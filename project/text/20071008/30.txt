eyes on the road a comeback for coupes signs of new life for segment that has been disappointing for many auto makers online edition i was stopped at a light on woodward avenue in suburban detroit enjoying a beautiful fall evening recently in a borrowed silver nissan altima coupe glancing to my left i realized that the attractive something woman in the car next to me had rolled down her passenger window and was flashing me a smile as bright as the october sun "hey " she said freeze the frame i am a middle aged guy with a wife a mortgage two kids and a cat i proudly declare allegiance to reality still she had my attention because in years of navigating public streets an encounter like this had never happened to me "dude " yelped my inner year old "we gotta get a car like this " car companies appear to be betting that a lot of people will want to experience moments like mine when it feels great to be in a sleek sporty car over the next four years forecasters at j d power &amp associates expect new or redesigned coupe models to hit the u s market including from luxury brands among the coupes j d power sees coming are a two door version of the cadillac cts and maybe coupes from italian brands alfa romeo and abarth an offshoot of fiat that currently dont compete in the u s market auto makers have had good reason to be wary of the coupe market despite the affection many car executives have for sporty cars since the mid s demand for coupes has waned significantly coinciding with the heart of the baby booms practical family hauling years as boomers slogged through their minivan and child seat phase interest in low slung two door midsized midpriced cars cratered it didnt help that many of the offerings in the midpriced coupe segment were fairly bland such as the outgoing honda accord coupe in u s auto makers built million two doors out of a total of million cars according to wards automotive yearbook by wards data shows the number of two doors built in the u s fell to vehicles out of million through the end of september coupes accounted for of the total u s market down from the year before according to data from the power information network now however there are some signs of new life in the coupe segment at the low end sporty little cars such as the scion tc and honda civic coupe are attracting younger buyers at the high end luxury car makers are courting empty nesters and those wealthy enough to have a car for every purpose with sleek new models such as the audi a i tend to use the term "coupe" interchangeably with the term two door because thats how i still think of the segment but european luxury marques define a category of "four door coupes " these are cars that have the swept back roofline of a sporty two door car but have four doors an example of this breed is the mercedes benz cls which has enjoyed considerable success the porsche panamera will be another of this four door coupe style when it arrives in two years or so bmw recently confirmed plans to build a large four door coupe based on its striking shanghai concept car the cs in the &# to &# price range the success of the retro styled ford mustang has inspired a "back to the future" replay of the pony car wars of the s chevrolet has been touting the return of the camaro in since early chrysler llcs dodge brand is expected to field its mustang fighter the challenger sometime next year more striking because they seemed to come out of nowhere &lt ndash&gt are the two new designs from honda and nissan the accord coupe represents a significant departure from its bland predecessor honda designers created a distinctive profile for the coupe compared with the accord sedan and gave it a unique powertrain option a v with a six speed manual for more than a decade "sporty accord" was an oxymoron the new accord coupe restores some meaning to that phrase the altima coupe which i test drove last week is lighter and smaller in most dimensions than the accord coupe but it has more power in both its four and six cylinder versions consistent with its recent product strategy nissan emphasizes horsepower and sporty touches such as a push button start the altima coupes exterior profile with flaring rear fenders and narrow side glass hints at the aggressive lines of the nissan z or the infiniti g not that youd mistake the altima for one of those more expensive models but it works as a budget minded alternative the altima coupe asks you to overlook the fact that the trunk is surprisingly tiny the back seat is hard to access and rear leg room for anyone you squeeze back there is inches less than in the sedan but with coupes its really all about the driver given the demographics of an aging population looking for self indulgence car makers may be smart to put some effort into this segment oh right lets roll that video "hey " the young woman said beaming "are you from santa monica " huh why no i replied unsure how to process this then i remembered my test car had a california license plate i live here i explained this is just a car im test driving i just moved to michigan she offered youll get used to it i said the light changed i waved and drove away it wasnt me it wasnt even the car it was just the license plate i ordered my inner year old back to his regular job compelling me to listen to year old rock music during my commutes the altima went back to nissan its really for the best send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
