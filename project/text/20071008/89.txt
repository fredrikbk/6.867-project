uaw ratchets up heat on chrysler in talks the united auto workers union stepped up the pace of negotiations with chrysler llc over the weekend signaling that union leaders plan to test the auto makers new private equity owners before moving on to ford motor co the uaw which began formal talks with chrysler over the weekend effectively put the company on notice saturday that it could call a strike as early as tomorrow the move could be a sign of progress in the talks suggesting that the uaw feels a deal is close enough that it can set a deadline to push final issues to a resolution in talks with general motors corp last month the union set a deadline and then staged a two day walkout before wrapping up a contract a spokeswoman for chrysler detroits no auto maker by output behind gm and ford declined to discuss the situation a uaw spokesman didnt return calls a short strike at chrysler may have little significance because chrysler already has five plants closed this week amid soft market demand ford and chrysler are operating under indefinite extensions on contracts that ended sept the uaw has to give the auto makers hours notice before canceling a contract saturday the union gave that notice to chrysler it is unclear how eager chrysler and its new majority owner cerberus capital management llp are to sign on to the labor pattern agreed to by the uaw and gm last month chrysler officials are expected to come to the talks with a unique list of demands including health care cost concessions that would put the auto maker on equal footing with gm and ford when it comes to retiree medical expense liabilities chrysler also has indicated plans to shed certain uaw represented units a move that would cut against the unions effort to maintain the current level of jobs at detroits big three in return for wage and benefit concessions meanwhile uaw leaders continued to work to ratify the gm agreement at plants across the u s uaw president ron gettelfinger spent part of his week working with chryslers negotiators people familiar with the situation said mr gettelfingers decision to focus next on chrysler could shift if talks there falter but several analysts have predicted that saving ford for last would be the uaws strategy ford could need the biggest breaks from the union given its weak financial health and falling sales ford had a &# billion loss in and is working to gain momentum in a multiyear restructuring by positioning ford as the last auto maker to negotiate mr gettelfinger a former ford worker could extend to it additional breaks beyond those given to chrysler and gm ford representatives declined to comment chrysler says its total compensation for active workers is equivalent to &# an hour compared with &# at gm and &# at ford chryslers higher health care costs account for a chunk of the disparity chrysler has had trouble managing high labor costs because of tough economic conditions in the u s that forced the company to cut production and heavily discount its vehicles including profitable trucks and suvs while ford and gm have extensive international operations chrysler is primarily a north american auto maker detroits labor cost benchmark is toyota motor corp which pays &# to &# less an hour in labor costs and shoulders practically no retiree health care liabilities under its contract gm made strides in closing its cost gap with toyota but made extensive and detailed future product guarantees in order to get the uaw to agree to terms gm also agreed to turn over billions of dollars in cash securities and other liquidity in order to fund an independent trust a voluntary employees beneficiary association or veba to manage health care liabilities for hourly retirees given its private status and its relatively younger work force chrysler management will try to push for a deal that veers from gms people familiar with its strategy said for one chrysler likely wont be as eager to make public promises about its future product program disclosing too much information could put it at a competitive disadvantage because the uaw will make those plans public making broad guarantees also could hamstring chryslers ability to push production to lower cost markets such as china chrysler also may have difficulty matching gms commitments in relation to the veba gms ability to fund the trust will be aided by its deep pool of available cash and its vastly over funded pension assets raising pensions for retirees could help soften the blow for retiree health care cuts and it gives the impression that the uaw won better terms for its retirees by contrast chrysler and ford have relatively thin margins to increase pensions for a combined uaw retirees and surviving spouses whom they are on the hook to support
