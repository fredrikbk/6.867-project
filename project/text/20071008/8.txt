americas no room for entrepreneurs economist joseph schumpeter may be best known for his innovative work showing the link between entrepreneurial discovery and economic progress but as carl schramm president of the kauffman foundation of entrepreneurship has pointed out schumpeters insights about risk takers didnt make him an optimist in a speech last year to european finance ministers in vienna mr schramm explained schumpeters fears he "worried that entrepreneurial capitalism would not flourish because the bureaucracies of modern government and big corporations would dampen innovation the process of creative destruction would be too ungovernable for a modern keynesian regulated economy to tolerate " as a result mr schramm said schumpeter thought that "the importance of entrepreneurs would fade over time as capitalism sought predictability from governments who would plan economic activity as well as order social benefits " mr schramms comments caught my attention because they so accurately describe latin america there the entrepreneur has been all but run out of town by the bureaucracies that schumpeter feared growth has suffered accordingly the world banks annual "doing business" survey released last week demonstrates the point the survey which evaluates the regulatory climate for entrepreneurs in countries finds that latin america and the caribbean was the slowest reforming region this year and that it "is falling further behind other regions in the pace" of reform the average time it takes to start a business one of factors measured in latin america and the caribbean is days longer than anywhere else compare that with the organization for economic cooperation and development where business start ups take less than days other common problems in the region are weak minority shareholder rights slow legal regimes and punishing tax systems yet as bad as the regional averages are entrepreneurs in venezuela probably view them with envy when it comes to the ease of doing business venezuela now ranks six places from the bottom world wide between eritrea and chad it also finishes dead last among the regions countries and that includes haiti in the category of "employing workers" venezuela ties with bolivia at no the authors note that it is "not possible" to fire a venezuelan employee "starting a business" takes days and in ease of "paying taxes" it ranks no keeping venezuela company in the cellar are ecuador which finishes th in the region and bolivia which comes in th only suriname haiti and mr chavezs oil paradise have more hostile business climates to understand how argentina went from being one of the worlds top performing economies during schumpeters lifetime to the basket case it is today this report is instructive the resurgence of peronist economics helped it slide places lower than its ranking not only has it failed to carry out any meaningful reforms but in the past year it complicated the insolvency process and its tax system remains punitive a company that pays all its taxes coughs up the equivalent of of its profit argentina finishes nd in the region but ahead of costa rica which comes in th guatemala el salvador and nicaragua are all better places to be an entrepreneur than costa rica brazil earned about the same ranking as last year it made improvements to its legal regime but lost ground to more aggressive reformers in the category of "trading across borders " it also takes last place world wide for the time it takes to comply with the tax code hours and ranks th in the "paying taxes" category sluggish reform in the region has led some analysts to conclude that democracies in the developing world cannot overcome the obstacles to modernization presented by the political economy yet there are regional successes that prove that where there is political will there is a way take mexico in last years report it jumped almost places world wide thanks to a reform minded treasury ministry under former president vicente fox which lowered tax rates and made property registration easier it now has the fifth most pro business climate in the region if the government of felipe calderon keeps its reform promises more improvements should be on the way though its price controls on bread and tortillas are not a good sign this years superstar is colombia it is among the top reformers world wide and ranks th in the region it made enormous progress in "trading across borders" by reducing the time goods spend in terminals extending port operating hours and making more selective customs inspections it also strengthened investor protections adopted an electronic tax filing system and progressively lowered the corporate tax rate to in from in much more work is needed but the moral of the story is that with leadership such as that which president alvaro uribe has provided reform is possible but the opposite is also true chile has fallen nine places since its no ranking in the report suggesting that the center left coalition running the country is not attuned to the importance of entrepreneurial freedom the most important lesson for latin america from the world banks report is that its competitors around the world are working to unleash entrepreneurial spirits and doing nothing is not an option as mr schramm told his vienna audience "schumpeter saw what a century of evidence would prove socialism has not sustained economic growth " now if only more latin american policy makers would catch on
