doha or die how appropriate that the fate of global trade talks may be decided in africa today when the leaders of brazil india and south africa huddle in pretoria developing countries stand to gain the most from the embattled doha round which makes it all the more strange that these three regional economic powers are threatening to kill it what a switch from previous years when the u s and europe almost let doha founder rather than reduce their agriculture subsidies now that dynamic has changed the u s offered last month to cap annual farm subsidies to between &# billion and &# billion current u s subsidies are even lower at around &# billion given that the u s walked away from the table earlier this year when a &# billion offer was floated thats a big concession this u s flexibility has created a spurt of goodwill especially among european union countries many of which now look ready to do a deal but the so called advanced developing countries led by brazil and india have turned up their noses bowing to their domestic constituencies neither has even accepted the agricultural or industrial texts on offer with the world trade organization as a basis for discussion now time is running short and were about to find out if these emerging economies will do their part to continue the current global expansion if india and brazil walk away there wont be another u s offer under the bush administration and protectionist winds are blowing strongly over capitol hill if doha dies global trade talks could take years to revive that would be a special blow to the worlds poor who are enjoying one of the greatest economic updrafts in history china alone has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty since joining the wto in and liberalizing part of its economy india and brazil stand to benefit as well by opening to trade and making their industries more competitive the two countries howl that american and european barriers still block many of their goods and they have a point look no further than u s antidumping cases or the protected american sugar and orange juice markets the cent a gallon u s tariff on brazilian ethanol is a made in congress embarrassment but these are relatively small problems in the context of the huge and mostly open u s market which would become more open under doha brazil by contrast wants to keep its own tariffs high while forcing others to lower theirs under the current negotiating texts brazil is only being asked to cut its average industrial tariffs to from not all of its tariffs would dip into the single digits however only a little more than half of its industrial tariffs would be reduced from current applied levels and brasilia has already carved out special protection for certain key industries tariffs on automobiles for instance would fall to from as for india new delhi claims it cant liberalize agriculture because millions of subsistence farmers would be put out of work its a genuine concern with more than half of the countrys workforce in agriculture but indian agriculture also makes up only one fifth of the countrys gdp and its contribution declines annually by keeping trade barriers high delhi is condemning its farm industry to backwardness while preventing its expanding middle class from buying cheaper and higher quality food at least in principle both brazil and new delhi recognize the benefits of cutting tariffs president lula da silva has kept brazil growing by shedding some of the countrys more backward economic policies in india the congress led coalition government has unilaterally cut industrial tariffs yet indian industry remains highly protected especially for a country with aspirations to become a global power under the current doha text indias average industrial tariffs would fall to just from contrast this with the u s where average industrial tariffs are and would fall to under the doha draft the u s offer is a last ditch effort to break the doha impasse the more concessions india and brazil make in return the more the u s delegation can do and the more pressure will be exerted on europe to match the u s offer theres room to negotiate too over mechanisms that would safeguard indian farmers while tariff cuts phase in this decade has seen the greatest world economic boom in years fueled in large part by an enormous expansion in trade but such prosperity is not guaranteed to continue and it wont if the world retreats from further trade liberalization the latest u s concessions mean that brazil and india can no longer use farm subsidies as an excuse for their own failure to move if doha dies they will bear a large part of the blame
