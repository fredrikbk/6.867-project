ethics it should not be surprising that our universities generate interesting and urgent ethical challenges after all higher education is a big business scholarship is a demanding discipline teaching is a noble undertaking fraught with weighty responsibilities and liberal education plays a crucial role in the formation of free citizens what may surprise is that at the programs and centers devoted to the study of ethics and the professions that have been established over the last two decades at our leading universities one profession whose ethical issues the professors generally ignore is their own the return to campus this fall brings sharp reminders of the confusion about their purpose that plagues our campuses and so underscores the need for serious study of university ethics in the recently published and already critically acclaimed book "until proven innocent " k c johnson and stuart taylor jr show how the duke university faculty and administration collaborated with a reckless press and a lawless prosecutor in the rush to convict in the court of public opinion and but for the superb work of their attorneys in the criminal courts of durham n c three white lacrosse players falsely accused of raping an african american stripper on sept at the kennedy center for the performing arts "indoctrinate u " evan coyne maloneys riveting documentary about the war on free speech and individual rights waged by university faculty and administrations enjoyed its washington premiere also in september for crystal clear political reasons following a faculty petition circulated mostly by women from the university of california davis the uc board of regents withdrew a speaking invitation to former secretary of the treasury and former harvard president lawrence summers but dont expect the leading ethics centers harvards edmond j safra foundation center for ethics princetons program on ethics and public affairs or yales program in ethics politics and economics to sponsor lectures fund graduate student and faculty fellowships or publish writings that examine these and numerous other ethical questions that stem from contemporary university life while lavishing attention on legal political and medical ethics and to a lesser extent business ethics and journalism ethics worthy areas of inquiry all our leading university ethicists have shown scant interest in exploring university ethics celebrating its th anniversary last spring the harvard university program on ethics and the professions is among the nations oldest and most distinguished yet of the more than public lectures by eminent visitors sponsored over the last two decades by the harvard ethics program only three deal with the university one defending affirmative action one defending the propriety of academics engaging in public debate and one defending academic freedom the programs web site lists more than publications by over ethics fellows and senior scholars hundreds of the writings deal with law and politics and ethics hundreds explore medicine and ethics dozens discuss business ethics but only about of the publications and five of the authors address university ethics take away a few defenses of affirmative action and multiculturalism and a few reflections on teaching ethics at the university and little is left all in all after years of generously funding research in practical or applied ethics harvards program has made no discernible contribution to illuminating the challenges of university governance and the variety of duties and conflicts confronted in their professional roles by professors and administrators much the same holds true of the yale program in ethics politics and economics and the princeton university center for human values what explains the neglect by our leading university ethics programs of a vital topic that so plainly falls under their purview the major cause is probably routine thoughtlessness surrounded by like minded souls and therefore protected from questions that might rock the boat and from research projects that might call for scholarly retooling it may never occur to many ethics professors that no less than law medicine business and journalism their profession too is worthy of systematic scrutiny one cannot rule out that a few ethics faculty may have convinced themselves that professors and administrators because of their peculiar virtue already confront and wisely dispose of all the moral dilemmas and professional conflicts of interest that come before them it would not be the first time that intellectuals so aggressive in finding false consciousness and self interest in others concealed or overlooked their own nevertheless if they are impelled or compelled to overcome disciplinary inertia and intellectual orthodoxy and turn their attention to their own profession professional ethicists will discover a trove of fascinating and timely questions here are a few is it proper for university disciplinary boards often composed of faculty and administrators with no special knowledge of the law to investigate student accusations of sexual assault by fellow students which involve crimes for which perpetrators can go to jail for decades should universities have one set of rules and punishments for students who plagiarize or pay others to write their term papers and another and lesser set for professors who plagiarize or pay others to write their articles and books or should students and faculty be held to the same tough standards of intellectual integrity how can universities respect both professors academic freedom and students right to be instructed in the diversity of opinions what is the proper balance in hiring promotion and tenure decisions between the need for transparency and accountability and the need for confidentiality what institutional arrangements give university trustees adequate independence from the administrators they review is it consistent with their mission for university presses to publish books whose facts and footnotes they do not check in accordance with what principles may a university bar rotc from campus because of the militarys "dont ask dont tell policy" concerning homosexuals while inviting to campus a foreign leader whose country not only punishes private consensual homosexual sex but is the worlds leading state sponsor of terrorism and who himself denies the holocaust and threatens to obliterate the sovereign state of israel by exploring these and myriad other issues our ethics programs would do more than fulfill their mandate they would also vindicate liberal education by demonstrating the premium academicians place on ensuring that their own practice conforms to the proper principles mr berkowitz is a senior fellow at stanford
