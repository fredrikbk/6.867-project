in plain english one mans bid to save morse code prescott ariz nostalgic for simpler days retired astrophysicist chuck adams is translating classics of boys lit into a language he fears is going the way of kit radios and marbles morse code holed up in his high desert home crammed with computers radio receivers and a very patient wife mr adams uses homemade software to download online books with expired copyrights convert the typed words into morse code tones and record them on compact discs he sells on the internet so far mr adams says he has sold or donated thousands of morse versions of such novels as edgar rice burroughss "at the earths core " daniel defoes "robinson crusoe " and h g wellss "the time machine " in about an hour his software can take any book in the public domain and turn it into a string of digital dits and dahs last weekend he turned out a version of f scott fitzgeralds a k a "the beautiful and damned" for the year old mr adams its a labor of love mixed with equal parts hope and despair "morse code is going to die off unless you can talk someone into coming into the hobby " he says "i do it because its fun and to keep it going " he says then he adds in the next breath "but i have no delusions of grandeur that i can save morse code from extinction im not don quixote im not going to go out and fight windmills " mr adams grew up in wink a blink of a town in west texas six foot six himself he shared a small bedroom with his three younger brothers each of whom measures nearly feet tall he hand built his first bike with parts from a junkyard and flew model rockets high above wink while the soviets flew sputnik even higher and at the age of inspired by his father a ham radio operator he taught himself morse code from a book at the time ham operators had to transcribe morse code at a rate of five words per minute in order to earn the most basic federal license soon young mr adams was spending every night sending coded messages to anyone who could hear them and eavesdropping on upi news dispatches broadcast to ships many other radio amateurs use voice transmissions but mr adams preferred code because of the challenge and because he thinks his voice is too high and his west texas accent too twangy mr adams completed a ph d won tenure at the university of north texas worked high powered jobs in the defense and computer industries and dabbled in the professional poker circuit but he never lost his love for morse code the code is the creation of a painter samuel f b morse who needed a way to transmit messages over the telegraph that he and alfred vail had invented in the men famously sent a transmission from washington to baltimore that read "what hath god wrought " the telegraph soon replaced the pony express as late as world war ii ham operators found themselves using their morse skills as radiomen in the military during the vietnam war pow jeremiah denton later a u s senator from alabama blinked "t o r t u r e" in morse code when his captors put him on television but over time the telephone and satellites have rendered morse code almost obsolete "if the satellites go out and power goes out morse code can still get through " says nancy kott president of a code club called fists someone who sends good code has "a good fist " "all we need is a battery and two wires to tap together and we can communicate " in february the federal communications commission eliminated the morse requirements for ham radio licenses mr adams resigned from a ham operators organization because of what he saw as its flaccid defense of morse code "it is a sad state of affairs when the u s doesnt even attempt to keep the language alive or give an incentive to work on it " says mr adams many of those who still know morse code test their skills with a german computer game called rufz the standard for determining world transcription speed rankings players listen to coded five character call signs combinations of letters symbols and numbers that identify individual license holders the faster and more correctly they type them the more points they score transcribing regular text is much slower last month in belgrade goran hajosevic broke words per minute an extraordinary pace mr adams is tied for eighth in the world at more than words per minute scanning the list recently of the fastest morse coders under the age of mr adams spotted just two with american issued call signs "what this shows me is in the united states we have no one whos interested in learning morse code anymore " he lamented mr adams and other morse aficionados dont speak of dots and dashes that imagery is too visual and morse is an aural language so they prefer to describe the language in dits and dahs the sounds of the short and long tones a for instance is dit dah b is dah dit dit dit or simply dah dididit between two letters the sender allows a three dit silence between words it grows to seven dits like all morse experts mr adams rarely breaks signals down into letters instead hearing complete words much as readers recognize words on a page when he transcribes a message at high speeds his fingers are five or words behind his ears when he is "in the zone" he isnt even conscious of what he is transcribing he says he has to read it later to understand the message when he listens to one of his books the code is like a voice speaking to him "its like you dont count the is when someone says mississippi " he explains he produces his audio books to play at different speeds depending on the expertise of the buyer ken moormans bedtime listening is mr adamss word per minute version of "the war of the worlds " which he purchased for &# "its so much easier to pick up a microphone and yell " says mr moorman a year old retired electrical engineer in williamsburg va and a coder since "the people who do morse code today do it because its a lost art " earlier this year mr adams sent barry kutner a year old ophthalmologist from newtown pa and another world class coder a words per minute version of the book to mr adamss chagrin mr kutner wrote an email back pointing out that the gap between words was eight dits long instead of the prescribed seven at that pace a dit lasts one thousandths of a second much as he did growing up in texas mr adams enjoys sitting in front of a gray radio not much bigger than a hardcover book and sending code with a &# italian stainless steel paddle style key that he operates with a pinching motion with the slightest touch of his right thumb on one paddle the key sends an audible dit a touch of his right pointer finger on the other paddle sends a dah his wife phyllis doesnt begrudge him his long hours in front of the radio "im just glad he has something to keep him busy " she says "all my friends with retired husbands complain they follow them around the house all day " one recent sunday morning mr adamss radio came alive with morse tones it was a guy named gary mcclain in pryor okla the transmissions were pretty slow just words per minute mr mcclain a year old retired mill worker learned morse code in the boy scouts half a century ago he had nothing urgent in mind he just wanted to make contact with someone far away "weather here is cloudy and chance of showers " he tapped as mr adams transcribed the words in a notebook mr mcclain signed off and the radio went silent "it will eventually die " mr adams mused "ill hate to see it go i wont have anybody to talk to ill have to go back to reading " see related letter "letters to the editor dah dit its music to me" wsj oct
