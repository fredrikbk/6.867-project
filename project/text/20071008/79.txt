some warning flags fly as stocks continue to soar indicators like gold transportation suggest skepticism weakness the major stock market indexes set records last week making up for their late summer swoon but other financial indicators are behaving quite differently than they did in july when the market last peaked which is fueling some analysts concerns that the stock market is primed for a drop the dow jones transportation average which hit its july record and its august low on the same days as the dow jones industrial average hasnt followed the industrials back to an all time peak this month the transportation average which traders look to for hints about the staying power of trends in the dow industrials would have to rise to return to the record other trends that werent present during the last round of stock records the dollar has plummeted to historic lows and gold a traditional haven during times of investor nervousness has leapt also crude oil has broken through &# a barrel raising concerns about a possible drag on consumer activity if average americans start spending more at the pump and less on everything else that is one reason consumer discretionary components of the broad standard &amp poors stock index have lagged behind the index itself falling for the year that part of the index would have to rise nearly to reach its summer record all told the trading action shows investors are worried about u s economic growth a lack of investor enthusiasm for transportation stocks for example could reflect concerns that companies in other sectors arent seeing much demand for their goods so there is no need to move them to be sure the markets records mean that large swaths of buyers remain willing to snatch up stocks as in any rally it is likely that some of those investors are confident that the economy will strengthen and some are just chasing the markets recent performance despite their uncertainty about the long term if the rally has come to rely too heavily on the latter group that will spell trouble analysts say roger volz a strategist at swiss american securities the brokerage arm of credit suisse says he and others are buying stocks to ride out the rally "were trying to get as safely long as possible " using bets with built in safeguards against sudden market downturns mr volz said "but this isnt looking like a sustained uptrend its looking more like a classic rotation by hedge funds into large cap stocks to enjoy the last leg of a rally " the dow industrials reached a new high a week ago and finished last week fewer than points from the peak up at that pushed it up for the year the s&amp p jumped for the week to a record up for the year and the technology heavy nasdaq composite index gained to end at up for the year on friday a strong employment report boosted confidence in prospects for a pickup in u s economic growth sparking the latest wave of stock buying but on most days lately investors have seemed more confident about growth in quickly expanding economies such as china and brazil hoping that will translate into profits for multinational u s companies the msci emerging markets index is up from its august low more than doubling the gain of the domestic market barry james president of james investment research says such trends have recently prompted him to tell clients to move money out of u s stocks and into long dated high grade bonds "its always tricky to call a market peak but right now all the signals tell us the risks are very high " says mr james who estimates there could be a significant downturn in the u s market within the next six months others worry more about domestic problems strategist howard simons of bianco research says he worries that steps such as the federal reserves recent interest rate cut meant to spur u s growth will translate into inflation "i shake my head because history is pretty convincing about trying to inflate your way out of problems " says mr simons "it always ends badly " already the feds decision which effectively increases the supply of dollars sloshing through the economy has hurt the dollars value against major foreign currencies and sent it to historic lows against the euro and the canadian dollar douglas peta of investment management firm j&amp w seligman &amp co is more upbeat but guardedly so like many bulls he believes the worst of the recent shakeout in the mortgage market is over he believes u s stocks are still reasonably cheap relative to their expected earnings and that as long as the u s avoids a recession there should be room for the market to rise but mr peta and other analysts are a bit cautious about the fourth quarter historically one of the strongest for the market with the dow industrials and the s&amp p averaging gains of around this year the third quarter was stronger than usual which has some analysts wondering whether the market might have effectively "borrowed" gains that would usually come later in the year in several instances including when the dow industrials suffered an october crash a strong performance in the third quarter was followed by rough going late in the year the dow rose in s third period
