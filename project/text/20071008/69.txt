politics &amp economics thompson turns to taxes presidential candidate hopes tough talk lures conservatives washington fred thompson entered the presidential race hoping to be the candidate of choice for conservatives but he has stumbled in early attempts to woo social conservatives partly because he doesnt support a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage now as he seeks to win the republican nomination for president he is looking to lure the partys economic conservatives with an aggressive plan to curb government spending and overhaul the tax code while all the partys leading candidates have embraced fiscal restraint the former tennessee senator seems likely to go further than his rivals he has hinted at politically risky proposals to rein in social security and medicare benefits and he appears to be heading toward proposing tax code changes to help lower corporate tax rates as well but mr thompson may have trouble balancing his pitch to small government purists with his quest for popular support in the competitive early voting states even as he decried what he described as washingtons dependence on pork barrel spending last week he reversed position after touring an iowa ethanol plant saying he now supports subsidies for alternative fuel "i have voted against subsidies in the senate " mr thompson told reporters after the tour according to the associated press "but i think its a matter now of national security and weve got to avail ourselves of a lot of different resources and i think renewable has to be a part of that picture " so far mr thompson has painted his vision with a broad brush hell get a chance to offer more specifics tomorrow afternoon when the wall street journal cnbc and msnbc co host a debate of the republican presidential candidates on economic issues in dearborn mich it will be mr thompsons first debate and first major live event before a national audience since joining the race last month he has been panned for long rambling speeches on the trail and is hoping for more success on stage this week his ability to respond to questions succinctly and spar with rivals who have been mixing it up for months will be tested the debate will also provide an opportunity for mr thompson to begin fleshing out his economic proposals so far he has provided few specifics but he appears close to proposing replacement of the current tax system with an alternative aimed at reducing trade imbalances and entitlement spending mr thompson has been among the most vocal of the republican candidates in advocating smaller less intrusive government but while his willingness to propose lower spending on popular social programs such as medicare and social security may endear him to fiscal conservatives it isnt clear how that will play among older residents in the early voting states where the republican race is still fluid tax overhaul particularly for corporate america is a top priority mr thompson says "we have the second highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world you talk about corporate taxes youre not talking about just some fat guy sitting in the back room " mr thompson told a meeting in washington of the americans for prosperity foundation a conservative group "we are only one of two nations that hasnt reduced its corporate tax rate since it should be reduced to at least in this country " mr thompsons aides outline a change to the tax code that would move away from taxing income or profits and shift toward a system that would reduce taxes on exports when they cross the border and impose them on imports when they enter the country under international rules the european value added tax a kind of sales tax is waived for exports but those rules block the u s from reducing corporate profit taxes for exporters "the best thing to do would be to have the world trade organization change its rules to level the playing field and that should be the first step if that fails then we should play by the same game that everyone else plays " said lawrence lindsey mr thompsons economic adviser and former director of the national economic council for president bush "generally mr thompson had an excellent pro growth record as a senator " said david keating executive director of the club for growth an antitax group that has offered generally positive reviews of the fiscal records of former new york mayor rudy giuliani and former massachusetts gov mitt romney "whether you replace it with a flat tax or a fair tax there are many ways to do it but the current tax system is a mess " yet among three of the top republican candidates messrs thompson giuliani and romney there appears to be more agreement than differences in their general economic approaches all three would extend president bushs and tax cuts and they urge an end to the federal estate tax all three have embraced president ronald reagans belief in supply side economics and a market approach to controlling health care costs mr thompson has advocated reining in discretionary spending and has been particularly critical of the medicare drug benefits program that congress passed four years ago he said he wouldnt have voted for it "i know this probably isnt a real popular thing to say but we couldnt afford this prescription drug bill " mr thompson said last week on a swing through iowa home of republican sen charles grassley who helped push the program through congress "we basically put a &# trillion commitment on top of an already broken entitlement system not a responsible thing to do " mr thompson has suggested a scaled back drug benefit as part of a broader medicare overhaul he hasnt ruled out allowing the program to sunset aides say on social security mr thompson has begun outlining a plan that would slow the growth rate of benefits and tie future cost of living adjustments to the cost of goods which rise at a slower rate than wages "social security actuaries have put out a study that shows that we could guarantee the benefit schedule fully protected for inflation going forward " says mr lindsey the adviser to mr thompson "i dont think thats a harsh conclusion to say we can afford the current benefits but we cant afford more " john harwood contributed to this article
