boss talk can ailes outfox cnbc invoking stonewall jackson fox business chief prepares to battle entrenched rival during a long and colorful career roger ailes has dug ditches advised richard nixon on his presidential campaign produced off broadway shows and started cable networks notably fox news channel his next effort is the fox business network scheduled to make its debut next week mr ailes who is chairman and ceo of both channels and chairman of the fox television stations group and his team have been scrambling to build the hour network ever since his boss news corp chairman rupert murdoch announced it in february mr ailes years old runs his tv empire with combativeness and guile and is secretive about his plans for the business channel specific shows havent been announced and he hasnt talked about its approach it took fox news four years to surpass cnns ratings and fox business is starting at a similar disadvantage now mr ailes is taking on general electric co s cnbc a network that for now will reach three times as many homes as the start up business network but its a rival he knows well because he served as the president of the channel he now must knock down there are other complications news corp foxs parent has agreed to buy dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal and has said it wants to make use of the newspapers journalists on the business network however it will be hampered by an existing content sharing arrangement between the journal and cnbc that contractually runs through at his office in midtown manhattan right next to mr murdochs mr ailes talked last week about his networks his competitors and his philosophy excerpts wsj the fox business network launches on oct after two years of speculation and to use your word "disinformation " i want to know what will viewers see mr ailes so do i were working on it we think economic news is probably broader than what cnbc has been presenting we intend to cover the markets and cover wall street as effectively as they do maybe more and add additional value beyond that theres no sense in me talking about it because this is a launch and its a competitive launch i will call a lot of audibles at the line once the play starts i will not stand around the sidelines with a gamebook and a set of plays that ill stick to ill change many things in the first year im sure wsj what specific things has cnbc done in anticipation of fox business mr ailes the first thing they did was to say "well ailes seems to be patriotic so well name it americas business network and take that away from ailes " theyve embraced capitalism suddenly they have a tremendous advantage theyre in million homes they have a year head start i put them on track years ago and weve announced when were going to come with our programming in our million little pathetic homes if they cant kill us in the crib now its only going to get worse for them day to day wsj how will you surmount that mr ailes well if you study history the victories did not always go to the people with the great resources confederate gen stonewall jackson seemed to be undermanned in every campaign and won union gen george mcclellan had plenty of resources in every fight and lost that isnt always what matters theyre winning because theyre a monopoly theyre winning the same way cnn was winning when we came on the scene with fox news once you have competition its a different kind of fight wsj will rupert murdoch try to find a way around the content sharing agreement between the wall street journal and cnbc mr ailes i tell you one thing i never do is predict mr murdoch the only thing i know about mr murdoch is one day a couple years ago he said you know we ought to have a business channel and in two weeks were going to have a business channel wsj in august mr murdoch said he expects the fox business network to surpass cnbcs estimated &# billion value "in short order " how long do you think it will take to do that and how will you do it mr ailes i never predict offensive goals i think that was israels problem in lebanon look there are too many variables is there going to be a recession will that affect the ratings on either channel will cnbc suddenly get better will something work out with the wall street journal will we be better than expected is it going to rain i believe we will beat them and i believe the asset value of fox business network will grow relatively rapidly but people have to remember that fox news right now is seen as a success and it took us four years to tie cnn i would not be surprised if the fox news model were replicated here wsj your greatest successes have been in politics and political news do you have the same passion for business news mr ailes i believe business news is general news i believe most people think the economy is very important every political poll you take absent a war the economy is no because people are worried about "can i send my kid to school can i get another game boy can i buy a new house is this the year i buy a new car should my wife or husband go to work so i can stay home " wsj one of the reasons cnbc is so lucrative for general electric is that although the network has a small audience it is an extremely affluent one and cnbc is able to charge advertisers very high rates if fox business network targets a more mainstream audience how will it make money mr ailes fox news has a very high income audience and i think that any business channel automatically draws that were not gonna reach for a lower financial demographic wsj it seems like the sensibility youre striving for with the network is embodied by cnbcs jim cramer would you like to have him on your air mr ailes he used to work for me i like jim jims like driving down the highway and watching the wreck across the guardrail you never know what hes going to do which makes him interesting its entertaining at times at times its annoying you know that show would be better if someone just ran in from off camera sometimes and whacked him on the butt and said "lets get back to business here " wsj is there anyone from cnbc youd like to hire mr ailes look im the one who put maria bartiromo on the air shes a fine talent this new woman that theyre overusing because shes on now hours a day erin burnett is a good talent but shes gonna age shell only last another year the way theyre working her so i hope at some point she steps up and says "i need water i need a little break here " wsj will there be bill oreilly like stars on fox business network mr ailes whos like bill oreilly if there was somebody like bill oreilly theyd be out there getting ratings no matter how much the mainstream press dumps on him the guy constantly delivers an interesting show hes unique will i find unique talent will unique talent break through yes its all in the developmental stage for me now wsj the fox new channel reported a rise in operating income in the fourth quarter from higher affiliate fees and advertising growth how did you accomplish that at a time when viewership is off and ratings are waning for cable news mr ailes well the ratings arent off much youd be surprised i get hundreds of emails a day from american people saying "god youre the only thing we watch " so we feel a real responsibility to get the story straight and balance the story in some ways when i see something in the news particularly horrible about america that i think is a little out of proportion to what is actually going on i call up the desk and say "do you have any pictures of people lined up at the border trying to get out " they say "what do you mean " i say "i just watched that and hell weve got to get out of here americas a terrible place we need to get out fast there must be guys stacked up at the airport trying to get out of here " no it turns out everybodys trying to get in and nobodys trying to get out weve got to keep that perspective in mind when you cover the news it doesnt mean you dont cover the bad news about america you do it means you dont get up in the morning hating your country wsj how does that philosophy translate to business news mr ailes well capitalism works and so you have to keep it in perspective when you find nine companies where the ceo should be in jail you should report it and make sure the guy goes to jail but you have to recognize that there are a lower percentage of businessmen who are doing bad things than other professions wsj does a shift in the political climate have any impact on fox news ratings mr ailes the fox news channel launched during clinton went through bush survived the war and will survive whatever happens in the future i think were going to cover a democrat presidency the same way we cover a republican presidency if they do great things theyll get great press if they do bad things theyll get covered its not going to matter really fifty one percent of audience in the demo of to year olds is either independent or liberal we dont want to lose either group so we work on presenting both sides wsj what do you think of alan greenspans recent criticisms of president bush mr ailes you cant sell a book in america if you dont dump on bush thats the cheapest shot in the world you cannot get an advance and you cant sell a book because the publishers are all people who hate bush and hate republicans wsj id like to switch gears and ask you about the fox station group which you inherited along with this office a little over a year ago when mr murdochs son lachlan left news corp not long after that you were surprised by the merger of upn and the wb networks to form the cw mr ailes yeah they gave me about five minutes notice wsj mynetworktv which you created to replace the programming you lost because of the merger had an unimpressive first year it took in less than &# million in ad revenue although things are looking better this fall whats your strategy for mynetworktv and the station group mr ailes the strategy is to get it out of the dumper we tried something inexpensive prime time soap operas which was a spectacular failure failure is never permanent unless you accept it that type of programming didnt work so we got rid of it and we started other things wsj are you a hands on manager mr ailes i have a working knowledge of all the areas i have probably vice presidents who report to me i have to know enough about each of their areas to know how to ask the proper questions i think what i bring to it is life experience people say "how can you you didnt go to columbia journalism school how can you run a news organization " i say "i have two qualifications one i didnt go to columbia journalism school so theres a chance ill be fair and two i never want to go to a party in this town so theres nobodys a i have to kiss " i think my management style is direct i want very fast decisions i think the worst decision is usually no decision wsj youve said theres a long slog ahead of you maybe up to four years is that something you look forward to or dread mr ailes there are no options the problem with most people who dont succeed is that they see options its the way i was brought up i dug ditches i put in sewer pipe i put in guardrail when i was my dad looked at me and said "where are you going you cant live here you going to go in the service you want me to put your name in up at the shop try to go to college " so i went to a cheap state school so i could work three jobs when you dont see options you dont give up easy the real problem with our society is weve taken the word responsibility and turned it into entitlement and we sit around thinking thats an option wsj hows your relationship with mr murdoch mr ailes he gave me this office right next door so it must be good if he throws me out i guess its not so good
