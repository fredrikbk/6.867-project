small business link the conversation continues excerpts from wsj com smallbusinesslinks forum debt collections readers and experts weigh in the sept small business link looked at the different approaches small companies are using to collect bills we invited collections manager carol frischer at accounting firm holthouse carlin &amp van trigt llp and consultant michelle dunn a former collections manager to participate in a forum on wsj com below are edited excerpts ms dunn the most effective way to collect a past due bill is to first make a phone call if you dont get a payment right away or you get an answering machine leave a phone message and then send a past due letter it should state the total amount due and the date that the payment must be in your office include a stamped self addressed envelope send the letter by priority mail with a delivery confirmation my clients and i have had an annual success rate using this technique ms frischer i call or email the customer and simply ask why the bill hasnt been paid start by confirming that they received the invoice if they are withholding payment because there was a problem with the work or invoice it is better to find out sooner rather than later the worst tactic is to call up customers and put them on the defensive or threaten to sue them instead get the details on why your invoice has not been paid and work with customers to resolve these issues in a positive manner wsj reader as a former credit manager i have heard these stories plenty the key to solving the collections problem is to not put deadbeat customers on your books to start check out a potential customers credit rating if they are going to be slow to pay you they are already doing that to someone else ms dunn i look at a credit policy as preventive maintenance businesses that have a credit policy and enforce it will make more money than a business that doesnt when you have a credit policy you are in control of your money wsj reader after many requests we have been told "youll get paid when we get paid " this routine seems to be a growing trend in our industry waiting for the prime contractor to be paid before paying us the subcontractors in essence we are financing their business eventually we are paid ms dunn every year business owners must "fire" some of their customers if a customer is past due or late on a bill and you have to spend time trying to get paid you dont really want them as a customer weed out these customers and you will end up with a solid paying customer base which will leave you more time to make more money wsj reader we have fired some clients and make others pay cash on delivery accepting credit card payments has helped us even though it costs us to it is more than worth the time we would otherwise spend on collections were in the video business unfortunately our products have become a commodity clients search for the best prices with no regard for quality for the big clients who pay in to days we factor that into our costs when we can some clients will go elsewhere if we demand prompt payment years ago clients would jump from one supplier to another running up large past due invoices at one supplier and then move on to another monthly credit manager meetings within our industry helped if a client became known as one who would jump from supplier to supplier and was past due he would be placed on a cash on delivery list with the latest supplier unfortunately this approach fell apart with increased competition ms frischer when i hear the excuse "when i get paid youll get paid " i remind the client that i didnt recall seeing this in our engagement letter or service agreement and ask them if they can point out this part of our agreement to me sometimes you do have to wait for someone to be paid before you will be paid but i want them to know that this is not part of our agreement and from a legal standpoint they owe the money regardless of whether or not they are paid these are the types of clients that i am in touch with constantly and send statements that include monthly interest to which you are entitled even if it isnt specified on your agreement
