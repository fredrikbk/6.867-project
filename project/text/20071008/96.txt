under fire plan to sell iraqis m s triggers new controversy u s provides the guns but training is lacking upgrade from the ak camp taji iraq in this war ravaged country a man is often measured by the make of his gun when iraqi soldier abbas ali eadan picked up his brand new u s made m rifle in august at this sprawling base north of baghdad his pride was palpable "i can put a cigarette in an ashtray and hit it with my m from far away like a sniper " boasted the year old "the terrorists may have rockets and grenades but only the iraqi army has m s " this spring after years of requests from senior iraq politicians and generals the u s began quietly converting the iraqi army over to the m the main rifle for u s soldiers for more than years according to the pentagon the iraqis have thus far purchased about of the rifles worth roughly &# million from colt defense llc current plans allow for the iraqis to eventually buy of the american made firearms the shift to m s is stoking a debate about how the new iraqi army should be equipped the m is a far more accurate weapon than the ak assault rifle the iraqis relied on through decades of fighting but its also tougher to maintain and could strain the iraqis supply and maintenance systems more to the point the iraqi army is riven with conflicting loyalties leading many in the u s military to worry that the very weapons the u s is supplying could be turned against them some day "there has been a lot of anxiety about having modern assault rifles fall into the hands of terrorists " says col michael clark who advises the iraqi ground command in baghdad "the m is just a much much better weapon it can do real damage " the argument over the m is part of a broader issue that has dogged u s efforts to rebuild the iraqi military since the beginning of the war should the u s seek to model iraqi forces after its own and in the process familiarize soldiers with advanced modern american equipment or should it simply teach the iraqi army to better use the weapons and vehicles it already possesses during saddam husseins rule iraq relied on soviet made helicopters tanks mig fighter jets and artillery most of that equipment fell into disrepair after the first gulf war in after u s forces toppled mr hussein in the armaments were further destroyed or looted having to rebuild the iraqi army from scratch the americans initially equipped the countrys forces with confiscated guns and tens of thousands of new ak s purchased from eastern europe cheap plentiful and easy to use the russian designed ak has been a staple for armies warlords and militias of developing countries around the globe it was the iraqi armys primary firearm under the countrys late deposed leader mr hussein in a recent report the world bank found that the aks are still the weapon of choice for poor armies and insurgents because of their "ease of operation robustness to mistreatment and negligible failure rate " the m meanwhile has become an important symbol of a modern iraq "the m elevates the morale of our soldiers before they fight the enemy because they know it gives them strength " says maj gen abdullah mohammed kahmees al dafaee who commands all iraqi ground forces "it is a new iraqi army so we should have new weapons " low ranking iraqi soldiers in the field would eye their u s advisers m s and complain that they would never be more than a second rate army so long as they carried aging ak s senior iraqi officials pressed top u s officials to let them buy m s as well as a trove of other more modern equipment throughout then iraqi prime minister ayad allawi urged top u s civilian and military officials in iraq to provide the countrys armed forces with american made tanks helicopters and planes that would cow insurgents and inspire iraqi soldiers mr allawi gained some support from pentagon officials who feared that the lightly armed iraqi troops were being outgunned by insurgents using its own funds primarily from oil revenues baghdad last year agreed to buy more than &# billion in american equipment by the end of by law iraq or any other foreign government wishing to purchase u s made weapons must first get approvals from congress the pentagon and the state department the u s cleared the way for iraq to buy armored humvees cargo trucks and communications gear directly from u s military contractors it refused iraqi requests for more advanced weapons like m tanks and apache attack helicopters citing fears that the weaponry could fall into the hands of insurgents or be used to menace iraqs neighbors more than anything else the iraqis wanted m s the iraqis received their first shipment of guns earlier this year another are due to arrive this fall so far the u s has distributed about of the firearms issuing them only after iraqis have completed a short training course on the weapons use and maintenance one sweltering afternoon this month a few dozen iraqi soldiers in t shirts and mismatched uniforms made their way to a bustling warehouse here to swap their ak s for shrink wrapped m s the guns were so new they still had "colt defense llc" stickers on their stocks after picking up the guns and ammunition magazines the iraqi soldiers ambled over to a plastic table and put their fingers on a small glass scanner connected to a panasonic laptop which took digital copies of their fingerprints iraqi attendants digitally scanned each soldiers iris took digital recordings of his voice and photographed each soldier with his new rifle "my name is wadih mohammed i was born in " one stocky iraqi lieutenant said into a microphone the biometric information was burnt onto compact disks and then given to iraqi authorities as a way of safekeeping the weapons if one goes missing the solider assigned the weapon will be held accountable the iraqis spent a total of just three days learning how to fire the weapons instead of the almost two weeks of training that u s soldiers undertake "in a perfect world they would get more than three days of training " says master sgt varon martinez a senior member of a military training team here "but nothing in iraq is perfect " the classes were taught by instructors from military professionals resources inc a subsidiary of defense contractor l communications corp the company received a &# million contract to train the iraqis at taji through the end of "gentlemen lets talk about the characteristics of the m from top to bottom " mpri instructor jeffrey goodman said to the iraqi soldiers gathered around him on a dusty firing range here early one morning mr goodman clad in olive green pants and suspenders told the troops that an ak round is narrow so that it typically goes straight through the enemy limiting damage to tissue an m round spins much faster and tumbles when it makes contact with the enemy so that "it causes mass casualty in the body " an army retiree with odd years in the military mr goodman demonstrated how to disassemble the weapon and clean it piece by piece removing any rust and dirt by the end of the second day the iraqis were able to take the weapon apart and reassemble it when they followed along mr goodmans step by step demonstration but many struggled with taking apart the m s firing mechanism which contains numerous small parts there were other snafus the iraqi supply depot failed to order enough ammunition for the m s for all the classes the first two groups of soldier students also faced significant shortages of cleaning kits essential to making the m s work the m is a far more complex weapon than the ak with its many springs and pins and requires regular upkeep and cleaning or it will cease firing a stockpile of spare parts must be kept on hand adding to the strain on the iraqi armys troubled supply system on the third day of training mr goodman told the iraqis to lie flat on their stomachs balance their m s on a short stack of sand bags and prepare to fire at paper targets stapled to wooden backstops a short distance away when he asked the iraqi troops where they should shoot they jubilantly yelled "bnose " arabic for "in the center " mr goodman directed them to open fire mr goodman shook his head as several iraqis gripped the m s as if they were ak s causing their bullets to miss their targets by a long shot "this is not a kalashnikov " he shouted using the nickname for an ak "youre using a precision weapon " some u s trainers say the switch to the m will help improve the professionalism of the iraqi force and its performance on the battlefield sgt martinez has noticed that iraqi soldiers behave differently in firefights when they have the more precise m "i saw them crouch on one knee and aim the weapon rather than just spraying " he said "it was like wait if i aim i can actually hit something i dont need to just spray " when the iraqi troops at camp taji finished test firing their m s at the rifle range they gingerly laid down their rifles and began comparing their bullet ridden paper targets slightly more than half of the iraqi soldiers met the basic marksmanship standards needed to pass the course the remainder were ordered to show up the following day for a second chance although there were no real consequences for those who failed at both attempts starved for recruits the iraqi military rarely expels soldiers for technical lapses or ethical infractions senior u s commanders like lt gen james dubik say they are confident that the iraqis will eventually learn to operate the m s effectively but training them to use the new weapon will take time that the u s may not have a recent government accountability office report found that the number of iraqi army brigades capable of operating independently of u s forces had declined to six in july from in march after the initial enthusiasm of getting the m rifles wore off some iraqi soldiers began to complain that they missed their old ak s ali jassim an iraqi soldier who received his m in august worried that the guns bullets lighter than those used in ak s wont be strong enough to quickly kill combatants "to tell you the truth i would prefer my old ak " mr jassim said "the m s may be better for americans but the aks are better for iraqis "
