delhi drama new delhi communism may be a spent force in most of the world but not here in india in a throwback to the s when anti americanism was en vogue and the non aligned movement was at its peak leftists have threatened to kill the landmark civil nuclear deal with washington if they succeed they could bring down prime minister manmohan singhs already shaky coalition government and confine delhi to the ranks of nuclear outcasts for years to come it would be a coup too for china and pakistan how this benefits india is anyones guess domestically the agreement finalized last month and named for a clause in the atomic energy act is meant to provide india with the means to produce clean energy a key constraint to economic growth internationally the accord represents a long overdue acceptance of india as a responsible nuclear power mr singh told skeptics on friday that india "cannot afford to miss the bus" on nuclear power he could have added that the agreement is a lopsided deal that heavily benefits india in the course of the negotiations mr singhs government insisted on the right to reprocess fuel from other nations in the u s built reactors and pushed for a guarantee on the steady supply of nuclear fuel theres history here general electric built indias tarapur reactor in the s but successive democratic administrations from carter to clinton froze then permanently suspended nuclear fuel shipments after delhi tested a nuclear weapon in mr singh and his negotiators were naturally wary of u s promises to keep the fuel flowing india won major concessions on both points the deal allows delhi to reprocess foreign fuel a privilege the u s currently grants only to japan and european countries washington also committed to helping india find fuel if the u s cuts off the supply for any reason thats a big giveaway under american law if india tests a nuclear weapon washington is bound to cut off nuclear fuel supplies the u s is willing to take these leaps because it sees india as an important strategic bulwark against a rising china and increasingly unstable pakistan not enough say the communists last month prakash karat president of the communist party of india marxist claimed the accord would have "adverse consequences for an independent foreign policy sovereignty and the economic interests of the people" and hinted it would withdraw from the government in a weird twist the rightist bharatiya janata party which kickstarted the u s india rapprochement in the s joined the lefts opposition mr singh took a calculated bet when he challenged the dissenters to put up or shut up telling a kolkata newspaper last month that "if they want to withdraw support so be it " the public cheered in every major survey indians overwhelmingly support closer ties with the u s the agreement has been extensively parsed by the local media academics and policy makers the prime ministers political muscle congress party chairman sonia gandhi is solidly on board cracks have now started to appear in the communist bulwark the hindu newspaper usually a party mouthpiece supports the deal having first condemned it party members in west bengal and kerala both communist strongholds oppose mr karats brinksmanship fearing a snap election in which theyd lose seats last week mr karat backed down agreeing to sit on a government panel that would "consider" the lefts concerns before moving ahead even if it doesnt bring down the government the left could still prevail in the u s the delay has given critics a chance to revisit old critiques such as the fact that india isnt a signatory to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and raise new issues such as indias ties with tehran both are false premises the npt has never stopped a country from acquiring a nuclear bomb think north korea or iran as for its ties with tehran its true that delhi relies upon iran as a source of energy and an export route to central asia russia and afghanistan but india has voted twice in the iaea to sanction irans nuclear weapons program and is wary of tehrans tendency to support pakistan on kashmir if the deal falls through it could be years before washington or any other nuclear nation broaches the idea of selling nuclear fuel to india that outcome would ironically make india more dependent on iran for energy and weaken its own economic prospects it would also undermine other nations willingness to negotiate major treaties with delhi the logic being that if mr singh cant get a sweet deal like this through parliament what can he get passed if theres an upside to the delhi drama its that the political standoff has unmasked indias left for what it really is ideologically antiquated and dangerously out of touch with the public thats a step forward for a nation that for decades built its foreign policy on an anti u s platform but reversing that legacy is unfortunately far from a done deal ms kissel is editor of the wall street journal asias editorial page
