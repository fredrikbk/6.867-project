inc and others offered consumers similar online tools but the services typically came through an employer or health plan unlike these older services the new ones are available directly to consumers anyone can sign up even the uninsured in part these services aim to bolster online personal health records or phrs which are health records updated by consumers stored online and shared with whomever the user chooses such as physicians outfits such as ihealthrecord org mymedilist org and even webmd offer free online personal health records medical management services have certain limitations for one many medical records arent digitized so consumers may be stuck typing in all their information by hand plus the health care industry lacks any sort of technological standards for electronic medical records making it difficult for hospitals doctors offices and insurers to share information with online services makers of the online tools say that because their tools are web based they can constantly push updates and new features such as automatic uploading of statements from doctors and insurance companies to the sites as the health care industry evolves and becomes more digital each site also says it will guard personally identifiable health information and not share it with third parties without the users consent the new services are springing up at a time when employers and legislators are pushing more health care responsibilities on to workers in the government passed the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act establishing tax favored health savings accounts or hsas for individuals employers are now using these accounts in conjunction with high deductible health plans to reduce health care costs placing workers health care more directly in their own hands since consumer directed health plans or the combination of high deductible health plans with hsas have grabbed of the health insurance market and are projected to form as much as one third of all health care plans by according to forrester research "for better or for worse people are more and more on their own in health care " says ron klain executive vice president of revolution health based in washington d c a significant issue for consumers trying to manage their own health care is billing errors which can range from being billed twice for a health care service to being charged out of network prices for in network services if an error is found consumers often have to take up the dispute with their insurance provider which can be a lengthy process some of the new online health care services such as smartmedicalconsumer say they can help alert users to errors in their medical bills when christine nolte a now retired citigroup inc managing director was diagnosed with breast cancer in she struggled to keep track of her medical bills last year after she received letters from credit agencies and calls from lawyers of her hospital for disputing over &# in medical bills that didnt make sense to her ms nolte signed up for smartmedicalconsumer as a way to keep better track of her bills ms nolte notes the free online service has automatic error detection which alerts users through a message box on the top of the screen as to how many potential errors it has detected and where they can be found smartmedicalconsumers error detection software works by learning from previous entries by a user what is covered by how much and the type of coverage it then uses that as a comparison for new entries and alerts the user to mismatches or discrepancies in the billing since she has been using the service ms nolte says she has saved more than &# by challenging erroneous claims from her insurance company and hospital "id like to think that i have control over my medical bills even though i didnt have control over my cancer " says the manhattan resident apart from automatic error detection smartmedicalconsumer also has medical billing experts that man an online forum for members to ask questions revolution healths premium service goes one step further by calling up insurance companies and fighting over disputed claims on a users behalf customers have to sign a consent form and send or fax over the applicable records to participate in the service christopher parks co founder and chief executive of change healthcare says he started medbillmanager and other online tools to make paying for health care transparent and easier "we want to provide the means for people to organize and manage their bills and understand what is reasonable and fair " he says mohit ghose a spokesman for americas health insurance plans a trade association says the groups members are working with health care providers to create interoperable electronic systems in the health care industry in part to reduce billing errors he adds that services that help consumers manage their health care whether they are from employers health plans or direct to consumers are helpful "we believe they provide information and information is always a good thing " says mr ghose still all health plans are different and analysts who track the health insurance industry say that for any service that tracks medical expenses to be truly helpful to consumers it has to somehow tap into each consumers health plan and get a sense of what the rules are and how to apply them within the next month change healthcare says it will introduce a feature that will allow users to select their own carrier from a list of health insurers and the online tool will automatically adjust the form for the traditional explanation of benefits or eob to match the language used by the health plan smartmedicalconsumers software picks up some specifics from health plans such as in and out of network fees from a users previous entries and will in some cases automatically input billing data many analysts recommend consumers create their own personal health records essentially a record of an individuals important medical information thats because the person who will truly be responsible for ones health care in the end is that person if people change jobs frequently their health insurance companies and doctors will also change analysts also add that its a good way to keep track of childrens immunization records or early doctors appointments for a newborn cathy tripp who follows consumer health for consulting firm watson wyatt worldwide inc advises people to get in the habit of regularly updating their online health records much like a checkbook when they pay their medical bills consumers should also automatically update the personal health record she says otherwise the bills may accumulate or even get lost making it a chore to keep the record accurately updated "its a big issue " ms tripp says "you get explanation of benefits and bills from doctors and tracking that can be an onerous task for anyone who has ongoing medical issues " web solutions online medical expense tools have benefits and limitations pros can help sort through paperwork and provide summaries of expenses some can help detect billing errors by tracking anomalies in claims cons consumers may have to type in data manually online tools may not be compatible with an insurers formats
