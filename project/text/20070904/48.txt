market that lehman brothers holdings inc would go bust investors sold their shares pushing lehmans valuation to historic lows these days after more than a decade of diversifying its business mix and moving to longer term financing sources almost no one believes lehman is anywhere close to a blowup yet lehmans shares are down this year just behind bear stearns cos as the worst performing investment bank the reason for the selloff is lehmans earnings outlook despite expanding its nonbond businesses lehman is more dependent on the bond market than most of its investment banking rivals with the mortgage market in turmoil and the buyout boom stalled there is no doubt lehmans profit is going to fall the question is how far and for how long at lehmans relatively low valuation of times book value some investors and analysts think the market has become too pessimistic "there were real fears that lehman had a funding issue in " says michael peterson an analyst who covers brokers and banks at money manager pzena investment management which owned million shares or of lehmans outstanding shares at the end of june and has acquired more since then "i dont believe thats the case this time lehman is very cheap right now " lehman closed friday at &# up on the new york stock exchange on a price to book value basis lehman rates as the cheapest investment banking stock after bear which is trading below its book value morgan stanley is trading at twice its book value goldman sachs group inc at times and merrill lynch &amp co at times lehmans big investors and executives insist the bank has grown far beyond its roots as a bond house and that areas like the trading of stocks and derivative products plus overseas banking and trading which accounted for of the firms second quarter net revenue remain relatively strong lehman for example will help handle altria group inc s spinoff of its international tobacco unit announced last week still anxiety abounds on aug after a merrill analyst downgraded lehman from "buy" to "hold " the companys shares dropped in his report that day the analyst guy moszkowski wrote that "estimates for appear unrealistic at this point" and that the consensus figure of &# in earnings per share could fall by nearly mr moszkowski cut his own estimate by to &# along with his third quarter estimate which he trimmed by still he described lehmans "long term global growth prospects" as "excellent " his call echoed growing skepticism among the analysts who watch the stock since early july they have lowered their earnings per share estimates for the quarter that began saturday by an average from &# to &# according to thomson financial their view is fueled partly by a belief that lehman and other brokerage stocks may not have hit bottom "these are very good valuations if you can be patient and long term " says eric veiel an analyst who covers financial stocks for t rowe price the investment management firm that owned about million shares of lehman at the end of june "but theyre not troughs " even bullish investors agree that a serious economic slowdown a big stock market decline or a collapse in the mergers and acquisitions business would further erode earnings at lehman and other wall street firms and could send the share price on another leg down but even if the problems remain concentrated in the bond market lehman will be facing some tough times lehman recently shut its subprime loan originator bnc mortgage a move that cut lehmans headcount by more budget trims are expected in lehmans global mortgage origination business and people briefed on lehmans performance admit that declines in origination and in the packaging of mortgages into new securities will likely dent fixed income revenue for the third quarter that ended friday those results will be revealed in mid september fixed income is an important element of lehmans top line in the combination of bond trading and debt financing accounted for of lehmans &# billion in net revenue during the same period the figure was at goldman a company with which lehman likes to compare itself both firms note that their own bond businesses differ from those of peers depending on which subdivisions are included at the same time investors are wondering how lehman will fare in its leveraged financing efforts a business that skyrocketed during the buyout euphoria of recent years but is now under pressure as the cost of borrowing rises lehman has debt commitments for a number of significant deals including portions of the &# billion sale of texas utility txu corp and the &# billion sale of payment processor first data corp as well as its own &# billion purchase along with a partner of the real estate trust archstone smith normally lehman would raise that debt from a variety of outside investors but investors recently have shied away from such deals or demanded higher interest rates and that could leave lehman and other banks to fund the deals themselves as a result in a worst case scenario lehman could be stuck holding as much as &# billion to &# billion in client deal financing say people who have been briefed on the matter moreover if the terms of lehmans loans are renegotiated and result in lower prices for the related bonds the firm could be forced to pay the difference but investors and the people briefed on the matter say that with hedges and other risk controls in place the firm can comfortably shoulder some losses without facing a future cash crunch long term players are shrugging off those risks "im not worried" about whether lehmans debt financing commitments will prove more expensive to the firm than originally intended says brian posner chief executive of the money management firm clearbridge advisors a unit of legg mason inc with about million shares or of lehmans shares outstanding clearbridge was the firms biggest institutional investor at the end of june mr posner says the stock market seems to be confusing a short term cash crunch with longer term problems at lehman at a time when its balance sheet is quite sound he knows from experience he made big profits for his investors by buying lehman shares in "this is the type of environment where you want to step back and say where do i want to make a lot of money in the next three to five years " he says "lehman is one of those great opportunities "
