mind the gap we are about to find out what sort of president of the world bank robert zoellick intends to be on thursday the government accountability project gap a self described public interest law firm will release an unofficial report on the department of institutional integrity the world banks anti corruption unit known internally as the int next week comes a second official report about the int from a panel of worthies led by former federal reserve chairman paul volcker by the end of the month the int intends to release its own report on the banks health related projects in india where there is evidence of corruption running into the hundreds of millions of dollars that third report is what the first two are really about but whether its conclusions are ever acted on or so much as shared with the banks funders including the u s congress will depend on whether mr zoellick has the courage to confront his entrenched bureaucracy some background in february then world bank president paul wolfowitz named mr volcker who had previously led the inquiry into the u n s oil for food scandal to conduct the int review like mr wolfowitz mr volcker is outspoken about the evils of corruption which puts both men at odds with bank bureaucrats who tend to think of it as the acceptable price of "doing good" in the developing world the volcker panels remit is to find ways to improve the int a relatively new and small unit within the bank tasked with investigating everything from complaints about sexual harassment to evidence of bid rigging bribery mismanagement and fraud in the banks &# billion annual lending portfolio it wasnt long before mr wolfowitz became embroiled in the controversy over his girlfriends pay raise based on information leaked first to gap and then to the media mr wolfowitz was soon gone but the volcker panel soldiered on then in mid june bank staff arrived at their desks to find an email from beatrice edwards gaps international program director "at the suggestion of various world bank staff members " wrote ms edwards "we are conducting a review of the int as an effort parallel to the work of the volcker panel " after requesting her correspondents participation in gaps review she added that "never in our practice has a witness identity been revealed without that persons express permission " notably the gap review was slated to be released a week before mr volckers raising the question of whether the two were operating in parallel or at cross purposes ms edwards letter raised other questions too who among the "world bank staff members" would wish to undermine the volcker panel and why why involve the gap is it a credible outfit are its promises of confidentiality good an answer to the first question came a few days later in an internally circulated memo written on behalf of the banks "senior management team " then led by managing director graeme wheeler while noting that the bank "fully supports the work of the volcker panel" and "reaffirming the importance of the existing standards of disclosure " the memo simply acknowledged the gap study while doing nothing to dissuade bank staff from participating it isnt surprising that mr wheeler who led the staff coup against mr wolfowitz would support the gap review the new zealander is widely seen within the bank as an enemy of suzanne rich folsom the american ethics lawyer who runs the int mr wheeler also oversees the banks activities in south asia in late ms folsom released a devastating int report on the banks health related projects in india now her team is completing a follow up study on india that may prove even more embarrassing to mr wheeler and his deputies it also isnt surprising that gap would be enlisted to discredit the int and ms folsom according to a article in the washington monthly gap is a child of "the unapologetically leftist institute for policy studies " and ms folsom is considered the last wolfowitz holdover at the bank though she was initially hired by former president jim wolfensohn himself a clinton appointee the gap campaigned openly and aggressively for mr wolfowitzs resignation and in a telephone interview ms edwards makes little secret that the report leaked last week to sympathetic journalists will call for ms folsoms dismissal as well "quite frankly many people have voiced concerns about her " she says thats true though one has to wonder whether ms folsoms accusers might also be targets of her corruption investigations and thus have a motive to see her discredited also true is that many people have been voicing "concerns" about gap for many years in a sharply worded letter to gap from december scott white the banks deputy general counsel cut off all cooperation with a previous gap "study" of the banks whistleblower protection policies when it was discovered that gap was simultaneously representing bank staff in suits against the institution "since gap has taken on an adversarial role in matters pending with the bank gap is no longer in a position to conduct an independent review and has severely compromised its own credibility " wrote mr white in essence he was accusing gap of being a shakedown operation yet that may be as nothing next to what gap is now attempting contrary to ms edwards assurances bank staff who "participate" in gaps review by divulging confidential information are not automatically entitled to an attorney client privilege as former justice department official david rivkin notes "an attorney is not a confessor " and "the public interest" is not a client by making promises she cant keep ms edwards who is not a lawyer may be misleading world bank staff which brings us back to mr zoellick bank sources say that mr wheeler has been actively lobbying his boss to meet with ms edwards and take the gap report seriously surprise surprise what mr zoellick chooses to do will tell us whether "integrity" has any future at the world bank see related letters "letters to the editor world bank wasted money and lives in buying wrong medicine" wsj sept
