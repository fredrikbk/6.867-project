chicly turned out she says many werent as "dressy and fashion forward" as those in new york there were few stores to choose from she recalls and many of austins boutiques catered to the university crowd "you had to go out of town to shop for gowns " she says ms macdonald who runs a local marketing firm says she began serving as a chairwoman for fund raising events and in the past two years she says shes noticed a change transplants from new york los angeles and las vegas have imported their sense of style as women see more fashion on television and attend more social events she says many

social calendar nancy nichols vice president and general manager of the neimans at domain says sales associates stay on top of parties in town to make sure their clients arent wearing the same thing a concern once more associated with white house balls and academy award parties its a different feeling from dallas neimans headquarters where she worked for the company previously "the women in dallas shop for sport " says ms nichols "the austin women like to shop right before events " the retailer has also been surprised to see spending trickle down to younger buyers including women at the university of texas "students are buying sophisticated cocktail dresses and gowns " ms nichols said all of this has spurred a backlash of sorts as some local entrepreneurs pine for a return to the days when this liberal college town was referred to as the "blueberry in the tomato soup " this summer a group of local businesses banded together to protest the tax incentives handed out to the new domain complex similarly a few years ago a different group of small businesses began circulating "keep austin weird" bumper stickers at neimans charity gala last march well dressed young partygoers danced to local bands until midnight neimans slogan for the evening "keep austin fabulous "
