the morning brief bush points to iraq success but can it be replicated online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here president bushs surprise trip to iraq yesterday was carefully timed and located to highlight successes of the administrations war strategy ahead of key congressional hearings but outside of the spotlights glare the challenges facing u s troops and iraqi forces politicians and civilians appear hardly diminished mondays visit was mr bushs first trip to iraq not involving a stop in the capital baghdad instead he visited the former sunni insurgent stronghold of anbar province in what the wall street journal calls a "a symbolic nod to the emerging administration strategy" of focusing less on the central government in baghdad and more on local players who can bring about some stability to their communities in anbar province "you see sunnis who once fought side by side with al qaeda against coalition troops now fighting side by side with coalition troops against al qaeda " mr bush said during his seven hour visit which included meetings with u s commander gen david petraeus u s ambassador ryan crocker iraqi political leaders such as prime minister nouri al maliki and sunni tribal figures having successfully convinced some sunni chiefs to turn against sunni extremists in places like anbar the u s for the first time is trying to push more moderate shiite leaders to turn against extremists from their own sect the journal reports "the new approach bears some striking similarities to the soft partition strategy pushed by senior democrats and suggests that a broad consensus on how to move ahead in the war torn country may be forming " the journal writes yet the success in anbar may be an isolated case the result of a split between an al qaeda umbrella organization called the islamic state of iraq and the rest of the sunni guerrilla movement the independent writes the islamic state of iraq created widespread anger among sunnis by killing anyone connected with the government even garbage collectors or low level ministry employees and sought to draft one young man from each sunni family into their forces the independent reports indeed anthony cordesman a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies suggests to the new york times that the coalition success among sunnis in anbar could be more of an exception than a rule because sectarian divisions and strife appear to be worsening elsewhere in the country furthermore the alliance of some sunnis with coalition forces not only in anbar but also in the countrys north and east and around baghdad u s officials tell the washington post is greeted with wariness by leaders of iraqs shiite dominated government "there are those inside the maliki government that might want to characterize this as arming a sunni opposition to the shia based maliki government " a senior defense official tells the post this is one reason u s officials saw it as vital to persuade mr maliki to visit anbar where he has rarely traveled since becoming prime minister the post writes meanwhile in baghdad focus of the surge in u s troops "the shakiness of iraqs capacity for reconciliation under current conditions is especially evident " the los angeles times reports the paper says the capital has been split into a series of sectarian neighborhoods that have become more not less balkanized in the past six months "the surge now is isolating areas from each other and putting up permanent checkpoints that is what i call a failure " yousif kinany an engineer in the now primarily shiite area of hurriya tells the l a times the paper cites analysts military officers and ordinary iraqis as saying the country is only able to keep a lid on violence as long as the military buildup keeps armed groups at bay "once the military surge peters out which it will if there is no progress on the political front " joost hiltermann of the international crisis group tells the paper "these groups will pop right back up and start going at each others and civilians throats again " in terms of political progress the guardian reports that representatives from iraqi groups after four days of secret talks in finland organized by former finnish president martti ahtisaari agreed on a road map to peace based on the experiences of northern ireland of which unionist jeffrey donaldson and sinn fein leader martin mcguinness took part in the talks among the groups reportedly represented were that of radical shiite cleric moqtada al sadr the leader of the largest sunni arab political group adnan al dulaimi and humam hammoudi the shia chairman of the iraqi parliaments foreign affairs committee but the guardian writes "it was not clear last night what influence these representatives have or whether they were committed to bringing their organizations on side " for markets is the cruelest month to come september is a month many investors equate with stock market declines the wall street journal reports in the past years the dow has fallen on average in september making it the indexs worst month the paper says adding that this could be because funds that close their books in october sell stocks for tax loss purposes or because an expectation of september declines has become self reinforcing last month even with all the volatility the djia ended higher than it began and it turns out that liquidity worries didnt completely shut down the credit markets because the more than &# billion issued in investment grade corporate bonds marked the biggest august on record and the sixth biggest month ever the journal says citing ifr markets and thomson financial in the weeks ahead banks will be looking to raise money to finance several major buyouts and that could pressure the junk bond and leveraged loan markets the journal writes citing mark kiesel portfolio manager at bond giant pimco mr kiesel says companies at the mercy of domestic economic cycles such as homebuilders and retailers are going to have to jack up yields to sell bonds while noncyclical businesses like telecom and mining firms will fare better one early test of the markets appetite for debt will be an offering of &# billion in loans and bonds to pay for the buyout of first data corp by kkr the new york times writes the aggressively structured deal is likely to include covenant lite loans which place few restrictions on how much debt the company can take on and pay in kind toggles or bonds that can be repaid by issuing more notes the times reports noting that investors have recently rejected both as unacceptable "we are basically down to getting ready for a road show " first datas chairman and chief executive henry duques tells the paper "it would be nice if somebody wanted to buy the debt at a reasonable price " meanwhile there are signals to please both the optimists and the pessimists yesterday the cost of borrowing money for three months in the london interbank market rose to its highest level since december while euro libor and dollar rates for the same period hit their highest levels since "as some banks are scrambling to raise funding in an increasingly frenetic manner " the financial times reports today deutsche bank announced that the recent turmoil has forced it to mark down valuations but said it has no liquidity problems its exposure to hedge funds is "fully collateralized " and it has seen signs of market stabilization in the past few days as dow jones newswires reports european energy firms fewer and larger with a strong nudge by french president nicolas sarkozy gaz de france and suez at last sealed the terms of their deal to create what the financial times calls the worlds third biggest utility the energy giant will have billion euros &# billion in revenue billion euros in market capitalization and the potential to set up a big fight between the european union and national governments over who drives energy policy the wall street journal writes the deal means europes natural gas sector will now be dominated by a handful of players companies which have jealously guarded their positions even by making informal agreements not to enter each others markets the international herald tribune reports "their tight grip has made it difficult for smaller companies to enter the sector unless they make significant investments like building pipelines " the iht notes still the merged company is likely to give europe more clout when negotiating energy contracts with other big companies such as gazprom especially if it leverages gaz de frances presence in algeria the paper says the ft writes that mr sarkozy "who has repeatedly said he was prepared to intervene to promote frances energy interests " is now expected to turn his attention to the creation of a third energy champion by restructuring frances state
