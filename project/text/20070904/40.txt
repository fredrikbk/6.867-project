how p&amp g led also ran to sweet smell of success by focusing on fragrance gain detergent developed a billion dollar following gain was nearly a loss for procter &amp gamble the low priced laundry detergent launched in had grown a small following among cost conscious consumers in the south but failed to build nationwide appeal with sales dwindling in p&amp g decided to give gain one more chance by repositioning it as a heavily fragrant detergent touting scent instead of cleaning performance was a departure from the long held formula of laundry marketing but p&amp gs research showed that scent was a particularly important factor in hispanic households and it believed a fragrant detergent would draw the growing hispanic population in the u s emphasizing fragrance also allowed p&amp g to differentiate gain from its other laundry brands including tide cheer and era marketed respectively for superior cleaning color protection and stain fighting in gain held about of the &# billion laundry detergent market in the u s up from in that makes it no behind tide which dominates the market with about of sales in according to euromonitor international inc a market data firm even though the strong perfumes didnt have mass appeal p&amp g wagered that the scent loving consumer segment would be sizable and loyal enough to deliver consistent sales the bet paid off annual sales of gain broke the &# billion mark for the first time in the fiscal year ended june it joined other p&amp g brands whose sales surpass &# billion including pampers diapers crest toothpaste and olay skin care products "p&amp gs prayers were answered with that proverbial hail mary pass " says burt flickinger iii managing director of strategic resource group "they understood how important fragrance was for some consumers especially hispanics in the u s and seized it before anybody else did " gains rise to the billion dollar mark comes as unilever the maker of wisk and all is exiting u s detergent aisles after years of losing market share to p&amp g in august unilever announced it would sell its u s laundry business which generates about million euros &# billion in annual sales that comes four years after colgate palmolive threw in the towel on its u s laundry brands blaming p&amp gs strength for making its own effort unprofitable p&amp gs approach to marketing gain going after a narrow audience is unusual for the consumer products titan most of its billion dollar brands have won sales by building mass appeal but with gain just of users account for of sales volume p&amp g says "most p&amp g brands have a very large market share and so as a result we often end up with a voice for a brand thats watered down and trying to energize everyone " says german uribe p&amp gs multicultural marketing director with gain "theyre not trying to be all things to everybody " the narrowly targeted approach required a different marketing strategy than p&amp g the worlds biggest advertiser typically uses gain spends relatively little on advertising just &# million in compared with &# million for tide according to tns media intelligence a gain product line introduced last year prompted the brand to boost its ad spending to &# million tns estimates while tides rose to &# million though of gains sales come from hispanic or african american users p&amp g estimates the company says it doesnt overtly target them in the brands marketing its advertising does though include spots on cable channels delivering significant hispanic and african american viewers including univision and bet gain also selects fragrance names that translate easily into spanish such as apple mango tango and uses images of the fragrance ingredients on the bottle so non english speakers can still decipher the scent the ads also differ from traditional laundry commercials in content rather than tout laundry performance traits like stain fighting prowess gain ads take a playful often spicy tone illustrating the delirium great smelling laundry can bring to users whom p&amp g calls "gain iacs " even the curved lines of the bottle and its handle play a role "it looks like a woman with her hand on her hip it has attitude to it " says scott mautz an associate marketing director for gain tv ads also try to convey an insider feeling by quoting from users letters in one commercial a narrator reads a letter from a husband mystified by the effect gain has on his wifes behavior as the narrator reads a middle aged woman dances the tango through her kitchen while holding a basket full of laundry says p&amp g chief marketing officer james stengel "its about understanding those consumers who are very important to you and getting into the mindset that its all about creating a relationship with them " grass roots efforts also play a role p&amp g gave away samples of gain in laundromats in the los angeles area seeking to snag hispanic immigrants newly adapting to u s washing machines and detergent brands p&amp g says it will continue to look for ways to increase its sampling efforts gains latest product line gain joyful expressions introduced last year is also narrowly targeted "we deliberately made it more intense more polarizing they werent designed to appeal to everybody " says p&amp gs north america laundry marketing director kevin burke of the lines fragrances which include gardenia delight and mandarin lime fusion "thats how we got deeper love with an even narrower group of consumers "
