small talk kelly spors answers questions from readers about entrepreneurship q i am starting a small business and will have one product that i plan to sell to retail outfits i have found that many retailers will require my product to have a universal product code how do i get a upc g c mystic conn a upcs the digit numbers that appear under the barcodes on many u s products are given out by gs us a nonprofit group that sets standards for international commerce heres how it works businesses pay to join gs us and in exchange it assigns each member its own identification number that appears as the first part of its upc companies usually need different upc codes for each product they sell even if it is just a different size so companies will add more numbers to their gs issued identification code to identify each of their products each upc can be used to produce a specific barcode that can then be printed out and attached to products or ideally incorporated into the product design so that it is easily scanned at the register but going this route isnt exactly cheap for membership in gs us you must pay an initial fee of least &# and then an annual maintenance fee of at least &# the fees depend on the number of unique products you sell along with your annual revenue a membership form can be filled out online on gss web site www gsus org another option some internet based companies including buyabarcode com now resell upc codes for less than &# so small companies dont have to pay to join gs themselves you will be paying for the use of that companys identification number not your own that means your products upc will begin with another companys id number it can be a fine solution if you are cash strapped or working with small or independent retailers if the retailers dont mind and just selling one or two products but it wont work if youre planning to sell through major retailers because they generally require product makers to have their own identification numbers
