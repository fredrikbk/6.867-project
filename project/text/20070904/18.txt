enterprise why so many want to create facebook applications sites growing ranks seen as potential source of revenue customers another online gold rush is on entrepreneurs are scrambling to create small software programs for facebook inc s social networking site and grab footholds in its emerging economy three months ago the palo alto calif company invited software developers to create applications for its site the response was immediate facebook says more than developers from college kids to big corporation engineers have signed up for the tools needed to build the free applications meanwhile facebook members are energetically embracing the applications they use them to dress up their profile pages with everything from maps showing what countries theyve visited to outfits from a retail site to favorite youtube videos they send virtual cocktails and gifts to each other share reviews of favorite books and movies and play poker together among myriad other things so far facebook says there are some applications on the site that regularly attract more than users and quite a few other programs including the games and reviews that entertain tens of thousands of devotees daily many of the developers of these applications are entrepreneurs looking to start new businesses while others are expanding existing ones and the applications which are inexpensive to create have the potential to become a large source of revenue and customers for those companies that can successfully mine facebooks million strong community to that end companies are using a host of business models some for instance are selling advertising around the applications while others promote their own products and services on web pages shown to users of their applications "this is a watershed event that is going to affect business and technology for many years " much the way microsoft corp s windows operating system did says rodney rumford editor and publisher of facereviews com a solana beach calif company that reviews facebook applications online and provides consulting and application development services "its a tool for people to discover businesses in a way they couldnt be discovered before " the applications are garnering a big buzz among web companies and venture capitalists alike menlo park calif based venture firm bay partners has raised &# million specifically for companies developing facebook applications and is making &# to &# investments per application "all internet companies need a facebook strategy or a presence on facebook " says partner salil deshpande because facebook usership is growing so quickly indeed facebooks monthly visitor numbers doubled to million in july from six months earlier according to measurement firm comscore networks inc that growth has been propelled by a mass movement onto the site since facebook opened itself to nonuniversity email address holders the facebook platform is so promising in part because its members use it to connect with people they know or want to know in the nonvirtual world unlike news corp s myspace and most other social networking sites facebook members arent anonymous they use their real names and connect with each other to the degree they choose facebook also allows businesses to interact with facebook users fairly freely while restricting access to any personal data "they make it a safe place for communication and for doing business " says lee lorenzen chief executive of altura ventures llc a monterey calif firm that also is funding application creators and has purchased several applications "were certainly pleased with how much its taken off " say brandee barker a spokeswoman for facebook "we already have a thriving ecosystem of businesses built on the facebook platform " applications are easy to create developers build test and debug their applications and when theyre done submit them to facebook for review and testing if approved facebook simply turns them on the first wave of facebook applications were simple and designed to win over large numbers of people for instance more than two million users have been recruited by their friends to put cartoons of ninjas and pirates on their profile pages thanks to a contest created by a trio of developers but the new entrepreneurs entering the arena are bringing with them applications that are more sophisticated and can engage users more often and for longer periods of time to do so they try to harness the connections that link its members or what has become known as facebooks "social graph " take "neighbors " an application launched four weeks ago by point technologies inc a vancouver based company that operates a web based real estate listing service called point nls the application uses the companys broker defined neighborhood system to help facebook members meet other people who live near them and share local information and photos it also shows properties for sale in the neighborhood from any of points broker and agent members which the company says number about in countries "were trying to help these real estate professionals connect to the facebook community " says

like from the retailers site such as oscar de la renta dresses los altos calif based shopstyle com which debuted in february sells brand name products from about retailers "our aim is getting more people involved in the shopstyle community " says andy moss the companys founder and ceo he says shopstyle com has gotten of the members of its own fashion focused community from facebook but it remains unclear whether the application will successfully drive product purchases one application helps people plan real getaways sidestep inc a santa clara calif travel search engine provider
