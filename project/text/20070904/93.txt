the pyongyang bidding you have to hand it to kim jong ils negotiators in north korea they certainly know how to make u s diplomats pay again and again for the same real estate thus we have this weekends declaration by u s negotiator chris hill that the north koreans have agreed to give up their nuclear program by the end of the year wonderful but didnt they already agree in february to give up their entire program as well as to present a comprehensive list of their entire nuclear program and arsenal within days that was seven months ago and now the list wont be presented for another four months if it ever is meanwhile north korea is saying that in return for its latest unfulfilled promise the bush administration has agreed to begin the process of taking the terrorist state off the u s list of terror sponsoring states reuters quoted a pyongyang spokesman as saying yesterday that the u s has also agreed to lift "all sanctions that have been applied according to the trading with the enemy act " mr hill wasnt as forthcoming but you can bet north korea will soon turn both of these u s actions into prerequisites to any further declarations on its part were willing to bet too that the bush administration will end before north korea really comes clean about its entire nuclear weapons program
