investors hope this september isnt forgettable months bad history adds to trading unrest waiting for a rate cut many wall streeters head back from their labor day break hoping the financial market pains of july and august will be over bankers have a mountain of low grade debt to sell in the next few months investors have a long list of stocks and bonds to pick through that are much less expensive than they were a few months ago yet the setting is fraught with uncertainty if the market is going to get back on its feet hardly a sure thing some tricky questions are going to need to be resolved soon will the federal reserve cut short term interest rates something that seemed unlikely just a few months ago how will homeowners respond to tightening mortgage credit are any more bombs ticking on the balance sheets of hedge funds or banks will investors buy the billions of dollars of buyout related bonds and loans about to come to the market that could help decide whether history repeats itself and september follows its traditional pattern of being a down month for stocks "people are tired and theyre going to reassess what kind of exposure they want " says seth tobias of hedge fund circle t partners in new york "i think youre going to see a reduction in risk profiles " in his remarks friday at the kansas city feds annual jackson hole wyo seminar federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said nothing to dispel investors belief that the fed will lower its federal funds target rate from when it meets in two weeks the fed has already reduced the rate it charges for loans from its discount window but investors are counting on a lower rate on the more widely used fed funds market where banks borrow from one another overnight mr bernankes comments helped spur a point rally in the dow jones industrial average on friday for the week it slipped points or to yet it finished up for the month of august thanks in large part to the shifting view on interest rates u s markets were closed yesterday for labor day mr bernanke also didnt offer any guarantees on a rate cut warning "it is not the responsibility of the federal reserve nor would it be appropriate to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions " that suggests the fed will need much clearer signals than it did under former chairman alan greenspan that the economy is at risk before it responds to financial distress some investors could be selling stocks they might otherwise want to own whitney tilson of new york hedge fund t partners says he recently jettisoned his position in tyco international ltd even though he thinks that the stock is probably undervalued he is concentrating on owning the shares of companies for which he has higher conviction he likes berkshire hathaway inc for instance because its large cash position and berkshire chairman warren buffetts talent for picking up stocks for bargain prices in times of distress mean that it could actually benefit from a shakeout in financial markets mr tilson says he isnt predicting such a shakeout but sees higher odds of it occurring than he did earlier in the year as a result he says "if were not pounding the table enough on a stock were not going to own it " it doesnt help that it is september a month that many investors equate with stock market declines in the past years the dow has fallen on average in september making it the averages worst month this may be because funds that close their books in october sell stocks for tax loss purposes or because an expectation of declines has become self reinforcing "september has historically been a weak month and that has some historically minded people nervous " says william sterling chief investment officer of new york investment firm trilogy advisors at the same time the worry in the stock market could have an upside so many investors are steeling themselves for the worst that if things dont turn out to be so bad if for instance the credit markets calm down and the feds willingness to bail out funds and financial firms isnt put to the test stocks could advance if that occurs many professional investors could end up plunging into stocks in an attempt to catch up sending the market higher still says john bollinger president of manhattan beach calif money manager bollinger capital management "clients forgive managers who lose on the downside but if they miss the upside theyre really toast " he says but strategist roger volz of credit suisse brokerage arm swiss american securities expects that in a reflection of investor uncertainty stock indexes will trade in september within the range between their highs and lows of august an occurrence chart watching traders call an "inside month " because the range for august was so wide with the dow moving in an point range and the standard &amp poors stock index in a point range stocks could still be volatile mr volzs game plan is simple whatever the s&amp p does in the first week or two of trading mr volz says he will start betting the opposite way as the market will have to move in that direction in order to stay in the range "theres a little bit of exhaustion going into september this year " mr volz says "we wont have the same fireworks in the next few weeks that weve been seeing but there are still ways to position yourself "
