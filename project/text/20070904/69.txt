rating concerns the subprime market took off as individuals sought easy mortgages which brokers approved with little or no documentation and which investment banks packaged into securities and sold to other investors the role of credit rating firms mcgraw hill cos standard &amp poors moodys corp s moodys investors service and fimalac sas fitch ratings was to evaluate and score the debt since the subprime market collapse which led to delinquencies bankruptcies and broader market turmoil the ratings firms have come under fire for giving overly favorable ratings to mortgage backed financial instruments and for being slow to downgrade them the firms often collaborated with underwriters in designing such securities while also collecting hefty fees raising questions about whether they were capable of dispassionately assessing their risks two big questions for washington did the credit rating firms mess up did relationships with investment banks and others unduly influence their ratings "clearly things went wrong " said house financial services committee chairman barney frank mr frank is holding a hearing tomorrow at which representatives from the treasury department the sec mortgage lenders and investment banks will testify federal reserve representatives will testify at a later date he said regulators were caught off guard by the subprime problems too he added mr frank said it was too early to say what changes if any would come of the hearings the credit rating companies say their ratings accurately reflected the risk of the underlying assets of the attention from washington representatives for moodys s&amp p and fitch said only that they are open to working with lawmakers and regulators this is the second time in recent memory that the ratings firms have come under fire five years ago they were highlighted for failing to spot problems at enron and worldcom the corporate scandals that followed set off criminal prosecutions and changes in u s corporate governance including the sarbanes oxley law last week the white house said president bush had asked treasury secretary henry paulson to look into the ratings firms through his role as the head of the presidents working group on financial markets the working group which consists of treasury the fed the sec and the commodity futures trading commission also will look into how "securitization and the repackaging and selling of assets have changed the mortgage industry and related business practices " according to the white house while it is too early to say what if any recommendations the working group will come up with people familiar with the matter said there is a view within the treasury department that the ratings firms could benefit from operating more transparently the treasury department doesnt oversee the firms so changes would have to come either through the sec or congress phillip swagel treasurys assistant secretary for economic policy said he expects the landscape for ratings concerns to change as wall street and washington digest the lessons of the past few months "there will probably be a lot more scrutiny in a sense a lot more analysis being done of the underlying credit and thats probably a good thing " he said sunday on c span congress gave the sec authority to oversee rating firms last fall and the commission has begun examinations into their policies and procedures conflicts of interests and disclosure of their ratings practices said erik sirri head of the secs market regulation division this is the first time the sec will undertake such a review so it isnt clear what actions might follow ratings firms say they guard against any potential conflicts by not paying analysts based on specific deals they say ratings decisions go before committees that include senior officials before they are finalized "the key point is those securities that have been impacted the most are those that we originally told the market carried a higher level of risk " a spokesman for mcgraw hill said "when we saw loosened underwriting standards and started to see the poor performance of individual loans we adjusted our ratings criteria and required issuers of riskier subprime mortgages to add collateral enhancement to the deals " he said added a spokeswoman for moodys "ratings are both an art and a science and theyre constantly evolving as the credit markets evolve " she said that after the previous tightening of the credit markets moodys adjusted by adding a liquidity rating on debt securities a measure of how easy it is to buy and sell the debt to aid investors in their decision making more broadly the firms are hoping to escape the coming clampdown unscathed "we believe the current regulatory environment is working " the mcgraw
