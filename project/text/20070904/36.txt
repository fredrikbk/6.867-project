ghosn bets big on low cost strategy african plant underscores race to head off chinese indian car makers tangiers morocco the plan by french automotive group renault sa and japanese partner nissan motor co to jointly build an assembly plant in this north african port city highlights the accelerating race among global car makers to redefine the meaning of "low cost " and not just for emerging markets renault nissan chief executive carlos ghosn flew to tangiers saturday where he signed the draft agreement with morocco prime minister driss jettou for the tangiers plant the two companies aim to invest as much as billion euros &# billion to erect one of the largest auto production facilities on the african continent the plants initial capacity of vehicles a year will increase gradually to a year including variants of renaults low cost logan car line and a new range of &# trucks under development at nissan the companies said the plant is slated to open in the second half of mr ghosn said moving into the no frills segment represents a challenge "it is easy to make a cheap vehicle " mr ghosn said "to make a cheap vehicle that is robust and reliable and to turn a profit thats the future of the auto industry " mimicking the way japan and south korea built up strong auto industries by focusing initially on low cost products india and china have started to export low cost cars taking advantage of a combination of relatively inexpensive home market labor and technology imported from western partners and suppliers while many indian and chinese vehicles dont meet western safety and pollution standards they represent a challenge to efforts by established car makers to win new customers in emerging markets of africa eastern europe and asia u s european and japanese car makers also fear that if they abandon the low cost segment to india and china those countries will rapidly improve the quality of their products and start to attack mature markets renault is in talks with bajaj auto ltd the indian maker of motorbikes and three wheelers to develop a &# car mr ghosn said renault needs to look into the possibility of making cheaper models because its existing low cost car the logan which was introduced in india this year with a price tag of about &# is more suited for middle class purses earlier this year chrysler llc and chinas chery automobile co struck a deal under which chery will assemble a series of small inexpensive cars for export to western europe and the u s under the dodge brand the deal is intended to help chrysler roll out new models quickly inexpensively and with less capital investment than would be required in the u s other big auto makers are pushing their own low cost strategies general motors corp recently announced a &# million investment in its operations in brazil and argentina aimed at producing a new line of low cost vehicles gm also is shifting engineering to new centers in india korea brazil and china and is nurturing its ties to ultra low cost chinese minicar maker saic gm wuling automobile co which sells cars that start at prices below &# toyota motor corp is also working on efforts to develop lower cost cars for the bric markets brazil russia india and china renault made its first inroad into the low cost market in september when it launched the logan a no frills five seat car made at its dacia affiliate in romania "at the time we werent too sure of what we would do with this car " said dacia chairman luc alexandre menard who also is responsible for east european and north african markets at renault and was present at the tangiers signing ceremony "it was meant to be a one off a trojan horse to penetrate new markets in developing countries " but he said the cars tough quality as well as its marketing success persuaded renault directors to turn logan into a low cost platform for a wide range of no frills vehicles the logan is now produced in seven countries including colombia and russia and soon will be available in five versions including a hatchback and pickup truck depending on how quickly renaults partner in iran increases logan production in the islamic republic mr menard said logan sales will reach between and this year nissan meanwhile has been exploring low cost production options in an effort to boost profit margins in may japans no car maker by sales reported its first full year drop in net profit in seven years a setback for mr ghosn who led nissans resurgence from near bankruptcy in mr ghosns strategy at nissan relied heavily on large expensive vehicles aimed at the u s market but nissan suffered as u s consumers began opting for smaller fuel efficient vehicles as gasoline prices rose over the past two years now mr ghosn and nissan executives are focusing on smaller vehicles designed for emerging markets in july nissan announced it would begin construction on a plant in st petersburg russia scheduled to begin assembly of the teana sedan and the x trail crossover for the russian market in last month the company signed a pact to form three joint ventures to make and distribute light commercial vehicles in india with ashok leyland ltd a maker of commercial vehicles and buses in chennai the morocco plant will further extend the renault nissan alliance which both firms use to keep costs down the car makers share a factory in curibita brazil that makes small trucks cars and power trains this summer nissan put its own regalia on the logan and sold it in mexico as the low cost nissan aprio as they bring low cost vehicles to their mature markets global car makers could face a marketing challenge attempting to sell low cost vehicles and their existing lineup of pricier models under the same brand sales of low cost logan based cars represent a relatively small share of renaults sales in western europe this year the french company expects to sell about logans in france in germany and in one of europes most elitist car markets switzerland another complication for western car makers is managing potential opposition from their home market workers and their unions mr ghosn addressed that issue saturday saying that shedding renaults historical production base in western europe would make no business sense "closing a plant in western europe would be too expensive " he said amy chozick in tokyo and stephen power in
