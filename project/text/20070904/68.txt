politics &amp economics two for one deal take two hillary clinton eases her husband into the campaign limelight des moines iowa hillary and bill clinton kicked off her fall campaign for the democratic presidential nomination a rare joint effort calling to mind the uncharted waters of a white house with an ex president in residence many voters in their audiences even some nonsupporters saw the potential precedent as a plus the clintons labor day weekend of stumping in new hampshire and iowa the states with the first nominating contests in four months was the third time they have publicly campaigned together this year the campaign has focused on letting the new york senator make her case independently of her husband "im here today in a very different role " the former president said sunday in portsmouth n h as he introduced his wife yesterday before hundreds of union members and their families at a labor day picnic in sioux city iowa mrs clinton suggested one role for her husband should she be elected repairing the countrys reputation in the world after what the clintons and other critics charge is the damage done during the bush years "the day im elected " she said "im going to be asking distinguished americans including my husband of both parties to start traveling around the world and not just talking to governments and leaders but talking directly to people and telling them that america is back " mrs clinton has said she would take advantage of her husbands experience beyond that the couple hasnt addressed issues that might be raised because mrs clinton is a long way from being the nominee let alone president mr clinton has said he would continue as head of his clinton foundation although that could raise a variety of foreign policy issues or conflicts given its global work on aids poverty and global warming when mr clinton first ran for president in his suggestion that his wife would be a sort of co president sparked controversy so far the idea of them returning as president and ex president seems to have caused relatively little "to me its a nonissue " said john sweeney years old a democratic leaning independent at the clintons sunday rally on the state house grounds in concord n h who hasnt decided whether to support her "better than having cheney in there " "im wondering if it would be hard for him to be just an adviser and bite his tongue and let her make decisions that she needs to make " said teacher susan huppi who is uncommitted to any candidate another teacher maureen wheeler a clinton backer said if the clintons did have differences "i think shed be her own person " voters said they didnt fear a repeat of the monica lewinsky scandal that led to mr clintons impeachment although one man teased a woman whod just shaken the former presidents hand "did you ask him about monica " ms huppi said "hes hopefully grown up and i really think that his experience was excellent so im hoping we can count on the positives " as the clintons separately walked through the hopkinton state fair in new hampshire kelley teunessen a republican leaning independent who volunteered on the bush campaigns said she might vote for mrs clinton "because shes a female its time for a change " and she added mr clinton "would be able to help her " her husband mike while no fan of the clintons agreed saying "his expertise at handling high pressure situations is an asset she can use " several thousand people turned out at each stop many undecided and some committed to others at the portsmouth rally jon wyckoff a construction company owner who supports a rival democrat former sen john edwards said the possibility of both clintons in the white house doesnt bother him so much as "the idea of bush clinton bush clinton " with the two families taking turns in power "what kind of message does that send to the rest of the world " he said "its as if were a monarchy " mr clintons introductions for his wifes speeches reflected the campaigns central themes of change and experience "hillary is the best prepared to be president of any nonincumbent i have ever had a chance to vote for" in years he said repeatedly "you want to restore americas standing in the world overnight elect hillary clinton " mrs clinton unveiled a new stump speech for the primarys final stretch it outlined four goals restore leadership rebuild the middle class reform government and "reclaim the future for our children " that includes she said "quality affordable health care for every american " without naming her chief rivals illinois sen barack obama and mr edwards she took aim at both mr obama has been a clinton target for his relative inexperience and vague talk of "hope" for big changes "you dont just do it by hoping it happens you do it by hard work " she said at the sioux city labor picnic before a union rally in des moines "change is just a word if you dont have the strength and experience to make it happen " suggesting her differences with mr edwardss more combatively liberal rhetoric she said "ultimately to bring change you have to know when to stand your ground and when to find common ground you cant always demand everything your own way or youll never get anything done in america "
