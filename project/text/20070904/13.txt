business technology those on the go get to go online cars planes and maybe even trains are becoming wireless hot spots when nascar driver and racing instructor tom dyer wanted to teach a student to correctly attack tight corners he didnt go the usual lecturing route instead mr dyer flipped the switch of a wi fi box in his car and downloaded a video from another drivers in car camera onto his laptop more effectively illustrating his point for the past year mr dyer years old has been on the road between driving lessons and races with nascar and the united states auto club through it all he has remained connected to the internet via his car "anywhere i go i can hook up to the net for whatever reason " he said "i liken it to your high speed router in your living room that you take with you it makes life a lot easier " as the number of wi fi hot spots grow so too do the possibilities of where they can be placed no longer do they have to be in fixed locations such as coffee shops or libraries planes trains and automobiles are turning into wireless internet access points new technology wimax is expected to further accelerate adoption "its an important trend in letting us remain connected when we want to be " said karen hanley senior director of the wi fi alliance autonet mobile inc builds the wi fi box mr dyer uses and also makes them available through avis budget group inc car rentals autonet wants to eventually put wi fi into every car "its the ability to maintain the internet based lifestyle people live today " said sterling pratz chief executive of autonet mr pratz isnt alone in his push for wi fi in vehicles amtrak is looking to provide coverage to its trains amr corp s american airlines plans to provide its passengers with wi fi access by next year others however are more skeptical gartner inc analyst ken dulaney said he doesnt believe there will be much demand to turn individual cars into wi fi hot spots "who wants this i cant see a market " mr dulaney said "i may want to drive to a hot spot but not have one in my car " autonet is betting that consumers will want a steady internet connection to their cars "we started autonet because we were tired of waiting for the car makers to do it " mr pratz said "people really want this " avis has recorded thousands of rental days for the wi fi boxes customers pay &# a day to use the service the autonet box makes a connection by riding on a cellular technology called code division multiple access or cdma used by sprint nextel corp and verizon wireless which is jointly owned by verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc autonet a closely held larkspur calif company developed proprietary technology that converts the cdma signal into a wi fi one allowing laptops and other electronic devices to connect to the web it also smooths out the bumpy connection cellphones often will get when moving from place to place avoiding the "dropped call syndrome " "we wanted to make it like your environment at home " mr pratz said adding that the speeds are comparable to standard digital subscriber line or dsl service passengers typically tourists who use the service surf the web to find local restaurants or activities over the next few months autonet plans to work with car dealers to offer the box as an option mr pratz said it will cost &# for a full internet connection but added that the company was exploring a subscription model down the line he said the service offers a closed network that follows industry security standards in addition to cars analysts see potential in mass transportation mr dulaney said he sees a place for connecting planes and trains american airlines recently selected closely held aircell llc to provide a high speed internet connection to its airplanes by the first half of next year aircell which has facilities in itasca ill will use spectrum specifically set aside for planes to connect them to the internet cellular towers on the ground will have antennas pointed into the sky broadcasting cdma signals that planes pick up and convert into wi fi joe cruz chief technology officer said the antennas pointed upward boast a wider range than those on the ground because there are no obstructions in the sky as a result aircell can use fewer towers to cover a larger area mr cruz said there will be little difference in the online experience for the passenger for train service there have been sporadic wi fi trials set up around the u s "were definitely looking at it " said karina romero a spokeswoman for amtrak "its something our passengers are requesting " analysts believe trains will use some combination of cellular signals and satellite dishes to maintain an internet connection seen speeding the adoption of internet access in vehicles is wireless technology wimax which is similar to wi fi but with longer range sprint and clearwire corp are partnering to build a nationwide network sprint recently held a technology summit in which partner nokia corp demonstrated the applications of wimax in a ford motor co mustang fitted with nokia n tablets embedded in the back of the cars front row headrests with clips of "terminator " and "harry potter and the order of the phoenix" wirelessly streaming from a remote personal computer while the demonstration used a wi fi signal nokia said wimax would fill the gap down the line "it represents how the in vehicle experience will look in a year " said claudine goldsmith head of marketing for nokias u s automotive group she noted that even at miles an hour the car could maintain a steady connection to the web
