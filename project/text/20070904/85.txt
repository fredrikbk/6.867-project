the daily fix a champion shows mettle by stunning no michigan online edition six top division college football teams ranked in the top of what used to be called div i a played opponents in the division a rung below formerly div i aa five of the big boys beat their opponents by at least points the average rout came by a score of the sixth of the presumed creampuff vs powerhouse matchups has already entered college football history appalachian state of boone n c beat no michigan to become the first of its second division brethren to defeat a ranked opponent the victory may well have been the biggest upset in the sports history which may only go to show that appalachian state has outgrown its division in retrospect michigans biggest mistake may have been scheduling the game the other five div i aa opponents for ranked teams this past weekend were a collective last year the best of the bunch youngstown state was crushed by appalachian state last season in the semifinals of the playoffs the mountaineers went on to win their second straight national championship perhaps they should indeed jump up a level this year and play in the rose bowl as one of their players suggested after the game by usa todays sagarin ratings the mountaineers are now th in the country among all programs two spots ahead of michigan but why would they want to play in a bowl game when their division has the football playoff the big boys can only clamor for last november when michigan was undefeated no in the country and unaware three straight losses awaited wolverines fans would have liked a playoff to have a chance at a rematch against ohio state none of this means anyone really expected michigan to lose on saturday except of course for the mountaineers by their telling winston salem journal reporter tommy bowman captured the post game moments in which an overlooked team transformed into a national sensation and helped overshadow appalachian states other recent distinction as the place where miss teen south carolina might major in geography "appalachian state players bounced through the exit tunnel at michigan stadium away from fans that were left in stunned disbelief " mr bowman writes "players and coaches hugged danced and made calls on cell phones or used them to snap pictures to capture the aftermath of a victory against powerful michigan a gathering of asu fans waited behind a metal barrier anxious to congratulate their team strains of the school fight song played by the mountaineers band which had bused to ann arbor echoed in the background " the fix thinks it possible that the exultant appalachian state radio team may also have been audible on the field all the way from their press box by the end of the game "they werent even announcing the score anymore " charlotte observer columnist scott fowler writes in his essay about attempting to track a fabled upset from his car radio "they were cheering and screaming when michigans potential game winning field goal attempt was blocked with six seconds left they were nearly incomprehensible but in a good way " hear for yourself on the observers site anyone who saw the game or highlights afterwards couldnt help but notice how fast the mountaineers are the fastest most physically gifted players are supposed to end up playing home games in ann arbor not visiting from boone asheville citizen times columnist keith jarrett credits mountaineers head coach jerry moore for his able recruiting "when he committed to the spread offense and a quicker defense several years ago moore recruited speed " mr jarrett writes "his offensive and defensive lines gave away an average of more than pounds a man to the wolverines but quick darters found holes and foot cornerbacks covered heisman candidate receivers " that helped make it possible for the underdogs to win despite playing far from a perfect game as mr jarrett notes among the overlooked talent is quarterback armanti edwards who is in his career but wasnt recruited by the big colleges because he isnt very big espn coms mark schlabach explains how mr edwards ended up in boone just as mr edwards couldnt overcome the perception that he was too small to play quarterback at a big time school the wolverines wont be allowed to forget this game for years "michigan will not get over this for a long long time " michael rosenberg writes in the detroit free press "college football more than any other sport is a perception game the championship game matchup is decided at least in part by public opinion " nonetheless in a follow up column mr rosenberg attempts to separate perception from reality for instance one speedy mountaineers receiver is one of the fastest players in the country the reality that appalachian state is better than a few dozen div i a teams should also help michigan coach lloyd carr keep his job until he voluntarily steps down "carr wants a successor who respects the tradition and legacy of the program while winning most of his games in an ever evolving cutthroat sport " mr rosenberg writes "that is what carr has done " if that doesnt reassure michigan fans perhaps mgoblogs pictures of kittens and crying children will help or they can turn to the denver posts john henderson for an alternative for the sports biggest upset ever in his second major league start ever and possibly his final start of the season boston red sox year old rookie clay buchholz no hit the baltimore orioles on saturday night two days later boston globe columnist dan shaughnessy reviews the feat from all angles including the superstitious broadcasters the anxious general manager and the youngster at the center of it all "he didnt even look quite when he left the ballpark after yesterdays win " mr shaughnessy writes "buchholz granted one last round of no hit interviews then walked out of the clubhouse wearing a backpack that would have made any junior high schooler proud cooperstown meets high school musical only at fenway " the baltimore suns peter schmuck wonders how much worse things can get for the orioles who just days earlier had lost to the texas rangers the os have lost of overall "i know my heart swelled watching that kid being mobbed by his teammates " mr schmuck writes "it was sports entertainment at its best even if it happened at the expense of a team that already has been humbled enough the orioles arent without a certain twisted entertainment value of their own i for one cant wait to see what happens next " phil mickelson was at fenway to catch the buchholz no hitter then he outdueled tiger woods on monday to win the deutsche bank championship in norton mass "its been a long time since boston witnessed a tee party like this " gary van sickle writes on golf com "with apologies to zach johnson angel cabrera padraig harrington and every other winner this year labor day at the deutsche bank championship blew them all away this was golfs finest hour in weve waited years for a tiger vs phil rivalry to really blossom or at least take center stage monday those dreams came true " the beijing olympics next summer wont be as easy for team usa as was the fiba americas championship clinched by kobe bryant and co in las vegas on sunday michael wilbon cautions in the washington post "unlike the last two weeks there will be plenty of teams in china whose players believe they can beat the united states " mr wilbon writes "not only has the intimidation factor been lost forever international teams now cant wait to play team usa no matter whos in uniform
