for montana sect cellphones send mixed message hutterite colony allows technology for work elsie asks how r u martinsdale mont elsie wipf lives a simple life picking vegetables sewing clothes for her brothers and sisters and butchering chickens she also goes to church every day and knits slippers in her spare time that is when she isnt sending her friends text messages like "btw how r u day " the year old ms wipf who got her first cellphone three months ago is a hutterite the roughly members of the anabaptist christian group living in colonies in the northern u s plains and in canada are related to the amish they strive to live lives built on faith and family they grow their own food make their own clothes and shun many practices of the outside world but unlike the amish who live mostly unplugged the hutterites embrace technology as long as they feel it improves their colonies farming equipment is allowed for instance tv sets and other entertaining electronic equipment arent now that cheap cellphones have come to rural areas the question is being asked throughout the roughly hutterite colonies are cellphones useful answers differ a colony outside winnipeg manitoba allows just five cellphones and they are shared by people the warden colony in washington bought its combine drivers bluetooth wireless headsets to talk while tilling the colonys acres in martinsdale cellphones are dividing families ms wipf says that she sent more than text messages in the first two days after she got her phone much to the consternation of her father his opinion matters greatly he is the head preacher of the colony "its against our rules " ms wipf explains hutterites named after jacob hutter who was burned as a heretic in had for years banned conventional telephones many homes didnt even have indoor plumbing but although hutterites still speak in their own german dialect their colonies have changed with the introduction of advances like tractors and automobiles cellphones have had a different effect the array of available devices with different accessories goes against the communal colony dynamic features such as cameras and internet access which are banned or severely restricted in nearly all colonies open up a tantalizing window to the outside world "they can phone whoever they want " says a colony elder "and have somebody pick em up and go places where they shouldnt go " in this year old colony miles northwest of billings the residents are members of the lehrerleut branch the most conservative of the four types of hutterites the neutral colored metal buildings including four apartment complexes a church and barns for hogs chickens cows and turkeys dot a small section of the acres of hilly farmland each of the families got individual land lines for the first time in november cellphones began to appear here nearly a decade ago and have slowly made their way into the hand sewn pockets of the residents between cellphones provided by the colony and those supplied by outsiders a total count is hard to come by its somewhere between six and depending on whom you ask just six of the phones are paid for by the colony the rest are spirited in by residents paul wipf elsies father carries one of the colony sanctioned cellphones he uses it to do business but mr wipf says cellphones in his colony have gone "too far " they can be a distraction and of great concern a link to the outside world that makes leaving the colony easier mr wipf has yet to enforce strict rules on "illegal" cellphones or discipline users because he concedes "i dont think well ever get rid of them " the most obvious threat cellphones pose is to productivity the sprawling farming operation turns out pounds of milk to send every other day to meadow gold dairies and tons of potatoes that it sells each year to wal mart stores inc the fear is that more texting will mean less working ms wipf carries her cellphone most days as she does her chores she keeps it out of sight tucked safely into the folds of her long skirt weeding a row of beets by herself in the acre vegetable garden gives her a chance to get in a few text messages over the course of a month ms wipf sends hundreds of text messages occasionally exceeding her allotment of alltel corp is her service provider she texts mostly within the colony but also sends messages to friends and family elsewhere "shes constantly on the cellphone and not doing what shes supposed to be doing " said mary wipf her mother one sunday recently elsie laughed off the jab as she jumped up to get a glass of water for her brother cellphones also upset a social order that blurs differences between individuals the hutterites communal lifestyle means everybody owns everything and nobody owns anything they wear the same garb eat together in one dining room and live in cookie cutter apartments the colony elders distribute things by family from handmade furniture to haagen dazs mint chip ice cream to pay for cellphones not provided by the colony hutterites seek outside help ms wipfs cellphone an lg ax was furnished to her by a brother who left the colony more than a decade ago other women tap their ex hutterite boyfriends who have left the colony to earn money and live on their own the beckoning oil fields where many of the teenage boys go pay as much as &# an hour according to one hutterite typically they come back to the colony after a few years to get married some of their new discretionary income pays for their girlfriends cellphones the setup allows men to stay in contact with the colony and gives the women a peek at life on the outside rita wipf a colony resident has such a boyfriend outside who pays for her cellphone she sends more than text messages a month including a recent one to her best friend elsie wipf no relation that read like a typical young persons lament "it is so boring here at home " the year old believes cellphones are a natural addition to the colony "as the world changes we change too " she says men in the colony who want cellphones use work connections with non hutterites to get them several years ago mike kleinsasser the colonys electrician grew tired of standing in line to use the communitys only phone tucked inside an elders house mr kleinsasser asked an electric company representative for one and had a cellphone within a week "if youre a businessman you have to have one " he says for teenage boys cellphones can be a pathway to life outside the colony carnie wipf elsies year old nephew watched many of his friends take off for the oil fields and thanks to his cellphone got blow by blow accounts of their adventures going to movies watching tv and buying clothes he knew he could have a job waiting for him and that he could make &# an hour more than five times his monthly allowance in the colony so last april carnie wipf hitched a ride into billings with other colony members in town he split from the group and said he would find his way back that night he used his cellphone to call his mother and tell her he had left the colony with no immediate plans to return would he have left without a cellphone "the honest truth im not sure " carnie said carnie whose late father was a blacksmith at the colony cuts steel at a local manufacturer and delivers pizza at night he misses calving and harvesting but finds comfort in his friends all of whom are ex hutterites with cellphones he uses his cellphone to call his mom every day "she wants to know how is life on the outside and i tell her going real well " but he adds "the grass is not as green as i figured it would be "
