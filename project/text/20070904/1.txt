a cultural conversation with adrian benepe meet new york citys official green thumb new york they were standing beside the van cortlandt swimming pool in the bronx at the beginning of summer but only one city employee had brought his bathing suit and jumped right in why not he is in charge of an organization with acres of parkland tennis courts baseball fields golf courses recreation centers stadiums and beaches employees and a billion dollars to spend in this fiscal year he sits on cultural and recreational boards is responsible for all of the citys parks and recreation facilities and still has time to be one of new yorks most popular commissioners his name is adrian benepe and he was fully clothed when i spoke with him recently his office in the arsenal building at fifth avenue and th street was crammed with photographs pictures medals and mementos i dont think i was expecting to meet such a boyish looking year old although i knew of course that he was chosen by michael bloomberg to be his parks and recreation commissioner almost five years ago when mr benepe was a vice president of the municipal arts society mr benepe charmingly assured me he was not the mayors first choice his first job in the department was as a high school summer employee whose job it was to pick up trash in a park on the lower east side this meant squeezing thousands of empty beer cans into holes in the sidewalk through which they floated on down to the east river he remembers word for word the official welcome speech he received from his immediate supervisor "kid let me tell you how things are run around here you are supposed to come in at a m but you can arrive at a m theres a half hour break for lunch but you can take an hour and a half you can leave at p m not p m and be sure to warn me if you see the foreman coming " but that was as mr benepe likes to point out "and those were the bad old days when the parks department was in a state of serious disarray " his next job there shortly after getting out of college was working as a member of the newly established cadre of park rangers set up by the then commissioner to educate the public give tours maintain security enforce park rules and generally act as roving goodwill ambassadors "i was a kid patrolling the park with a walkie talkie and explaining to people in a nice way why they couldnt play softball in sheeps meadow once it was fixed up " one day he got into conversation with an elderly man who proceeded to expound his theory as to why the city had gone so calamitously downhill in the s it was because it had abandoned its parks to thugs and vandals and the only path to recovery lay in reclaiming this huge resource for the use and enjoyment of ordinary city residents this insight proved to be one of those defining "ah ha" moments for mr benepe and more than years later the notion that parks are what civilize and transform a city into a desirable place to live is still front and center in his philosophy sounding every inch the new yorker that he is adrian benepe is convinced that the parks of this city are "more vital than anywhere else in america " he goes on to assert that given the greater number of high rise buildings and sheer density of the population new yorkers are dependent on the parks not only for recreational but also for social and even political life "take even a tiny little triangle like abingdon square in greenwich village if you fix it up and make it green suddenly it becomes a magnet for people if on the other hand its allowed to become gray and grimy it becomes just the opposite a haven for drug dealers " for him new york citys parks function almost like a secular church becoming magnets in time of crisis he cites union square which became the citys epicenter following he also recalls the tens of thousands of people who came to central park following the death of john lennon mr benepe stayed as a park ranger for almost three years and then returned to school to get a masters in journalism at columbia shortly after receiving his graduate degree he was invited to come back as deputy program director for the park rangers a post he held from to at which point henry stern who succeeded gordon davis as parks commissioner hired him to be his press secretary two years later when he "couldnt take it any more " mr stern sent him off to work for the first deputy commissioner who later appointed him head of the newly formed natural resources and horticulture division mr benepe credits this with radically changing his mind set about undeveloped parkland "for years the conventional wisdom was that if you could just get enough money the thing to do was come in and cut everything down and turn the place into a football or baseball field " now however he began to appreciate that undeveloped parkland offered the city essential natural habitats for salt marshes fresh water wetlands meadows and deep woods all needing to be preserved wearing his horticultural hat he also got a sense of how badly the department was doing in terms of ornamental gardens trees in the park went unpruned and there were fewer than gardeners to serve all of the citys parks one of his accomplishments was to persuade mr stern to reestablish a job category of assistant gardener and begin a program to hire younger people today in addition to outsourcing much of the work to nurseries there are full time employees working on trees and forestry there are also full time gardeners as well as privately funded gardeners who work in central park and prospect park warrie price head of the battery conservancy compliments mr benepe on being the first truly horticultural commissioner in modern times as an example she recounts that when he visited the bosque garden in battery park for the first time a big grin came over his face when he felt the crushed stone under his feet instead of asphalt and he told her that his feet could always tell him when he was in a garden mr benepe is now the head of a parks and recreation department that is on a roll over the past five years more than acres of new parkland have been acquired for public use and the department has its largest budget ever for new capital projects expanding park facilities renovating the waterfront and increasing open space are all part of his mandate from the mayor there has not been such staff such financial resources since the s a time generally considered to be the golden age of parks construction under the aegis of robert moses during the past years the department probably more so than any other city agency has developed and sustained various models of public private cooperative partnership best known is the central park conservancy which raised &# million last year but there are many other partnerships each in its own way remarkable for its flexibility and level of cooperation every relationship be it with the high line which will turn an elevated railroad spur stretching miles along manhattans west side into a public park randalls island sports foundation or the battery conservancy reflects an understanding that for parks and recreation facilities to be responsive to the neighborhoods in which they exist community support is as important as outside financial resources mr benepe has his critics local residents want him to reopen the la guardia recreation center on the lower east side and there have been raised eyebrows at bryant parks being closed to the public during fashion week there have even been lawsuits to stop the redevelopment of washington square and curtail private school use of randalls island playing fields during after school hours but the commissioner has persuasive answers to his critics and whether it be to mediate the brouhaha that arose with some of the residents of fifth ave over the nesting habits of pale male and his mate lola or to be the mayors point person for christos gates project in central park making sure it did not take place during bird migration season or to set up a mountain bike course in inwood park or to spearhead a program to plant one million trees within the next years or to encourage the central park conservancy to take responsibility for four historic harlem parks mr benepe is always on the move and what does he plan to do when his term of office ends the commissioner laughs "we have approximately days and a lot to get done so the mayor doesnt give me much time to think about anything else " its true that with so much money to spend and a public increasingly concerned about green issues times are good and not just busy but even though hes ready to jump in a public pool to signal the beginning of summer mr benepe doesnt strike me as the sort of person who will ever have much time for lazing around ms garmey writes on gardening for the journal
