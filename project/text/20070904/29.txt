gdf suez deal sets up eu paris fight national governments regulators in brussels vie over energy policy after months of wrangling state controlled utility gaz de france sa and domestic rival suez sa agreed to a merger yesterday but the deal they sealed sets up a potentially bigger fight between the european union and national governments over who drives energy policy the merger will create an energy giant with billion euros &# billion in revenue and a market capitalization of about billion euros in which the french government will hold a direct stake of but by recreating a quasimonopoly under government control paris is bumping up against the objective of the european commission which is seeking to foster greater competition by busting up entrenched national interests in the energy sector the deal highlights how the eu and many of its member states are working at cross purposes as they seek to come up with a viable energy policy eu officials have long decried the power held by "national champion" energy companies and the paucity of choices available to most consumers that situation eu regulators say is to blame for high prices however many national governments are more concerned about locking in future supplies of crucial commodities such as natural gas than about creating competition while the european commission the blocs executive arm has tried to rip open the european energy market national governments have pushed back by trying to cut deals to bulk up their own energy giants france for example has stubbornly resisted efforts to open up its own electricity market which is still dominated by government controlled electricite de france sa earlier this year italys enel spa beat out germanys e on to win control of spains second largest utility endesa sa creating europes second largest largest utility by market capitalization after edf that deal which had the blessing of both the italian and spanish governments shares control of endesa with spanish conglomerate acciona sa "energy is a strategic sector in all countries " gdf chairman jean francois cirelli said in response to questions about the french states involvement in the sector "its the main driver of an economy " mr cirelli said french households and companies would benefit not suffer from the creation of an enlarged company because the gdf suez combination will have more firepower to buy cheaper natural gas a fuel for which europe is increasingly dependent on supply from russia the merger was first announced in february designed to shield suez from a possible hostile takeover bid by enel but the hastily cobbled marriage ran into regulatory hurdles because it required passing a law to allow for a privatization of gdf the deal languished until suez late last week agreed to terms put forth by french president nicolas sarkozy that required suez to spin off most of its water and waste management operations and merge its natural gas and electricity business with gdfs the spinoff will help reduce the size of suez which has risen more quickly than gdf in recent months and proceed with what is billed as a quasimerger of equals suez shareholders will receive gdf shares for every suez shares tendered suez chairman gerard mestrallet will become chairman and chief executive of the enlarged group mr cirelli the gdf chairman will be vice chairman and vice ceo of gdf suez the european commission has taken a variety of tacks to break up the influence of energy giants from pursuing antitrust enforcement against major companies to pushing deregulation orders that make it possible for companies to compete across boarders its effort will continue later this month when it unveils its next energy proposal options under consideration include the separation of energy production from distribution known as "unbundling" to make it harder for an integrated energy giant to impede a smaller competitor from using its transmission network or the establishment of independent operators to control access to networks the eus push faces substantial resistance and countries are divided on how much change should be forced those with more competitive markets britain for instance favor unbundling opposition is strong in france and germany where energy giants flourish and national politicians dont want to see brussels force changes or regulations that would weaken companies that command substantial local interest and employ vast numbers of their citizens elsewhere the eu must confront the fear that truly open energy markets will invite unwanted participation from outsiders particularly russia and lead to concerns over the security of the blocs energy supply the eus competition commissioner neelie kroes a strong proponent of unbundling conducted an inquiry into the energy sector and has shown no hesitation in using antitrust tools to try to force open energy markets
