newly recruited successor at praters foods inc the small food manufacturer he has led and controlled since "the management change begins immediately" while the controlling stake in the company will be sold to mr fields over the next year or so the year old executive told colleagues they were crowded into the conference room at its noisy one story plant here where the holiday foods specialist churns out items such as sliced ham dinners baked turkey and stuffings vowing to slow down mr chenoweth said he would be in by a m and gone by p m several staffers who considered him a patriarchal workaholic because of his frequent hour weeks chuckled in disbelief things didnt turn out exactly as he predicted mr fields worked for four months as an unpaid consultant until mr chenoweth relinquished the presidency in december but mr chenoweth gave himself a new title chief executive today the former president still toils long hours and still makes most of the big financial decisions he is unsure when he will sell his stake in the company which collects about &# million in annual revenue "it takes a special person to work with me " he admits in a heavy texan drawl pointing to his chest then adding with a laugh "it takes patience " he hands a visitor his card it still reads chip chenoweth president giving up command is never easy but it may prove especially difficult for the large number of retiring baby boomers accustomed to working hard in a fast paced economy the oldest among them will turn next year and will begin to face the difficulties involved with passing the baton even gradual power transfers can create troubles for veterans in top posts the executives often neglect to spell out clear lines of authority in the interim they resist setting a departure date and they wrestle with the fear and anxiety that losing their title will make them a previously important person many dont make adequate retirement plans how long a transition lasts "is irrelevant if the trust isnt there between the outgoing and incoming leaders " says christina williams a principal at atiara group an executive coaching firm that counseled mr chenoweth and mr fields until this past june failed power switches litter the business landscape j c penney co abruptly fired its chief operating officer in december after just five months because the industry newcomer didnt learn fast enough how to be

john k hanson the late chairman and founder of winnebago industries inc famously ousted his own son plus six others from the chief executives post over a year period to occasionally stepping in himself in between many aging chiefs choose to move on slowly and want to do their part to ease the transition and shape their legacy more than half of the coaches at marshall goldsmith partners llc are seeing increased demand from senior leaders for advice on a gradual transition at small employers as well as big according to the coaching network mr chenoweth used a coach even though he had known mr fields an ex praters supplier for almost years "i wanted to make sure dorsey and i would be able to work well together during the transition " he explains he also hoped the new executive would transform praters a specialist in holiday foods for grocery chains into a year round operation without destroying its close knit culture "were very different people " agrees mr fields now the laconic and lanky mr chenoweth a former cowboy is something of a worrier and focuses so hard on the nitty gritty of his daily business that he occasionally tries to fix broken office printers the voluble mr fields knows how to relax and keeps his eye on the big picture he is enjoying himself so much helping to run the prepared food plant that he has added another pounds to his pound frame since coming to praters adapting to each others style has required frequent feedback and compromises mr fields worked for his familys food business and nestle before launching a producer of soups and sauces which he sold in late "youve got a guy who will rock praterss world is that what you want " dr williams asked mr chenoweth at the outset "yup " he replied "thats what praters needs " some of his lieutenants werent so sure they distrusted mr fields a cleveland transplant who acts fast "you could see their eyes get big with panic when he unveiled the shift to year round production " dr williams remembers "under chips leadership it had been nice predictable steady growth " the head of sales quit partly because he disliked the new presidents rapid changes "i believe in building rome in a day " mr fields says with fervor but in a conservative texas workplace like praters he admits "i had to set a different tempo for my actions " the shift in pace improved the new bosss image as did joining fellow executives for three days in assembling frozen dinner boxes last fall after temporary workers failed to show up "it was degrees up here " he recalls breathing hard as he climbs steep metal steps to the assembly area benny cousatte the general manager says "dorsey won some people over when they saw hes not going to just sit behind a desk " at times mr chenoweth raised a fuss over how his no was carrying out his overhaul mandate he opposed mr fieldss introduction of six new or revamped products including a pricey italian meatloaf "i told him nobody could afford it " the ceo recalls when one major grocery chain balked at the items stiff price he got mr fields to develop a cheaper meatloaf too both are selling well mr fields says since his arrival mr fields has rolled out new products at praters as part of its shift to year round production in addition to the meatloaf new products include cajun fried chicken and side dishes such as italian peppers and onions in a spicy marinara sauce mr chenoweth had trouble letting go of the reins he says he called headquarters about times during the first long weekend he took off a month after mr fields arrived "i wanted to make sure everything was all right " he explains mr chenoweth insists he chases associates from his office who pose questions that mr fields should handle "but if somebody comes to me to make a decision i still have the tendency to make it " he concedes "its hard for me to not jump in and correct" problems nor would mr chenoweth let mr fields dismiss a supervisor for making a major mistake last winter the errant staffer ordered costly stainless steel racks without management approval mr fields says he favors firing anyone who "is not cutting the mustard " but when he informed his boss about the excess spender the praters leader said "i dont want this guy to lose his job over this this was not maliciously done " mr fields instead reprimanded the man mr chenoweth asked him not to terminate anyone for poor performance during his first year twice as long as he initially requested the two executives settle serious disagreements behind closed doors heeding a suggestion from dr williams they brainstorm about broader issues every week or so their two hour sessions occur during weekend stints at the office "how much longer do you want me around " mr chenoweth always asks mr fields urges him to stay "as long as you want " satisfied with how well his heir apparent weathered his inaugural year mr chenoweth has begun to pull back more he now works hours a week of the three key steps that dr williams advocates for smooth executive transitions the men have successfully taken two aligning their views of the companys future and talking through their differences but mr chenoweth hasnt decided when he will hand over total control of an enterprise in which he invested a lot of his life soul and wallet he is a pilot who dreams of building a plane someday but he admits that a lack of a long term plan is part of the reason he doesnt have an end date at work "its kind of fluid " he says he may give mr fields the ceo title next year and sell his stake in "the bottom line is do i trust dorsey or not to carry on the answer is i can " mr chenoweth notes pounding his small brown desk hard with the sides of his hands he adds "you cant forever be in transition "
