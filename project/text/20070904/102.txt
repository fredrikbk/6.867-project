helped place in a private home thats about minutes from his home "we wrestle and play tag and thats quite a workout " he says "if i can i do that every day " the diet "i eat very little while playing in a tournament " he says "im sharper that way i guess you could even say im hungrier " mr watkinson eats cereal or an omelet in the mornings most tournaments start at noon and players are allowed to eat at the card table and are also given a dinner break at the table mr watkinson might eat a banana or energy bar or nibble on nuts he wont eat a meal during the dinner break "a lot of people go out and have a huge dinner after theyve been playing for eight hours and then they come back tired and with a full stomach " he says "your concentration is blown " alcoholic drinks are also served to players at the table but mr watkinson abstains "ive gotten to the point where im pretty much over drinking " he says "it wears me out " he and his fiance had signed up for a diet meal delivery service

bought me two pairs two christmases ago and one pair is still in the box " he says the effort mr watkinsons job doesnt necessarily lend itself to a healthy lifestyle some poker tournaments can run late and occasionally hell find himself up until a m which makes waking up to run challenging "even if i feel tired before i start i know how good i will feel once i get warmed up " says mr watkinson "and how much better i will feel for the rest of the day " strength training takes more motivation "it is the only part of staying healthy i dont really enjoy " he says "and so i usually dont do it until later in the day " mr watkinson believes his exercise also helps him deal with stress in life and at the table as he advances deeper into big tournaments he starts to feel the pressure "the finalist table at the world series main event was really stressful " he says "first prize was &# million if you win that youre like poker immortality and this is the main event of the whole season it was the most stress ive ever felt at the poker table " when mr watkinson first started playing poker smoking was allowed in casinos "it was disgusting you would go home and the smell wouldnt leave "
