shine some light on government funded clinical drug trials i was surprised by the anti capitalist undercurrent of scott gottliebs attack on comparative effectiveness clinical trials "the war on expensive drugs " editorial page aug when i took economics it was axiomatic that efficient markets required consumers to pursue their own economic interests like choosing less expensive drugs if they provide the same or better therapeutic benefits as more expensive options unfortunately todays pharmaceutical marketplace operates inefficiently because it doesnt provide consumers or prescribing physicians the information needed for medically or economically rational decision making the comparative effective trials authorized in the childrens health insurance bill would help eliminate this information gap dr gottlieb brackets his defense of marketplace inefficiency by complaining about secrecy and the selective interpretation of government funded clinical trials thats as inexcusable as when companies do it thats why consumer groups have been pushing for full transparency of all clinical trials from their initial registration to the posting of their final results dr gottliebs case would have been stronger had he endorsed that aspect of the fda reform legislation now moving through congress merrill goozner director integrity in science project center for science in the public interest washington in what might be called "the art of medicine vs the government " dr gottlieb nails it again on the journal editorial page as he has in the past "drug danger " april and "journalistic malpractice " may its just too bad that the problems with government sponsored prescription drug research are complicated dr gottlieb identified poor study design lack of transparency in sharing study results interpretation bias clarity about clinical differences vs statistical differences clinical differences are the ones that matter most and failure to include study findings that he correctly characterized as relevant to "real world medical decisions " but these issues are well complicated and policy wonks dont do "complicated" very well what they do well is promote their idea of what is good for the ignorant misled and uninformed public dr gottlieb has correctly described the policy goal as "imposing limits on prescribing " and he is right to characterize that goal as not being "about medical discovery but bean counting " maybe george w bush will get the word and veto the reauthorization of schip state childrens health insurance program if it arrives at his desk in its present "malignant" condition steve barnes roswell ga we read dr gottliebs commentary with considerable interest his underlying theme seems to be that we cannot assume that government sponsored clinical research and particularly its interpretation are unbiased especially if there are dollars to be saved in other government programs dr gottlieb addresses the governments new comparative effectiveness agenda which now may include hundreds of millions of new research dollars for evaluating the health care costs and outcomes associated with different medical treatments particularly pharmaceuticals since its been long stated by critics that industry sponsored research cannot be completely trusted what are we to do clearly we need better scientific evidence as to what works best and whats good value in terms of improving health outcomes for money in health care it seems to us the solution is clear government funded research and interpretation need to be fully open for critical peer review by independent and stakeholder experts from any sector including manufacturers at all stages of the process similarly funded research by private industry would be well advised to follow suit then perhaps we would have less rancor and better supportable scientific evidence for informing clinical and public policy and the health and well being of the public would be better served bryan r luce ph d m b a senior vice president science policy dennis a revicki ph d senior vice president health outcomes united biosource corp bethesda md
