new forecast for climate debate consensus on emission cuts takes shape but debate turns to who will pay a consensus that the world should pursue vastly bigger cuts in fossil fuel emissions is likely to emerge from a flurry of global warming diplomacy in coming weeks negotiators touted that view at a climate conference last week in austria and they are likely to echo it at other gatherings this autumn but that merely tees up the real debate who will pay for the cuts as the diplomats wrangle evidence is mounting that a force beyond governments control may be doing more than regulations to slow emissions growth high energy prices the latest sign came in a report last week from environmental defense a new york environmental advocacy group it said high gasoline prices caused palpable changes in consumption in the u s in the most recent year the report studied average carbon dioxide emissions from new u s vehicles fell that year "a decline not seen in nearly two decades " the report said growth slowed significantly in both total driving in the u s and in total carbon dioxide emissions from all vehicles on the road carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas is produced when fossil fuel such as petroleum is burned in an engine globally annual greenhouse gas emissions are projected to rise more than by the middle of the century the coming climate negotiations will stretch from a meeting this week of the asia pacific economic cooperation forum in sydney to back to back sessions later this month organized by the united nations in new york and the bush administration in washington to a big u n gathering in december in indonesia the goal of the meetings is to come up with a climate change agreement that will succeed the kyoto protocol that treaty which was negotiated a decade ago and mandates emissions cuts through has had mixed results the kyoto treaty requires emissions cuts only from industrialized countries that ratified it and it requires them to cut their emissions to only a collective below levels by it has spawned a multibillion dollar trade in "carbon credits " a market in which countries and companies in them that are obligated to cut their emissions can trim their compliance costs by bankrolling cheaper emission reducing projects in the developing world developing countries such as china are where emissions are increasing fastest but those countries face no caps under kyoto a fact that industry in most developed countries argues puts it at a competitive disadvantage many industrialized countries that signed up for emission caps under kyoto are finding it politically painful to follow through now with most scientists saying the world would have to cut emissions by far more than kyotos to avoid the worst potential effects of global warming the diplomatic tussle over who gets hit with the burden is about to get nastier diplomats concluded last weeks u n sponsored climate meeting in vienna with a statement saying industrialized countries should aspire to cut their emissions to to below levels by that statement is nonbinding and it leaves unanswered how the burden would be apportioned among specific countries industries and consumers this weeks climate conference in sydney is likely to highlight the unresolved questions the nations in apec include the worlds three biggest energy users the u s china and russia and together the apec nations account for about of global energy demand in a speech last week in sydney australian prime minister john howard called for "a new international agreement" on global warming that includes "a long term aspirational goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions " according to a transcript of his address yet he criticized the kyoto treaty as "a recipe for a structurally flawed and ineffective global response to climate change " noting it demands cuts only from developed countries a future global warming push should include "all economies " he said but it also should ensure "flexibility and respect for national circumstance " on the same day harlan watson senior climate negotiator in the bush administration expressed essentially the same sentiment to the u n meeting in vienna like australia the u s declined to ratify kyoto largely on the grounds that the treatys mandated emission cuts would hurt the nations competitiveness also like australia the u s is preparing to host a climate policy conference this month a meeting that will include both developed and developing countries mr watson said the administration hopes the diplomats it gathers in washington will pursue "a long term global goal nationally defined mid term goals and strategies and sector based approaches" to curb emissions according to a state department transcript of his remarks terms such as "nationally defined" and "sector based" are becoming part of the lexicon of international climate talks the unspoken message countries and industries are girding to push as much as possible of the burden for the coming environmental cleanup onto their competitors
