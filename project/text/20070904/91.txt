the naacp at a crossroads the highlight of the naacp convention in detroit this summer was a symbolic burial ceremony for the n word in other words the nations oldest largest and once fierce champion of civil rights has been reduced to staging publicity stunts there once was a time when the naacp was ably led by the likes of roy wilkins and undoubtedly nonpartisan political office holders and front runners for president democrats and republicans would look for chances to address its large assemblage of mostly black americans today gop politicians avoid the organization like a plague naacp chairman julian bond once likened the republican party to the "taliban " former ceo kweisi mfume openly boasted of naacp efforts to defeat republicans and then there was bruce gordon an ex verizon executive who became president of the naacp in june a choice heralded or derided as an attempt to moderate the organizations extremism and to make a bid for support from big corporations that once shunned funding civil rights campaigns mr gordon resigned months into the job blasting the naacps old guard lay leaders for being wedded to an outdated structure and accusing an oversized board of directors of day to day meddling with his management his words had a stinging impact on fund raising even as he left behind a pile of the debt his fund raising prowess was supposed to erase now the naacp is in dire straits financial and otherwise it is cutting some of its staff including the youth coordinators the organizations senior leaders once proclaimed to be the bridge to the so called hip hop generation as well as the organizations future but the naacps leadership does not understand that it cant have it both ways instructing urban black youths on the one hand that their street lingo is objectionable and on the other expecting to recruit these types into its ranks when it tries the naacp comes off as simply counterfeit worse the shifting of its purposes from an interracial and integrationist organization to one aimed at airing racial grievances threatens the naacp with oblivion for more than a decade no one at the top has uttered the "i word" for fear of alienating young blacks who were segregating themselves on campuses instead the organization began identifying with ghetto blacks who deified skin color and lashed out at "uncle toms" and others whose moral behavior and speech patterns displayed middle class values the naacps rank and file also seems hell bent on romanticizing the warped values and mindset of the obstinate subgroup of young blacks that cora daniels calls "ghettonation " there has been no general alarm issued much less a call to arms to save these very black youths from their patterns of illiteracy welfare dependency criminality and social dysfunction instead while an entire generation of young blacks has been weaned on racial difference racial rhetoric and racial chauvinism the naacp went silent with these compromises and forfeits of core principles the naacp is down in membership down in funds down in glory and accomplishments but not "down" with inner city black youth it is at a crossroads and unless it makes the right choices and wise decisions it may shrivel up and die what choices first the naacp must reclaim its mission as a racial healer rebutting the crazed racial slander of militants who want to keep our nation divided into racial camps bantustan like political districts and racially pure neighborhoods black politicians must be encouraged to follow the fashion of the likes of barack obama and compete for white support and not just black votes white and hispanic and other pols should be encouraged to run to represent "minority districts" too second the naacp should recommit itself to inculcating solid middle class values and aspirations in the young its greatest successes occurred when proud middle class people led intelligent efforts to persuade the american people about the moral rot of segregation as a way of life third the naacp must make public education the civil rights issue of our times everything else will fall into place if young blacks overcome illiteracy stay in school and are inculcated with a love for learning and for the pursuit of excellence instead of trained to accept mediocrity and quotas as a means of social advancement holding school authorities accountable including black teachers and black dominated school boards such as in newark n j and washington d c must be the priority that means tutoring pupils and coaching teachers so that they pass standardized competency tests and eschewing notions that such examinations are "culturally biased " a revamped naacp should not accept any alibis for blacks academic underachievement it would take the lead in answering those black educators and their paternalistic allies who develop ghetto industries for grants and careers explaining blacks deficits it would confront separatist schemes such as "black paradigms" of learning and ebonics as the language of africans in america and the naacp should urge black americans at long last to drop their hyphenated african roots we are several hundred years out of africa and unless we are recent immigrants our connection to the african continent is not only minimal but mostly pretense and posturing the modern civil rights agenda must have a more compelling americanization base to it a liberating leap from the trap of race the only practicable way to integrate in america is to personally overcome and cross the constructs and demarcations of race and to personally defeat the habits and prejudices of communities and groups to live work marry and socialize only with "their own kind " only when we become neighbors to every person of every hue and remove the racial blinders from americans eyes and minds will we be able to deal with the considerable problems of racial profiling disparate criminal sentences and housing segregation if the naacps leaders are listening their successful resurgence as a proud and powerful civil rights lobby will require bold steps to deracialize and depoliticize their rhetoric and to the extent they succeed the echo of roy wilkinss voice will be resonant "steer our naacp ship steady as she goes " mr meyers is executive director of the new york civil rights coalition and a former assistant national director of the naacp see related letter "letters to the editor the naacp is still what it has always been" wsj sept
