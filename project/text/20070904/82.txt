tax law would shackle german businesses i enjoyed stephen moores column on the effects of tax rates on investment and growth around the world especially the recent developments in europe "reaganomics " editorial page aug i think it is a bit premature however to add germany to the ranks of the true reaganomics converts i would instead say germany is taking an approach that might be better described as reaganomics as part of its recent tax reform germany included a provision that will tax companies who move their businesses or employees out of germany with a "toll charge" equal to the value of what is moved the application of this law is still largely unclear but this provision will clearly serve to handcuff any business to the yoke of high cost germany in the future it would tax anyone whose business model changed in the future and who wanted to move its production or distribution business out of germany to some lower cost location such as romania even if their customers all moved out of germany and the future of the business in germany was declining as companies are deciding every day where to invest this law would make it impossible for anyone to recommend more investment in germany because if you ever wanted to move for any reason you would have to pay a tax charge on the "value" of what was moved even if you had no actual sale generating any cash to pay the tax there are many who believe this law has serious eu legal problems and it may eventually be rescinded or overturned but i think it is a good example of a mindset in germany that remains far from the real heart of what reagan started years ago todd behrend atlanta
