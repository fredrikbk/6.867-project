safety agency mattel clash over disclosures amid two high profile toy recalls this summer mattel inc has said its highest priority is protecting children by pulling defective products off store shelves as soon as hazards emerge but the companys own definition of such a timely response differs sharply from the governments as mattel openly acknowledges the consumer product safety commission says that manufacturers must report all claims of potentially hazardous product defects within hours with few exceptions mattel in at least three major cases since the late s including last months recall of nearly million playsets studded with potentially dangerous magnets took months to gather information in two of the cases it collected scores of complaints for months before disclosing them to the agency at times mattel officials have considered possible remedies for defects before making an initial report to the agency disclosing safety concerns none of these recalled products have been implicated in any fatalities mattel chairman and chief executive robert eckert said in an interview that the company discloses problems on its own timetable because it believes both the law and the commissions enforcement practices are unreasonable mattel said it should be able to evaluate hazards internally before alerting any outsiders regardless of what the law says by mandating that companies immediately report any incident that could conceivably expose a hazard the commissions "standard might apply to almost anything " mr eckert said "its very easy for anyone to apply the word could backward " he added the cpsc doesnt agree "its a statute its clear " said julie vallese the commissions spokeswoman referring to the hour rule yet enforcing such rules poses a challenge for the small agency which has limited resources and is only authorized to impose fines of less than &# million against companies that ms vallese says "think they can get away with delaying reporting " since the agency has twice fined the worlds largest toymaker for "knowingly" withholding information regarding problems that "created an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death " mattel settled the cases denying any wrongdoing or that the recalled toys had a defect now the commission is investigating the timeliness of the companys disclosures before its most recent recall at the same time internal cpsc documents raise questions about whether mattel has passed along information to regulators about possible recurring electrical problems with a recalled toy the company has declared fixed the clash raises questions about federal safety standards and the enforcement powers of the nations consumer safety agency with one of its three commission seats vacant since late last year due to a standoff between congress and the white house the cpsc has been hobbled in ordering recalls levying fines and updating safety rules in addition to toymakers it has come under fire in recent months for being too timid in dealing with other industries that make the roughly products under its purview senate majority whip dick durbin the illinois democrat who heads the subcommittee that oversees the agencys funding calls the cpsc a "toothless tiger " with an "inability to find offenders and change conduct " commission members havent commented on their recent dealings with mattel but ann brown who served as the agencys chairwoman until calls mattels position "fallacious and wrongheaded " children can be injured while the company takes its time investigating incidents under its own rules she said "its an inhumane way to approach this " mattel argues that raw incident reports too often have been blown out of proportion by the government and industry critics even hundreds of incidents dont automatically implicate the safety of a specific toy according to mr eckert "you have to put it in context " he said mattel isnt withholding anything from regulators he said adding that the only question is "whether we reported the issue in a timely manner " "we are allowed to investigate" before alerting the commission to consumer complaints he said adding that clarifying the issue of response time with agency regulators would avoid some of the conflicts that have plagued mattels relationship with them mattel isnt alone in its run ins with the commission a number of other large toymakers including hasbro inc mattels largest rival have been chastised by the cpsc for failing to promptly report problems and have paid millions of dollars in fines to the government under the current recall system which relies heavily on voluntary reporting by such companies in its settlement hasbro denied any wrongdoing mattels conflicts with the cpsc stretch back nearly a decade the company previously was fined &# million for failing to promptly report a fire hazard involving its power wheels line of motorized minicars designed to be ridden by children as young as years old ten million of the cars were pulled from the market in mattel knew about hundreds of problems with the toys electrical systems "yet did nothing for years " said ms brown then the agencys chairwoman after announcing the penalty in the commission said there were reports of fires involving the minicars and more than times as many reports of electrical components overheating melting short circuiting or failing mattels mr eckert says the company recalled the kiddie cars and agreed to pay the penalty to get the issue behind it "we investigate every fire we dont know of a single fire caused by power wheels " he said even so the company altered its power wheels line by installing a new fuse and other parts less than a year after paying the power wheels fine mattel again defied the commissions reporting rules in the fall of mattel began collecting a large number of reports involving its popular little people animal sounds farm this time the issue was the safety of screws used in the barnyard themed toys which could pose a hazard if swallowed in one case a screw had punctured the lung of a month old baby who had inhaled it the child required emergency surgery "it was not until march that the company reported the safety hazard" to the commission an agency investigation concluded the government discovered that mattel had collected earlier reports of loose screws before approaching regulators denying any wrongdoing the company signed a settlement in march agreeing to pay &# these settlements didnt resolve the underlying issue of timely reporting of possible safety defects say current and former commission officials "the agency has a real problem in finding out about dangerous products they know after company lawyers might know thats after a death or injury " said pamela gilbert the former executive director of the commission while defending mattels past actions company ceo mr eckert said "weve gotten better at understanding and investigating were generally able to report incidents sooner than previously " the issue of timely reporting however has cropped up anew in the latest round of recalls last november mattel recalled roughly two million figurines it marketed under the polly pocket brand because of high power magnets in the figurines that could fall off and tear through a childs stomach lining if swallowed over the next eight months the company collected an additional reports of problems with other toy lines studded with magnets before expanding its recall this summer to include an additional million toys it isnt clear how long mattel spent analyzing the reports before advising the cpsc and agency officials declined to comment because they are investigating the timing of mattels disclosures last week mr eckert said he couldnt remember when the company brought the complaints about the magnets to the attention of authorities safety problems involving mattels recalled toys and the disclosure of those incidents have at times continued to plague the company long after the problems were thought to be fixed according to internal commission documents gathered by neil chernoff a self described consumer advocate near atlanta who has collected documents on power wheels cases for several years cpsc staff believed that some of the ride on toys continued catching on fire nearly seven years after the initial recall the incidents prompted at least nine new investigations by the commission some of the victims informed mattel about fires and mattel paid some of them for losses but so far the company hasnt informed consumers of any hazard and according to the documents commission staff learned about many of these incidents from other sources the commission declined to comment on whether it plans to take action on the matter mr chernoff who battled mattel for years over the release of commission files under the freedom of information act said "the bottom line is that the documents show company officials never really fixed the problems otherwise how could they continue to have reports of fires " the commission documents describe some frightening scenes for example sonya deangelo a real estate agent from portland ore says she lost the detached garage in a house she rented when a power wheels truck she bought for &# caught on fire two hours after her grandson had gotten off the fire buckled the surrounding asphalt "the toy was completely melted except for the frame " she recalled though her landlord was insured ms deangelo was without renters insurance and says she couldnt afford an attorney to pursue legal action against mattel last year mattel paid her &# half of what ms deangelo had asked for to cover her losses according to an internal commission report ms deangelo notified mattel on march two days after the fire occurred that report which was prepared two months later identifies the toy as the cause of the fire but makes no mention of any information received from mattel mattel declined to comment on the specifics of the fire in other incidents the damage has been worse before dawn one summer morning in todd kelly a former national football league player and his family were startled awake by the sound of a smoke detector at his red brick home in knoxville tenn according to another internal commission report rushing into the garage mr kelly found his two cars along with his garage door engulfed in flames estimated damages exceeded &# the local fire department suspected that the fire originated from a red jeep wrangler power wheels toy that was being recharged inside the garage the report says the document also says that an electrical engineer hired by mr kellys insurance company determined that it appeared "the fire had started in the wiring harness of that toy " mr kelly couldnt be reached for comment mattel officials declined to comment on the case time lapses mattels toy recalls and trouble with the consumer product safety commission early mattel receives
