sony to challenge apple in tv movie downloads ceo stringer sees video as key to reclaiming title as no innovator tokyo two years after taking the helm of sony corp chief executive howard stringer is quietly preparing a big move to expand the company and challenge rival apple inc in an area that has thus far promised more than it has delivered video downloading services people familiar with the situation say mr stringer is planning to use sonys technology packed playstation and playstation portable videogame machines along with its bravia high definition televisions to develop products and services to let users download television shows and movies similar to the way they download music and videos using apples itunes store and ipods a sony spokesman declined to comment on the companys strategy as internet connections have become faster analysts have expected the next big potential market to be in downloading movies and television shows some analysts believe it could be significantly larger than the digital music market park associates a market research and consulting firm estimates that annual revenue from internet video including ad based and user paid services could exceed &# billion in the u s alone by apple offers video compatible ipod devices and the iphone along with downloadable television shows music videos and movies for purchase on its itunes store but analysts say theres no clear winner yet and the market is up for grabs "the real key is going to be who is providing the best high definition experience for viewers " says kurt scherf a park associates analyst who studied this market he adds that companies ranging from electronics makers to cable companies and content providers are all experimenting now in search of the best strategy establishing a dominant position in this area is crucial for sony whose walkman music devices lost out to apples ipods when sony failed to launch compelling music downloading software the move could also help boost lagging sales of the ps and psp videogame devices the ps in particular has been a big disappointment even though sony made a large investment in its development to build a state of the art machine sony which has spent the last few years restructuring has already been moving in this direction just last week the company unveiled a walkman for the u s market that for the first time can play movie trailers and music videos in addition to listening to music in a sign that sony might have given up at least for now on trying to beat apple in music it also said it was phasing out its music download service called connect and that the latest walkmans would use microsoft corp s windows media software earlier this year sony introduced a module for its u s television models that can download internet content it will roll out a similar device in japan this fall that will let consumers download videos from a number of internet services meanwhile sonys playstation unit last month launched new features for the ps and psp in europe that let consumers use their game machines to record television shows onto their pss and transfer them onto their psps but it faces huge challenges in this market for a start it will be competing with some of the most powerful names in global business in addition to apple microsoft has also been positioning its competing xbox device to be used for video downloading internet companies as well as television and movie studios cable companies and mobile operators are jockeying for a piece of the action apples set top device called apple tv which lets users play music and video from their computer based itunes library has not been selling strongly since it went on sale earlier this year analysts say since introducing video on itunes in october apple saw a big increase in video downloads for the first year but analysts say the number has tapered off recently in response an apple spokeswoman said "were the no video download store " still industry observers say sony has one possible advantage in its quest to a major player in the video downloading market content companies like movie studios may be wary of the way apple dominated the digital music market and may be more encouraged to work with another company especially one that owns a movie studio of its own and understands their concerns last week a dispute erupted into public view between apple and one of its biggest suppliers of television shows general electric co s nbc universal over pricing of television episodes and other issues as a result apple has vowed not to sell nbc programs from the coming season starting this month "weve been saying for years that if theres a company that can marry all this emerging content to products that people want its sony thats going to make it happen " says parks associates analyst mr scherf the foray into video downloading will be a crucial test for mr stringer who has succeeded in slashing costs at sony but must now prove he can also find new areas of growth since the failure of the walkman to beat the ipod sony has been struggling to come up with a new product that defines the industry standard in innovation it is also a test of whether mr stringer has succeeded in taming sonys fiercely independent corporate culture in the past the company has struggled to get its various units to cooperate with each other an area like video downloading would require extremely close teamwork among the electronics movie and videogame units mr stringer has recently appointed executives with a track record of cooperation one is kazuo hirai the new head of the playstation group who in june succeeded ken kutaragi the headstrong creator of the playstation mr stringer also expanded the role of an electronics executive katsumi ihara who sony officials say understands the importance of integrating compelling software with good hardware people familiar with the situation say mr stringer has been laying the groundwork in recent months to shift the companys focus to video downloading for example they say he decided to end sonys unsuccessful efforts to challenge apple in the music downloading business in order to focus on the new strategy in may mr stringer quietly decided to shut down the unit that was charged with creating a portable music player and online music service sony said thursday that the service would be phased out and the latest walkmans would use microsofts windows media software the people privy to sonys plans also say mr stringer over the protests of some executives personally enforced a decision to adopt certain digital rights management software that will eventually be used in all of sonys products that is an indication of how serious he is about making sure the companys various units come together to make this strategy a success they say nick wingfield contributed to this article
