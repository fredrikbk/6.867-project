business technology best of the business tech blog excerpts from recent entries at wsj coms tech blog cigna creates culture that makes data security everybodys business in most companies information security is the responsibility of one department and more often than not relegated to an afterthought cigna corp has figured out a way to create a culture where everyone is accountable for it craig shumard the health care companys chief information security officer isnt worried about the year old ukrainian hacker he can always buy technology to help secure the corporate network instead his biggest concern is well meaning employees who just dont consider the security implications of whatever it is they are doing there isnt a technology vendor in the world that can help with that the biggest problem for security organizations mr shumard tells the business technology blog is that the rest of the business just assumes that security isnt something they need to consider there is a dedicated security team after all cigna tried embedding security staff in each business unit but nothing changed three years ago mr shumard came up with a new idea make the business people responsible for security he drafted corporate vice presidents to be security champions these people spend of their time on security related issues and generally bring a security mindset to everything they do he also has information protection coordinators businesspeople from throughout the organization who spend of their time on security issues in each case security becomes part of the job description and is covered in performance reviews support from the highest levels in the organization is a prerequisite rewriting a vps job description isnt easy to do but mr shumard says that the program has been a revelation not only does his message get out to every level of the organization but "we probably get two three four good ideas every other week from these folks " he tells us "its a real gold mine for us " for example cigna used to prevent employees from sending automated out of office emails because it could have given a potential data thief valuable information but the security coordinators convinced mr shumard that this was hurting peoples ability to do business so he relaxed the restriction for selected users niche social networking takes off companies trying to figure out how to take

new social networking initiative makes headlines playboy enterprises inc last month announced plans for a new social networking site that will only be open to college students cafemom com a social networking site for moms says it had million unique visitors in july and just got &# million in funding even the central intelligence agency is getting in on the act launching a social networking site for its spies social networking first gained prominence when myspace inc burst on the scene several years ago giving anyone a chance to meet anyone else but now the trend is toward niche sites how niche there are social networks for vietnamese models viet models bills itself as the best social network for vietnamese models which raises the question whats the worst french bulldog owners and second life librarians theres even a network for social network administrators the trend toward niche networks makes sense because many adults dont just want to meet new people for the sake of meeting new people the way teenagers do they want to meet people they have something in common with says constantine von hoffman a social media consultant for spoke software inc which runs a lead generation web site social networking can help with that "everything has its obsessive types " he adds and thats the energy that corporate social networking initiatives should be trying to tap into both for
