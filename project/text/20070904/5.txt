as premiums rise homeowners drop wind coverage a small but growing number of homeowners are taking an extreme approach to insurance against hurricane winds theyre going "bare" doing without the coverage entirely florida this year passed a law making it easier to opt out of wind coverage amid a voter backlash over soaring premiums and the practice is also apprearing in other states particularly those along the gulf coast hit hard by recent storms while the option of doing without wind coverage is generally limited to people who dont have mortgages banks typically require borrowers to carry insurance even a slender increase in those going uncovered could have broader repercussions in the wake of another major storm a drop in insurance payouts could leave storm struck areas with fewer resources for rebuilding and shift some of the burden to taxpayers that more individuals are opting to go without coverage also underscores the breakdown of the insurance system in coastal areas nobody tracks how many americans are going without wind coverage and its likely still rare most homeowners do have mortgages and carry some kind of home insurance which often includes wind coverage according to the trade group insurance information institute moreover in some coastal states wind coverage is typically included as part of a general policy making it harder to drop nevertheless people in the insurance industry say it occurs and some say they see an increase "theres no doubt in my mind that there are more people going bare than in the past " says robert rusbuldt chief executive of the independent insurance agents &amp brokers of america an alexandria va based organization that represents agents and brokers nationwide "theyre betting against mother nature " mr rusbuldt says a survey conducted for the group in may concluded that nearly three million americans were dropped by their home insurers in the past two years more than two thirds of them in southeastern states the survey had an average margin of error of "you have to assume" that some of those people did not get new wind coverage he says after the devastating hurricanes in and caused more than &# billion in damages much of which they had to pay for insurers have increased rates dramatically while dropping clients they consider high risk allstate corp which insures nearly one out of every eight homes in the u s according to a m best co has moved to shed roughly customers in hurricane prone states since katrina most of them in florida customers can choose to drop wind coverage on their own "we work with them to make sure they are appropriately covered " says mike siemienas an allstate spokesman but he adds "at the end of the day its the customers decision " the federal government handed out at least &# billion in grants and aid money after hurricane katrina hit in some of which went to help people who didnt have government backed flood insurance but one of katrinas consequences was a sharp jump in premiums for wind coverage from private insurers which doubled or tripled in some coastal areas some homeowners are doing the math and concluding it can be more cost effective to cover rebuilding costs out of pocket rather than paying big annual premiums kathy sansbury dropped coverage on her fort lauderdale fla townhouse after the premium roughly doubled in december to nearly &# at that price she and her husband concluded that after paying the higher premium for just years they would have spent enough to rebuild "it doesnt make sense as expensive as it is " she says at the other end of the spectrum are individuals who either cant afford soaring premiums or who have concluded that their homes arent worth enough to warrant the price of coverage at all "theres no incentive to have my home insured " says melissa destio who owns a roughly year old mobile home in boynton beach fla that she estimates is worth up to &# "the premium far exceeds the benefit after you pay the deductible " some insurance agents say they are seeing an increase in the number of clients who have taken the plunge of going uncovered or discussed the option alex soto who heads insource inc a miami insurance agency estimates that to of his clients have dropped wind coverage five years ago he says such a step was almost unheard of earlier this year a number of homeowners in the new orleans area opted to go without wind coverage after being dropped by their prior carriers and electing not to turn to louisianas insurer of last resort says marc eagan president of eagan insurance agency he estimates that of his agencys homeowners insurance customers are currently without the coverage but mr eagan adds that the markets improving because no storms have struck the area so far this season and he expects more insurers will be willing to offer coverage at rates that appeal to customers the recent upheaval in the insurance industry has led to a dramatic rise in the number of people getting insurance through state created insurers of last resort these insurers sell insurance to people who cant get coverage otherwise often at much higher rates than they got in the private sector for instance floridas insurer of last resort citizens property insurance corp now insures more than million homes more than any other company in the state until recently insurers in florida were required to include wind coverage in all policies they sold except in particularly high risk areas but in response to anger over rising premiums lawmakers passed new rules which took effect july letting insurers sell policies without wind coverage to any florida homeowner willing to sign a statement that they dont want it theres also interest in self insurance pools homeowners are "looking for ways to bypass insurance companies " says state sen don gaetz a republican who represents part of the florida panhandle large corporations have long turned to self insurance setting up their own insurance companies and paying premiums to them or planning to pay out of pocket if disaster strikes companies including walt disney co and wal mart stores inc have said they now carry less insurance against hurricane damage after storms the past few years in a recent filing with the securities and exchange commission disney blamed "recent weather events" for its inability to purchase as much wind insurance as it previously carried as a result the company says it is "carrying more self insurance than we have in the past " disneys main property in a hurricane prone state is the walt disney world theme park in florida but for some homeowners dropping insurance simply means taking on a big risk wendy avin who lives in a mobile home park in gulfport miss a town that was ravaged by hurricane katrina says she received an insurance payout for damages to her home from that storm but now she says she cannot afford the wind coverage and is going without "it really worries me " she says george mastics who lives near the atlantic ocean in palm beach fla says the structural stability of his house built in factors into his decision not to carry wind insurance "the walls are so thick " he says "i cant imagine a hurricane tearing it down " "maybe im a gambler i dont know " he adds but he hasnt paid for wind coverage for a few years "so far im ahead of the game "
