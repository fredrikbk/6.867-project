challenge for etf trading bumpy markets gums it up during recent market swings investors buying and selling many of the newest exchange traded funds have encountered a major snafu wide trading spreads etfs are like index mutual funds but trade on exchanges like stocks making them subject to "bid ask" spreads or gaps between the price buyers are willing to pay and sellers are willing to accept widening spreads can eat into an investment "big etf spreads are a cost people did not anticipate " says dan dolan of the select sector spdrs line of etfs generally they "should not be there " large widely traded etfs havent been as susceptible but smaller less widely traded etfs have had a tougher time spreads detract from one of etfs biggest advantages over regular mutual funds the ability to actively trade them throughout the market day spreads on regular stocks can vary widely and etfs reveal a similarly wide range the tiny &# million healthshares infectious disease etf had a average spread from may to july "every visit we make to an adviser or broker we tell them these are relatively new funds and until they get traction the spreads will be wider " says anthony dudzinski chief executive of xshares advisors llc which offers the healthshares etfs some of the biggest most heavily traded etfs including barclays global investors &# billion ishares s&amp p etf and &# billion ishares msci eafe etf had an average spread of of their market price or less from july to late last month among vanguard groups etfs the one with the highest average spread in a recent day period was vanguard long term bond etf with a spread the lowest was for vanguard total stock market etf a vanguard official says the spread for the bond etf was due to credit market volatility last month rather than trading volume issues investors of course want the smallest spreads possible "but if you happen to be selling and its on a day the market is deteriorating " you have to choose between accepting the bigger spread or risking a bigger loss by sitting on the sidelines says tom lydon president of global trends investments in newport beach calif in general bid ask spreads have narrowed in recent years for most publicly traded shares thanks in part to the advent of electronic trading which can be more efficient at matching up buyers and sellers at the same time the move a few years ago away from pricing shares in fractions of a dollar and instead pricing in penny increments helped to close some of the bid ask gap however some etf watchers say the issue could worsen as hundreds of new etfs gear up to launch in coming months many of the newest etfs focus on narrow market niches their low trading activity could become an issue with such funds such trends combined with other issues like small assets under management could mean that "eventually youll see some consolidation or shutting down of etfs " says john mcguire a partner at law firm morgan lewis &amp bockius who works on etfs etf providers note that besides trading volume issues like market volatility or risk and the amount of trading in the funds underlying investments can affect spreads spreads can also be affected if some of those holdings are traded in overseas markets which might be closed during the u s trading day to help ease the problem of wide bid ask spreads many etf companies say they are trying to drum up more trading interest in niche products and are putting investors directly in touch with the floor traders handling their funds to work out better pricing they also advise clients use "limit orders" when they see wide spreads which brokers and others often use to execute trades at a specific price or better "people will call us to say theyre looking for the best execution" of trades given "some of our etfs will have little to no volume on a given day " says christian magoon head of the etf group for claymore securities many traders and other investors were confounded by wider spreads this summer when they sought to make fast bets to profit from the markets turmoil dan connolly a proprietary trader in chicago recalls spending a couple days accumulating shares of the ishares lehman year treasury bond etf about two months ago as he tried to minimize spreads and find the best prices for the trades such decisions can cost money when the markets are "crazy busy" and you have to make trades "in a matter of seconds " he says bgi a unit of barclays plc notes that while such blips can occur on average the etfs spread was of its price so far this year in fact during recent heavier trading spreads actually narrowed on many of their products including this one says michael latham head of americas ishares
