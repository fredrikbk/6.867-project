life of downtowns stores such as richs in atlanta l s ayers &amp co in indianapolis j l hudson co in detroit and g fox &amp co of hartford conn "they had fashion shows daily radio shows for kids and charm schools for teenagers " says jan whitaker author of service and style how the american department store fashioned the middle class "they didnt just sell things they were like malls but with a local flavor " in its heyday "lazarus was the heart of our community " says sherry buk executive director of the columbus historical society she recalls saturday afternoons in the s when she would put on her best dress and white gloves before traveling from her rural home into columbus to go shopping the store "was the most elegant thing id ever seen in my life " family members sometimes referred
