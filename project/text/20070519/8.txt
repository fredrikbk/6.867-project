holding the evidence of a flight to a new life in new york when he was "where did you find this " the moment was another small triumph for dr anderson the corporate historian for wells fargo in recent years the former stanford university history fellow has turned genealogical research into an unusual marketing vehicle after dr anderson taps into rich families fascination with their forebears the

private banking long the bailiwick of trust banks or blue blood institutions like j p morgan chase &amp co has recently become a fiercer battleground trillions of dollars in personal fortunes are

competition in colorado afterward audience members asked the historian how to research their own families dr anderson concluded that rich families were hungry for details of their history often not so they could brag but to impress upon their descendants that family wealth often came with sacrifice "they want to hear about how hard it was " soon the bank began asking regional wealth managers to identify current and prospective clients to invite to family heritage gatherings at the events dr anderson presents participants with a sampling of facts about their families if they want to know more he prepares a detailed report and presents the family an archive that can include or so documents including birth and death registries prison records or oral histories from interviews of family

histories for about families most with net worths of &# million or more with so much genealogical material now available on the internet he can often complete much of the work cheaply and within a few weeks wells fargo recently hired a second ph d historian to assist with family histories and expects to complete more full scale histories over the next year the reports are free notwithstanding fees the bank may eventually collect for managing clients funds dr anderson generally begins by poking around for family information and then approaches clients with an offer to dig deeper so far the bank says no one has called the digging intrusive dr anderson says that when his turns up sensitive material three families for example have had members kidnapped in the th century he offers to omit such details from the familys archive but he says so far no families have sought to redact their past client ginny lawrence was intrigued when the historian confirmed a piece of family lore her maternal

around the airplane manifest which dr anderson found in microfilm records of the u s immigration and naturalization service available online then dr anderson shared a piece of his own history his father was a u s airman whose b bomber was shot down while on a raid over germany in he was confined for a year in a nazi prison camp and as soviet troops closed in endured a forced march that killed
