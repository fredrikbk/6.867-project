the weekend interview with robert e murray coal man washington d c every good party has its wet blanket in the case of the energy industrys merrymaking for a global warming program the guy in the dripping bedspread is a year old straight talking coal mine owner by the name of robert e murray you wont hear many of mr murrays energy biz colleagues mention him they tend to avoid his name much as nephews avoid talk of their crazy uncles ges jeffrey immelt duke energys jim rogers exelons john rowe these polished titans have been basking in an intense media glow ever since they claimed to have seen the light on global warming and gotten behind a mandatory government program to cut c emissions theyd rather not have any killjoys blowing the whistle on their real motives which is to make a pile of cash off the taxpayers and consumers wholl fund it and yet heres mr murray killjoy in chief at the global warming love fest "some elitists in our country cant or wont tell fact from fiction cant understand what a draconian climate change program will do to the dreams of millions of working americans and those on fixed incomes " says the chairman and ceo of murray energy one of the largest private coal concerns in the country hes incensed by his fellow energy ceos"shameless" goal of fattening their bottom lines at the "expense of the broader economy " so these past months hes emerged from his quiet cleveland office and jumped on the national stage calling out the rest of his industrys co collaborationists hes testified in front of congress become a regular on television and radio programs sat for profiles by journalists and written letters to other energy companies exhorting them to think of the broader consequences it seems unlikely his campaign will slow the runaway global warming train now hurtling through washington but mr murray is certainly making the ride less comfortable for some corporate players "for me global warming is a human issue not just an environmental one " he says in his slow gravelly way nursing a cup of coffee at a local shop here after recent congressional testimony "the science of global warming is speculative but theres nothing speculative about the damage a c capture program will do to this country i know the names of many of the thousands of people american workers their families whose lives will be destroyed by what has become a deceitful and hysterical campaign perpetrated by fear mongers in our society and by corporate executives intent on their own profits or competitive advantage i cant stand by and watch " tough words and unusually brash ones for a respected ceo though mr murray is uniquely situated to deliver them unlike other energy executives at industrial firms such as ge that make millions on wind turbines or utilities such as duke or exelon who are making big financial bets on "clean energy" coal ceos such as mr murray are the bad boys on the global warming scene and will see zero upside in a global warming program while the industry has certainly made advances on the real pollution front sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide coal still accounts for the vast majority of all electricity related c emissions the only way to really cut carbon emissions would be to severely limit the use of coal fired power plants and manufacturing facilities which is exactly what environmentalists have wanted for years "were one of the targets of this campaign " says mr murray "putting in place a global warming program is about putting limits on the coal business and low cost energy " the ohio coal miner therefore has nothing to lose by speaking hard truths hes also well qualified to speak them hailing from a long line of coal miners proud of their roots and their industry a no nonsense guy mr murray became the family provider after his father was paralyzed in a coal mining accident by he was mowing lawns every day after school using a coal miners cap with a light on the front so he could continue to work past dark hed set his sights on a medical career when he was unexpectedly offered a chance at a scholarship to become a mining engineer "im a fourth generation miner but its only by happenstance " he chuckles there followed years at the north american coal corporation where he rose to ceo and then left in after a disagreement striking out on his own he mortgaged his home to buy his first mine today murray energy operates coal mines in ohio illinois kentucky pennsylvania and utah producing million tons of coal annually &# million in sales for u s electric utilities he employs about although he estimates that if you look at all the secondary jobs created to provide goods and services for miners his company has helped create some jobs those jobs are top of mr murrays list of concerns and hes been determined to make people hear about them at a recent speech to the new york coal trade association designed to whip some of his fellow coal industry friends into action mr murray recalled what happened in his region after the clean air act which imposed drastic reductions in coal production "in ohio alone from to nearly mines were shut down costing more than primary and secondary jobs these impacted areas have spent years recovering and some never will families broke up many lost homes and some were impoverished " he finishes the thought by noting that a global warming program would make those prior coal cuts look like small potatoes these speeches and tv appearances have become more frequent and its a measure of just how big an irritant hes become to global warming politicians and their new buddies in the energy industry that when mr murray was invited to impart his wisdom to congress at a hearing in march democrats tried to keep him from testifying they later gave in although energy and mineral resources subcommittee chairman jim costa pointedly left the room when it was mr murrays turn to testify had mr costa bothered to stay hed have heard a useful and irrefutable analysis of just what todays legislative proposals for a global warming program would mean to the economy including the nations many miners "some of this countrys electricity is generated from coal " mr murray says "global warming legislation would place arbitrary limits on the use of coal yet theres nothing to replace it at the same cost theres nuclear but the environmentalists killed it off and arent about to let it come back theres hydro but were using that everywhere we can already theres natural gas but supply and pipeline capacity is limited and its three times the cost of coal politically correct and subsidized alternative energy is very limited in capability and also expensive "so what you are really doing with a global warming program is getting rid of low cost energy " he says the consequences americans have been fretting about losing jobs to places such as china or india which already offer cheaper energy "you hike the cost of energy here further and you create a mass exodus of business out of this country " especially so given that neither of those countries is about to hamstring its own economy in order to join a kyoto like accord he points out that since u s greenhouse gas emissions have increased by while chinas have increased by mr murray also notes that many countries that have joined kyoto have already failed to meet their targets mr murray like most honest participants in this debate can reel off the names of the many respected scientists who still doubt that human activity is the cause of rising temperatures but he tends to treat the scientific debate almost as a sideshow an excuse for not talking about what comes next "even if the politicians believe that man is causing global warming they still have an obligation to discuss honestly just what damage they want to inflict on american jobs and workers and people on fixed incomes in the here and now with their programs " this is where mr murray really gets rolling on his favorite subject of his fellow energy executives and the role they are playing in encouraging a mandatory c program "there is this belief that since even some in the energy industry are now on board with a program that it must be okay no one is looking at these executives real motives " to understand those motives youve first got to understand how a cap and trade plan works the government would first place a cap on co emissions each company would then be given an "allowance" for emissions if the company produced less co than allowed it could sell the excess credits to others if a company wanted to produce more co than its allowance it would have to buy credits "the strategy for these folks now is to go to washington help design the program to suit their companies and snap up all the carbon emission allowances " says mr murray "the more allowances they get the more theyll have to sell and the more money theyll make this has nothing to do with creating regulatory certainty which is how they like to sell their actions this has to do with creating money for their companies off the back of an economy that will be paying more for its energy " mr murray reserves special criticism for those companies that have joined the high profile u s climate action partnership a coalition pushing for mandatory controls on greenhouse gas emissions "some of them see profits such as caterpillar general electric dupont alcoa general motors british petroleum shell oil conocophillips entergy and all are just trying to look green but none of it is good for america " he says that if these companies think the good times will last theyve been smoking their own products "these ceos were picked because they know how to work the political scene within their companies and are doing the same with the public on this issue they are focused on short term profits and maybe its true that a cap and trade program will help them with their next earnings statement what they wont acknowledge is that once a cap and trade program is in effect the politicians will want to keep lowering lowering lowering the cap that means fewer and fewer allowances in the long term this will starve american energy though that isnt something they are telling their shareholders " mr murray does business with many of these companies and in february he sent strongly worded letters to their executives pointing out the hazard of mandatory co reductions to the nation his letter to duke energy ceo jim rogers ended "you are promoting the wrong policies for your company for mine and my employees and for the american people your company may well have some short term benefits but slowing down our economy and with it the global economy over the long term will not help anybody " mr rogers responded with a letter that said while he respected mr murrays views he couldnt help "legislation is coming we can help shape it or we can stand on the sidelines and let others do it " he wrote it seems some have already given up on this battle ms strassel is a washington based member of the wall street journals editorial board
