pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink a no quaff for toffs flight lt david crook was a quintessential world war ii spitfire ace flying with the squadron out of ever so english sounding middle wallop in hampshire crook was dogfighting from the first blistering august days of the battle of britain on aug after a long day of combat with messerschmitts and stukas over the isle of wight "there was the whole german air force bar goering" crook managed to make it back to base and collect his reward for the days efforts a tall glass of pimms well iced the british navy and colonial planters had their pink gin the empires men in india favored a chota peg but come summertime in england the upper crusters drink of choice has long been pimms its a tradition learned by generations of toffs at oxford and cambridge where it is the default drink of the spring and summer "pimms can only be drunk during the punting season " the american oxonian a publication for rhodes scholars once advised "so dont ask for it in february " its still the drink of "the season " that gaggle of warm weather events the derby ascot wimbledon the henley regatta and the glyndebourne opera festival that anchor the british social calendar the new york timess r w apple jr was once at glyndebourne with a french friend who looking at the dinner jacketed men and begowned women sipping pimms there on the sussex downs observed "you can see why the aristocracy in this country is so desperate to hang on " and yet pimms isnt quite as u as it used to be this is not just because after a decade of "call me tony" blairism britain is somewhat less class constrained the effort to democratize pimms has come from diageo the drinks behemoth it bought the brand a few years ago and saw no reason sales should be confined to people hosting posh parties the pimms cup is one of those drinks that invites endless argument over its proper construction the most basic debate is over the fizzy stuff to be used the brits commonly use "lemonade " by which they mean a sprite like soda other lemon sodas are regularly employed and the most serious pimms artistes swear by "cloudy lemonade" the noncarbonated lemon juice sugar and water stuff we yanks call lemonade mixed with club soda the most vigorous disputations however have always centered on the garnish one is likely to see all sorts of fruits and vegetables stuffed into a pimms cup lemons oranges mint strawberries cucumber traditionalists abjure strawberries and cucumber insisting that the mug come dressed with borage a weedy herb with fragrant leaves and edible blue flowers the marketing johnnies at pimms used to distribute free packages of borage seeds throughout england so that folks could grow the necessary garnish at home though pimms long ago acquiesced in the notion that cucumbers provided a sufficient approximation of borages scent and flavor pimms never did make much of an effort to push borage in the states perhaps recognizing the promotional hurdles facing a cocktail requiring months of preliminary gardening but when it made a go at the u s market after world war ii the company recognized that a noisy debate over the correct garnish was just the ticket to draw the gawkers of the press and so in pimms staged a savvy publicity stunt two actresses got into a loud and violent spat in a new york nightclub arguing over whether to dress a pimms cup with cucumber or mint to make sure it got into the papers the fracas ended with hair pulling and calls to the police a decade later pimms president was still regaling reporters with details of the brawl even so pimms never quite caught on here which is a shame pimms itself is a delicious mix of gin bitter herbs and sweet fruit though its hard to find a more effective summer refresher than the brands signature cocktail the drink met resistance from the likes of robert ruark the midcentury newspaper columnist controversialist novelist and sometime big game hunter disdained that "insidious import the pimms cup " ruark didnt like anything about pimms not the gin at its core "a plebeian beverage at best" and most definitely not the garnish "a general landscaping of assorted vegetables" "i resent vegetables in booze " ruark proclaimed in "i do not think a cucumber should be included in alcoholic beverage any more than you order gravy with ice cream " it isnt just americans who are leery of excessive solid matter the british drinks writer john doxat in his "the gin book " lamented that pimms was losing its up market cachet because "bars continue to tart it up with all sorts of garbage turning a delicious long drink into a lightly alcoholic fruit salad " even so mr doxat could not understand why pimms had not attracted an ardent following in the u s why indeed missed opportunities for starters during queen elizabeths recent visit the british embassy in washington hosted a garden party in her honor it was a perfect pimms day gerard baker united states editor of the times of london was there spotting folks walking about with tall ice packed glasses filled with a coppery beverage mr baker educated in pimms at oxford felt an instant hankering but the bartender was an american who not only didnt have pimms to serve but didnt even know what it was "then what are they having " asked mr baker "iced tea " when he was done rolling his eyes in dismay mr baker went home and fixed his first pimms of the season an excellent idea that and though the pimms season has already started theres still plenty of time to plant borage try www
