risk adverse fda is a risk to the public accountability at the fda described by dr mark thornton "black wednesday at the fda " editorial page may are only the tip of the iceberg last september genentech announced that approval of its colon and lung cancer drug avastin for the treatment of breast cancer would be delayed at least a year because of requests from the fda for additional data the company said that regulators appeared to be increasing the stringency of requirements for certain types of clinical trials and had arbitrarily demanded that its trials be "audited and summarized" in a way different from an earlier agreement between the company and regulators regulators moving the goalposts in the middle of the game is particularly vexing for drug developers and avastin is not an isolated case another particularly problematic example involves somaxon pharmaceuticals testing of an already approved drug doxepin for a new indication the drug approved for the treatment of depression since is being tested in very low doses for use as a sleeping pill the fda initially assured the company that it could begin human clinical trials without first doing animal tests because of doxepins long history of use and because somaxon was using less than one tenth the dose used to treat depression however in may after the company had completed several clinical trials regulators unexpectedly asked for a full battery of testing in animals animal testing is usually considered to be "pre clinical " so it is difficult to understand the logic of animal testing for an almost year old drug that is undergoing trials for a new indication at a far lower dose than it is normally used in addition a number of important drugs previously granted marketing approval in europe have received "approvable " instead of approval letters from the fda meaning that additional data is required before the drug can be marketed these include acomplia for weight loss and cessation of smoking preos for osteoporosis and thelin for pulmonary hypertension a further sign of greater risk aversion is the increasingly aggressive use by regulators of post marketing "risk minimization action plans " which can include the submission of additional safety information greater restrictions on distribution and advertising and so on two years ago for example the riskmap that accompanied the fdas approval of a diabetes drug called symlin prohibited the company from conducting direct to consumer advertising or journal advertising for a year following approval and also restricted promotion primarily to physicians specializing in diabetes management who are supported by certified diabetes educators a washington legal foundation legal backgrounder offered persuasive arguments that this kind of regulatory expansionism is unwise outside fdas statutory authority and unconstitutional it also said that the fdas ban on the advertising of symlin conflicts with the agencys own guidance to industry in which the fda cited "promotional techniques such as direct to consumer advertising" as an example of how to use a riskmap " the fdas philosophy seems to be that the way to protect the public from uncertainty about the safety of new drugs is to stop approving any at all but who will protect the public from the fda henry i miller m d the hoover institution stanford calif
