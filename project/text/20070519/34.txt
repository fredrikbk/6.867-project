pursuits books assassination chronicle examining jfks death a former prosecutor compiles the evidence and debunks the myths reclaiming history by vincent bugliosi norton pages &# what exactly happened in dallas on nov you may have thought that the debate over the kennedy assassination was settled long ago vincent bugliosi would disagree although hed like to settle it now "reclaiming history" is less a work of historical reclamation than a very very long and passionate argument about what historians and investigators have claimed and counterclaimed over the years the argumentative design should not be surprising because as an attorney mr bugliosi comes to the subject steeped in the adversarial process as the finest way to arrive at the truth his fascination with the dallas murder in fact began in when a british tv company asked him to be the prosecutor in a mock trial of the presumed guilty but never tried assassin lee harvey oswald mr bugliosi the los angeles district attorney who famously prosecuted charles manson and his cult won a unanimous verdict in that case in and went on to write a book about it the best selling "helter skelter " now after years of intermittent effort investigating the jfk assassination he is prosecuting this case in the court of public opinion it took that long partly because "reclaiming history" is unlike any other book on the assassination ever produced by a single author rather than compare mr bugliosis work with say gerald posners "case closed" another effort by a lawyer to well close the case it is probably much fairer to shelve "reclaiming history" alongside the two massive federal investigations of the assassination the first of course was the warren commissions final report and supplementary volumes published in and the second was the final report and supplementary volumes issued by the house select committee on assassinations in mr bugliosi is a much better and more curious writer than the legal teams that produced these federal texts and while his output might first appear modest by their standards for a lone author writing about a lone gunman the output is staggering i should note that mr bugliosi mentions my work in his book mostly favorably but not always so the printed text of "reclaiming history" alone runs pages the book includes a cd rom with an additional pages of end notes before the whole prolix enterprise comes to a merciful end with a mere pages of source notes if printed like a regular book in a normal size font and on regulation paper mr bugliosis work would take up volumes at &# this encyclopedic work is a bargain "reclaiming history " at its best is a labor of love born out of an admirable even relentless ardor for the truth about the assassination there is no other way to describe the patience and stamina required to get to the bottom of so many stories encrusted as they are by decades of falsehoods misrepresentations and outright hoaxes mr bugliosis verve for setting the record straight is unequaled and will probably never be surpassed although a book of this length inevitably has factual errors e g the left wing national guardian now defunct is called a "libertarian newsweekly" to mr bugliosi now belongs the mantle of chief defender of the official story oswald did it and alone but there is an occupational hazard that comes with being an advocate especially a prosecutor rather than a historian mr bugliosi assumes a pose of omniscience that is not always warranted he is absolutely certain even when he is not necessarily right the most prominent example of this is mr bugliosis treatment of the iconic zapruder film the most important home movie ever made like previous assassination researchers of every stripe beginning with the staff of the warren commission mr bugliosi presumes that the "z film" is a virtual time clock of the assassination an unimpeachable witness that recorded all three gunshots in sequence this is an understandable assumption brought about because the second and third shots were so devastatingly evident the second hit president kennedy in the upper back passed through him and struck texas gov john connally the third burst open the presidents head it is eminently reasonable to assume that oswalds errant first shot which missed everyone and everything in the motorcade was nonetheless captured on the z film too yet it wasnt or at least no one has been able to find it in years of looking to make an educated guess which is what mr bugliosi ends up doing he necessarily ignores vital testimony from several reliable ear witnesses in dealey plaza they all swore that the time interval between the first and second shots was longer than between the second and third the only way to get to that result is to take into account the radical possibility that the first shot occurred before abraham zapruder started rolling as it turns out such a scenario fits in far better with the totality of the evidence oswalds pesky first shot was in all likelihood deflected not by an oak tree branch as mr bugliosi would have it but by a traffic light mast overhanging elm street this explanation could not be more fundamental to our understanding of what happened in dealey plaza it would mean that oswald did not have six or eight seconds to fire his three shots but which was akin to all the time in the world it would mean that oswalds feat of arms was average for a former marine and would forever put to rest any suggestion that he could not have pulled it off that mr bugliosi did not arrive at this insight suggests that he too is not immune from discounting evidence that doesnt quite fit the "what happened" chronicle of "reclaiming history" is written like a nonfiction novel not all that dissimilar from the form pioneered by truman capote in "in cold blood " for this portion mr bugliosi understandably relies largely on the previous federal investigations supplemented by reliable secondary works such as priscilla j mcmillans book on oswald and his wife "marina and lee " and the expert labors of a small coterie of consultants mr bugliosis version is one of the best narrative treatments of the four days from assassination to funeral since william manchesters kennedy authorized account yet it is not novel in the sense of being new and probably draws too much from tendentious renderings by kennedy acolytes including manchester there is no evidence for instance that lyndon johnson engaged in "childish antics" during the texas trip as mr bugliosi alleges the part of the book that mr bugliosi calls "what did not happen" is the great bulk of "reclaiming history" and represents his main contribution not coincidentally perhaps it also constitutes his primary justification for writing the book in the wake of mr posners widely acclaimed "case closed " unlike mr posner mr bugliosi undertakes the unenviable task of rebutting every conspiracy theory known to man as of the date when he finally stopped writing some might regard this as a foolish errand because there is no end to it a fact that mr bugliosi readily acknowledges by my count at least four new strains have appeared in the last four months the most recent being a supposed death bed confession by watergate burglar e howard hunt who fingers lbj as having been in cahoots with several of hunts former cia colleagues all of whom are conveniently dead to his credit mr bugliosi is not content with just piling on familiar theorists such as mark lane and oliver stone whose claims that the cia engineered the assassination deserve lasting scorn he also points out how eminent authors like michael beschloss and evan thomas have contributed to conspiracy mongering with superficially profound observations both have written that the u s government did not try very hard to unearth the truth out of fear of where it might lead that insinuation is a complete misreading of what happened inside the government after the assassination and a disservice to the truth as well as to the reputations of earl warren and others who investigated the assassination out of a sense of duty to the country one of the casualties of writing a book over a year period however seems to be the skewing of editorial judgment perhaps the most important canard only because it was perpetrated by the house select committee that demands a thorough bugliosi style rebuttal is the so called acoustic evidence supposedly proving that a fourth shot was fired in dealey plaza rather than being a centerpiece of the book though the page section debunking the acoustic business is relegated to the cd rom where mr bugliosi deftly explains by drawing from the best research that the "fourth shot" is pseudo scientific clap trap the putative shot occurred nearly a full minute after the assassination was over meanwhile an entire print chapter is devoted to refuting the grotesque and absurd theory that kennedys wounds were altered before the body arrived in bethesda md for the autopsy one cannot help admiring mr bugliosis zeal drive and conscientiousness still the cumulative effect of putting serious issues on a par with every cockamamie assertion that has ever been uttered is in the end mind numbing in a curious certainly unintentional way it plays into the hands of conspiracy theorists by giving scores of them undeserved stature someone forgot to tell mr bugliosi that less is sometimes more mr holland the author of "the kennedy assassination tapes" is completing a history of the warren commission for knopf
