pursuits books the towers the terror and a cosmic domestic drama falling man by don delillo scribner pages &# it is reasonable and don delillo like to imagine that on the morning of sept a stray copy of mr delillos epic cold war novel "underworld" whose cover included an image of the twin towers got buried somewhere in the ashes of ground zero the random or inexplicable affinity of distant events and the shared fate of relative strangers have always been among mr delillos subjects and he was clearly fated to write about from the moment it happened indeed there is no other american novelist one would rather hear from on the subject even if the book he has now produced turns out to be after early intermittent brilliance peculiarly half hearted and unrealized like other delillo novels "falling man" is a kind of cosmic domestic drama the story of a couple who might as well be adam and eve banished into a new wilderness by the terror attacks keith neudecker and lianne glenn the separated parents of a year old son are actually brought back together by when keith having escaped the world trade centers destruction returns to his wifes apartment instead of his own over the next few weeks the two of them achieve a weak and wary reconnection keith is described with some accuracy by his mother in law as "a model of dependability for his male friends all the things a friend should be an ally and confidant lends money gives advice loyal and so on but sheer hell on women " he is to say the least not built for cuddling or the verbal exploration of feelings even so everything in his world seems sharper and more observable than it did before "he noticed things all the small lost strokes of a day or a minute how he licked his thumb and used it to lift a bread crumb off the plate and put it idly in his mouth " during the fall of despite his reconciliation with lianne keith embarks on an affair with the woman whose briefcase he had "blankly" carried with him out of the north tower when he seeks out florence givens to return it the two of them are thrown together by memories of their descent through the burning buildings stairwell so crucial is it for florence to share with another survivor the "dazed reality" of the step by step escape arrestingly envisioned by mr delillo that she comes to believe keith has saved her emotional life even so he is hardly the type to stick around for long keiths wife troubled by the cataclysm tries in this same period to continue working and to keep leading a storytelling group for alzheimers patients liannes involvement with them is motivated by the memory of her fathers suicide which followed a diagnosis of the same disease but this therapy group seems like a novelists contrivance for a number of fairly trite reflections upon such as this one by a member of the group imagining someones sudden death at ground zero "at least he didnt die with a tube in his stomach or wearing a bag for his waste " lianne interests us most when we see her at home angry and sleepless coping with her frightened son seething over a neighbor who keeps playing middle eastern sounding music the last quarter of "falling man" takes place three years after by which time lianne is determined to live within a "small guarded scheme free from rage and foreboding " she and keith remain attached by the slimmest of threads he now spends much of his own blunted existence following the new poker craze from one tournament and casino to another still traumatized however inexpressively by he is as alienated from men as he has always been from women "people have trouble approaching him on the simplest social level they think they will bounce off " the early sections of "falling man" sharp vignettes demarcated by white space in which mr delillos best effects are left to resonate remain worthy of the subjects magnitude not least the novels opening pages in which the towers come down in a slow shower of passive verbs mr delillos physical descriptions "he had the pressured look of a man whose eyes have gone smaller in his head" are as arresting as ever but as the novel plays out its prose can sometimes sink beneath portentousness and thematic obligation "these are the days after everyone now is measured by after " "falling man" begins seriously to drift during its long three years hence epilogue and the novel ends up feeling as remote and unresolved as its two main characters and their relationship the authors brief attempts to imagine the interior life of one of the hijackers with all its sexual contradiction and human vanity will strike some readers as too sympathetic but these glimpses of a man trying "to fight against the need to be normal" while absorbing the arguments of mohamed atta "those who will die have no claim to their lives outside the useful fact of their dying" are superbly repellent "hammad was impressed by this it sounded like philosophy " nonetheless "falling man" feels in the end truncated and underimagined issues are raised and then dropped and too often the sea changing quality of is allowed to act as a simple given "by the time the second plane appears were all a little older and wiser" the truth that keith and florence "knew together" as a result of their near death experience remains unexplained hoarded by the author as if a truly close look at it would be a profanation like the performance artist who gives the book its title falling man as he calls himself pretends to be a white collar worker jumping from one of the towers before he is pulled up short by a harness the novel undergoes its own sudden deceleration but the reader is the one who is left hanging baffled by a literary provocation that refuses to follow through mr mallons most recent novel is the just published "fellow travelers "
