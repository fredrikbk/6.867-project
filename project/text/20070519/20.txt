hot topic immigration opening the white house and key senators struck an immigration deal this week that looks like the best chance in years to balance border security with human and economic realities theres room for improvement and a long way to go before any reform becomes law but senators jon kyl of arizona and ted kennedy of massachusetts deserve high marks for making progress on the plus side the bill addresses the million undocumented aliens living in the u s by providing a way for most to obtain legal status with minimal disruption to their lives or employers in return for reporting to authorities paying a &# fine passing a criminal background check and making a "touch back" visit to their home country illegal aliens would be eligible for a "z" visa allowing them to keep working here restrictionists are calling this "amnesty " but they were going to slap that label on anything this side of mass deportation the public is understandably upset about the presence of so many illegal aliens in the u s but there is no evidence that voters want millions of foreign families many of whom have been here for decades and have american children uprooted and forcibly removed from the country the restrictionist wing of the gop simply wants no new immigration and "amnesty" is merely a political slogan to kill any reform another major part of the legislation is more problematic this would shift immigration away from family ties and toward a merit based model that favors better educated immigrants with higher skills the stated justification for this change is that the u s currently admits too few skilled workers due to unchecked "chain migration " which facilitates the entry of unschooled and unskilled kin thats hard to credit however considering data that show the typical legal immigrant already has a higher skill level than the typical american were all for admitting the worlds best and brightest but the economic benefits of immigration also derive from the way immigrant skills complement the u s work force foreign workers make the u s more productive because they complement us at both the high and low ends of the skills spectrum remove the low end leg of the stool and you make the economy less productive and natives worse off why because well be using our human capital less efficiently natives may end up doing jobs theyre overqualified to do or those jobs will disappear altogether and diminish our quality of life immigrants comprise of u s workers though everyone knows theyre overrepresented in such lower skill occupations as farming construction food preparation and custodial work less well known is that these are the same businesses that the bureau of labor statistics predicts will experience high demand for future jobs any "merit based" system that is too rigid runs the risk of putting immigration policy out of sync with the needs of an expanding u s economy which brings us to the senate bills biggest flaw the guest worker program the u s has so many illegal immigrants in part because there arent enough legal ways to enter the country a guest worker program is the best way to allow that legal entry but the senates version isnt up to the task it would make available some "y" visas per year and the cap would be adjusted annually based on market fluctuations so far so good the problem is that these y visas which are good for two years and renewable up to three times would require the worker to return home for a year in between each renewal theres no economic reason for creating such turnover red tape and denying employers the benefit of experienced employees the complexity would discourage compliance especially among workers who might decide to enter the black market or never leave it rather than jump through these hoops the bill also call for more interior "enforcement " so in addition to hiring more border patrol agents and erecting miles of fence gop lawmakers want to harass businesses by increasing the penalties for unlawful hiring and require employers to electronically verify the immigration status of new employees these conditions come from the same republicans who say we cant repeat the mistakes of the immigration overhaul which also featured employer sanctions we realize any immigration reform is going to require compromise and this senate bills complications reflect that political necessity its a genuine cross party bargain a "center out" compromise that is already under fire from the restrictionist right the big labor left and lou dobbsian opportunists senate sages are predicting votes in support next week but its an ominous sign that the ever calculating democrat chuck schumer is already expressing his doubts his real goal may be to deny president bush any legislative success a bipartisan immigration bill would be good for the country if it truly leads to fewer illegals while allowing the flow of workers our economy needs the senate bill takes us only half way there
