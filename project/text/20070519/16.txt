did merrill morgan stanley overpay both spent big money on subprime lenders just before slowdown some of wall streets biggest players bet heavily on the subprime mortgage sector last year just as it started to head south now investors are questioning whether the firms overpaid to get into a sector that has become less profitable last year merrill lynch &amp co and morgan stanley bought subprime mortgage lenders with merrill paying &# billion for first franklin and morgan stanley acquiring saxon capital inc for &# million matthew howlett a mortgage sector analyst at fox pitt kelton estimates that the pace of subprime lending and the volume of securities backed by such loans may fall by nearly half this year as a result mr howlett believes merrill may have overpaid for first franklin by &# million he doesnt believe morgan stanley overpaid as much for saxon because that business includes a mortgage servicing platform which he believes has held more of its value wall street firms are heavily exposed to the subprime market where lenders make loans to people with weak credit brokerage firms bankroll subprime lenders with credit package and sell bonds backed by their loans and operate their own subprime lending shops like first franklin in the past year mounting defaults and delinquencies among high risk borrowers who received subprime mortgages have forced some lenders into bankruptcy proceedings attracting buyers on wall street hoping to snap up deals at fire sale prices at merrills annual shareholders meeting in late april chief executive stan oneal defended the first franklin purchase in response to questions from a former merrill marketing employee shareholder robert volpe whose family owns merrill shares mr volpe asked whether first franklin would hurt merrills results this year mr oneal said he remains "very confident" that first franklin "will be a more valuable franchise over time " partly because so many competitors have "gone bankrupt" or halted making new loans but he acknowledged it may not add to merrill earnings this year as originally projected indeed mortgages was the only area where merrills first quarter revenue fell from the first quarter of although merrill didnt quantify the mortgage revenue downturn the firm said the subprime sector including origination securitization warehouse lending trading and servicing has accounted for less than of the firms net revenues over the past five quarters that indicates that merrills quarterly subprime revenues are less than &# million a morgan stanley spokesman said the saxon subprime mortgage servicing business has seen "an uptick" in inquiries from potential new clients based partly on the firms greater financial strength and company officials dont believe they overpaid for saxon for that reason the firms first quarter earnings didnt get hit by subprime either merrill notes that first franklin has a big servicing business too karen weaver global head of securitization research at deutsche bank ag said that merrill and other big firms are still pursuing a valid strategy of using their acquisitions to gain a supply of mortgages which they can repackage and resell to investors just two months ago goldman sachs group inc paid about &# million for a small two year old subprime lender senderra funding llc in charlotte n c but ms weaver says the business faces a "sharp and dramatic" deterioration in fundamentals including a slowdown in home purchases and weakening home prices along with falling new mortgage and refinancing volumes "at least of the subprime loans done last year probably wouldnt be done in this environment " ms weaver says she agrees that merrill likely overpaid for first franklin in the first quarter of merrill has moved up to become the no underwriter of subprime mortgage backed securities in terms of dollar volume according to inside mortgage finance a trade publication in bethesda md for all of merrill ranked no subprime issuance fell by to &# billion in the first quarter of this year from the same quarter of the publication said merrill has moved into the top spot "virtually overnight " said guy cecala publisher of inside mortgage finance thanks to first franklin morgan stanley aided by saxon ranked no in the first quarter up from no for all of the two securities firms are filling a gap created by the bankruptcy filing of new century financial corp last month and the withdrawal from the market of other lenders such as fremont general corp merrill underwrote &# billion in the first quarter including deals of roughly &# billion or more in each month of this year the two wall street firms have surged past rivals such as lehman brothers holdings inc mr howlett of fox pitt said merrill has gained the top spot based partly by "pricing very aggressively" in offering such subprime securities for resale referring to merrills recent burst of subprime underwriting he said "i have a hard time believing its better than break even " a merrill lynch spokesman declined to comment on a call with analysts about the firms first quarter earnings merrill chief financial officer jeff edwards said subprime mortgages are "an asset class that will continue to be significant both in the u s and world wide " he said such markets inevitably encounter "periods of disruption " but that first franklins "origination and servicing capabilities enabled us to see trends sooner and adjust underwriting standards and pricing more rapidly " officials at lehman brothers which ranked no in subprime underwriting last year but slipped to no in the first quarter of dont view the drop off as a negative according to someone familiar with the firm thats because lehman bankers believe they exercised price discipline and restraint in buying fewer subprime mortgages during before market conditions deteriorated and thus currently have fewer mortgages to package and resell
