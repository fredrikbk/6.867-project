pursuits leisure &amp arts dale earnhardt jr s well traveled track big name nascar drivers have been switching teams for decades the mainstream media have had lots of opportunities to show just what they dont know about nascar while the rest of america was embracing nascar during the s and s making it second only to the nfl those who live in the new york and l a media bubbles were still scratching their heads wondering what "this nascar thing" was all about last year when producers for nbcs "dateline" were looking to chronicle anti muslim bigotry in america they exhibited prejudices of their own dispatching their cameras to a nascar race they came up empty handed but perhaps the most egregious example of this lack of understanding is the analysis following the news that dale earnhardt jr will leave dei the team founded by his father if you know nothing about nascar you read the papers last week and believed that young mr earnhardt or jr as hes commonly known has ushered in a new era of free agency "it is the dawning of nascars first true free agency market " the seattle post intelligencer reported viv bernstein the otherwise level headed nascar beat writer for the new york times wrote breathlessly that jr s "free agency will send ripples throughout the sport potentially affecting driver salaries merchandise sales and even television ratings not to mention the balance of power among race teams " nothing could be further from the truth thats because nascar drivers have always been free agents they change teams so often it would make reggie jacksons head spin in the early days of nascar which was started in many drivers didnt even work with a particular team theyd simply show up at the track walk the pits and look for a ride the deals were done on the spot with a handshake if anything the drivers were more loyal to a brand ford chevy than to a team as the sport developed driver owner relationships became more stable the iron man of nascar is richard petty whos been with the same team his own and sponsor stp for decades four time champ jeff gordon has spent his entire nextel cup career with rick hendrick but theyre the exceptions not the rule team changes among big name drivers are not new darrell waltrip a nascar superstar in the s and s and now a broadcaster for fox sports is a good example he had a very public split with digard racing at the end of the season moved over to junior johnsons team and promptly won three nascar championships in five years in he left to drive for hendrick motorsports and four years later left hendrick to form his own team but waltrip argues that jr is a bit different "i didnt leave the race team founded by my dad and run by my stepmother " he said fair point but nascar history is full of big name drivers coming and going to big name teams hendrick was a revolving door in the s and s with geoff bodine ricky rudd ken schrader and others passing through three time daytona winner dale jarrett has raced for four different teams since the same goes for former champion bobby labonte even modern day iron man mark martin whod raced for jack roush since changed teams this year crew chiefs change teams as well andy petree now an espn broadcaster was the crew chief for harry gant for years he left that team in the mid s and went to richard childress racing where he won two championships with dale earnhardt sr before leaving to form his own team i could go on but you get the point moves by successful drivers and crew chiefs are so common that the nascar beat writers have a term for it the silly season jr has changed one thing however the silly season used to be hush hush thered be rumors of a driver or crew chief leaving a team intrepid reporters would sometimes break the news but usually the new deals werent announced until late in the season when everything was locked in place jr by contrast went public he first used the media to make his case for ownership in the team owned by his stepmother teresa earnhardt and when teresa and jr couldnt come to terms he used the media again to announce his departure and availability the only question that remains is what about his sponsor budweiser in nascar your sponsor is as important as your car owner while no one really expects to see defending champion jimmie johnson shopping for nails at lowes jr and budweiser have one of those rare relationships where you can actually imagine him using his sponsors product the smart money says budweiser will stay with jr so as dale earnhardt jr and the rest of the nascar field compete in the annual all star event in charlotte n c this weekend is his pending departure from dei big news certainly will it forever change the sport no this is how nascar has done business for decades mr yost is a writer in lake elmo minn his book "the mph billboard the inside story of how big money changed nascar" motorbooks is due out in august
