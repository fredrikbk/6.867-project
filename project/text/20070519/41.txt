pursuits food &amp drink wine notes in the years we have been writing our tastings column which appears on fridays we have received thousands of questions about wine from readers in this column we answer some questions that touch on common themes we have edited the questions for space if you have a question drop us a note at wine wsj com be sure to include your full name city and state wines for a wedding my fiance and i have recently become very interested in wine our wedding is coming up and we want to be able to share our newfound love of wine with our guests we will be having a red and white wine to be poured during dinner but we cant afford to be serving &# a glass wine to our guests help kara reighard mount pleasant mich we are asked about wedding wines so often that weve written about the subject extensively in both our column and our books you might want to refer to the chapter about this in our book "wine for every day and every occasion" its very difficult to give general advice on the subject because there are so many variables for instance many caterers and hotels insist that you order only from their wine lists overall our advice would be to keep in mind that there are many excellent wines available from all over the world at reasonable prices these days so theres no reason to spend a fortune on wine or to settle for a second rate inexpensive wine for the white you might consider a sauvignon blanc from chile the youngest you can find everyone will love that for the red its hard to beat beaujolais for the price and it is one of the most exuberant party worthy wines on the planet for our most recent columns about chilean sauvignon blanc and beaujolais drop us a note at wine wsj com be sure to taste the wines before you buy them by the case in fact you might want to buy several wines in your price range put them in bags and decide with friends in a blind tasting which ones you like best guests bearing bottles i am a collector and have quarterly tastings at my home my wife and i are having a debate as to whether i should open wines that are brought to our home on the evening of the tasting i feel that their quality and varietal may conflict with the theme of the evening but dont want to offend anyone gene ross virginia beach va we are often asked variations on this question most commonly "when i invite someone to dinner and they bring a bottle of wine do i have to open it " often the problem is that the wine isnt a good match with dinner or that the host already had a well conceived idea of the wine menu our feeling is that if you asked someone to bring a bottle of wine whether to a tasting or dinner yes you should open it if someone simply shows up with a bottle of wine and you werent expecting it thats a gift and its ok to say "wow this looks great well save it for a special occasion " there are of course a million exceptions to this for instance if someone showed up at our house with a wine and was very excited about it we probably would feel funny not enjoying it with them that night all of this can be avoided very simply by saying to the people you invite "dont bring any wine we have plenty " thats what we do
