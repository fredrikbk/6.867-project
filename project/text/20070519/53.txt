pursuits travel summer trips the trainspotting vacation folkston ga stuart and mary beth lodge sit back in their chairs on an outdoor viewing platform and wait for the show to begin suddenly they hear the blast of a horn followed by the roar of diesel locomotives a mile long freight train races by feet in front of them for the lodges the trains are what bring them to this small town in southern georgia "i love the power the force and the strength of trains " says ms lodge a personal life coach from atlanta its been more than years since the end of the railroads glamour days when hollywood stars still traveled on fast streamliners to the coast and powerful steam locomotives symbolized the countrys industrial might these days when even plane travel is passe trains evoke a passion in some people the way baseball or food might in others they recall a bygone era when life was simpler and when small towns still thrived before the suburbs took hold now folkston is figuring out how to profit from that passion officials are turning what many local residents here have considered a major annoyance the gritty noisy railroad tracks through the center of town into a tourist attraction several years ago this town near the florida border built a covered wooden platform next to csxs busy mainline tracks and outfitted it with chairs lights ceiling fans and other amenities thousands of train lovers now flock to the platform each year to watch the csx freight and amtrak passenger trains that come through town every hours long before i started writing about trucks ships and railroads for the wall street journal in late i had an attachment to trains since my early years growing up a half block from the elevated train line in queens n y i have enjoyed watching and listening to them in my late teens and s id go to country areas with busy freight tracks sometimes camping with friends near tracks in northeast pennsylvania there was the quiet and solitude then the amazing rush of energy and noise when a huge train broke the silence then the silence returned and the anticipation built up for the next rush there are all kinds of train buffs just as there are fresh water and salt water fishermen says danny harmon a television producer from tampa fla one of the people gathered on the folkston platform on a recent day "some of us like locomotives some of us like to listen to operations on the radio and others just enjoy being in the outdoors and watching the trains go by " whatever our reason for being drawn to the tracks we all share a respect for these trains that have helped shape the history of this country at platforms like the one in folkston buffs swap stories at times exhibiting an almost encyclopedic knowledge of trains routes railroad history and schedules theres even one upmanship i find that extreme sector a bit annoying what should be a relaxing pursuit becomes another ego driven activity but its not long before theres a horn and a long train drowns out such talk here in southern georgia train lovers are fueling something of a rail renaissance its now possible to take what a csx spokesman calls an iron triangle tour of georgia visiting the triad of viewing platforms that have emerged in the state one of these is in jesup about miles north of here a town that has less than half the trains of folkston manchester miles southwest of atlanta is an old railroad town and mountain retreat of president franklin d roosevelt its platform built behind the downtown shops overlooks a junction of csx lines from atlanta and birmingham ala what sets folkston apart though is the sheer number of trains that pass through buffs call folkston the funnel because trains pour in from both the midwest and east coast on their way to florida the town has created a grassy train watching park that stretches along the tracks for two blocks from the towns restored depot to the platform when folkstons town fathers spent &# of state money to build the platform they had diehard train fanatics in mind but along with well heeled buffs from all over the country and the world who set up expensive cameras and video gear next to the track officials have been surprised to find that the platform is also drawing families this is spawning a tiny but growing cottage industry of hotels restaurants and gift shops its not just happening in folkston but in towns in pennsylvania and illinois since last fall two new gift shops have opened in folkston whistlin dixie and the wild caboose selling railroad theme merchandise the towns two bed and breakfasts the inn at folkston and the folkston house which for years catered mainly to eco tourists visiting okefenokee swamp are reaching out to rail tourists with train maps memorabilia and hints about train watching still folkston faces challenges as it tries to broaden its appeal to families and the spouses of train lovers for one thing it has a small supply of high end accommodations innkeepers and merchants also say it can be difficult to keep non buff family members entertained "its not your usual going to the beach or the mountains and were learning how to capitalize on it " says claudia burkhart executive director of the okefenokee chamber of commerce in folkston she estimates that more than people visit the platform each year pumping about &# million into the local economy folkston wasnt the first town to build a train watching platform rochelle ill for instance put one up in as a result of train lovers making regular visits to the crossing of two busy freight lines in the past few years after decades of decline railroads have experienced a resurgence in part as higher fuel prices hurt the trucking industry for train watchers its a "non stop show " says jim wrinn editor of trains a magazine for enthusiasts at the annual rail watch weekend in late march men and women wearing shirts and caps with the names and logos of their favorite railroads fill the platform and the grounds next to the tracks john parker a line haul driver for united parcel service wears a dark blue shirt with white lettering "i spent most of my time and money on trains the rest i just wasted " theres a sense of nervous anticipation among the rail buffs although they have a rough idea of what trains come through each day they never know exactly what the next train will be they hunt for clues such as a signal turning to green from red to alert them to an approaching train they listen to the radio scanner at the platform for train communications and mechanized voice announcements that a train has passed a track detector in the area and there are no equipment defects the latest craze is to use wifi at the platform to download track diagrams and train positions from rail web sites to laptops to help pinpoint oncoming trains most bring cameras and a few meticulously log every train writing down locomotive numbers or the number of freight cars when a train carrying chemicals lumber and scrap metal rushes through town onlookers take aim with their cameras some of the biggest attractions are amtrak trains particularly the auto train which hauls passengers and automobiles and the tropicana orange juice train with its distinctive orange or white refrigerated cars some buffs will fortify themselves with snacks and settle in for hours sometimes returning day after day the tropicana train usually passes through folkston five nights a week but on my recent visit the friday night one heading to new york from florida didnt arrive when expected some returned saturday finally at p m a headlight appeared to the south a few watchers rushed over to a fence closer to the tracks kneeling down to take photos gail compton a corporate communications manager from port richie fla says she cant understand why her husband and son love trains so much "i just dont get it " says ms compton who keeps busy for hours while at the platform with her family by reading
