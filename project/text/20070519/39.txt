politics &amp economics tug of war breaks out over immigration bill washington with the senates fragile immigration compromise facing its first test next week lawmakers and interest groups on all sides of the debate began pushing friday for major changes to the plan businesses want more flexibility to fill their labor needs than they would get under the proposed merit based visa system immigrant advocacy groups vowed to fight changes they said would disadvantage low skilled workers and break up families some democrats opposed a temporary worker program they said would create a permanent underclass while republicans balked at allowing millions of illegal immigrants to remain in the u s the proposal unveiled this week by a handful of senators on both sides of the aisle could be the last shot at resolving one of president bushs top priorities and answering one of the countrys most intractable questions what to do with an estimated million immigrants who are here illegally but who do jobs that are critical to the economy from picking apples to cleaning bathrooms this weeks deal would try to step up border security and set up a system for companies to verify their workers are legal immigrants in the country illegally before jan would be able to remain and eventually apply to become citizens temporary visa programs would create a path for some workers to get citizenship eventually the senate is set to debate the bill next week and leaders are considering imposing a limit on the number of amendments that would be allowed in the hope of voting before the scheduled memorial day recess all sides in the debate will need to swallow things they may not like democrats supportive of the deal will have to convince their colleagues that it is worth accepting the temporary worker program in exchange for winning legalization of some illegal immigrants already here many republicans say giving illegal immigrants citizenship is rewarding bad behavior but they may accept that in order to win a more secure border "youre going to lose some people on the left who think the temporary worker program goes too far and youre going to lose some people on the right who think its amnesty " said randel johnson of the u s chamber of commerce "i think in the end there will be enough votes to pass it " house speaker nancy pelosi d calif said she wouldnt bring up immigration legislation in the house unless the white house can guarantee support from at least republicans that is a heavy lift even with conservatives such as sen jon kyl of arizona and sen johnny isakson of georgia supporting the tentative senate deal "what is it that conservatives get out of this " asked rep steve king r iowa maybe mr kyl "did strike the best deal he could in the senate " mr king said "why did he strike a deal at all though if thats the best he can do " even constituencies that appear to benefit from the senate legislation such as high tech businesses were skeptical in a letter to senate majority leader harry reid d nev microsoft corp said the plan to distribute visas using a points system "would take hiring decisions out of the hands of employers and could potentially harm the technology industry " compete america a coalition of business groups and high technology employers including google inc and hewlett packard co expressed "serious concerns" in a letter to sen kyl it insisted that high tech employers need access to far more immigrant visas than the a year they now have that has been a long running complaint among this group currently employers recruit the workers they need and typically sponsor them for a temporary work visa after a year or two they help valued workers apply for an immigrant visa or green card under the new system employers still could recruit and sponsor workers for a temporary visa but those workers then would apply for permanent status themselves competing with everyone else around the world that could result in for example too many history teachers and not enough electrical engineers getting work permits businesses fear immigrant advocacy groups said that depending on the details of the points system lower skilled temporary workers may have too hard a time getting green cards "it looks more like chances of winning the lottery than the chances of getting in under our current immigration system " said cecilia munoz of the national council of la raza a latino advocacy group the bill also splits the labor unions john sweeney president of the afl cio denounced the guest worker plan saying it would allow in thousands of temporary workers who wouldnt be covered by union protections and would be subjected to "virtual servitude " the latino coalition a washington advocacy group charged that the afl cio was "choosing to stand in the way of the best interests of our community "
