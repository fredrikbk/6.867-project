pursuits food the carnivores guide to vegetables mashed potatoes soft as a fine sheet tender fava beans perfect cabbage with help from duck fat with top chefs making veggies the centerpiece of their dishes our columnist offers his own manifesto coming out of an east european culture whose main green vegetable was the mushroom i have learned to love all manner of leaves and seeds and roots not because i think they are good for me what popeye didnt know consuming can after can of spinach with its high oxalic acid content can reduce calcium and iron absorption and then theres the contamination that caused a panic in spinach munching circles call me a hedonist or a morally heedless epicure but i just like the taste of spinach gently wilted and drained still green and full of personality i dote on parsnips more even than potatoes because their natural flavor is one of earthy sweetness vegetables are interesting much more interesting than meat and fish and the chieftains of fine dining are increasingly taking notice in my travels across america writing about food ive noticed that chefs aiming at the maximum sensual and visual impact have quietly put vegetables at the forefront of their menus more and more vegetables are showing up on menus as the centerpiece of main dishes in which meat plays a supporting role in doing this chefs are applying classic techniques yes that includes using butter and presenting their vegetables not just as virtuous but as delicious its not vegetarian cooking its vegcentric cooking this may not have the logic of pure vegetarianism but it is the tasty position leeks braised in chicken stock taste better than leeks braised in water and biblical evidence suggests that god is behind it he drove nebuchadnezzar the bad babylonian king out of his palace and condemned him ever after to "eat grass like oxen " daniel while i wouldnt dream of concluding from that ancient punishment that vegetarians are on a bestial diet i do think they are deprived at his new atelier outpost in manhattan chef joel robuchon headlines his imaginative menu with truffled mashed potatoes chicagos culinary vanguardist greg achatz offers guests a dish listed simply as "snap peas tofu pillow of lavender air ham " at bacchanalia in atlanta a spring menu offered pea ravioli with pea sprouts garlic and cream as an alternative to more conventional meat centered dishes this isnt a trend that sprang fully formed from the brain of wolfgang puck as a multi veg pizza primavera its a gentle growth thats been creeping up on little hairy tendrils and rising on leafy stalks helping chefs to solve the problem of the stolid main course clumping onto the table after the light and artistic appetizers that have been the main success of modern cuisine since the s my most memorable vegetable moment the equivalent for me of prousts madeleine is a big red ripe tomato i bought from a vendor at a rail siding in northern greece after sitting up for two nights without food on the grim old coal spewing simplon orient express as it sputtered through communist yugoslavia scarlet tomato juice dripped on my shirt juice perfectly balanced between acid and sweet flesh soft but gently resistant to the tooth botany pedants who write in to tsk tsk that the tomato is a fruit will receive a visit from a man disguised as a rutabaga who will force them to consume a quart of avocado ice cream recipe on request but these days my favorite vegetable is the fava bean whose new world ugly cousin is the lima maybe its because favas are still a delicacy in this country and require laborious double skinning first peel the pod whose shape is suggestive enough to be the subject of much joking in italy then after the briefest blanching in boiling water pop off the delicate skins protecting the tender electric green bean in italy and spain very young favas can be eaten right out of the pod their flavor is a mild tang that puts limas in the shade it was in spain in the remote southeastern city of murcia where i encountered fava cookery at its zenith all morning someone had been skinning the little beans on my plate they glistened alongside the worlds best ham jamon iberico some poor fellows cant eat favas safely because of an inherited deficiency in the enzyme glucose phosphate dehydrogenase a condition that primarily affects people of eastern mediterranean heritage doctors once thought i had it as a legacy from some putative sephardic ancestor but the diagnosis proved wrong doing justice to these natural wonders often means going beyond simple steaming or other healthy preparations and giving vegetables the attention and culinary nurturing of a main dish the first principle of cooking vegetables is the same as the first principle of being a doctor first do no harm but unlike a doctor stop worrying about cholesterol and add fat as necessary fresh green beans should be boiled in lots of salted water until brilliant green "refreshed" under cold water to stop the cooking and sauteed briefly in butter or better yet duck fat just before serving a slight crunch is ideal in my book even carrots shouldnt be cooked beyond the earliest point you could call fork tender i hated cooked carrots as a child and avoided them for many years until i ate some as an adult in france that hadnt been left in a stew until they were mashable mashed potatoes stymie some folks unnecessarily mash them with a ricer a processor will turn them to glue stir over low heat in a saucepan to dry them out a bit then add as much butter as you dare whisking until silken smooth this is a housewifes trick that made mr robuchon famous along with a few other less obvious dishes no wonder mashed potatoes are called mousseline in french muslin soft as a fine sheet my elder son when just a toddler got dragged along to the very great alsatian restaurant lauberge de lill we grownups ate venison st hubert in sauce grand veneur for the tyke the chef brought out a mousseline with a softboiled egg whose yolk was so bright orange michael thought it was an apricot disguise may be the way to go with spinach haters once again overcooking wrecks everything but elegant concoctions like chicken stuffed under the skin with spinach puree and ricotta cheese or cheese topped spinach mornay may fool the wary or maybe not in a new yorker cartoon of the s e b white depicted a child spurning spinach and blurting in the caption "i say its spinach and i say the hell with it " i say take this brat to grasings coastal cuisine in carmel calif where spinach appears in eight dishes including a house special lasagna consisting of a sheet of fresh spinach pasta filled with artichokes you already know that i part company with those who think veggies must always be given the healthiest preparation possible i also have a bone to pick with those who are using their greens to make a green political statement please dont put me in the same trug as those terroir terrorists who want to disrupt interstate truck farming and airborne shipments of perfectly seasonal in their hemisphere green beans in favor of a smug californian myth called sustainability i like a homegrown tomato as much as the next epicure but im not willing to eat root vegetables all winter for me its emerald peruvian asparagus for new years lunch in a risotto slowly cooked from the traditional and physically appropriate rice imported from italys po valley rich from absorbing a broth i join the great french chef michel guerard in producing from bouillon cubes asparagus from peru flown into your market in midwinter is qualitatively as good as any warm weather northern hemisphere stalk let alice waters caterwaul about the jet fuel emissions as long as she acknowledges all that truck exhaust bringing california veggies back east while she flies into new haven from berkeley to plan "sustainable" meals for yalies are there vegetables i loathe at your next luau dont serve me poi the mucous taro mush of polynesia i paid my taro dues once at a maori banquet in wakarewarewa i also dont care if i ever eat broccoli rabe or other very bitter greens unless they come with bits of pork to take the bite out of them and make them slide down easy but unlike a host of otherwise sensible adults including president george h w bush aka i love broccoli cauliflowers green relation actually has an attractive flavor what drives off the multitudes is overcooking the proof of this is on a million coffee tables where cocktail guests happily scarf down raw broccoli flowerets dipped in mayonnaise for the truly broccophobic serve puree of broccoli soup enriched with chicken stock and heavy cream even old broccoli haters like bush wont know what it is call
