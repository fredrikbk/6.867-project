pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations the man who wasnt there having watched the second republican debate the other night its clear to me the subject today is fred thompson the man who wasnt there while the other candidates bang away earnestly in a frozen format thompson continues to sneak up from the creek and steal their underwear boxers briefs and temple garments he is running a great campaign its just not a declared campaign its a guerrilla campaign whose informality is meant to obscure his intent it has been going on for months and is aimed at the major pleasure zones of the republican brain in a series of pointed columns commentaries and podcasts mr thompson has been talking about things conservatives actually talk about shouldnt homeowners have the right to own a gun isnt it bad that colleges dont teach military history how about that sarkozy good news isnt it did you see tenet on russert his book sounds shallow tell all y these comments and opinions are being read and forwarded in internet nation they are revealing and interesting but theyre not heavy not homework they have an air of "this is the sound of a candidate thinking " thats an unusual sound most illustrative was what started this week as a small trading of barbs with provocateur michael moore whose general and iconic dishabille is meant to show identification with the workingman though in america workingmen bathe mr moore was back from cuba where he made a documentary on the superiority of castros health care system mr thompson suggested mr moore is just another lefty who loves dictators mr moore challenged mr thompson to a health care debate and accused him of smoking embargoed cigars within hours mr thompson and his supposedly nonexistent staff had produced a spirited video response that flew through youtube and the conservative blogosphere sitting at a desk and puffing on a fat cigar mr thompson announces to mr moore he cant fit him into his schedule then "the next time youre down in cuba you might ask them about another documentary maker his name was nicolas guillen he did something castro didnt like and they put him in a mental institution for several years giving him devastating electroshock treatments a mental institution michael might be something you ought to think about " you couldnt quite tell if mr thompson was telling mr moore he ought to think more about cuba or might himself benefit from psychiatric treatment it seemed almost deliberately unclear right now mr thompson has the best of both worlds an air of fearlessness and nothing on the line he hasnt committed hes not in he can take a chance and be himself because hes not afraid and hes not afraid because he has nothing to lose he says hell get in if enough people ask him to if they dont hell go someplace else and do something else its not as if his speech fees would go down why would he run now because he thinks theres no one of greater stature on the field because he thinks hes got a better shrewder read of the base than the rest of them because hes at an age where you throw the dice or know you never will because he thinks the one essential to modern presidential leadership the one thing you must have now in the age of terror is the ability to communicate and he reads himself as the best communicator and because hes at a point in his private life where its possible for him hes got a wife whos got his back and two kids whove given him a second chance even in great careers its the private life thats hardest to get right he feels he has people speak of mr thompsons movie star looks but hes not beautiful hes heavy and gray what he has is bearing he has the manner of someone who thinks a great deal of himself and thinks it after long personal pondering of his good points bad points high points and low he may or may not be correct in his conclusions but i suspect they are part of his draw i suspect people pick them up is he anything beyond a standard republican conservative will he have anything beyond a mideast policy that consists of win in iraq support the surge and oppose any timetable does he stand for any strategic thinking apart from what john mccain unconsciously but aptly characterized as "bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb iran" on domestic issues can mr thompson go beyond standard conservative thought i happen to be standard conservative myself but sometimes old things need to be made new the obvious needs to be made fresh here are some things mr thompson has going for him he had eight years in the u s senate and then left in instead of sticking around and getting all the muck on him he has a conservative record but a moderate persona he seems nonradical non lets follow the banner over the cliff hes a southerner but modern he has a great voice voices matter ask obama who has one ask hillary who doesnt he comes to a field that may soon start to feel tired that to some extent already does his relatively late entry suggests suggests his motives are serious not just ego related but mr thompsons challenges are real too hell have to show hes serious that hes in it for big reasons and in it to the end hell have to knock down the "low energy gadfly hops from thing to thing" charge which has persisted so long that one assumes theres something in it hell have to show hes not just a rote pro forma conservative a dumb conservative but someone who knows times change horizons shift he has to show he has run something or can run something romney ran a state giuliani a city mr thompson has run what a career big whoop most importantly for him and for all the republican candidates for that matter mr thompson will have to answer this question what is he running to do why should the republicans get another eight years or four years after all the missteps theyve made isnt conservatism or republicanism or whatever you call it just tired isnt it over isnt america just waiting for whatever will take its place why shouldnt liberalism get a shot could they mess up more why should we trust republicans with foreign affairs if fred thompson can answer these questions hell be showing hes something new and not just the newest candidate or the latest face reports this week said an announcement could come in june
