welcome to u s a if youre a shepherd a quirk of history and a new law could make immigration easier for a vanishing trade twin falls idaho julio cruz a shepherd lives in a covered wagon on the high desert about miles from here a somber peruvian in a floppy hat and an overlarge parka he works full time under a special visa and three year contract for a sheep grower named john noh without mr nohs permission mr cruz cant work for anyone else "if everything goes well ill stay for a couple of contracts " he says "there isnt much work in peru " from march to november in the high deserts and higher mountains of the west men like mr cruz tend their sheep all day all night all week the u s has about shepherds most come as guest workers from chile mexico or peru their legal wage ranges from &# a month in wyoming to &# in california here in idaho mr cruz earns &# the u s also has tens of thousands of legal less skilled guest workers on farms timber stands and summer resorts most of them allowed into the country for just a few months a year alone among these workers shepherds can hold year round jobs bringing their sheep down to the farm for lambing all winter and up to the desert in spring like other guests shepherds must go home when their jobs go bad they arent offered any route toward becoming american citizens now congress may change that a little noticed clause folded into the immigration overhaul announced by key senators and the white house on thursday would allow shepherds to apply for a green card after three years on the range no sponsor needed and work anywhere until it came through thousands of dairy workers may obtain the same right the provision is part of a much broader overhaul that could spread year round guest workers throughout the economy the senate will open its debate on the measure next week even as negotiations on the details continue the bill as it stands also offers new guest workers a roundabout shot at citizenship though the path is not as direct as the one proposed for shepherds the rancor is far from over however and the issue has split democrats and republicans in both houses of congress legislators still must finesse a difference of opinion at the heart of immigration history should new arrivals expect to stay permanently or go back home for reasons of politics and tradition the sheep industry has felt the effects of both ends of the argument shepherds of today fit the formula favored by those who want immigration cut back they come to do a particular job and leave when their bosses no longer need them on friday sen jon kyl of arizona raised objections to the shepherd provision lobbyists and senate staffers said the best way to meet the countrys future need for unskilled labor sen kyl said recently "is through a temporary worker system that allows people to come to the united states when work is available that they want to do and is not being done by americans but on a temporary basis " shepherds of the past by contrast were given a promise of permanent residence green cards in hand generations of them mostly basques from spain left their sheep behind and joined the middle class thats the formula favored by those who say guest workers should eventually win the freedom to sink their american roots in the s when wool and mutton clothed and fed the world the u s sheep population was million easterners kept sheep on the farm and texans fenced them into pastures but on wide open ranges from california to the dakotas growers needed manpower more than any other livestock enterprise basques came legally to herd sheep until when the quota for spanish immigrants was eliminated then as john and mark bieter tell it in "an enduring legacy the story of basques in idaho " hundreds came illegally yet by the early s western sheep owners faced a labor shortage with sheep numbers peaking at million they had the clout in congress to get their shepherds legalized and to win admission for many more in when congress created the h visa for seasonal workers sen patrick mccarran of nevada a state with many sheep pushed through a clause allowing shepherds to stay year round unlike the other workers immigrant shepherds also won the right to apply for a green card it was a right that jose mari artiach was quick to exercise today he owns a boise restaurant where a mural celebrates his first american job in an image of bucolic nostalgia a shepherd standing watch above his sheep as they graze on a mountainside the shepherd is mr artiach who was in his bar one evening having a glass of wine "i worked sheep four years " he said "then i thought i was too smart to work sheep so i started driving a truck " that was mr artiach years old came to idaho with the last of the spanish basques who had herded sheep in america since the california gold rush his contract paid &# a month in just four years mr artiach had his green card by he owned seven trucks then he became a hay broker bought a dairy herd and two farms last year he opened the restaurant his wife miren whose basque father also came to herd sheep is idahos deputy secretary of state lino zabala sipping wine across the table married mirens sister he landed here in herded sheep until his green card came through in quit to mine gold then studied mechanics and spent years working in irrigation hes retired at clinking his brother in laws glass mr artiach said "we took chances to go abroad so success comes with that maybe " when congress took up illegal immigration in everything changed spanish ruler francisco franco who had repressed basques was dead and spain was prospering instead of basques poor latinos for the most part were herding sheep congress that year preserved their visas and the u s labor departments system of setting their wages but it took their route to a green card away bruce goldstein director of a washington interest group farmworker justice blames that switch on lobbying by sheep growers "a selfish group of employers" intent on keeping their shepherds from working elsewhere he says james holt a lawyer who has represented growers for decades simply recalls that "somewhere along the line" the green card arrangement "evaporated " shepherds still come to the u s under a visa that lets them stay year round but they can stay only as long as they tend sheep on the high desert of southern idaho the sheetmetal top of mr cruzs sheepwagon was a glint in the distance as mr noh his boss approached in his pickup one recent morning mr noh runs two bands of ewes from a farm that his german great grandfather began in in spring they graze with their lambs on a acre federal lease in summer they move higher into sawtooth national forest then the fattened lambs are trucked to california for slaughter mr noh parked his pickup at the wagon and waited as mr cruz walked up with his collie the sheep far behind them were puffs on the wheat grass mr noh comes by twice a week bringing food and supplies this time he carried two drums of fresh water what else did his shepherd need mr cruz climbed up into the wagon and came out holding his last can of vienna sausages mr noh jotted down the order in his shirt pocket notebook the shepherd who speaks no english told his boss who speaks a little spanish that hed seen coyotes mr noh asked how many mr cruz stood silently finally he said "uno " "i got to get him a rifle " said mr noh times in the sheep camp arent quite so hard for mr cruz as they were for boises basques he listens to spanish on a short wave radio even calls peru on a cellphone but if he aspires to drive a truck or own a restaurant his only route now is the one taken by scores of latino shepherds each year run off and work illegally otherwise mr cruz is stuck he flew to idaho in february on a visa arranged paid for and sponsored by mr noh when mr cruzs one year visa expires mr noh can roll it over year after year but if the shepherding provision in the current immigration bills finds its way into law mr cruz could apply for his green card after three years on the range in other words he would get what the basques had its a chance that todays shepherds may jump at but one sheep owners might take some time getting used to raising dust in his pickup on another day mr noh was delivering groceries to tony villaizan who is and comes from the peruvian andes hes been herding sheep in idaho for nearly years as mr noh pulled up to the sheepwagon mr villaizan stood in its doorway wearing a biker t shirt and showing a new set of white dentures he sleeps on a bunk beneath a crocheted coverlet a tractor battery under a fold down tabletop powers a light bulb he boils rice and barley tea on a gas ring a small wood stove supplies the heat a horse grazing outside supplies the transportation he rises early to rouse his sheep from their bed ground he stays with them on horseback as they move toward water after they "noon up" and nap for three hours he guides them toward fresh grass at nightfall the sheep bed near camp for protection he cooks dinner drinks a warm beer and sometimes puts in a brief call to his family he has two daughters in peru "i did the same work when i was a kid staying out like this " mr villaizan said with an interpreters help pay started at &# a month in peru and topped out at &# in the u s he made &# to start mr noh pays &# enough to finance a house in peru and a set of teeth "im comfortable with sheep " said mr villaizan "if you got a green card " asked mr noh "what would you do " "even then id work in sheep " his shepherd said "this is my favorite man right here " said mr noh then mr villaizan added "id like to make more money " more money though is what mr noh and most other sheep growers in the west say they cant offer their fortunes and their influence have gone the way of the countrys taste for lamb americans eat just a pound of it a year thanks to synthetics demand for wool is a tenth of what it was in the sheep population has dwindled to six million and with it the growers political capital in the latest immigration haggling they havent been ignored shepherds will get the same long stay and monthly pay but restoring their green cards wasnt on the industrys wish list "thats nothing we pursued or asked for " says peter orwick one of its lobbyists rather the green card clause was inserted by western legislators as a nod to groups like farmworker justice who argue that visas for full time guest workers ought to lead to permanent residence a few weeks ago sen patrick leahy of vermont added dairy workers to the clause greatly expanding its scope in the compromise presented to the senate on thursday the possibility of permanence was extended to all future guest workers a limited number could apply for green cards under a merit based points system unlike skilled workers however most would ultimately have to go home for some conservatives and labor unions even those terms are too generous while pro immigration groups condemned the proposal as an affront to american values "indenture" is the word mr goldstein of farmworker justice uses to describe the guest worker deal for shepherds he wants nothing short of a legal means to come in from the desert "for people who want out of those jobs " he says "that means they can get out and will get out " toward sundown mr noh left the sheep camp and drove to twin falls for a beer at jakers where the rack of lamb &# comes from australia what would he do if mr villaizan got his green card "id sit down with him and offer him as much as i could " mr noh said "id try to help him bring his daughters here if i could teach him to drive a little better id move him into a position where hed be camp tending like im doing now thats my hope for tony id do the business end tony would move up " when mr noh thinks about his shepherds future he has a role model in mind ambrosio aspiazu he came to america to herd sheep for mr nohs family in when his green card came through he became their camp tender and then their foreman as a child mr noh trailed after him learning all there was to know about sheep mr aspiazu had saved half a million dollars by the time he retired in last year he sold his house in idaho and moved back to the basque country where he was born
