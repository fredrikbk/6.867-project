cross country l a dodger los angeles this year may day was no walk in the park for mayor antonio villaraigosa a few thousand people showed up at macarthur park to demonstrate for immigrant worker rights before long police were shooting rubber bullets at protestors and even pushing aside outraged reporters after dozens of people began throwing bottles and creating a civil disturbance rather than isolate the troublemakers the police broke up the entire demonstration almost two years into mr villaraigosas first term this was the kind of scene that could cast a dark mood over the democrats mayoralty and he was slow to understand that he was traveling on a trade mission in mexico when the disturbance occurred and although other california officials urged him to get back to los angeles immediately he waited a few days he was barely back when police chief william bratton already well into an investigation reassigned one commander and demoted another not a good example of leadership for a mayor eyeing the governors race when arnold schwarzenegger will be term limited out a screenplay about los angeles these days would likely feature a charismatic mayor rushing from event to event proclaiming his intention to remake a badly aging city decrying police misbehavior declaring war on gangs and bad schools and delivering when a disaster hits but mayor villaraigosa hasnt exactly been a man of measurable results one leadership failure came in his decision to seize control of the los angeles unified school district lausd which he says would allow him to impose necessary reforms but his plan is fraught with problems its been alternatively ignored and opposed by other democratic officials he did manage to get a law passed through the state legislature giving him control of a handful of schools but a state court soon overturned the law on solid constitutional grounds next mr villaraigosa started backing enough candidates to gain a majority of support on the school board and he suddenly jumped on a "gang crisis" as his new passion he compiled a list of the " worst gangs" in the city but as my newspaper the l a weekly discovered the list is a fantasy it is peppered with lesser gangs along with some of the worst gangs to satisfy geographic and racial imperatives mr villaraigosa is promising to get &# million from the city budget to fight gang violence and help youths even here however the mayor isnt really doing much about &# million of that money is already earmarked for existing programs hes promising to deliver whats already being delivered moreover little of it addresses gang violence our paper reported that one program spends &# per child on golf lessons while mr villaraigosa portrays himself as a warrior against disastrous schools and a city controlled by gangs most residents seem concerned about more mundane quality of life issues the nasty traffic bad development and spreading decay in tattered neighborhoods that are driving residents out when it comes to achievements on these counts there is surprisingly little to report mr villaraigosa is popular but he is the most bustling l a mayor to achieve so measurably little since well perhaps forever greg nelson a former city department head and former city council chief of staff says "id hope to see him commit to specific and measurable things and then hope for five of them but since i am not seeing any of that i tend to wonder if it is a lot of showmanship " despite his insistence on a gang crisis crime is dropping in los angeles the second safest big city in the u s ugly black eyes such as prostitute riddled hollywood were cleaned up by past mayors james hahn and richard riordan gang violence its well below the levels of five or six years ago a spike in gang crime in is the very thin evidence upon which mr villaraigosa erects a "crisis " one civic booster privately calls mr villaraigosas over hyped war on gangs "a classic middle class stunt" designed to prove he can be governor the same hollywood production feel permeates his battle for control of public schools in the year since the wall street journal interviewed mr villaraigosa about his school reform dreams he has achieved little meanwhile he has demoralized real reformers by downplaying the near miracle in l a s elementary schools where test scores have undergone their first serious turnaround in years jonathan wilcox a political consultant and professor at the university of southern californias annenberg school for communication who teaches a course on celebrity and society says the mayor has "attached no policies to what was a political move to take over the schools to his people school reform was getting that school takeover bill put into law " that came to naught although in last tuesdays school board elections mr villaraigosas supporters won a majority of seats and yet with a net annual loss of about local taxpayers a measure of middle class flight the mayor seems oblivious to the small ugly things that make residents bolt abandoned sofas piled onto third world esque santa monica boulevard taggers scrawling graffiti throughout silver lake tree hating landlords wiping out greenery in piping hot san fernando valley mr villaraigosa once promised to plant one million shade trees but says mr wilcox "to his people tackling basic issues like that sets them up for a bad media story or a future negative campaign commercial because unlike the signature achievement of school reform or a war on gangs these simpler efforts can actually be measured if he fails " neglecting basic issues costs the city dearly compared to nearby jurisdictions l a residents are more likely to leave the city to buy a new or used car thus avoiding l a s gross receipts tax the less sexy but ignored issues are "the taproot of l a s problems " says steven frates senior fellow at the rose institute of state and local government at claremont mckenna college "what you see is very poor public policy this mayor to my knowledge has not yet begun to address it " the likable mayor is a fine leading man but the city would be better served if he took care of off camera issues that in the calculus of the governors race wont earn him a single credit ms stewart a longtime california political reporter is deputy editor of news at l a weekly see related letter "letters to the editor los angeles gangs
