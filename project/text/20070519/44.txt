pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece it was years ago today with sgt pepper the beatles indulged their whims and changed rock forever anatomy of a classic its possible for two reasonable adults probably older than to argue for hours about the most significant pop music event of the s my own vote would be cast in favor of the beatles first appearance on "the ed sullivan show" in february but a very close second is the release of their "sgt peppers lonely hearts club band " the majestic album that will be years old in early june its not that "sgt pepper" is my favorite record from that era bob dylans "blonde on blonde" is but theres no denying the extraordinary influence that the beatles most famous achievement had not only in the music industry but this countrys popular culture as well "sgt pepper " the groups first album that wasnt supported by a world wide tour captured to use a word that didnt become a cliche for years afterward the "zeitgeist" then impeccably in sync with the "summer of love " "flower power " psychedelia and the youthful lifestyle of sex drugs and rock n roll that the beatles weary of avoiding hordes of fans and tabloid reporters abandoned live concerts was in itself a radical shift of gears but spending more than four months in a recording studio on a single project and a "concept" album at that was unheard of revisionists today when critiquing the beatles discography arent quite as rapturous about "sgt pepper" as millions of fans were in but the immediate impact of the album cant be overstated when "sgt pepper" appeared it was as if a massive block party had appeared outside your window i was nearly years old at the time and when one of my four older brothers came home with the highly anticipated new beatles record we listened to it over and over marveling at the sheer audacity of songwriters john lennon and paul mccartney doug overwhelmed by enthusiasm and hyperbole declared matter of factly "the band has changed its name forever and rock n roll will never be the same " and it wasnt just the music the album cover itself was breathtaking a puzzling and colorful collage by peter blake that showed the band in gaudy mock military costumes presiding over the burial of the "old" beatles with scattered mug shots of high and low cultural icons hovering in the background youd go cross eyed trying to figure out just how many notables were depicted a mass of pop art that included marilyn monroe karl marx aldous huxley marlene dietrich sonny liston laurel and hardy oscar wilde marlon brando leo gorcey bob dylan lenny bruce and mae west the presentation was a triumph of packaging and included for the first time the printing of lyrics on the back cover that the group had reached this point a mere three years after the first rush of "beatlemania" was astonishing and the songs simply ratcheted up the sense of momentousness provided by the record sleeve relieved from the pressure of performing live the beatles were able to record songs that were even in a relatively primitive studio filled with overdubs backward tape loops snippets of orchestral crescendos a cowbell here a tin horn there creating a sound and style that was quickly for better or worse aped by the bands peers and imitators aside from the technical innovations the songs ushered in yet another phase for the beatles one that was far more introspective grandiose and certainly informed by their recreational use of drugs forty years later its easy to dismiss such lyrically slight songs as mr mccartneys "when im sixty four" or george harrisons meandering sitar driven "within you without you " but the bulk of "sgt pepper" stands the test of time for example john lennons "being for the benefit of mr kite " is about an evening vaudeville romp where "henry the horse dances the waltz" and men leap through "a hogshead of real fire " another standout is mr mccartneys "fixing a hole " a dreamy and druggy meditation about fame and drudgery he sings about "filling the cracks" in his door that "kept his mind from wandering " and chastises those who "disagree and never win and wonder why they dont get in my door " its not exactly t s eliot as some said at the time but its a long way from "i want to hold your hand " on one point there is almost universal agreement "a day in the life " a five minute lennon mccartney collaboration that concludes "sgt pepper " is the groups most accomplished song combining references to british current events and the narrators utter boredom with urban routines the song endorses the notion of dropping out of society as mr lennon sings dreamily "id love to turn you on " although "sgt pepper" received almost unanimous raves when it was released a significant dissident was richard goldstein who panned the album in the june new york times mr goldstein roundly pilloried after the review was published complained the new release was "busy hip and cluttered " he concludes "we need the beatles not as cloistered composers but as companions and they need us " as was soon evident however the beatles didnt "need us " and in fact didnt need each other the group disbanded just three years later mr goldstein was partially correct in saying that "sgt peppers lonely hearts club band" was "precious " but years later i cant think of a single album that was more influential in changing the way that lyricists producers and fans went about making and consuming popular music its said that mr mccartney in particular was inspired by the beach boys landmark album "pet sounds " in which leader brian wilson labored in the studio to create a unified set of songs that challenged the listener and his competitors with its musical complexity but it was the beatles so popular and wealthy that their record label had to cater to what were considered "whims " who topped mr wilson artistically and commercially with "sgt pepper " it was no longer a given that a rock pop group would dash off an album as quickly as possible to minimize cost and talented young men began to exert more control over studio production a process of increased sophistication the release of "sgt pepper" marked the shift of power in the music industry not all that dissimilar to the advent of free agency in major league baseball from the "suits" to the stars and to this day the balance hasnt changed mr smith writes a weekly column for new york press see related letters "letters to the editor even blank spaces are famous on the sgt pepper album cover" wsj may
