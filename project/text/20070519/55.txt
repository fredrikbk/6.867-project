retail health clinics are a return to an earlier form of medical care grace marie turner offers favorable evidence about the rise of retail health clinics but only on the surface are they "consumer friendly innovations" "customer health care " editorial page may the fact is they are not innovations they are a return to the type of health care that existed until the advent of managed care in the late th century before managed care health care remained settled within the community the patient was dispensed medication by the town chemist whose apothecary was at most a few doors down from the office of the local physician since managed care the patient has had to traverse the self interested arrangements and managements of organizations that concentrate power so as to largely remove the patient and physician from freedom of choice over health care related decisions yet during that transformation and into the st century the demands of the patient remain the same as they ever were at no time in history regardless of circumstances have patients wanted anything more than the assurance that their medical needs are well protected by a trusted relationship that is they have always wanted access to services at prices that both they and their health care provider could agree is just this appears to be the function of the retail health clinics so in the absence of alternatives to the rigid models of "universal health care" and "consumer driven care " it may be that these clinics provide a simple aggressive way forward for our complex retarded health care system lee h igel ph d assistant professor new york university school of continuing and professional studies new york while grace marie turners commentary might make retail health clinics sound like a good health care option the reality is that they are not appropriate for infants children and adolescents the american academy of pediatrics aap strongly discourages parents from taking their children to these clinics first care may become fragmented for those children who sometimes go to a pediatrician and sometimes a retail health clinic there is no continuity of care and no relationship established second making a diagnosis without the childs complete medical history is risky and underlying conditions can go undetected without proper follow up what started out as something minor could turn into something more serious third public health issues could result from patients with contagious diseases visiting the store do you really want to be waiting in the checkout line behind a child with pink eye we realize that what these clinics do offer is convenience which is why the aap urges more pediatricians to provide longer office hours including evenings and weekends many pediatricians have been doing this already for many years the bottom line is that children are our future and they deserve the best quality health care so that they can become healthy adults you cant find that at a retail store jay e berkelhamer m d faap president american academy of pediatrics grove village ill
