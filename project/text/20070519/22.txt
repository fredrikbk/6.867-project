irans enablers as irans violations of its nuclear nonproliferation obligations have been revealed u n sanctions have been imposed and economic pressures have been multilateralized since none of this has stopped irans seemingly inexorable progress toward nuclear weapons many have concluded that there are only two realistic options war or engagement in fact it is too early to give up on multilateral economic pressure there is significant unexploited potential for leverage against the islamic republic because iran is tightly bound to the world in a vast web of trade and financial relationships limited u n sanctions have yet to compel the rest of the world to exercise this leverage and even americas closest allies have so far avoided jeopardizing lucrative trade and investment relationships with iran so before we despair about sanctions we should redouble our efforts to persuade other countries to join us in applying meaningful economic pressure dozens of nations pour billions worth of financial support into iran world wide since we were able to document reporting on more than &# billion worth of major contracts or agreements and both private and government lines of credit altogether separate transactions with iranian entities public and private the details compiled in our database www aei org iraninteractive are not to be found anywhere including the u s treasury department in a study of open source reporting since we found indications that countries have used public export credit agencies funded by taxpayers to underwrite at least &# billion worth of business with iran in addition private banks have individually or through consortia funded at least &# billion worth of multiyear foreign direct investment and while the petroleum sector is clearly a magnet for investors lured by irans immense oil and gas reserves the transportation construction power and telecom sectors were also attractive to outsiders since french companies and financial institutions working individually or through international consortia have signaled their intent to ink deals worth more than &# billion with iran china germany and italy followed closely these figures represent only published reports most nations have imposed few restrictions on trade or investment with iran washingtons draconian bilateral trading sanctions with carve outs only for food and medicine are the exception even u s sanctions are not airtight permitting american firms such as coca cola pepsi and halliburton to lawfully trade halliburton has announced that it will pull out as a result and despite a finding of non compliance with its safeguards obligations under the nuclear non proliferation treaty in and subsequent condemnations by the international atomic energy agency iran continued to attract eager investors and more importantly generous financing in the u n security council frustrated with iranian intransigence over its nuclear program adopted unscr banning the supply of nuclear related technology and materials to tehran and freezing the assets of key individuals and companies related to the enrichment program unscr adopted in march of expanded the freeze imposed an embargo on iranian arms exports and imposed additional visa restrictions it stops short of a ban on financing merely calling upon "states and international financial institutions not to enter into new commitments for grants financial assistance and concessional loans to the government of the islamic republic of iran except for humanitarian and developmental purposes " notwithstanding iaea condemnations and u n security council resolutions between and iran secured more than a billion dollars in world bank financing for a public works projects a variety of national export credit agencies were just as generous in sace italys taxpayer funded export credit bank reportedly underwrote a &# billion loan for power plant conversions throughout iran the next year brought &# million more in financing for road construction between and germanys export credit bank hermes underwrote nine projects in iran four in and after irans illegal nuclear program was revealed covering everything from a billion dollar french credit agricole loan to a thousand megawatt power plant in tarehsar frances coface was equally active with five loans between and now worth nearly &# billion other export credit agencies in particular japans bank for international cooperation were also active in funneling taxpayer financing to various projects often with iranian state owned enterprises the value of this credit is difficult to pin down as most such banks do not make public their records however reporting to the berne union the international union of credit and investment insurers for the period through clocks italy at &# billion in total commitments for iran directed business germany at &# billion korea at &# billion france at &# billion and spain and austria close behind experts believe these numbers significantly under represent japans export credits lately in response to u s pressure european and asian governments have begun to ratchet back export credits for business in iran u s treasury department officials report that two swiss banks ubs and credit suisse and hollands abn amro have pulled back as has u k based hsbc energy companies such as baker hughes conocophillips and bp plc have cooled on tehran across the board fewer investors are plunging into iranian waters but overall business remains brisk and the value of new transactions has skyrocketed in the value of publicly reported foreign investment in iran including multiyear investments was slightly under &# billion for it is &# billion because of several high value projects from tehrans point of view offering multiyear contracts and guaranteeing long term cooperation with its foreign partners can mitigate the negative effects the overall decline in foreign investment has on its economy since january the netherlands shell spains repsol austrias omv chinas sinopec and malaysias sks have each signed tentative agreements to develop irans gas infrastructure and exporting capabilities the smallest of these contracts is an estimated &# billion and tehran has secured for itself a long term commitment from european and asian companies to explore extract and develop its energy resources additionally irans foreign partners help guarantee that iran will break into established european and asian markets for instance last month austrian state controlled energy giant omv ag signed an &# billion energy contract with iran in turn the austrian government has agreed to import two billion tons of gas from iran over the next years for iran entirely dependent on the outside world for its economy the news remains mostly good american pressure on investors has had some impact but where some have withdrawn others have taken their place japan irans prime trading partner until dropped to number nine in but china stepped in and is now irans main partner many export credit agencies and companies also avoid the kind of public scrutiny that might force a reassessment by withholding information but things can change there is a growing divestment movement modeled on the campaign against south africas apartheid regime florida recently passed legislation requiring the state pension fund to screen approximately &# billion for holdings in companies doing business with or investing in irans oil sector california and other states are headed in the same direction shareholders and taxpayers in europe have been slow to awaken to the risks of business with iran let alone the risks of its nuclear weapons program but awareness is growing will a squeeze on irans pocketbook force a fundamental reassessment in tehran even limited u n sanctions have prompted squabbling among factions in the regime iran is after all very dependent on the outside world for cash ratcheting up the pressure significantly may not dissuade the supreme leader of the wisdom of a nuclear weapons arsenal but it could well slow the program down and enable the international community and irans own population the time to cobble together a more effective strategy to end the program or force the mullahs from power at the very minimum understanding just who is underwriting iran will provide accountability and increased leverage against one of the worlds most dangerous regimes ms pletka is vice president for foreign policy and defense studies and mr jafari is a research associate at the american enterprise institute
