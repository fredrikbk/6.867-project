tax resolution with all the other news this week the media barely noticed that congressional democrats passed a budget outline that envisions more than &# billion in tax increases over five years seems worth reporting to us to read the brochure the resolution would fund national priorities produce a whopping budget surplus and do it all without "new" taxes in reality the resolution would increase spending substantially and allow president bushs tax cuts to expire causing most tax rates to snap back to their clinton era levels after democrats tried to cover themselves politically on taxes by leaving room to extend some of the targeted bush tax cuts for another two years to these include the per child tax credit and income tax bracket ironically these tax cuts are the most "expensive" in terms of lost federal revenue because they do little to change incentives to work or invest meanwhile the democratic budget anticipates the expiration of the tax rates on capital gains and dividends as well as the lower income tax rates for everyone except low income earners these are the tax cuts that helped kick the economy out of its post bubble post post sarbanes oxley stupor starting in federal revenues have since climbed so rapidly that this year they may reach of gdp above the year modern average of apparently democrats think this tax windfall isnt enough as for spending the budget outline adds &# billion to the presidents &# billion proposal for discretionary accounts the kind that need to be approved every year democrats will now have to write their specific spending priorities into assorted bills that mr bush will have a chance to sign or veto white house budget director rob portman says hell recommend a veto for bills that exceed mr bushs overall spending "cap " we hope he means it
