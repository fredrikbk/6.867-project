china answers critics ahead of talks beijing will raise rates widen the yuans range stock market concerns with trade tensions and worries about a stock market bubble growing china announced several steps designed to address criticism of its economic management raising interest rates and making a rare but largely symbolic change to its currency policy the moves came just days before economic talks in washington led by u s treasury secretary henry paulson and chinese vice premier wu yi at which u s complaints that china keeps its currency artificially low are expected to figure prominently in addition to the rate increase chinas central bank said friday it would widen the yuans daily trading range a move that could theoretically facilitate greater appreciation the timing appeared aimed at showing that china is moving forward both on the contentious political issue of currency reform and on addressing the risk of economic excesses after several years of plus growth both issues have become subjects of intense interest to investors policy makers business executives and labor leaders around the globe given the heft of chinas economy now the worlds fourth largest analysts said fridays interest rate rise could help tame enthusiasm in the rocketing stock market whose surge this year is feeding concerns among government officials and others that it could lead to a sudden painful reversal the increase follows a rise in march representing the quickest back to back interest rate tightening since at least and was coupled with another central bank adjustment aimed at reducing the share of deposits banks can lend but the currency move the first major change to chinas exchange rate mechanism since the yuan was revalued in mid likely wont satisfy chinas critics in washington who argue that beijing suppresses the yuans value to make its exports artificially inexpensive the central bank said the daily range within which the yuan can trade against the u s dollar will widen to plus or minus from previously that probably wont have much real impact on the yuans value because the currency almost never approaches the limits of the existing trading band in announcing the change the central bank said it didnt mean the yuan would appreciate by a large margin "this is a nice gesture but in the past most of their gestures have not produced any concrete change " said sen charles schumer d n y one of chinas most prominent critics on capitol hill "to widen the band is well and good but if they dont use the band nothing will happen " mr paulson and the bush administration are trying to walk a fine line between urging faster liberalization of chinas economy and keeping congress from taking steps that might plunge the two countries into a trade war the central banks move is "a useful step toward greater flexibility and eventual float of the currency " treasurys china envoy alan holmer told reporters friday "its important now that chinese authorities use the wider band and allow greater movement within each day and over time " many economists had expected rate increases like the one announced friday thanks to recent economic growth and the raging bull market that has propelled the benchmark shanghai stock index up so far this year as of saturday the central bank said the benchmark one year lending rate will rise percentage point to while the rate on one year fixed savings deposits will be lifted by percentage point to the central bank also raised the reserve requirement ratio the share of deposits lenders must keep in reserve and cant lend out to the eighth such increase in less than a year economists said that with the unusual move to announce several modest policy changes together the central bank probably hoped to appear more aggressive than it actually is thereby deterring speculation without clamping down too much on real economic activity "chinas real economic data do not yet signal the economy is overheating " said ben simpfendorfer an economist in hong kong with royal bank of scotland "however if the authorities do not act forcefully there is a risk that investment and inflation growth rates will accelerate " indeed the rate increases seem aimed more at tempering enthusiasm for stocks than slowing the economy the central bank published a survey this past week that found a record low desire to deposit money in banks along with record high interest in stocks by raising deposit rates by a wider margin than lending rates the bank makes bank deposits more attractive while limiting the blow to mortgage holders and other borrowers the surging stock market is a dilemma for beijing which wants the market to thrive but fears a sudden collapse could trigger public anger some chinese officials have publicly signaled concern about market levels and fund managers and others have been warned in recent weeks against speculative practices investors have continued to pour money into chinese stocks even as the government has taken other measures to cool its domestic markets including one this month to make it easier for chinese investors to invest in stocks overseas the rate
