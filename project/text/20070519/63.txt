the week ahead our take on coming events iran nuclear report could require fancy footwork by candidates by gerald f seib note to presidential contenders it isnt just iraq any longer iran is about to move in as a significant headache for all presidential wannabes iran will reach this status next week when the international atomic energy agency issues a report on the countrys nuclear capabilities that report is expected to declare that a recent inspection showed iran making faster progress than previously thought toward enriching uranium on a large scale that will prompt a rethinking of how much closer iran is toward having the capability to produce nuclear warheads experts will continue to disagree over exactly how close it may be but for the presidential candidates this still will produce a special kind of quandary and an especially acute one for democratic contenders the trick for all candidates will be to sound tough enough on iran to show they take the nuclear problem seriously without setting off alarm bells among voters weary of one war in iraq and leery of a second one in iran sen john mccain r ariz already got into a bit of hot water on that front when he flippantly answered a voters question about iran by riffing on the old beach boys tune "barbara ann " substituting the words "bomb iran " the balance most republicans will try to strike was summarized by former virginia gov jim gilmore at the republican debate in south carolina a few days ago he said the u s should work with other countries to impose "serious mandatory sanctions" against iran but then raised the prospect of a military attack "i think the american people have to at some point come to a real serious conclusion about the tough decision that has to be made when we may have to in fact strike " the balance is trickier for democrats because they are playing to a party base that has become increasingly antiwar because of the conflict in iraq moreover the top candidates are operating in a field where fringe candidates are disparaging any suggestion that military action against iran is an option thus the formula that might work for republicans such as mr gilmore a call for economic sanctions that leaves open the prospect of military action is tougher to pull off for a democrat the difficulty was illustrated at the first democratic debate last month when illinois sen barack obama was thrown on the defensive on iran in a recent extensive national security speech he had declared "we must never take the military option off the table" in trying to stop the nuclear programs of iran and north korea that brought attacks from the left from both former alaska sen mike gravel and ohio rep dennis kucinich who virtually accused sen obama of war mongering he responded by saying irans possession of nuclear weapons would be a "major threat " but also felt compelled to add "i think it would be a profound mistake for us to initiate a war with iran " the balancing act for him and others isnt going to get any easier in the days ahead france as sarkozy moves in how long are ministers leashes by david gauthier villars frances new government a minister medley of conservatives centrists and a socialist gets to work next week on a long list of economic and social measures president nicolas sarkozy promises will pull the worlds sixth largest economy out of a deep malaise but a key question looms as mr sarkozy settles into the elysee presidential palace how long a leash will he give his ministers minutes after the cabinet was unveiled friday mr sarkozy flew to airbuss headquarters in toulouse to meet management and unions over a restructuring plan for the struggling european plane maker a unit of european aeronautic defence &amp space co such a visit would normally be made by an industry minister but a spokeswoman for new prime minister francois fillon said it was still unclear who in the new cabinet would be in charge of the strategic industry brief which includes hot topics such as outsourcing of manufacturing jobs foreign raids on french companies and the fate of national industrial champions the toulouse visit by mr sarkozy the son of a hungarian immigrant known for his brash management style was an early sign that he wants to extend his political oversight beyond the constitutional duties of defense and foreign policies in choosing his cabinet however mr sarkozy took some unusual conciliatory steps by opening up his cabinet to politicians from rival camps socialist bernard kouchner was named foreign minister and centrist herve morin defense minister mr sarkozy is trying to bridge the traditional right left divide that has dominated french politics for decades and pursue more consensus driven policies that might help mr sarkozy meet less resistance in pushing through his ambitious platform to slash frances bloated state bureaucracy keep immigration in check and free business from rigid labor laws by reaching out to political forces beyond his conservative ump party mr sarkozy also hopes to gain a comfortable parliamentary majority in frances legislative elections next month the socialists immediately tried to neutralize mr sarkozys move by evicting mr kouchner within minutes of his appointment the centrist party of francois bayrou who has seen his political base melt as supporters have joined the ranks of mr sarkozy dismissed the presidents overtures as a political gimmick the new government includes former prime minister alain juppe a longtime supporter of departing president jacques chirac who will be in charge of environment issues he will handle transport policies jean louis borloo who was in charge of social affairs in the outgoing government was named economy and employment minister high on the agenda of mr borloo a centrist lawmaker whose movement is affiliated with the ump party will be to make good on the presidents promise to halve the countrys unemployment rate to deal with the states billowing budget mr sarkozy has created a ministry of accounts which will also handle the health care and pensions budget at the helm he named eric woerth who worked for the arthur andersen consultancy firm in s in a sign that france may change its controversial approach to agricultural issues former trade minister and free trade advocate christine lagarde was named agriculture minister under mr chirac france refused to let the european union reduce its longstanding subsidies for agriculture ms lagarde will be one of seven women in the person government among the other appointed women ministers is rachida dati a magistrate of mixed moroccan algerian origin who was given the justice portfolio corporate scandals belgian enron on trial at last by william echikson and mark maremont more than six years after belgiums lernout &amp hauspie speech products filed for bankruptcy in the wake of an alleged massive accounting scandal its former founders and managers will finally appear in court monday in the first phase of their trial on numerous criminal charges the case enjoys similarities with the corporate scandals such as enron and worldcom that rocked the u s while also underlining some trans atlantic differences in dealing with them twelve company officials one of the companys outside lawyers a banker and an accountant have been indicted on counts ranging from falsifying company results to forging documents and manipulating the companys stock price they face jail terms and fines if convicted lernouts bankers dexia sa and kpmg internationals belgian accounting subsidiary have been indicted as corporate entities for the same offenses they face fines and could have to pay the damages of the individual defendants some belgian investors are frustrated by the long delay in getting the trial started because any civil actions to recover damages must await the ending of the criminal trial they are clamoring for the country to change its law to allow u s style class action suits at present each investor must file a separate lawsuit "the u s moves much faster than us " because "defendants there face the sword of damocles" in class action suits says jean philippe ducart of the consumer group test achats his organization represents some investors who claim &# million in damages another peculiarity because the wall street journal broke the story in and a u s securities and exchange commission investigation followed some defendants are blaming a u s conspiracy for the companys collapse frank vandecaveye the editor of focus on flanders a press review of the flemish media says there is even a small minority who believe "the whole bankruptcy was organized by the cia to protect intelligence technology or at least to keep the technology in the u s " no evidence has been produced to support these charges the case could drag on for months or years the initial phase of the trial will consist of procedural matters and is scheduled to last to the end of may it will resume toward the end of this year with lawyers saying its final length will depend on how many witnesses are called civil suits filed by test achats and others can take place only after the criminal trial before its collapse lernout &amp hauspie was hailed as one of europes rare technology success stories founded by two belgian entrepreneurs the company emerged as a major world player in speech recognition software using its highflying stock to buy up u s rivals at one point it had a market value of nearly &# billion the dream ended in late when lernout &amp hauspie filed for bankruptcy protection amid an accounting scandal an internal investigation concluded that as much as a third of its revenue in the prior years had been improperly recorded while a subsequent probe conducted at the behest of new management found that most sales in the companys supposedly large south korean unit had been fabricated at the heart of lernout &amp hauspies woes was a repeated pattern of recording revenue from supposedly independent parties that in reality were funded by lernout &amp hauspie or related entities in a interview co founder jo lernout defended the accounting practices as proper the company eventually was disbanded and its assets sold for a tiny fraction of their earlier value in any case dont expect a quick trial "theres a long list of charges and if as some defendants have suggested they are going to even call our belgian prince philippe to the stand as a technology witness the sky is the limit for this trial " says bernard thuysbaert an official of deminor a belgian association of small investors
