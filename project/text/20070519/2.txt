bernankes false dichotomy responding to the declining u s role in global capital markets federal reserve chairman ben bernanke called tuesday for moving away from the detailed rules of u s financial regulation toward the "principles based risk based" system of the financial services authority fsa in the united kingdom however this is a false dichotomy although the principles of the fsa are stated in fewer than words its rulebook has more than pages a regulatory system needs a mix of general principles and detailed rules optimally the mix should be based on the regulatory functions to be performed the subject matter to be regulated and the litigation risks associated with the regulation general principles have distinct advantages they are flexible enough to accommodate new financial instruments they allow detailed rules to be avoided on certain issues which can be addressed by references to general principles and they act as safety valves trumping the application of specific rules that together lead to inappropriate results general principles are most useful where their application is transparent and readily understood in the u s and the u k tender offers are for example regulated through a few general principles supplemented by a small set of procedural rules this works well because the main players in a tender offer can easily see and protest if needed the application of the relevant regulatory principles that minority shareholders receive equivalent consideration to large shareholders that neither the bidder nor the target receive favored treatment and that both make adequate disclosures to investors by contrast no regulator should rely on general principles in determining the unfunded liabilities of a defined benefit plan this determination involves projected accruals for current workers expected longevity of retired workers and the choice of a discount rate given the complexity of these factors the calculation should be governed by detailed rules to avoid inconsistent results among similar companies detailed rules have three key advantages first they promote consistent treatment of regulatory issues across companies which will be undermined if loopholes in the rules can be exploited by certain companies second detailed rules can reduce the time and effort needed to resolve a complex regulatory issue rather than thinking through all the aspects of an issue just follow the directions third and most importantly they provide considerable protection if executives follow the precise steps in the rule they have a strong defense against lawsuits in the u s companies are much more likely to be sued and for much larger amounts than in europe in this environment u s companies are better able to reduce their litigation risks by following bright line rules than by attempting to abide by general principles the secs anti fraud rules for example are couched in terms of general principles a person shall not engage in any "deceptive or manipulative" act or practice in connection with a securities trade as a result a company executive cannot easily predict how the courts would apply this anti fraud rule to many class actions similarly the sec brings many more enforcement cases than the fsa which often resolves problems through informal consultation in addition a financial institution must deal with only one regulator in london while that institution would be subject to multiple regulators in the u s each with a different perspective given possible differences in interpretation and a relatively high incidence of enforcement actions u s firms can find more comfort in bright line rules than vague regulatory principles instead of chasing a holy grail of principles based regulation in the u s context we should improve the drafting of detailed rules some rules e g hedge accounting are simply too long and complex to provide the clear and efficient guidance that detailed rules should offer others are too rigidly drafted they do not allow for exceptions consistent with the general principles behind the rules moreover major rules should be revisited periodically to see how they are actually working we should also try out alternative ways to adopt rules the worst way is for a public agency to unilaterally announce new ones instead new rules should be promulgated in draft form for public comment so that they will become as workable and clear as practical in some areas industry groups could take the lead in proposing rules subject to veto by a public agency this is the approach taken by self regulatory bodies like the nyse subject to the oversight of the sec in other areas the details of the regulation could be left to the market participant after the framework was established by a public agency this is the approach taken by basle ii on bank capital requirements which allows large banks to utilize their own risk models within the parameters set by the banking agencies finally u s regulators should follow a risk based approach to rules as well as to principles the adoption of rules should be targeted at areas where large groups of investors are at risk while efforts to enforce rules should concentrate on the biggest players in the sector and those with typical patterns of egregious conduct mr pozen is chairman of mfs investment management see related letter "letters to the
