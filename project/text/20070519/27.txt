hot topic immigration whats in the new bill senate republicans and democrats reached a delicate compromise on an ambitious bill to overhaul the nations immigration policy the deal would provide legal status to some million immigrants who entered the u s illegally and offer an eventual path to citizenship it aims to staunch the flow of future illegal immigrants by boosting border security and creating a guest worker program it would also recalibrate a longstanding policy that gives preference to immigrants with family in the u s by giving added weight to immigrants with job skills including education and english proficiency the bill which president bush wants to sign by the end of summer is likely his last chance at reaching a "grand bargain" to cement a legacy issue for his administration a similar accord last year collapsed in the house under republican divisions and a compromise filled with political risks will become more difficult to reach as the elections draw closer heres a closer look illegal immigrants the biggest question centers on what to do with the estimated million illegal immigrants living in the u s the proposal would create a new "z visa" and immediate work authorization for illegal immigrants who had entered the country before jan z visa applicants would have to pass a background check pay as much as &# in fines and fees and pass an english proficiency test visas would be renewable every four years for &# the department of homeland security estimates that to of immigrants would be ineligible because of their criminal record visa holders would eventually be able to apply for a green card which provides legal permanent resident status and is a step to citizenship but they would have to return to their home country to apply applications wouldnt be considered until the current backlog of green cards is cleared which will take about eight years altogether it would take between eight and years to receive a green card more than million people obtained green cards last year up from million in and in and about of those recipients already lived in the u s either on a temporary visa or without documentation guest workers the bill creates a new temporary "y visa" for as many as guest workers roughly equal to the number of illegal immigrants who enter the u s every year workers could come to the u s for two years at a time and the visa could be renewed twice for a total of six years but workers would have to return home for a year in between each stay only guest workers could become permanent residents a separate program would provide temporary legal status to as many as million undocumented agricultural workers in a five year pilot project that would allow those who continued to work on farms to apply for a green card border security the bill wouldnt allow the government to issue any visas until it meets certain "triggers " including the addition of new border security officers miles of new border fence miles of vehicle barriers and surveillance towers most estimates say it would take about months to meet those triggers employers also would have to verify whether job applicants were eligible to work in the country using a new electronic worker registry economic preference the bill would restructure u s immigration policy that since has given preference to applicants with relatives in the u s the new policy would limit family visas to just young children and spouses of immigrants while substantially increasing the number of immigrants admitted on economic merits using an as yet undetermined point system such a system would reward workers with english proficiency experience living in the u s an employers endorsement and higher levels of education especially in science math and technology it would favor workers with skills for jobs that the bureau of labor statistics sees as the fastest growing including software engineers and nurses but many of those jobs are low skilled slightly less than half of the fastest growing jobs require a bachelors degree last year green cards about two thirds of the total issued were sponsored by families of citizens or legal residents compared with the or that were employer sponsored the proposed legislation would award family based visas and merit based visas after the current backlog has been cleared nick timiraos points of view the agreement reached today is one that will help enforce our borders but equally importantly it will treat people with respect " president george w bush "this rewards people who broke the law with permanent legal status and puts them ahead of millions of law abiding immigrants waiting to come to america " sen jim demint r s c facts voters in the dallas suburb of farmers branch texas overwhelmingly approved an
