getting going lessons from markets mayhem in the classroom corporal punishment is frowned upon in the financial markets its a way of life yes we are once again getting whacked across the side of the head with the dow jones industrial average plunging points last week including a drop of on thursday hurting this time maybe we should learn our lesson i dont know whether the past weeks market mayhem signals the start of a major decline but like any tough teacher this years turbulent market offers many lessons including these six  go moderately wild in recent years investors have become infatuated with what i consider fringe sectors im thinking about investments like emerging market stocks emerging market debt commodities gold shares high yield junk bonds and real estate investment trusts and i dont think theres anything wrong with having a small stake in any of these investments in fact i own some of them myself but your stakes should indeed be small these sectors can be wild performers as we were reminded on thursday when lower quality bonds emerging market funds and gold shares all got battered my advice think long and hard before allocating more than of your portfolio to any one of these sectors  check your pulse if you shouldnt invest much in these fringe sectors where should you stash your cash every investor i believe should have exposure to the broad u s stock market to high quality u s bonds and to developed foreign stock markets these three core holdings should probably account for or of your investment portfolio and maybe more how you divvy up your money among these three core holdings will depend on your tolerance for risk and your need for returns that brings us to another lesson that gets driven home every time the market tumbles there are within reason no bad investment mixes just investors who cant live with them you should decide precisely what percentage of your portfolio you want in u s stocks foreign shares high quality bonds and each of the fringe sectors in settling on your target percentages think about what mix you can live with when markets turn volatile true it might seem wiser to contemplate your appetite for risk when things are a little calmer but the reality is risk tolerance changes over time its easy to be big and brave when share prices are heading higher its a lot tougher at times like this which is why you should take a moment today to think about how much risk you can really tolerate and what sort of long term allocation to stocks you ought to have  its a big market earlier this year many commentators were saying stock market valuations still appeared quite reasonable despite the heady gains of recent years typically however these commentators were talking about the standard &amp poors stock index and that doesnt tell you a whole lot about valuations among say emerging markets stocks or u s small company shares indeed at this juncture blue chip u s stocks may be one of the global stock markets most reasonably priced sectors after all the s&amp p is trading below its march stock market peak while small company stocks emerging markets reits and other sectors have all posted impressive gains over the past seven years  lose your confidence investing is always an uncertain enterprise yet many investors are regularly able to shed all self doubt and make the most outrageously bold investment bets think about the past seven years in early investors were convinced that stocks especially technology shares were a one way ticket to wealth these folks of course ended up as wall street road kill just a few years later many people were absolutely certain that the stock market was a losers game that was when the bear market hit bottom and share prices came roaring back by folks were adamant you couldnt go wrong with real estate today many condo flippers are suffering the consequences by early investors fancy had returned to stocks especially emerging markets and reits emerging markets have continued to soar in but reits have taken it on the chin the markets are trying to tell us something here and they arent telling us to chase performance the message not only do we need to think about risk as well as reward but also we shouldnt be nearly so confident in our predictive powers  fundamentals triumph when investments are hot it can seem like theres no limit to the possible gains yet there are always limits and economic fundamentals always win out in the end for instance the broad markets share price gains frequently outpace the economys growth rate over the short run but unless investors are willing to pay higher and higher price earnings multiples for stocks that cant go on forever similarly home prices can for a while climb faster than household incomes but unless home buyers are willing to commit an ever increasing share of their paycheck to homeownership that isnt sustainable over the long run  winning takes time i am not arguing however that you should avoid investments that have lately been hot performers when a market sector gets on a winning streak it can generate dazzling gains for four or five years and sometimes longer take my least favorite example as i have noted before in this column i have been cautious about reits since and i have been dead wrong this year reits have finally lost steam posting double digit losses but that was after seven years of blistering gains and much chagrin on my part the lesson its mighty tough to predict which sectors will shine and which will sink so our best bet is to diversify broadly never betting too heavily on
