office technology beyond help computer technicians sometimes run into problems they werent trained to solve thats when instinct takes over for corporate computer technicians most problems are easy to solve after all theyve probably seen the problem many times before but not always sometimes they run into problems that dont respond to the known tricks of the trade or they find themselves in a situation no training program covers thats when instinct takes over "it people like to solve problems " says bob last who writes an advice column for the help desk institute an association of it service and support professionals based in colorado springs colo "we like to play around with stuff theres a real tinker factor " that tinkering most often is of the technical type of course but common sense people skills and the occasional shot in the dark come into play as well here are a few accounts of the kind of technical puzzles that challenge it pros to go beyond the book cold storage jeffrey jarzabek it director for matocha associates a construction firm based in oakbrook terrace ill once got a call from a matocha employee complaining that his computer wasnt turning on after diagnosing the problem as a failed hard drive mr jarzabek focused on saving the users files everything he tried and he tried a lot of things failed normally that means sending the drive to a company that specializes in data recovery this service can cost thousands of dollars and consequently is a last resort in a final desperate attempt to save the company money mr jarzabek stuck the hard drive in the freezer and left it there overnight something he once heard can resuscitate a dead drive sure enough the next morning the drive started right up "it was totally unbelievable " he says "i have no explanation for why it worked " the it team at dow chemical co faced a challenge that tested its creativity when hurricane katrina knocked out the phone connections at several of its gulf coast facilities in august the companys telecommunications provider routed calls through new orleans and the providers facility was flooded luckily dows computer network was still running and a dow plant in plaquemine la had about voip phones which use "voice over internet protocol" technology to make calls over the internet boxed up in the it department dow was planning on rolling out the phones later that year a fairly involved process that normally can take several months but mary mckay dows regional information systems manager decided to press them into service she and five other technicians distributed about of the phones at the plaquemine plant and took the rest to a dow facility in st charles la neither plant had dedicated voip servers so the phones had to be connected to dows corporate computer network and calls were routed to and from the gulf coast facilities through the companys midland mich headquarters back to square one the same instinct that helps it people solve complicated technical problems can cause them to overthink simple ones chris martel chief information officer for spillers a company based in lewiston maine that sells office equipment admits that most of the time hes on the lookout for the obscure so when a pc he had finished setting up for a user wouldnt connect to the company network he started down a path of increasingly complex diagnostic tests eliminating one possible problem after another he even reached a point where he was rewriting the code on the computer "finally i threw my hands up in the air and said i had no more ideas " mr martel says thats when he realized that he had forgotten to check one thing the cable that connects the computer to the network it was broken "i get so caught up in all the technology that connects a computer to a network that i forget the simplest things sometimes " he says the human touch sometimes the solution to technical problems isnt technical at all dan combs now the president of global identity solutions a washington d c consulting firm was reminded of that when he worked on a project for the state of iowa the project aimed to make court records in the state accessible on a web site each court used a different computer system and the project team had to find a way to integrate all the technologies the project was over budget and months behind schedule when mr combs got the call to come and help he soon learned that while the technology was complicated the reason for the delay wasnt the problem mr combs says was that there was too much bickering and not enough cooperation among the contractors and the state employees working on the project after a few days of contentious email exchanges and phone conversations mr combs dragged a bunch of desks into a makeshift office and told the contractors and the it team that they were going to sit together until they learned how to work through their differences "there were a few days where instead of virtual finger pointing we had real finger pointing " mr combs says "but after a short amount of time they got past that " being in the same room helped everyone focus on the big picture within a few months the site was up and running despite his years of experience in it "everything i needed to know about managing it i learned in kindergarten " mr combs says mr worthen a staff reporter in the wall street journals san francisco bureau writes the journals business technology blog at wsj com biztech he can be reached at ben worthen wsj com
