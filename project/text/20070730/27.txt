eyes on the road bikers fight to ride free and win data show increase in fatalities among motorcyclists online edition phillip brewer rode a motorcycle during an eight year sojourn in france when he returned to the u s in the early s to pursue his career as an emergency room physician he says he thought about getting another bike until "this guys arm got carried in to the emergency room about minutes before the rest of him " that was it for motorcycling says dr brewer now director of university health services at quinnipiac university in connecticut a former faculty member at the yale medical school dr brewer has served as a safety fellow at the national highway traffic safety administration and over the years has argued consistently against efforts to repeal state laws requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets the nhtsa last week released preliminary figures for highway fatalities in and heralded a decline in overall motor vehicle fatalities to the lowest absolute number in five years and the lowest rate per million vehicle miles traveled the government has ever recorded but underneath the positive headline was grim news for bikers fatalities among motorcycle riders rose to people accounting for of total highway deaths last year thats the highest share ever for motorcycle fatalities and marks the ninth straight year that motorcycle fatalities have increased the steady rise in deaths among motorcycle riders has coincided with a surge in sales of motorcycles since this is just one more phenomenon driven by baby boomers the average age of motorcycle owners rose to years old in up from years old in according to a study of trends in motorcycle fatalities nhtsa researchers published in june more than of bikes registered in were owned by people or older compared to just in overall people over owned of motorcycles in according to the nhtsa report many a harley davidson is indeed piloted by a middle aged man looking to recapture his pirate youth its not just a stereotype biker culture celebrates the romance of living on the edge from the tunes selected for harley davidsons series of road music collections to the skulls and crosses that bedeck biker clothing and jewelry what many riders may not realize is just how dicey the road can be for someone on two wheels adjusted for miles traveled riders were times more likely to die in a highway accident than occupants of passenger cars in according to the nhtsa study while riders aged suffer the largest number of deaths deaths among riders years old are rising fast the government study found the average age of riders killed on the road has risen by nearly six years to and more fatal accidents involve bikes with large engines most of the increase in deaths came because of crashes involving motorcycles with engines of cubic centimeter displacement a class of bike that includes many heavy cruiser models from harley davidson honda yamaha and others the causes of motorcycle crashes are typically the same as the causes for car and truck crashes speeding is linked to about a third of motorcycle fatalities also a majority of riders die with blood alcohol concentrations above the level now designated as the legal limit of course the margin for error on a motorcycle is narrower than for cars even the flimsiest car puts some steel between its operator and the pavement or another vehicle if my subaru side swipes another car on a crowded freeway i will probably live to pay my insurance deductible but if i make a careless lane change and sideswipe a motorcycle rider the outcome could be tragic this is why rider groups promote bumper stickers that read "look twice save a life motorcycles are everywhere " the decline in fatality rates for automobile passengers has coincided with the spread of technologies such as side airbags stability control more crashworthy vehicle designs and more vigorous enforcement of seatbelt laws and strictures against drinking and driving while car and truck drivers have largely acquiesced to state laws mandating seat belt use riders present a more difficult challenge spurred by persistent and sophisticated lobbying by rider groups such as abate legislatures in about states have repealed laws requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets moves to repeal helmet mandates continue despite evidence that once riders have a choice motorcycle deaths rise sharply about of riders who died in helmet optional states werent wearing head protection according to the nhtsa study the anti helmet rider groups argue that adult motorcyclists should be free to make their own choice about whether to wear a helmet a proposal in michigan for example would allow riders to opt out of wearing a helmet in return for a &# fee proof they have completed a safety course and acquired &# in medical coverage some anti helmet activists go further contending that helmets can compromise safety by limiting peripheral vision helmet law opponents also say that ridership drops in states that require helmets advocates of mandatory helmet laws such as dr brewer dismiss the arguments that helmets are unsafe or ineffective "the science is absolutely clear " he says "you have a higher fatality rate when you are not wearing a helmet " so why isnt there a federally driven "helmet or ticket" crusade as there has been with seat belts because over the years helmet law opponents have persuaded congress to effectively block the nhtsa from pursuing such moves the industry meanwhile through groups such as the motorcycle safety foundation urges riders to wear helmets in safety courses it designs "we absolutely say a helmet is the most important piece of safety equipment you can wear " says the foundations dean thompson "we are pretty emphatic " while the industry steers clear of campaigning for mandatory helmet laws it is taking other steps to improve safety honda motor co which is promoting safety technology in its cars with the slogan "safety for everyone " recently launched a version of its top of the line gold wing motorcycle equipped with an airbag there are also independent companies trying to develop rider wear that incorporates air cushions the motorcycle safety foundation in june announced it would contribute &# million to finance a study by the oklahoma transportation center of a new "motorcycle crash causation study" that will also get federal funding oddly the nhtsa which has a long history of research into the causes of motorcycle crashes isnt involved that study could take as many as six years to yield results dr brewer says hes pessimistic that the motorcycle safety problem will be addressed through new regulation given the political climate "if car drivers organized to the same extent against seat belts " he says "youd see us repealing seat belt laws as well " which means those who ride will have to decide send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
