either rusal is keen instead to promote its current ceo alexander bulygin as what spokeswoman vera kurochkina calls "a key strategic decision maker for the company " through his moscow headquartered holding company basic element mr deripaska declined to comment rusals approach demonstrates how russian firms striving to gain international recognition are often keen to emphasize future plans but remain reluctant to discuss their frequently colorful corporate histories that date to russias anarchic s flush with cash from the nations fast growing economy and the four year boom in natural resources russian companies are eager to spend to extend their global reach questions about their past have occasionally hindered that effort last year lack of information about another russian tycoon alexey mordashov contributed to the failure of the attempt by the russian steel company he controls oao severstal to acquire steelmaker arcelor sa since then severstal has gone public and mr mordashov has increased transparency and outlined plans to build globally rather than embark on an acquisition spree the moves have won severstal greater respect in the industry and in the markets mr bulygin

left standing when global industry consolidation peters out his strategy is to turn the company into a "multiminer" and a major producer of all the metals traded on the london metal exchange "rusal similar to bhp billiton ltd could be a base for all these metals " he said while mr bulygin is promising to draw investors with good corporate governance and a multinational corporate culture he is dogged by the question of whether he is really in charge and controversy surrounding mr deripaska who is a board member while mr bulygin says he is responsible for day to day affairs he says that mr
