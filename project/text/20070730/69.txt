second opinion employers turn to alternative for insuring staff no headline available despite legal concerns workers are encouraged to use individual policies park city utah many small businesses have trouble providing health coverage because the costs of paying benefits for a handful of ailing employees drive up the premiums for their entire staffs now an entrepreneur in utah relying on a wrinkle in u s tax law thinks he has found a way around the problem his idea employers should stop providing group health insurance and instead help employees get individual policies paul zane pilzer a year old economist occasional rabbi and author of books like "god wants you to be rich " isnt just concocting theories his sales method has drawn interest from insurance giant unitedhealth group inc his company zane benefits llc has signed up more than employers covering around people since opening in march a company led by america online founder steve case and a unit of wal mart stores inc have teamed up to market the idea to small business mr pilzer is among a growing number of people politicians policy makers and others scrambling to find alternatives to the u s system of employer provided insurance some merely want to fix a system that leaves millions uninsured others are looking for ways to profit from patching together the system none of the solutions so far is perfect but mr pilzers is gaining traction critics say his plan doesnt take account of those people who cant get individual coverage because of previous or existing illnesses mr pilzer says they can get help from their state or other sources with many companies dropping group coverage "we believe something is better than nothing " says bryce williams chief executive at a subsidiary of mr cases company involved in the marketing critics say the concept violates the fundamental principle of health insurance that the well help pay for the coverage of the sick "its poor public policy " says greg matis counsel for selecthealth a utah insurer that wont cover workers this way "here it will only be healthy people who get individual policies and the ones who need coverage the most the highest risk people will be left holding the bag " but mr pilzer believes its better for individuals to buy their own health insurance policies because under state and federal laws the policies cant be terminated for health reasons by contrast workers who lose group coverage when theyre laid off or change jobs may not be able to replace it he also contends that with individual policies consumers pay only for the benefits they want avoiding the bells and whistles in employer plans that drive up health costs "i feel im doing gods work switching people from group plans to individual insurance " he says he likens his philosophy to the shift in recent decades to k retirement plans where employers provide tax deferred dollars and its up to employees to invest them "employers will be relieved of a crushing moral and financial obligation that they should never have taken on in the first place " he says some say mr pilzers setup violates a federal law requiring that employers offer coverage to everybody or nobody texas insurance regulators have warned employers not to try the idea saying it discriminates against sicker workers "i think this is blatantly illegal " says mila kofman an associate professor at the georgetown university health policy institute and a former labor department official "i would not advise any employer to do this " mr pilzer calls his plan legal and so far the federal government hasnt said anything to the contrary the department of labor says it is aware of the controversy and is consulting with other parts of the federal government over possible clarification of the rules according to the kaiser family foundation of businesses offered health benefits in down from in employer premiums for family coverage rose since to &# annually the tax wrinkle used by mr pilzer involves something called a health reimbursement arrangement or hra employers set aside a certain sum every month say &# that employees can use for health expenses the employer can write off the expense for tax purposes just like traditional health benefits and the money doesnt count as taxable income for the employee the tax advantages of hras resemble the better known health savings accounts or hsas both plans are sometimes used by large employers that offer comprehensive benefits and want to supplement it by giving employees tax free dollars for noncovered medical costs the key difference is that employees can use the money in an hra but generally not an hsa to buy health insurance thats why an hra can be used not just to supplement health insurance but also to buy it at a business with generally healthy employees an hra plan in effect allows the owner to cover a good chunk of most peoples insurance bills at a fraction of the cost of a traditional group insurance plan the idea is especially attractive to small businesses that dont have the leverage to drive a good bargain for group coverage helen griffin owner of it pros in overland park kan was fed up with soaring premiums her insurer was demanding the technology firm this year began offering a &# a month hra allowance plus an additional &# a month for workers with a spouse and children ms griffin says all five of her full time employees were able to find individual coverage she and her husband paid a combined &# a month for their policies down from &# a month paid by the company when the business had a group plan businesses with only a handful of employees often pay high group premiums because insurers must accept all employees and they keep rates high to protect against large claims "the biggest thing for us no more increases " says ms griffin referring to her previous group plan critics say a system like the one at it pros encourages employees to pick a bare bones policy with low premiums that may exclude coverage for pre existing conditions maternity care or other major medical needs the setup is attractive to some insurance companies worried about losing business as employers drop coverage like traditional group coverage the hra is a mechanism for companies money to get pumped into insurance premiums but with individual coverage insurers are allowed in most states to weed out sick people likely to rack up big bills an industry survey in found about a quarter of people to get rejected for individual coverage above the overall average of unitedhealth is encouraging hundreds of its independent agents to take an online course offered by mr pilzers zane benefits to learn how to market individual plans at companies with hras zane benefits isnt an insurer it earns about &# a

patricc quinn director of travel and nonfinancial services for sams club declined to say how many employers have signed up but he said response has been strong "its a very simple model going back to individual health insurance something that fits small businesses better than group insurance " says mr quinn "members dont believe it its too good to be true " barnett well services lp in cresson

individual plan previously it had nagged at her that she was paying high premiums even though shes in good health "a lot of people in the group plan are not as healthy is that affecting my policy and

three stents implanted in april after tests found blockages in his blood vessels "too bad for me this wasnt around years ago " mr schulz says of the hra idea "im not sure i would qualify now " he would face the prospect of going uninsured except that his wife can get group coverage through her employer thirty four states have a high risk pool for people who cant get insurance because of illness but the premiums can be up to double the usual rate the florida high risk pool has been closed to new enrollment since owing to a lack of funding in texas workers are ineligible for last resort insurance if their employer offers an hra jennifer ahrens associate commissioner of the state insurance department says people with existing conditions "would be locked out of insurance completely" if a company dropped group coverage in favor of an hra because of the barriers in texas extend health and zane benefits have stopped marketing hra reimbursement for health insurance there mr pilzer acknowledges there are holes in the government safety net but he accuses texas regulators of making matters worse by trying to shield higher priced group policies from competition the states rules are "total price protection for brokers selling group insurance " he says "its a joke "
