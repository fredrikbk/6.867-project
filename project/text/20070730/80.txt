telecommunications a question of priorities faced with clogged networks companies and college campuses get more sophisticated about which online material gets in first inside large organizations not all network traffic is of equal value to the business at hand so why should it all be treated the same with the explosion of bandwidth hungry applications like file sharing programs internet phone service and online video companies and especially college campuses have seen their networks slow dramatically as entertainment and chat crowd out business related traffic to deal with the problem many organizations are beginning to use sophisticated traffic control systems that can sort out less important online material while giving higher priority to business critical files the technology called dpi for deep packet inspection is an improvement on the traditional firewall which simply blocks unwanted traffic dpi grants network administrators greater flexibility dpi also can be more effective than simply expanding a network to try to keep up with the growing traffic thats because online networks are a lot like highways higher capacity usually only invites more traffic "adding more capacity or bandwidth just gives more people incentive to download more videos and music " says scott kriens chairman and chief executive of network equipment maker juniper networks inc dpi peers into data files and sorts them by their content based on that assessment and the priorities established by a networks operators it decides whether a particular packet can continue to its destination or should be blocked or delayed while more important traffic proceeds network providers including juniper cisco systems inc packeteer inc allot communications ltd and ellacoya networks inc offer dpi technology for their networks colleges are big proponents of dpi as students are among the heaviest users of the high bandwidth services that clog networks "i cant imagine a university in the united states without some kind of dpi technology in their network its just that important " says chris cahoe enterprise network engineer at ball state university in muncie ind mr cahoe tapped allot after ball state began to experience problems with its network last year the campuswide videoconferencing system took longer to access as did other software stored on the network computer users all over campus who use the university network for internet access voiced their frustration at the slow pace of their connections mr cahoe found that a small minority of students were using peer to peer file sharing programs to download movies and music the students had become wise to some of the older techniques for curtailing such traffic and began turning to file sharing services that encrypted their traffic which older filtering systems couldnt decipher mr cahoe installed a dpi system in may the allot technology could look more deeply into online files than the older filtering technology and even defeat some of the encryption techniques it also could inspect a larger volume of traffic allowing less traffic to escape unchecked using dpi ball state was able to cap the amount of file sharing traffic and assign it a much lower priority that not only cleared a broader path for preferred traffic it also greatly reduced the download speeds for those using file sharing discouraging use of the network for that purpose weeks after the equipment was installed the pace of prioritized traffic increased dramatically "life for me changed fairly quickly after putting the allot equipment into the network " mr cahoe says "i experienced fewer headaches " michael cole manager of network operations at clark university in worcester mass installed a dpi system from ellacoya about a year ago that helps counter data encryption by file sharing services and online phone companies when it encounters data traffic that it cant categorize the system places it on a hard drive to be analyzed by ellacoya engineers on a weekly basis network administrators can then choose to block that data or allow it to proceed with the appropriate priority the system also allows bandwidth to be allotted based on who the user is at clark for example about faculty and administrators have access to one third of the networks bandwidth while more than students share access to the other two thirds companies are also beginning to use dpi rawlings sporting goods co was hit late in with a wave of complaints from customers about internet orders taking too long to be processed rawlings technicians had a hard time figuring out the cause of the problem until they tried a dpi demo system from packeteer network administrators found that employees were eating up bandwidth by watching streaming videos "the network was the last place i would have thought we had problems " says richard truex network manager for rawlings correctly identifying the problem meant big cost savings for rawlings by deploying the packeteer system rawlings was able to improve the flow of network traffic without having to purchase more bandwidth the system allowed mr truex to create rules to guarantee bandwidth for important applications like customer orders and squeeze bandwidth for others during peak business hours for example streaming videos are nearly shut off to allow the flow of important data viasat inc a company that provides internet service via satellite uses dpi to help manage the traffic it handles viasats dpi system allows its customers to prioritize their internet traffic by the type of data being transmitted and also to assign greater or lesser amounts of bandwidth to different groups of employees similar to the way clark university divides its available bandwidth between students and administrators sometimes the use of traffic filtering technology can cause a backlash when network administrators decide to block certain programs thats what happened last september when san jose state university tried to use its dpi system to ban internet calling on its network using ebay inc s skype service in a letter to students and administrators the california schools it department explained that skype which uses peer to peer technology to connect calls can significantly increase bandwidth consumption the school also said use of the skype service opened the universitys network up to unauthorized third parties steve sloan one of the professors who fought to keep skype available on campus points to the value of the service as a low cost way to communicate with students and with other professors around the world "we convinced them that educational uses outweighed any threat to the network " he says instead of banning skype the schools network administrators eventually met with skype technicians and have begun to work with the company to address the schools concerns mr white is a staff reporter in the wall street journals san francisco bureau he can be reached at bobby white wsj com
