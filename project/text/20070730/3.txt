americas cuban tremors cuba is not an island known for earthquakes but "temporary" dictator raul castros speech to the nation last thursday provides the clearest evidence yet that the tectonic plates underpinning the political status quo are shifting and perhaps even colliding even the best cuba experts who follow its politics closely caution against making predictions but what seems evident from rauls language is that the government can no longer ignore the enormous suffering caused by a deteriorating economy this crisis together with the loss of fidel castros charismatic political leadership has left the regime in uncharted waters and perhaps even fearful thursdays event was the annual celebration of the july movement which commemorates the first armed assault on the batista dictatorship by rebels in normally fidel gives this speech but he hasnt been seen in public in about a year though he has been videotaped and there is speculation that the absences are due largely to a decline in his mental capacity whatever the truth raul who hasnt a shred of his older brothers charisma has had to pick up the slack in public appearances before an increasingly dissatisfied population at the same time he has had to run the secretive totalitarian machine which may be beginning to experience its own internal strife in many ways the speech delivered in the east central city of camaguey was standard fare castrista rambling about the glories of the revolution and the need to defend it forever the ugliness and injustices of the "empire" the u s and its embargo and the wonders of el maximo lider and socialism but on matters of the economy raul seemed to break ranks and signal that he knows things cannot go on the way they are a less sympathetic view is that the speech was crafted to calm down a population at the breaking point due to privation as he has done before raul complained about the low productivity of the cuban worker and tried hard to stir national pride toward improving the record yet there were moments when he seemed to be acknowledging that the system doesnt work "we are duty bound " he proclaimed "to question everything we do as we strive to materialize our will more and more perfectly to change concepts and methods which were appropriate at one point but have been surpassed by life itself " in other words which were surpassed by reality he also recognized the problem of low wages linking them to low productivity he noted that the average cuban salary less than &# a month is "clearly insufficient to meet all the needs so that it practically ceased to fulfill the socialist principle that each contribute according to his abilities and receive according to his work " whether intentional or not that reference to marx is not quite right the father of communism called for each to receive according to his "need" while raul suggests it should be according to his input he also contemplated "incentives" for producers somebody is wandering off the reservation it is not insignificant that he said that cuba has "not yet come out of the special period " that term was supposed to apply to "temporary" adjustments in policy designed in to help the country overcome the hardship caused by the end of soviet financing this included inviting foreign investment allowing the operation of farmers markets and some small businesses and the legalization of the u s dollar it is widely agreed that raul and his friends in the military championed these changes while fidel went along grudgingly fidel castro subsequently withdrew many of those privileges and more than years later the dire economic circumstances continue even venezuelan financing to the tune of &# billion &# billion a year has not reversed the decline this is why rauls references to foreign investment on thursday are intriguing "we are currently studying the possibility of securing more foreign investment of the kind that can provide us with capital technology or markets " he told the nation this is a clear reference to the china model of economic liberalization which raul has long advocated for cuba none of this is to suggest that fidels little brother known for his ruthlessness dreams of a freer cuba as the regimes most bloodthirsty enforcer he has been at the forefront of a renewed wave of repression some say orchestrated in anticipation of fidels passing that began in march april with a nationwide crackdown on dissidents seventy five of those arrested were handed sentences averaging more than years state security attacks on government critics have since escalated according to the cuban directorio in miami which tracks such incidents but the man is desperate he cannot put the whole island in jail and with food and milk shortages growing it may become increasingly difficult to keep the lid on things as armando valladares a former political prisoner who spent years in castro gulags told me in an interview last month terror as a way to control people has its limits in mr valladaress view the cuban people are very near if not over that limit suggesting that even a small spark could ignite a massive rebellion not unlike what happened in romania directorio says that the number and size of public acts of dissent have been rising every year despite the brutality of rauls goons last month people marched in camaguey in an unprecedented display of support for a political prisoner raul is also facing his legacy within the military having carried out fidels dirty work such as the execution of popular gen arnaldo ochoa hes garnered a lot of enemies over the years if rumors of rumblings in the barracks are true he could be the counterrevolutions first victim to avoid that fate he has to get the economy going and he now seems to be pinning his hopes on a new u s administration that might end the embargo on thursday he repeated cubas "willingness to discuss on equal footing" its "dispute with the u s " lifting the embargo might give raul some breathing room but he cant do much until big brother passes "the problem for raul is that fidel wont die " says ernesto betancourt who represented the july movement in washington in and and probably understands the regime as well or better than any cuban exile "he might want to make changes but fidel wont allow them " ironically once fidel is no longer around to hold together the depraved and nihilistic regime rauls chances of survival may be even grimmer
