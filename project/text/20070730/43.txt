love &amp money a soccer injury and a difficult choice the pain was intense as ive noted in the past i play soccer specifically goalkeeper and though im years old i play with the vigor and intensity amy my wife would say "stupidity" of a year old either way all my numerous injuries have been minor until now i suffered a blow to my right quadriceps in a recent game that nearly resulted in emergency surgery a procedure in which the doctor would slice open my leg to relieve pressure fromthe blood that had accumulated in my muscle this a major injury has been amys biggest fear surrounding my soccer exploits while shes concerned about my health of course she also worries that i will damage my body to such a degree that it affects my ability to earn a living as a writer as it is ive hurt my hands in so many ways that i now cannot remove my wedding ring because my ring finger knuckle is so swollen had any of my injuries been worse she complains "you might not be able to be a writer and then what do we do " her question always gives me pause and as a result of the latest injury has led to some pretty lively debates in our house of late the immediate issue is whether i should hang up my soccer goalie gloves but the broader issue is even more difficult can a spouse veto your hobbies when those activities potentially affect your livelihood so many of the sports and hobbies we pursue as adults are rife with risk scuba diving mountain climbing hang gliding amateur drag racing skiing flying and apparently soccer yet when youre confident in your skills you assume nothing bad will befall you of course bad things do happen last fall i watched a competitor in my over mens league collapse from a heart attack and die on the field before the ambulance arrived earlier this spring while scrambling for a loose ball i had four fingers on my left hand bent so far back that i spent a week struggling to type every time something like this happens amy quickly pushes me to retire from soccer reminding me that i risk not only the familys income stream but the ability to play with my kids and travel with her or even navigate the long flight of stairs at our lake house just as quickly though i disregard her complaints and continue playing i love this game ive been off the field just two weeks and despite passing out despite throwing up in the doctors office because of the pain despite the pain i currently feel when walking i cannot wait to return to the goal if i could choose to do anything id play goalkeeper every day i love the game that much amy doesnt share a similar passion for any particular activity so its hard for her to relate she does however have a passion for family and to her im jeopardizing all weve worked for "if you keep pushing the limit " she chastised me "youre going to end up with a really horrible quality of life and youre not going to enjoy our retirement together isnt that the prize our eyes are on how are you going to be able to travel with me and the kids if you cant walk you can barely walk now "i know you love the game but for the whole family and your longevity you need to stop playing you can be a coach you wont get hurt that way " eleazar the husband of one of my colleagues has faced a similar wrenching decision he grew up loving baseball making it to the rookie leagues for a major league team in his early s eventually he abandoned his diamond dreams and pursued his passion of becoming a police detective a job he loves but he kept playing baseball as well then in the summer of playing in an over league he stepped on home plate awkwardly and crumpled to the ground he had torn the acl in his knee ultimately requiring surgery and a few months of rehabilitation what he calls "the most pain i have ever experienced in life " during that period he couldnt work he was unable to play with his daughter or manage any of his chores around the house leaving his wife to essentially manage everything a european vacation was postponed without putting her foot down my colleague says she encouraged her husband to forgo baseball for the familys benefit telling him he needed to consider the familys future so far he has kept himself on the bench but the game constantly calls to him "i miss that part of my life " eleazar says "theres no other sport i like nearly as much i was very happy and now its gone i feel like im missing something in my life but to me it comes down to whats more important my hobby or my job and my family if something happens to me and i cant pursue my job because i cant use my legs that would be more devastating than not playing baseball "but i do miss the game a lot " after the sports trauma doctor had reduced the pain that morning in the surgery center amy said to me "say it with me i will not play soccer any more " certainly my injury does not affect my ability to write however it nearly sidelined a trip to florida last week for my son to participate in a soccer camp the doctors wanted me to stay home to reduce potential complications but allowed me to ride in the back of amys minivan with my leg in an immobilizing brace the injury has affected my family life forcing amy my son and even my mother in law to do certain things because i cant bend my leg very well for a while i couldnt even move my foot enough to drive so yes i see amys point what if this had happened to my hand in all likelihood i wouldnt be typing my articles for the wall street journal for several weeks if not months with consequences to my income and yet with all that staring at me i cannot get my head around the notion of never standing in front of a goal again as selfish as i know that is for that reason ive so far refused to repeat her phrase though i know shes probably right for the moment at least i keep pressing to rejoin my team as soon as the doctor clears me "any time you want to play again " she responded "im just going to kick you in the thigh and remind you of the pain " jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal write to him at lovemoney wsj com
