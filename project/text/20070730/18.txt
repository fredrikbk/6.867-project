big brazil deal has investors calling for level playing field sao paulo brazil brazils stock market is booming but antiquated rules have some investors claiming that the field is tilted against minority shareholders exhibit a is the biggest domestic acquisition ever in brazil the &# billion takeover of petrochemical group ipiranga by brazils state controlled oil giant petroleo brasileiro sa and two partners the deal announced in march is being challenged by several money managers and there is a continuing investigation of insider trading by the commisao de valores mobiliarios or cvm brazils version of the securities and exchange commission as negotiated members of several families who founded ipiranga sold a controlling stake in the company for just over &# billion a big premium to where their shares had been trading but other investors were given a different deal new shares with a face value close to that of their ipiranga stake since then these minority holders shares have traded up more than the deal is a reminder that in many brazilian companies all investors arent equal most companies here have a split share structure with voting and nonvoting shares under brazils law in cases like this it is up to the company that acquires control to decide the value of the nonvoting shares while legally required to provide a "fair" price the procedure leaves plenty of room for interpretation in the u s by contrast "control premium" payments in a merger or acquisition are unusual now while some classes of shares may have different voting rights they typically are treated equally in terms of price when a buyer comes knocking in some cases a buyer may be permitted to offer a different value to holders of separate classes or series of stock but even that is rare brazil has been moving toward a similar system in the countrys bovespa stock market in sao paulo created a new listing system called the novo mercado for companies with u s style standards including one share one vote rules and full "tag along" meaning all shareholders receive the same price in the event of an acquisition since the changes the novo mercado has boomed drawing a record influx of foreign capital with initial public offerings last year and so far this year however companies operating under the antiquated rules established to let family founders remain in control while raising money still make up of publicly traded companies in brazil according to bovespa now emboldened by the new interest in good governance large investment groups are increasingly flexing their muscles and focusing on the ipiranga acquisition a group of more than a half dozen asset management funds have filed a complaint at the cvm and say they are looking to stop the deal in the courts if necessary "the deal isnt close to fair " says claudio andrade of polo capital a hedge fund in rio de janeiro that along with other funds now holds more than of ipirangas nonvoting stock ipiranga was seen as a prize acquisition partly because its complex structure three lines of business and four listed stocks had left it undervalued analysts speculated that petrobras wanted to prevent petroleos de venezeula sa from building a fuel distribution business in brazil the ipiranga deal was led by petrochemicals company ultrapar participacoes sa known as grupo ultra which will take over most of ipirangas gasoline stations petrobras is set to get filling stations in northern brazil and with braskem sa latin americas largest chemical company is dividing up ipirangas petrochemicals business including plastics making plants to seal the deal the partners paid about &# billion to members of ipirangas five controlling families for voting shares valued at more than of the company according to ultra ipirangas stocks still trade but in the next steps of the deal ultra plans to first acquire the remaining voting shares and then the nonvoting shares through a stock swap ultras chief financial officer andre covre calls the funds complaints unfounded "their intentions are to try to cause disruptions in the process and try to create a negotiation position " he says in a page complaint filed with the cvm in late may polo along with two of brazils most prominent investment groups tarpon investments and hedging griffo accuse ultra of hiring deutsche bank ag to prepare a "fairness opinion" that low balled the value of their shares cvm officials say they are considering the complaint deutsche was paid &# million for its work which ultra is relying on under brazilian law to prove its deal terms are fair for instance the banks valuation estimates the current value of ipirangas chain of am pm filling station convenience stores by comparing them to a brazilian supermarket chain whose sales have been hurt by tough competition from multinationals polos mr andrade says if am pm was valued using the average growth rate for brazilian retailers it would increase am pms value by &# million altogether the brazilian funds claim deutsche banks estimates undervalue their shares by &# million ultras mr covre says deutsche has assured him that the methodology was correct deutsche declined to comment some funds are so confident that they can get a better price that they have been piling into ipiranga nonvoting stock since the announcement of the acquisition tarpon investments for instance has raised its stake by to &# million some fund managers figure that the ipiranga purchase may be especially vulnerable to pressure because of the brazilian governments participation through petrobras mr covre says the short seller position in ultra has tripled in size but was still only &# million this past week according to polo as some investors bet that the deal could be blocked and that the stock price will fall the fight is just the latest in a series of similar disputes in brazil last year minority investors successfully blocked a reorganization of one of brazils largest telecommunications companies telemar group more recently protests complicated mittal steel co s acquisition of arcelor sas brazilian operations part of the merger that formed the worlds largest steel company mittal ended up paying minority shareholders in brazil more than its initial offer
