adobe fedex link pushes a hot button adobe systems inc the maker of acrobat and flash software faces a wave of criticism from printing companies protesting a deal that gives fedex kinkos stores a prominent link on adobe software the brouhaha could hurt adobes standing with important customers and partners and also throw a wrench into fedex corp s plans to revitalize kinkos the copy and print chain it bought in at issue is a new button on some adobe software released in june that lets people electronically transfer documents directly to a fedex kinkos store to be printed the button appears on new versions of adobes popular acrobat and reader software which display documents in adobes pdf format there are no buttons for competing printers on the products the button on the software "is kind of hard to miss when you launch it its right there " says kim turk a manager with imagers a family run printing business in atlanta ms turk who wrote a letter to adobe last month protesting the move said her company and others could lose business because of the direct fedex kinkos link adobe is important to printing outfits because many of them now get much of their business directly from the internet and computerized documents rather than from walk in customers "our members frankly feel betrayed " says joseph p truncale president and chief executive of the national association for printing leadership which he says counts about printers designers and graphic arts companies as members some critics liken the situation to a scaled down version of the "browser wars" of the s when a u s justice department antitrust suit addressed microsoft corp s tactics in bundling its in house web browser with its ubiquitous windows operating system an attack on rival netscape communications with adobe similarly its about "just not having a choice " said ray fusco a vice president with printing and business communications company redmondbcms inc in denville n j adobe says it is reviewing the matter and expects to officially respond to the printing industrys concerns on wednesday top company officials including chief executive bruce chizen met with printing company executives for about two hours at adobes headquarters in san jose calif on july to hear their concerns adobe called the meeting after hearing "some pretty robust feedback" protesting the new feature said adobe spokesman russell brady fedex kinkos said in a statement friday that the alliance with adobe was "established with our customers in mind" and that it "provides a simple printing option for many users of adobe reader " fedex and adobe didnt reveal any financial terms of their deal adobe declined to make executives available to comment but on a corporate blog adobe senior vice president johnny loiacono said that at the july meeting mr chizen acknowledged the process for developing the new button feature was "flawed" because adobe didnt talk to print industry executives early on to get their ideas and feedback mr loiacono wrote that adobe is "doing to do everything possible to find a way to deliver a win win situation on all sides" and resolve the conflict for fedex the adobe deal is the latest and most aggressive move by the memphis tenn company to resurrect kinkos a &# billion acquisition that was criticized by some analysts as too costly and risky for a transportation company with no experience in the retail printing field fedex which handles about million packages a day planned to use fedex kinkos stores to extend package delivery services deeper into the retail sector where small and medium size companies and walk in customers pay a premium because they lack high shipping volumes to negotiate discounts but fedex company officials have acknowledged they had to first learn the retail business and then begin to restructure the operating model as demand for traditional copying and printing services diminished the retail printing market is heavily segmented though there are a few other chains including kwik kopy and sir speedy it is dominated by mom and pop shops kinkos founded in rose to prominence as a copy shop for college students but was already feeling the pinch from dropping demand spurred by the rise of personal computers and printers when fedex bought it in the fiscal year ended may kinkos revenue declined to &# billion while fedexs three other operating units posted increases and overall revenue at the company gained the adobe partnership is part of a new plan to enhance online document services through a digital network that links all fedex kinkos stores in an effort to sell office support services to small businesses and business travelers fedex kinkos has around shops around the world with the bulk of them in the u s the idea is that customers can send their printing orders directly from adobe software without even going to fedex kinkos online site to any shop in the world from there the order can be picked up at the fedex kinkos store or sent further via the fedex services now at the shop locations analysts say the backlash over the adobe fedex deal is unlikely to affect the financial health of adobe which reported that profits jumped to &# million in the second quarter still as it tries to generate revenue from more sophisticated graphics tools and increasingly compete with larger software companies like microsoft adobe "needs to be making friends not creating enemies " said bill whyman an analyst with new york brokerage firm international strategy and investment group
