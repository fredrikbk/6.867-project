technology a special report ten things your it department wont tell you admit it for many of us our work computer is a home away from home it seems only fair since our home computer is typically an office away from the office so in between typing up reports and poring over spreadsheets we use our office pcs to keep up with our lives we do birthday shopping check out funny clips on youtube and catch up with friends by email or instant message and often its just easier to accomplish certain tasks using consumer technology than using the sometimes clunky office technology our company gives us compare gmail with a corporate email account theres only one problem with what were doing our employers sometimes dont like it partly they want us to work while were at work and partly theyre afraid that what were doing compromises the companys computer network putting the company at risk in a host of ways so theyve asked their information technology departments to block us from bringing our home to work end of story not so fast to find out whether its possible to get around the it departments we asked web experts for some advice specifically we asked them to find the top secrets our it departments dont want us to know how to surf to blocked sites without leaving any traces for instance or carry on instant message chats without having to download software but to keep everybody honest we also turned to security pros to learn just what chances we take by doing an end run around the it department for hacking advice we asked gina trapani editor of lifehacker com an online guide to being more productive on the web leon ho editor of lifehack org a blog with a similar mission and mark frauenfelder founder of the wide ranging blog boingboing net and editor of the do it yourself technology magazine make to find out the risks we talked to three experts who make a living helping it departments make the rules and track down the rogue employees who break them they are john pironti chief information risk strategist at amsterdam based it consulting firm getronics nv mark lobel a security expert in pricewaterhousecooperss advisory practice and craig schmugar a threat researcher at security software maker mcafee inc here then are the secrets your it department doesnt want you to know the risks youll face if you use them and tips about how to keep yourself and your job safe while youre at it  how to send giant files the problem everybody needs to email big files from time to time everything from big marketing presentations to vacation photos but if you send anything larger than a few megabytes chances are youll get an email saying youve hit the companys limit companies cap the amount of data employees can send and store in email for a very simple reason they want to avoid filling up their servers and thus slowing them down says messaging research firm osterman research inc of black diamond wash and getting your company to increase your email limit can be a convoluted process the trick use online services such as yousendit inc sendthisfile inc and carson systems ltd s dropsend which let you send large files sometimes up to a few gigabytes in size free of charge to use the services you typically have to register supplying personal information such as name and email address you can then enter the recipients email address and a message to him or her and the site will give you instructions for uploading the file in most cases the site will send the recipient a link that he or she can click to download the file the risk because these services send your files over the web theyre outside of your companys control that makes it easier for a wily hacker to intercept files during their travels how to stay safe some of the services are more reputable than others yousendit for instance is a start up run by a former adobe systems inc executive and funded by well known venture capital firms others offer little information on their sites about themselves and could be more susceptible to security holes that could let a hacker steal your information if the sites backers arent immediately apparent there are other clues that can help look for a "secure" icon in internet explorer its a little lock on the bottom of the screen which signifies that the site is using encryption to protect its visitors confidential information a logo from a security company such as verisign inc meanwhile means verisign has confirmed the identity of the sites owner  how to use software that your company wont let you download the problem many companies require that employees get permission from the it department to download software but that can be problematic if youre trying to download software that your it department has blacklisted the trick there are two easy ways around this finding web based alternatives or bringing in the software on an outside device the first is easier say your company wont let you download the popular aol instant messenger program from time warner inc s aol unit you can still instant message with colleagues and friends using a web based version of the service called aim express aim com aimexpress adp theres also google inc s instant messaging service google talk accessible at google com talk there are web based equivalents of software such as music players and videogames too typically skimpier versions with fewer features than the regular programs the other approach to this problem is more involved but gives you access to actual software programs on your computer all three of our experts pointed to a company called rare ideas llc rareideas com which offers free versions of popular programs such as firefox and openoffice you can download the software onto a portable device like an ipod or a usb stick through a service called portable apps portableapps com then hook the device up to your work computer and youre ready to go but if your company blocks you from using external devices youre out of luck the risk using web based services can be a strain on your companys resources and bringing in software on outside devices can present a security problem it departments like to keep track of all the software used by employees so that if a bug or other security problem arises they can easily put fixes in place thats not the case if youve brought the program in on your own another thing to keep in mind some less reputable software programs especially underground file sharing programs could come loaded with spyware and make it possible for your own files to leak onto the web how to stay safe if you bring in software on an outside device says mr lobel make sure you at least tweak the security settings on your computers antivirus software so that it scans the device for potential threats thats easy to do usually through an options or settings menu likewise if you use a file sharing service set it up so that others cant access your own files also through an options or settings area  how to visit the web sites your company blocks the problem companies often block employees from visiting certain sites ranging from the really nefarious porn to probably bad gambling to mostly innocuous web based email services the trick even if your company wont let you visit those sites by typing their web addresses into your browser you can still sometimes sneak your way onto them you travel to a third party site called a proxy and type the web address you want into a search box then the proxy site travels to the site you want and displays it for you so you can see the site without actually visiting it proxy org for one features a list of more than proxies another way to accomplish the same thing from mr frauenfelder and ms trapani use googles translation service asking it to do an english to english translation just enter this google com translate langpair enen&amp u www blockedsite com replacing "blockedsite com" with the web address of the site you want to visit google effectively acts as a proxy calling up the site for you the risk if you use a proxy to say catch up on email or watch a youtube video the main risk is getting caught by your boss but there are scarier security risks online bad guys sometimes buy web addresses that are misspellings of popular sites then use them to infect visitors computers warns mr lobel companies often block those sites too but you wont be protected from them if you use a proxy how to stay safe dont make a habit of using proxies for all your web surfing use them only to visit specific sites that your company blocks for productivity related reasons say youtube and watch your spelling  how to clear your tracks on your work laptop the problem if you use a company owned laptop at home chances are you use it for personal tasks planning family vacations shopping for beach books organizing online photo albums and so on many companies reserve the right to monitor all that activity because the laptops are technically their property so what happens if your ahem friend accidentally surfs onto a porn site or does a web search for some embarrassing ailment the trick the latest versions of the internet explorer and firefox browsers both make it easy to clear your tracks in ie click on tools then delete browsing history from there you can either delete all your history by clicking delete all or choose one or a few kinds of data to delete in firefox just hit ctrl alt del or click clear private data under the tools menu the risk even if you clear your tracks you still face risks from roaming all over the web you could unintentionally install spyware on your computer from visiting a sketchy site or get your boss involved in legal problems for your behavior if youre caught it could mean at best embarrassment or at worst joblessness how to stay safe clear your private data as often as possible better yet dont use your work computer to do anything you wouldnt want your boss to know about  how to search for your work documents from home the problem youre catching up on work late at night or over the weekend but the documents you need to search through are stuck on your office pc the trick google microsoft yahoo and iac interactivecorps ask unit have all released software that lets you quickly search your desktop documents on top of that some will let you search through documents saved on one computer from another one how does it work the search company keeps a copy of your documents on its own server so it can scan those copies when you do a search remotely to use googles software among the most popular follow these steps on both your work and home pc first youll need to set up a google account on both machines by visiting google com accounts be sure to use the same account on both computers then go to desktop google com to download the search software when its up and running again do this on both machines click on desktop preferences then google account features from there check the box next to search across computers after that point any document you open on either machine will be copied to googles servers and will be searchable from either machine the risk corporate technology managers offer this nightmare scenario youve saved top secret financial information on your work pc you set up desktop search software so that you can access those files when working from home on your laptop then you lose your laptop uh oh getting hold of your companys internal documents could give others insight into your plans and losing certain information could have legal repercussions in particular myriad state laws regulate how a company has to react when it loses private information about customers or employees most require notifying those people about the breach in writing sending those notifications can be costly for your company not to mention damaging to its reputation on top of that threat researchers have found vulnerabilities in googles desktop search software that could let a hacker trick a user into giving up access to files says mr schmugar of mcafee those vulnerabilities have since been fixed but more could crop up he says matt glotzbach product management director for google enterprise says there are bound to be vulnerabilities in any software and that to the best of his knowledge none of the google desktop vulnerabilities were exploited by hackers he adds that when google finds out about a vulnerability it quickly fixes it and notifies users how to stay safe if you have any files on your work pc that shouldnt be made public ask your it administrator to help you set up google desktop to avoid accidental leaks  how to store work files online the problem desktop search aside most people who often work away from the office have come up with their own solution to getting access to work files they save them on a disk or a portable device and then plug it into a home computer or they store the files on the company network then access the network remotely but portable devices can be cumbersome and company network connections can be slow and unreliable the trick use an online storage service from the likes of box net inc streamload inc or aol owned xdrive box net also offers its service inside the social networking site facebook most offer some free storage from one to five gigabytes and charge a few dollars a month for premium packages with extra space another guerrilla storage solution is to email files to your private web based email account such as gmail or hotmail the risk a bad guy could steal your password for one of these sites and quickly grab copies of your companys sensitive files how to stay safe when youre thinking about storing a file online ask yourself if it would be ok for that file to be splashed all over the internet or sent to the ceo of your companys top rival if so go for it if not dont  how to keep your privacy when using web email the problem many companies now have the ability to track employees emails both on work email accounts and personal web based accounts as well as im conversations the trick when you send emails using either your work or personal email address you can encrypt them so that only you and the recipient can read them in microsoft outlook click on tools then options and choose the security tab there you can enter a password and nobody can open a note from you without supplying it of course youll have to tell people the code beforehand for web based personal email try this trick from mr frauenfelder when checking email add an "s" to the end of the "http" in front of your email providers web address for instance https www gmail com this throws you into a secure session so that nobody can track your email not all web services may support this however to encrypt im conversations meanwhile try the im service trillian from cerulean studios llc which lets you connect to aol instant messenger yahoo messenger and others and lets you encrypt your im conversations so that they cant be read the risk the main reason companies monitor email is to catch employees who are leaking confidential information by using these tricks you may set off false alarms and make it harder for the it crew to manage real threats how to stay safe use these tricks only occasionally instead of as a default  how to access your work email remotely when your company wont spring for a blackberry the problem anyone without a blackberry knows the feeling theres a lull in the conversation when youre out to dinner or an after work beer and everyone reaches for their pocket to grab their blackberry leaving you alone to stir your drink the trick you too can stay up to date on work email using any number of consumer oriented hand held devices just set up your work email so that all your emails get forwarded to your personal email account in microsoft outlook you can do this by right clicking on any email choosing create rule and asking that all your email be forwarded to another address then set up your hand held to receive your personal email by following instructions from the service provider for your hand held thats the company that sends you your bill the risk now not only can hackers break into your personal account by going online on a computer they can also break into it by exploiting security vulnerabilities on your mobile device how to stay safe theres a kosher way to access work email on some devices by getting passwords and other information from your it department  how to access your personal email on your blackberry the problem if you do have a blackberry youve probably got a different problem you want to get your personal email just as easily as work email the trick look at the settings area of your personal email account and make sure youve enabled pop post office protocol a method used to retrieve email from elsewhere then log in to the web site for your blackberry service provider click on the profile button look for the email accounts section and click on other email accounts then click add account and enter the information for your web based email account now your personal emails will pop up on the same screen as your company email the risk your company probably uses a whole bunch of security technology to keep viruses and spies out of your files when you receive personal email on your blackberry its coming to you without passing through your companys firewall that means viruses or spyware could sneak onto your blackberry via a personal email says mr schmugar of mcafee worse yet he says when you plug your blackberry into your work computer theres a chance that the malicious software could jump onto your hard drive how to stay safe cross your fingers and hope that your personal email provider is doing a decent job weeding out viruses spyware and other intruders chances are it is  how to look like youre working the problem youre doing some vital web surfing and your boss turns the corner what do you do the trick hit alt tab to quickly minimize one window say the one where youre browsing espn com and maximize another like that presentation thats due today the risk the good news is that there are no known security risks how to stay safe get back to work ms vara is a staff reporter in the wall street journals san francisco bureau she can be reached at vauhini vara wsj com
