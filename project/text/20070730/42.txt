libertarian support of the iraq war give me liberty or give me peace i agree with randy e barnett "libertarians and the war " july that being a libertarian does not "commit one to a particular stance toward the iraq war " i also believe there was a self defense rationale to go to war against saddam hussein for some of the reasons mr barnett outlined yet despite my agreements with him and disagreements with libertarian republican rep ron paul on these matters i believe mr barnetts criticisms of mr paul are inaccurate and his concerns about his presidential candidacy are misplaced at the may debate to which mr barnett refers i did not see mr paul connect "his answer to almost every question put to him" to the war what i saw was mr paul mostly criticizing republicans for losing their principles on domestic issues and embracing big government the exchange with fellow candidate rudy giuliani that mr barnett refers to came after mr paul was specifically asked by the debates moderator about his views on the war in iraq much more interesting than the differences mr paul has with some libertarians is the way in which he has formulated his positions to become one of the few self described libertarians to win national elective office john berlau director center for entrepreneurship competitive enterprise institute washington mr barnetts op ed cries out for criticism on many grounds but two points in particular seem most urgently in need of expression as mr barnett affirms all libertarians believe in an "individual right of self defense " he proceeds however to confound the actions an individual might take in self defense with the actions a state takes when it goes to war individuals have rights that each of them may properly defend a state has no rights whatsoever but only powers many of which it uses routinely to violate the just rights of individuals in its jurisdiction mr barnett regrets that libertarian opposition to the iraq war might "inhibit a wider acceptance of the libertarian principles that would promote the general welfare of the american people " but the american people have no greater interest than the preservation of their own liberty and nothing threatens that liberty so greatly as u s engagement in warfare robert higgs senior fellow the independent institute oakland calif as with most sophistic arguments there is a kernel of truth in mr barnetts argument that libertarianism does not imply a particular stance toward the iraq war there is some configuration of facts that can within libertarian principles justify an attack on another country including iraq nevertheless mr barnett does grave injury to the classical liberal and libertarian tradition by ignoring its strong presumption of peace of course no classical liberal objects to self defense but where was the evidence of the threat from iraq we all now know that the "evidence" was unforgivably poor the real motivation was regime change in the hope of making the middle east more amenable to particular foreign policy goals regardless of saddams resistance to inspections the u s government as a signee of the u n charter had no authorization to invade the immediate defense of the nation was not at stake so the "right" of every nation to self defense cannot be honestly invoked an adequate libertarian case for war in iraq would have to overcome the heavy burden imposed by the presumption of peace no libertarian i know of has yet begun this task mario j rizzo new york university department of economics new york while mr barnett does a great job of showing the two divisions within libertarians on the war in iraq he forgets a third kind of libertarian the one who constantly struggles between views both for and against the war in iraq my personal struggle boils down to a question about whether or not islamic radicals would leave us alone if we removed our military presence in the middle east and quit supplying aid to israel since it has been shown that some divisions in islam seek to place the entire world under islamic rule regardless of their views on the iraq situation or the middle east conflict the answer to that question appears to be resounding "no " the reality is that we are in iraq and that we will continue to be in the crosshairs of radical islam as long as we remain so if one thinks that this radical element was present in iraq before our troops arrived there then our strike is not pre emptive but one of self defense however if one believes that radical islam was not present in iraq until we got there then the war in iraq will always be unjustifiable i dont know which came first radical islam or our presence in the middle east but i continue to hope that we are successful in iraq since the question now seems to be moot austill stuart birmingham ala see related letter "letters to the editor the liberty of hindsight" wsj aug
