the grand old american economy i enjoyed rep tom rukavinas letter "its a grand old american made flag " july it would be nice if we could go back to the days of made in america but then how would mr rukavina manage to get a television set a stereo system or a cellphone the basic problem is that we buy foreign and in spite of complaints about human rights abuses in other countries continue to buy items that are cheaper to manufacture overseas than at home i am not happy about having to purchase items made in china and other countries not only because the average worker earns a few pennies for his or her labor but because i want to buy american but greed is greed perhaps the time has come to impose high enough tariffs on overseas goods to make them unattractive to the american shopper f a rosenberg ph d thousand oaks calif perhaps mr rukavina might be interested in another great american product an economics course at his local community college or university there he will learn the wonders of comparative advantage and how u s companies take advantage of this reality every day both in the states and in much of the world to continually lift our standard of living stephen hill dayton ohio it is wonderful to hear that my fellow minnesotan mr rukavina buys american however it is disappointing to learn that his grasp of economics is so weak my father was also a union member his employer went out of business decades ago not because the american public would not buy american made clothing rather because american business with unionized labor was not able to compete this is a fact of life that legislators in minnesota do not seem to understand don vomhof st paul minn mr rukavina should check the label in his red wing hiking boots the pair i just bought says they are made in china not red wing minn don piepgras river falls wis apparently rep rukavina has had a fleeting moment of lucidity in his letter in response to your editorial taking him to task for his bill banning the sale of foreign made flags in minnesota he stridently allows that the wall street journal is free to buy american flags from wherever it chooses would that his bill only offered minnesota residents that same free american choice john s villanova stamford conn see related letter "letters to the editor it goes without saying" wsj aug
