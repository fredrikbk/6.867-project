plant sugars seen as energy substitute a silicon valley start up backed by a prominent venture capitalist says it has developed a new way to wring energy from plant sugars in what some experts see as a potentially promising substitute for crude oil and other alternative fuels officials of ls inc say they have produced hydrocarbon from sugar by mixing it with a microbe they developed unlike ethanol or biodiesel products being developed by a growing roster of other companies this substance is a "biocrude" that lacks oxygen like petroleum they say the molecular similarities mean the liquid could be pumped into the existing refining system and processed into gasoline which ls officials see as the primary advantage of their approach ethanol by contrast requires separate facilities the technology must pass external scrutiny including the companys claims that the bioengineering process developed by ls can be replicated on a large scale ls says it plans to set up a pilot plant next year details of the companys progress are to be outlined today by stephen del cardayre lss head of research and development in a talk before a denver conference on industrial microbiology ls based in san carlos calif was founded in it has raised about &# million in backing from khosla ventures which is headed by vinod khosla a former partner at the firm kleiner perkins caufield &amp byers and from flagship ventures cambridge mass large and small companies are racing to find new energy sources hoping to reduce the dependence of the u s and other western countries on foreign sources of oil that are becoming increasingly expensive most also hope to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other so called greenhouse gases that have been blamed for global warming ls officials believe their biocrude could be essentially neutral in terms of greenhouse gas emissions partly because of the increased planting of crops that would serve as feedstocks to create sugar the company says the sugar could come from a variety of sources including cellulosic biomass from trees and grasses "our strategy is to be agnostic as to what the feedstock is " said gregory pal lss senior director of corporate development james collins a professor of biomedical engineering at boston university said of ls "theyre not yet ready to challenge exxon and shell for filling up our cars but they are a really interesting alternative to look at in a few years "
