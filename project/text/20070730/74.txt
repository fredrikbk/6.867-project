squaring off whats next for it are tech departments withering away or evolving to take on an even bigger role three experts weigh in whats the future of the it department some analysts have suggested the it department is withering most of the work it now performs eventually will be automated outsourced or handed off to other departments these observers say but others see the it department growing in importance as it takes on an increasingly strategic role from this perspective it is undergoing a transformation from a behind the scenes department to one that holds real clout within the company and plays a significant part in the development of products processes and services that help the company grow francesca donner an editor for the wall street journal online in new york discussed the changing role of the it department in an email exchange with three chief information officers meg mccarthy of aetna inc frank modruson of accenture ltd and steve squeri of american express co following are edited excerpts from their discussion the wall street journal analysts have written that it departments are becoming more strategy and business oriented do you agree ms mccarthy i totally agree at aetna the it organization is critical to enabling the implementation of our business strategy i report to the chairman of our company and i am a member of the executive committee in that capacity i participate in all of the key business conversations decisions that impact the company strategy and the technology strategy mr modruson accentures research has shown that it today is supporting more business processes than back end processes today it has earned a stake at the table has gone away from the bits and bytes and is more than ever a partner to the business mr squeri i agree that technology organizations are getting closer to the business its a must this doesnt happen overnight though we need to help the business better understand technology we need to help our technology employees better understand the business strategies one way we are doing this is by moving people across the organization from the business to tech and vice versa alignment with our senior leaders helps build the connection at all levels within the organization were all at the table together im a good example i came from the business where i was president of global corporate services and now as cio i report directly to the ceo and am part of our operating committee that has helped technologies have visibility at the company and a seat at the table ms mccarthy steves note is very consistent with some of the strategies we are employing at aetna to bring greater alignment with our business partners transitioning people from the business into it and rotating it people to the business brings a greater understanding to the broader organization at aetna we also use a "portfolio management" role to support the alignment process this is a person who may have come from either the business or it they are responsible to the business for managing the business it initiatives in a particular business area and assuring the return on investment for the specific portfolio the other important aspect associated with steves comment and his business background is the focus that most of us have on building a services oriented architecture the analogy that ill use here is legos in a services architecture we build discrete services that are individually tested and certified versus a more traditional programming method these services can be used and reused very efficiently i e the lego concept of taking legos apart and reusing them to build something new the promise of this approach is significantly reduced costs and speed to market the ability of the it organization to do this work efficiently is a function of how well we work with our business partners to define our business processes at the right level mr modruson what we have found at accenture is that effective communication with the business is critical it has to understand the needs of the business and the business must understand what is necessary from a technology perspective otherwise you can fall into "order taking" mode for example we present all major it projects to the business and clearly explain the business benefits we also audit the realization of business benefits delivered by all it projects to ensure that our it projects are delivering business results it all comes back to partnering and communicating with the business you want business people on your it team to facilitate both wsj what do you see as the greatest challenges and hurdles facing it departments and in light of that how do you see the cios role evolving to meet these challenges and hurdles mr modruson accentures research conducted with cios around the world has identified that high performing it organizations are not consumed with the problems of it but rather with how they can leverage it to drive business performance know your customer empower your employees facilitate supplier relationships essentially the role of cio has evolved from fixing it problems which is internally focused to being a catalyst for using technology to help the business perform better which is externally focused of course this assumes that the companys basic it needs are met internally ms mccarthy the big challenges for most companies will be the continued work on building an adaptable architecture that provides for seamless interoperability with other companies i e ease of communications and transaction processing with business partners and customers the cio in this work will be an important strategic partner who can educate and vision with their business partners as cios we need to understand the business the technologies that are evolving and work closely with our business partners to identify opportunities for the company and our customers to exploit these technologies to achieve market leadership and competitive advantage mr squeri i believe that finding the right talent is a key priority and challenge were facing we all talked about the need to align technology and business strategies part of getting there is bringing in and developing people with technical business and management skills our technology leaders need all of these skills to be successful and make our businesses successful were facing a dual crisis an aging employee population and a shortage in young talent to fill our pipeline it organizations have a population base with deep subject matter expertise but a lot of that base is near retirement unfortunately there isnt much of a pipeline of younger employees who can learn and develop from that base to become the new subject matter experts since our colleges and universities arent turning out enough graduates with computer science or engineering degrees who want to enter it organizations a big part of that shortage is probably due to the perception that it jobs arent a priority at companies today since there are so many vendors around the world providing it resources what a lot of people dont understand is that it departments still need people with subject matter expertise to run our projects and systems and we need young talent to learn about these systems through knowledge transfer and experience at the wheel so the biggest challenge we face is how to fill the pipeline of people we need to keep our business running and then developing these people to be the future leaders of it mr modruson i agree with meg and steve without a doubt top talent is critical you are only as good as your team wsj weve talked a little about sourcing "top talent " lets talk about the it department itself how do you envision the it department a decade from now how will it function alongside other departments might there be a case for outsourcing certain tasks and which areas of it if any will become defunct or be disbanded mr modruson there are two pieces to it strategy and operations ten years from now you will see cios focus even more on strategy whereas operations will be industrialized and outsourced to providers that are at market efficient scale and have the ability to invest and attract top it talent to operate the technology cios can then lead the it organization to focus more on meeting the needs of the ever changing business environment cios will also work more closely on internal customer relations to understand the business needs and the it team will manage the contracts of those to whom they have outsourced it operations ms mccarthy i agree with frank on the year view regarding strategy and operations the other big change will be with our customers how our customers want to receive information and interact with us will change dramatically over the next years creative technical talent will continue to be important to all of us as we work to meet our customers needs mr squeri i believe that over the next years the cio will get more involved in the overall business strategy of the company and see their role expand in importance the cio will be increasingly called upon not only to translate business strategies into capabilities but to become even more forward looking to determine what capabilities the business will need in the future the days of tech leaders as relationship managers and "order takers" will go by the wayside and they will be called upon to create and drive technology strategies that drive business capabilities technical architecture will become a core function of it departments today some of this is outsourced as the basic architectural footprint becomes important to own manage and control as we begin to manage platforms and capabilities as opposed to one off projects i believe that project management testing coding maintenance and basic infrastructure support and day to day operations will continue to be outsourced security and compliance will become even more important to control as compliance and data security continue to evolve due to increasing regulation and increasing threats wsj what advice would you give to non it managers and ceos on how they should approach it and address the it department mr modruson it and business are inextricably linked from day to day operations to interaction with customers ceos other top executives managers everyone needs a fundamental understanding of it web is familiar to new graduates just as cobol was once the standard college exit credential yet many successful senior business leaders are just getting fully acquainted with web wikis facebook etc willingness to learn adapt incorporate is a must for senior level and mid manager players technology presents an opportunity to change business in ways we cannot yet imagine it always has but the pace and degree of change have quickened board members and business leaders must stay current in their planning they should develop ways to learn whats new in it hands on learning such as rotation in it is one possibility top executives can undertake periodic self assessment and consider retreats or workshops midlevel managers might find an actual rotation in it easiest to schedule and it might enhance career options similarly entry level it professionals should find ways to leverage what they know mr squeri for businesses that leverage information or use technology as a competitive advantage it is important that business leaders know how to leverage the technology groups to enable their strategies this means that just as technology groups are learning to translate business strategies into technology capabilities business leaders will have to think about their strategies in terms of long term capabilities the only way that can really take place is by deepening the working relationship and ensuring that it has a seat at the table ms mccarthy our current ceo and chairman has a technology background which has been invaluable to our business at aetna he encourages all our non it leaders to have a good working understanding of technology and to understand the systems that enable their business areas he also has the business leaders report on all the "systems" projects programs for their business areas a recognition that this work is not just systems work but business and systems work i would encourage all non it managers to get an orientation to their systems organization i would also encourage non it leaders to spend time with their it partners particularly the architecture team during their strategic planning process have the architecture team look out three years and identify technologies that could be applied to the business to improve productivity or increase revenue working together on these things can generate creativity on both sides i would also recommend that midcareer leaders rotate into an it role for a period of time
