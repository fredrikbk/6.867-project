mickey mouse charges of mackey malfeasance surely there must be more alleged against whole foods ceo john mackey than what is highlighted in your editorial "mr mackeys offense " july possession of insider information so far as i understand is not criminal or even unethical unless it is used to guide private stock sales or purchases furthermore information disseminated via public media no longer classifies as insider information i could understand if mr mackey was accused of spreading false rumors about his company to manipulate the stock price but i have not heard such allegations dont most ceos through their advertising teams post "cheerleading" visions of their product company in the public media using surrogate personalities and actors the release of such information without attribution makes the information less certain but not illegal or unethical i wonder if we are not falling victim to a distorted sense of hubris in the united states we are offended to the point of threatening legal action over superficial issues that are probably neither unethical nor illegal while we fail to react to demonstrably bad behavior to which we have become inured one can be forgiven for having an initially uncomfortable feeling about such ceo behavior but progressing to a formal and public investigation should require some solid hypothesis that a law has been broken indeed when a public official continues an investigation while knowing that none of the "allegations" are actual violations of the law that public official is in my opinion guilty of prosecutorial abuse sadly our society often rewards such abusive prosecutorial demagoguery with higher office jeff sourbeer belleair fla
