the newest entitlement the state childrens health insurance program sounds like the epitome of good government who could be against health care for children the answer is anyone who worries about one more middle class taxpayer entitlement and a further slide to a government takeover of health care yet schip is sailing toward a major expansion with almost no media scrutiny and with republicans in congress running for cover schip was enacted in to help insure children from working poor families who make too much to qualify for medicaid in the intervening years the program reduced the rate of uninsured kids by about but has also grown to cover the middle class and even many adults and it gets bigger every year schip expires in september without reauthorization and congressional democrats want to enlarge its &# billion budget by at least &# billion over five years state governors from both parties are also leading the charge and for their own self interested reasons schip money is delivered as a block grant which the states match while designing their own insurance programs all cost overruns however are billed to the federal government which is on the hook for about of schips "matching rate " this offers incentives for state politicians to make generous promises and shift the costs to the feds or to toy around with costly universal health care experiments and since the states only get cents on the dollar for medicaid they are working hard to transfer those recipients to schip this self interest explains a recent letter from the national governors association demanding "urgent action" on schip which got lots of favorable play in the press yet these are the same governors who have been moaning for years about rising entitlement burdens which is what schip will be soon enough particularly egregious was the signature on the letter of minnesota governor tim pawlenty a republican who regards himself a conservative health care maven and should know better this "bipartisan" cover is serving democrats in congress who want to liberalize schip eligibility as part of their march to national health care the senate finance committee has voted to increase schip spending to at least &# billion over years not only does it use a budget trick to hide a payment hole of at least &# billion it proposes to offset the increase by bumping up the cigarette tax by cents to &# pack house democrats are putting the finishing touches on their own plan making the cigarette tax somewhat lower to win over tobacco state members instead the house is proposing to steal nearly &# billion from medicare advantage the innovative attempt to bring private competition to senior health care michigans john dingell explains that "these are not cuts" but "reductions in completely unjustified overpayments" which will come as news to insurers that offered coverage plans based on certain funding expectations the "overpayments" hes referring to were passed expressly as an incentive for companies to offer medicare advantage in rural areas with traditionally fewer insurance options and are intended to be phased out over time democrats apparently want to starve any private option for medicare in any case the actual costs of schip will overwhelm these financing gimmicks like all government insurance schip is "covering" more children by displacing private insurance according to the congressional budget office for every children who are enrolled in the proposed schip expansion there will be a corresponding reduction in private insurance for between and children although there is a net increase in coverage it comes by eroding the private system this crowd out effect is magnified moving up the income scale in of children between and of the poverty level already had private insurance which is where the senate compromise wants to move schip participation new york state is moving to of poverty or some &# in annual income all of this betrays the fact that the real political objective of schip is more government control hillarycare on the installment plan wed have thought capitol hill republicans would understand all this especially with the white house vowing to veto any big schip expansion but we hear the gop lacks the senate votes for a filibuster and perhaps even to sustain a veto gop senators mitch mcconnell and jon kyl are backing an alternative to account for population growth and reach the remaining uninsured children that schip was intended to help republicans would be wise to support this version or theyll take one more step to returning to their historic minority party status as tax collectors for the welfare state
