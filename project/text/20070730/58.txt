next generation behind microsofts bid to gain cutting edge mundie follows gates as long term thinker a history of catch up as the man designated to replace bill gates as microsoft corp s long term strategic thinker craig mundie is at the center of a daunting corporate challenge positioning the company to survive and thrive in the post gates era that mission keeps mr mundie rolling with his bag of dirt hiding black clothing and chocolate mint energy bars through airports around the globe at microsofts far flung research facilities he huddles with employees whose work is sometimes ignored by the powerful product executives who set the companys agenda its up to mr mundie the companys chief research and strategy officer to bring home long term business opportunities "the bulk of the population comes to work every day and makes the trains run on time " says mr mundie "youve got to have a small number of people who think that its their job to take risks i view my job in part as making sure that the company supports the things that take time but end up being big " throughout its history microsoft has been slow to grasp some of the computer industrys biggest technology shifts and business changes when it decides to embrace an innovation the company has often succeeded in chasing down the leaders as it did years ago with lotus development corp on spreadsheets that allow users to organize data and a decade ago with netscape communications corp on web browsers that transformed the experience of using the internet for years this catch up and surpass approach worked well early this decade however companies such as google inc and apple inc exposed holes in the approach microsoft was slow to see the potential in web search and online advertising and despite heavy investments has so far failed to catch industry leaders google and yahoo inc it also was late coming to market with its own music player and despite a push remains far behind apple today a host of web based software services from google and others threaten to reduce the importance of microsofts personal computer software one year ago mr gates the companys chairman announced that in june he would give up his post as "chief software architect" to focus full time on philanthropy he named ray ozzie a software industry star who joined microsoft in to take over the higher profile half of that job overseeing all software development including flagship products such as the windows operating system mr mundie got the other half of the job charting the companys long term technology course working mostly out of the public eye the year old executive is trying to alter the corporate culture so microsoft no longer misses emerging technologies and businesses mr mundie is "someone who can work well with the product groups and get their respect " mr gates says "it takes a unique person to do that " mr mundie continues to oversee microsofts public policy and intellectual property strategies jobs he had prior to the change microsoft faces an onslaught of nimble start ups and deep pocketed competitors coming to market with breakthrough technologies microsofts top executives chief executive officer steve ballmer and messrs mundie and ozzie will together be judged on how successful they are both at expanding the companys existing businesses and choosing new areas for investment mr mundie says his techie leanings date back at least to the fourth grade when his fascination with his grandfathers slide rule led his teacher to instruct him in high school level geometry after collecting a degree in electrical engineering from georgia tech he worked for data general a pioneering computer maker that is now defunct and for a supercomputer start up company that he ultimately shuttered he joined microsoft in as head of the consumer group he helped shepherd such non pc products as videogames interactive television and software for cellphones later he took on nettlesome tasks such as fighting piracy in china pushing microsoft to develop more secure software and improving the companys relationships with governments around the world he developed a reputation as a visionary with start up projects but less skilled at managing them as going concerns he and other microsoft executives say mr mundies current challenge is twofold to help the companys powerful product groups better adapt to technology shifts and to make microsoft a better incubator of new technologies and businesses his goal he says is to move microsoft to "the leading edge as opposed to the responsive edge in some of these new areas " over the years microsoft often has been late to recognize important trends but after focusing on them has caught up in the s for example apple popularized the use of the mouse and icons to operate computers years later microsoft adopted and spread that approach in the mid s after netscape demonstrated the importance of the internet microsoft succeeded in quickly building internet related technologies into its products when the industrys focus began shifting from the pc to the web microsofts habitual tardiness began to hurt years ago a few microsoft managers had started a service for brokering online ads but the effort died on the vine google built a huge business linking internet search results to advertisements microsoft only started investing seriously in its own search engine in and it remains an also ran behind google and yahoo mr mundie says advances in technology that represent "fundamental change" or "whole new business opportunities" are "more disruptive and so people arent as focused on them" at microsoft as they are on developing new features for existing products "when they encounter them they are naturally a bit more skeptical " microsofts product groups business units built around products such as windows and office that produce much of the companys cash have long had enormous clout in its corporate culture star product group managers the companys so called shippers get the big profitable products like windows out the door year after year for them meeting deadlines is all important longer term thinking about technology isnt mr mundie is trying to help shift some clout to the companys long term thinkers and to gain more attention for new technologies and businesses he nurtures small groups in areas he considers promising long term bets for microsoft such as health care education and super fast "quantum" computers during the past year to attract foreign talent he has opened more than small research centers in such distant locations as egypt chile malaysia and russia "i try to take these issues that look like theyre big business opportunities like health care " he explains "and create a home for them in a company that historically didnt have any business in the health care field " microsoft brings new technologies to market mainly through its traditional software products most of them ship at two to three year intervals mr mundie says that system can hold things up "theres a bus " he explains "if you get on the bus youre out if you miss the bus well the next bus is three years later " microsofts continuing development of new internet services an effort led by mr ozzie is providing new channels for getting software to market faster mr mundie says "making that effective across a diverse set of groups who arent working in lock step who have different business objectives thats the management challenge " he says as he scours microsofts global research network for promising technologies mr mundie tries to match them with product groups traveling with a small entourage of assistants he logs as many as miles a year meeting with microsoft researchers and government officials around the world this year that work has led him through a long list of countries including england germany egypt china india russia turkey and chile during a day of briefings on research projects in cambridge england in late january he asked researchers what support they needed and he prodded them to work more closely with product groups "its important that you get on a plane and meet face to face " he told one researcher as they discussed a new security technology the next day a researcher in germany described his work on a digital music technology mr mundie told him that microsofts zune music player group is "working on this stuff that youve already done its nutty " he told the researcher to start working with the vice president in charge of zune in cairo a day later he discovered a researcher duplicating work done by microsofts education group he told that researcher to coordinate better with the head of that group mr mundie says microsoft does a good job of pulling technology from research groups into existing products the challenge he says is anticipating what new technologies have the potential to become a big business for the company or conversely to threaten its foundation in peter neupert met with microsofts chief executive mr ballmer about returning to the company after a six year stint at drugstore com inc mr mundie was waiting outside mr ballmers door to talk mr neupert recalls working under mr mundie mr neupert soon was building a new group to develop technologies for the health care industry the health group bought two start ups a maker of databases for storing patient records and a web site for finding medical information online this spring the group got its first big allocation of money for expansion it plans to add people in the u s next month including doctors and other medical specialists and to bring aboard in china to do software development there mr neupert says although the group has started working with microsofts product groups it remains fairly autonomous and is allowed "to really operate like a start up " says mr neupert mr mundie has also nurtured technologies that product groups arent ready for several years ago the cambridge research group developed a new security technology capable of blocking computer "worms" and other potentially dangerous code mr gates says he was impressed but the product groups werent interested because the technology wasnt far enough along microsoft executives say mr mundie took it under his wing code named "vigilante " it is being developed by a handful of people in mr mundies group mr mundie has been warning his microsoft colleagues for years about a coming shift in semiconductors that could upset the companys most important businesses chip makers such as intel corp have been working on a way to increase semiconductor power without causing the chips to overheat it involves sticking what amounts to multiple chips or "cores" onto a single chip creating "multicore" chips some software experts contend that the change is so radical it will require software for large server computers and pcs to operate differently than it has for decades it is unclear however how quickly the change will come and what microsoft the worlds largest software maker will have to do to navigate it mr mundie contends it will come sooner than many people think and it will require new programming languages and techniques microsofts windows division has trained all its attention in recent years on finishing the much delayed windows vista operating system which shipped broadly early this year leaving the group little time to focus on the semiconductor issue microsoft executives say so mr mundie turned to a small group he had set up to develop software for robots thanks to the complexity of that task the group was well positioned to wrestle with the multicore chip problem mr mundie began using the group to test multicore software his aim is to demonstrate to the rest of microsoft the new demands the chips put on programming languages and software development tools microsofts research groups have begun experimenting with software technologies for multicore computers during his visit to cambridge mr mundie learned that researchers had been using a new multicore programming technology called "f sharp" to help a microsoft banking client manage a large system of server computers the technology mr mundie concluded was no longer just experimental but was working in the real world mr mundie told the researchers he was frustrated that "old line microsoft" skeptics back home had told him the technology was unproven "this is something that should be stuck in the face of the people who still think this is science fiction " he told them when mr mundie returned to headquarters he hosted meetings with several different groups in an effort to push forward development of multicore technology in april the cambridge researchers met with mr ballmer who says he told them he had "heard some buzz" about the f sharp technology he later sent an email to other top executives endorsing it andrew herbert managing director of the cambridge lab says that because mr mundie in his new role carries "authority and influence " product groups seem more motivated to consider new research tom gibbons a microsoft vice president who oversees software used in automobiles cable television boxes and certain mobile devices says he had written off multicore technology as something for the distant future he changed his mind after meeting in april with mr mundie and other executives the robot groups work he says helped persuade him that his group needed to get ready for the new chips sooner than he had thought mr gibbons recently dispatched engineers to visit manufacturing partners in taiwan and detroit to map out a strategy he says he may set up a new group to oversee the multicore work "i need to think of this as a completely new effort " he says
