abes election defeat may slow changes in japan ruling coalition loses upper house majority resignation is possible tokyo a stinging electoral defeat severely weakened japanese prime minister shinzo abe showing how little confidence voters have in his ability to deal with the challenges of a declining aging population just months after mr abe took office the ruling coalition lost its majority in the upper house in a defeat heavy enough that he might have to resign to take responsibility the loss is a sign of the difficulty mr abe is having in filling the shoes of his charismatic predecessor junichiro koizumi a transforming prime minister who raised the publics expectations of leadership the results mean that even if mr abe doesnt resign quickly japan might return to an era of short lived premiers who made incremental changes to the country without leaving major achievements the leading candidate to succeed mr abe foreign minister taro aso would be unlikely to make any big policy changes it isnt the upper house but the powerful lower house where the coalition holds a large majority that chooses the prime minister after most of the results were in yesterday mr abe said he would remain in office but if his liberal democratic party decides he has become a liability for future elections pressure might rise for him to go at the very least the defeat could hobble mr abe though his government will probably still be able to use its large lower house majority to pass legislation this will take longer than with upper house support that could make it harder for him to push changes to cope with japans aging society like deregulating inefficient sectors such as agriculture shoring up the national health and pension systems and reducing the number of public servants the results showed a huge advance for the main opposition the democratic party of japan or dpj with three seats to be decided the dpj had won of the upper house seats contested public broadcaster nhk said the ruling bloc consisting of mr abes ldp and the buddhist backed new komeito had won of the seats needed to keep its upper house majority the dpj despite its victory is unlikely to emerge as a strong alternative candidate for government because it is a collection of disparate political groupings the ldp has ruled japan almost continuously since either as a single party or as part of a coalition the immediate cause of mr abes defeat was a run of difficulties that made him appear not to be in charge when reports surfaced in may that million national pension records had gone missing people worried how they would survive in their old age mr abe first appeared to treat the problem casually saying simply that it would be investigated the public would have preferred immediate reassurances and punishment for the government agency involved opinion polls and analysts say then his agriculture minister committed suicide in may after he was investigated over questionable expenses and political donations the welfare minister offended women by saying they were "baby making machines " the defense minister resigned after offending victims of the u s atomic bomb attacks on hiroshima and nagasaki "the public perceives that mr abe is not imposing discipline in a way that is respectful of public opinion " said robert feldman morgan stanleys chief economist for japan mr abe already suffers in comparison with mr koizumi whose top down leadership allowed him to carry out tough measures that helped fix economic problems critics also say mr abe has trouble wielding authority in his administration at years of age he is younger than many of his ministers in a country where status comes with age while mr abe is in broad agreement with mr koizumis small government policies he is relatively inexperienced mr abes only ministerial experience before taking office was as mr koizumis chief cabinet secretary a combination of spokesman and chief of staff mr abe was elected leader because of his popularity for taking a tough stance on north koreas abduction of japanese citizens the impression of weak leadership put off many voters who are anxious to see quick decisive action to deal with a major demographic change the number of working age japanese has been declining since the turn of the century while the number of retirees is rising fast the coming days could see plenty of political maneuvering if mr abe quits the ldp would hold a leadership election perhaps in about a month and the winner would become prime minister miho inada contributed to this article
