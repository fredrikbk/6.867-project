marketwatch curb appeal how landscaping helps an infestation of carpenter ants signaled the impending demise of a shade tree in doug cowless yard almost years ago when he lived in downers grove ill in retrospect he knows that he should have given the trees a better look before buying the home "i had to pay to lose my shade " mr cowles says "once it was gone the deck wasnt as useful an asset to the property or as nice to enjoy " any real estate agent will emphasize the importance of curb appeal a homes first chance at a good impression based on how it looks from the street and from a sellers perspective a lush green lawn and manicured shrubs can do wonders in wooing a prospective buyer but buyers shouldnt get swept off their feet too quickly charmed by landscaping detail or the welcoming shade of a mature tree "try to get away from the paint and how pretty the landscaping is " says frank lesh president of the american society of home inspectors as well as an indian head park ill based inspector instead pay attention to how these outdoor elements are functioning noticing for example the health of the propertys plants how their placement could affect the home and the overall slope of the lawn he says consumers often perceive value in a homes landscaping at first glance and a study by the department of horticulture at michigan state university showed evidence of that the study presented participants in seven different markets with multiple pictures of the same home one image had only a lawn and cement sidewalk and driveway in front of the home others imposed various landscaping schemes says bridget behe one of the researchers and a professor of horticulture at michigan state the overall finding value increased from to for homes with good landscaping the elements most important to participants were those that displayed some design sophistication such as curving flower beds instead of rectangular boxes against the home the next most important element was plant size followed by the diversity of plant material in front of a home according to the study enhancing an average home with eye catching landscaping is "like putting a nicer frame on a modestly priced painting " ms behe says "it enhances the perceived value of that home " to identify exactly how much landscaping elements are worth some higher end home sellers are paying several hundred dollars for a service to profile and assign a value to the plants in their yards mr cowles the homeowner who had the misfortune of losing his tree to carpenter ants is the president and chief executive officer of horticultural asset management a cary n c based company that assesses a propertys plants for both insurance and real estate purposes the company aims to help quantify the curb appeal of a property mr cowles says using the assessment a prospective buyer can consider the value of a propertys mature trees many of which could cost &# to &# each to replace he adds the seller of a median priced home likely wont spring for a thorough evaluation of trees instead as a buyer nears the closing table a home inspector will probably evaluate outdoor elements to make sure conditions wont cause problems tomorrow before seriously considering a property however it might be a good idea for a buyer to look over a homes exterior here are some trouble spots to watch plant health even if youre not an arborist there are some telltale signs that a plant is sick wilting plants or brown and crispy leaves are warning signs that a plant might not be in good health ms behe says mushrooms and fungus at the bottom of a tree are also warning signs adds mr cowles who would also advise looking for evidence of insect problems tree limb location check if any limbs are touching a roof or could interfere with a power line both possible areas of concern but be especially aware of a tree limb hanging over the chimney mr lesh cautions not only could animals climb into the chimney but a blocking branch could affect the draft and create higher carbon monoxide levels in the home problems underground its tougher to look for evidence of heavy root growth than it is to take a survey of the limbs above but sometimes roots will make their presence known by lifting or cracking a sidewalk or driveway creating a trip hazard mr lesh says also a depression in the yard could indicate a leaking sewer line as a result of root interference the lay of the land take a drive around the block and get a good look at the ground the home is on mr lesh says is it at the bottom of the hillside at the top of one or on flat land its important that rain isnt able to follow a downward slope toward the foundation a condition that could lead to flooding foliage proximity watch out for foliage that is close to the houses exterior mr lesh says because it can provide a shelter for insects and rodents that allows them to hide from their predators and gives them an excellent vantage point to enter the house deck construction while a deck isnt a living part of the landscape its still an important one to inspect mr lesh says make sure that the deck is fastened to the house correctly and is supported properly it should have places for people to grab onto he says and balusters should be close enough that a four inch ball couldnt fit between them ensuring that a childs head couldnt get stuck amy hoak writes for
