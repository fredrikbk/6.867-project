business solutions help yourself companies try to make the web an alternative to phone support more and more companies are sending people to the web for customer support but most companies dont make it easy for people to find answers once they get there search tools often dont work very well the libraries of frequently asked questions arent always kept current and as tech and other companies increasingly rely on discussion forums to handle customer queries it isnt always easy to tell whether the people answering your question actually know what theyre talking about now some companies are starting to adopt improved software that can make online support more useful there are search tools that help visitors narrow down their query and find the most likely answer to their problems in discussion forums new programs make sure that questions get answered quickly by someone who knows the answer and that those answers are easily available to other customers and the best sites make it easy to connect with a live help desk agent if necessary for now at least much of the best online support tends to come from high tech companies which need to divert as many customers as possible away from high cost phone support more tech companies are also charging for hands on help so online support is a way to give nonpaying customers some assistance business to business companies also tend to have good web support since their customers tend to be technical support staffers who are comfortable with finding answers themselves consider cnh global nv a maker of construction and agricultural equipment based in the netherlands since its dealer based service departments have been able go online to get help in troubleshooting problems that arent yet included in its published service manuals but with documents on models using a common search engine to hunt for a problem might turn up hundreds of irrelevant documents so cnh turned to search and knowledge base tools from consona corp of indianapolis for instance a dealer wondering whether the companys new holland t tractor can burn biodiesel fuel can narrow the search by the model number then type in the query the tool will deliver a service bulletin that provides guidelines for using biodiesel in new holland engines "the dealer doesnt have to play phone tag " says steven petersen who manages the cnh knowledge base "they can get the customer up and going again quickly " some other sites particularly technology ones are relying on discussion forums their basic appeal is easy to understand they enable especially knowledgeable customers to help the less knowledgeable at little cost to the company they also at least in theory build customer loyalty by creating a community for future marketing pitches and other contacts but a successful support forum requires more than just opening the gates to customer problems it needs a critical mass of users so that its more likely that any given question finds an answer this means promoting the site visitors also need to expect to get their questions answered which requires some monitoring to make sure unanswered queries get attention from the help desk "if someone posts a question and doesnt get an answer they dont post again " says john ragsdale vice president of research for the service and support professionals association trade group forums are crucial to palm inc of sunnyvale calif the maker of hand held devices has long offered help forums and other self service web support but as recently as last year less than a third of the users expressed overall satisfaction with the online service "thats a number we were not satisfied with " says john moses palms vice president of customer relations moreover users were abandoning palms forum that was troubling enough but it brought other complications for instance it was harder for palm to track emerging problems or other support trends since many users were going to independent outside forums for support so palm redesigned its support site improving its appearance and adding new search capabilities from kana software inc menlo park calif in january it relaunched its forum site using software from lithium technologies inc emeryville calif the forum which gets about posts a week relies on about active contributors who moderate forums and step in to answer user questions moderators are chosen based on the amount of their participation and the quality of their answers and palm rewards them with products accessories and shirts in addition members of the customer support staff monitor the groups and pass along unanswered questions to palms call center for a response sometimes though customers dont get their problems solved online how easy should a company make it to get to a live person palm for one places a button that launches a live chat session with a technical support agent on the page for sending an email support request it also has a chat button on the troubleshooting page for its most common support question how to move data between a hand held and a computer but other pages dont yet have the "click to chat" feature while making a chat session available from anywhere on the site might defeat the purpose of online self service making sure that customers get their questions addressed means its important to be able to easily get a live support agent "we dont want people to get so frustrated that they bail out and dont get help at all " mr moses says bank of america corp initially used online chat to support sales and marketing efforts such as signing up for credit cards or applying for home equity loans now it has gone further in making it easier to get a live agent last year the charlotte n c banking company began putting click to chat buttons on key pages on its web site if customers need help in adding a payee for online bill payments for instance they can click on a chat button on the page in addition using software from new york based liveperson inc bank of america can detect when a customer is having trouble on the site the company can then cause a chat button to appear or even launch a chat session with a specialist to help the customer in surveys customers say theyre happier getting instant answers in online chat than waiting for an email or having to pick up the phone and call for support says gayle wellborn bank of americas executive in charge of online services and products they also say theyre more likely to have their problems solved on the first try ms wellborn expects to expand the use of online chat to more parts of the site "we want to give our customers choices about how they want to get service " she says mr totty is a news editor for the journal report in san francisco he can be reached at
