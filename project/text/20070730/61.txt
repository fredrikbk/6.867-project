politics &amp economics hamas to show an improved hand organization aims to capitalize on intelligence gains from gaza takeover when the islamist group hamas conquered the gaza strip in june it seized an intelligence and military infrastructure created with u s help by the security chiefs of the palestinian territorys former ruler according to current and former israeli intelligence officials former u s intelligence personnel and palestinian officials hamas has increased its inventory of arms since the takeover of gaza and picked up technical expertise such as espionage techniques that could assist the group in its fight against israel or washingtons palestinian allies the fatah movement founded by yasser arafat hamas leaders say they acquired thousands of paper files computer records videos photographs and audio recordings containing valuable and potentially embarrassing intelligence information gathered by fatah for more than a decade fatah operated a vast intelligence network in gaza established under the tutelage of the central intelligence agency hamas leaders are expected as early as tomorrow to go public with some of the documents and the secrets they hold the exact nature of the threat posed by the intelligence grab in gaza including any damage to u s intelligence operations in the palestinian territories and the broader middle east is difficult to ascertain u s and israeli officials generally tried to play down any losses saying any intelligence damage is likely minimal but a number of former u s intelligence officials including some who have worked closely with the palestinians said there was ample reason to worry that hamas has acquired access to important spying technology as well as intelligence information that could be helpful to hamas in countering israeli and u s efforts against the group "people are worried and reasonably so about what kind of intelligence losses we may have suffered " said one former u s intelligence official with extensive experience in gaza a u s government official said he doubted serious secrets were compromised in the gaza takeover other officials said they had no reason to believe that u s spying operations elsewhere in the arab world had been compromised close ties between hamas and the governments of iran and syria also mean that intelligence and spying techniques could be shared with the main middle east rivals of the bush administration as the white house prepares to lead an international effort to bolster fatahs security apparatus in the west bank the losses in gaza stand as an example of how efforts to help fatah can backfire the compromised intelligence hamas says it now has ranges widely the group alleges it has videos used in a sexual blackmail operation run by washingtons allies inside fatahs security apparatus but the group also says it has uncovered detailed evidence of fatah controlled spying operations carried out in arab and muslim countries for the benefit of the u s and other foreign governments hamas also alleges that fatah intelligence operatives cooperated with israeli intelligence officials to target islamist leaders for assassination "what we have is good enough for us to completely reveal the practices of fatah controlled security services both locally and throughout the region " said khalil al hayya a senior hamas official in gaza who has assumed a leading role on the intelligence issue for the islamist group michael scheuer a former top cia counterterrorism analyst who left the agency in said the u s had provided the fatah controlled palestinian authority with "substantial help" in training as well as computers other equipment and analytical tools other former intelligence officials confirmed that the u s gave fatah controlled services sophisticated intelligence gathering equipment including eavesdropping technology though these officials wouldnt provide more precise details about the technology this kind of technology along with the knowledge it yields is broadly known in intelligence circles as "sigint " which is shorthand for "signals intelligence " it can include eavesdropping equipment devices used for intercepting radio microwave and telephone communications and telemetry technology that allows the user to pinpoint the location of someone holding a communication device such as a cellphone "the united states invested a lot of effort in setting up this system in gaza construction equipment training filings the logistics the transportation it was a big operation and its now in the hands of the other side " said efraim halevy who formerly headed both the mossad which is israels foreign intelligence agency and israels national security council mr halevy said however that he didnt want to overemphasize the value of hamass potential intelligence gains avi dichter israels public security minister and the former head of shin bet the domestic intelligence and counterterrorism agency also said he didnt want to overemphasize the potential benefits to hamas but he confirmed that the islamist group seized sigint technology and expertise during its gaza sweep he declined to provide specifics but said it had been provided by the americans the british and the french mr dichter who left the shin bet when his five year term as its chief ended in also said the potential damage goes beyond hamass ability to turn the technology against its enemies now he said the militants could gain an understanding of how such technology is used against them allowing them to adopt more sophisticated counter measures "its not only the tools its also the philosophy thats behind them " he said hamas leaders are being vague about the equipment and technological know how they captured mr hayya said some important former fatah operatives in gaza all of whom were granted amnesty after hamas took over were now cooperating with the group on intelligence matters easier to assess is the threat posed by the military hardware hamas picked up after the takeover the militant group seized an arsenal of arms and munitions captured from u s backed security forces loyal to fatah and its leader palestinian president mahmoud abbas mr dichter said hamas gained roughly the same number of weapons during a few days that it would have taken the group nearly a year to amass from smuggling operations hamas says it is using the armaments to build a popular army in gaza israeli intelligence and security officials estimate the islamist group has some armed men in gaza as for fatahs secrets hamas leaders say they grabbed intelligence stashes from three locations the headquarters in gaza city of the preventive security force the palestinian authority intelligence headquarters which were housed in a gaza city office known as "il safina " or "the ship" and a nearby satellite intelligence office dubbed "il mashtal " or "the nursery " all three sites were long under the sway of fatah strongman mohammed dahlan who first became an important cia ally in gaza in at the time then cia director george tenet began working openly with mr dahlan and other palestinian officials to build up security services aimed at combating the rise of hamas and like minded extremist groups that rejected the oslo peace accords
