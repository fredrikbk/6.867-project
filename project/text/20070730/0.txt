a country to fight for an old saw has it that the best proof of a mans loyalties lies in the sports teams he roots for if so iraqs fairytale victory yesterday over saudi arabia in soccers asia cup and the euphoria it inspired from basra to baghdad to kirkuk is a timely reminder that iraq is not just a notional country "once again our national team has shown that there is only one united iraq " sabah shaiyal a baghdad policeman told the associated press "you can see the national feeling " added one abu baqir of sadr city to a reporter from the new york times "it has always been there and we hope this winning will be the beginning of the end of sectarianism " it is easy to get carried away by the symbolism of a single soccer victory still it was remarkable that the winning team known as the "lions of the two rivers" was iraqi in the broadest sense of the word younis mahmoud the team captain who scored the winning goal is turkman teammate hawar mulla mohammed who put the ball into position is kurdish goalkeeper noor sabri is shiite arab no less remarkable were the circumstances in which the team had to train and compete coach jorvan vieira of brazil had to move the iraqi players beyond their political differences the team which could not train on home turf went from match to match in economy seats their saudi rivals travelled more comfortably the celebration of their previous victory over south korea was cut short by a suicide bombing that killed yet for everything they lacked the iraqis had a powerful if intangible asset over their more pampered rivals a country to fight for perhaps their victory will give all iraqis a taste of what they may yet achieve together
