as costs rise whirlpool makes a dent in dings as the cost of the metal and plastics it uses to build appliances has soared recently whirlpool corp has tried the predictable things use less of the stuff or find cheaper substitutes but an initiative involving cardboard styrofoam and a &# supercomputer has become a key front in whirlpools battle against rising costs the enemy dents dings and scrapes that rob the company of millions of dollars each year over the past two years whirlpool assembled a team of engineers in india and the u s to figure out how to improve the way its appliances are packed stacked and handled it used the supercomputer to model the stress its bulky products undergo when theyre stacked five high or squeezed with the pounds of force in the pincers of its forklift like clamp trucks and it sent its engineers into warehouses to study how and how often its ovens are squeezed together swept against walls and loaded into trucks "this is an industry where youre looking for pennies out of each unit " says brian hancock vice president of north american supply chain operations whirlpool expects to save &# for every dollar it spends on the initiative the company found that a whirlpool washing machine is clamped and moved up to times en route from the factory to distribution centers to retailers warehouses and consumers homes a wide window in which it can end up damaged with once basic appliances striving for luxury cachet just the appearance of damage to the packaging of a top of the line refrigerator that can cost as much as &# might prompt a buyer to return it even if the product itself is unspoiled "they wont even uncrate it " mr hancock says the benton harbor mich company has been working to streamline costs amid skyrocketing commodities prices and in the wake of its merger with maytag corp steel plastic copper zinc and other materials amount to about of an appliances cost says chairman and chief executive jeff fettig late this month whirlpool said its raw materials costs would rise by about &# million this year effectively wiping out the more than &# million in savings the company said it expected to reap from the maytag merger this year since april whirlpool shares have risen on the strength of its international operations and better than expected performance in the slumping u s housing market but some analysts have noted the merger savings and initiatives like the packaging revamp will be essential to offsetting the added commodity costs for decades manufacturers have worked to reduce the cost of the cardboard plastic and foam that protect products but companies like whirlpool in recent years have realized that how products are packed and how they are handled during shipping need to be looked at together says ralph rupert director of a packaging center at virginia tech in blacksburg va "why try to reduce my packaging spend half a percent when if i just keep one product from being damaged ive paid for weeks worth of packaging goods " prof rupert says americans bought &# billion of major appliances last year according to the npd group a market research firm in port washington n y whirlpools packaging initiative evolved from a chance meeting at headquarters two summers ago between thomas gielda a director of engineering and patrick yates a supply chain quality manager who works on damage reduction projects mr yates was trying to understand why dents repeatedly appeared on the bottom side corners of whirlpools classic washers and dryers return rates had swelled and whirlpools engineers were stymied mr gielda perked up about a year earlier a &# front loading whirlpool duet washer he was trying out at home came with a dent in the back left side he kept it because he figured no one would see the dent but "i was not very happy " he says he offered his help in tackling the problem mr gielda who oversees computer modeling used in designing appliances worked with mr yates and his team of engineers to study how clamp truck drivers hauled the machines inside ohio manufacturing plants and distribution centers after setting up a computer model of the process the engineers discovered the clamp trucks sometimes were squeezing the washers too tightly says mr yates they also found that the lower corners of the machines were bearing a disproportionate amount of the force the company got new taller clamps with firmer metal to help distribute the force better they changed the packaging adding a sturdy cardboard beam across the machines tops to ease pressure on the lower corners "its not intuitive that you would put something on top to protect the bottom but it works " says mr gielda in the three months after the packaging design changes were implemented in the fall damage rates on the washers and dryers declined more than saving millions of dollars he says "it was a big wake up call for the supply chain " he says with the new supercomputer and added engineers for the project mr gielda says the company will build simulations of its products and packaging together before making prototypes the results will start showing up in packaging in or he says mr yates says big retailers have been reluctant to upgrade or change their clamp trucks and other equipment the company says the retailers have pressured it instead to make its products and packaging stronger as retailers and consumers become more exacting the program has moved beyond damage to machines to look for ways to minimize scarring on the packaging itself in december whirlpool warehouse workers noticed styrofoam corners on some side by side door refrigerators made in mexico were broken by the time they arrived in the u s whirlpool engineers marked down how many refrigerators arriving from mexico at its fort worth texas distribution center came off the trucks with broken styrofoam corners they realized the corners were cracking because the styrofoam molds werent shaped properly leaving some space between them and the refrigerators whirlpool engineers in india pieced together digital models of the refrigerators and their packaging they simulated the effects of adding another styrofoam panel to the corner molds and changing their shape to fill in the space they settled on the latter option using the supercomputer the company fixed the problem in several weeks a process that previously took several months "this type of analysis you wouldnt expect in an appliance company " says mr gielda "they didnt do it because they didnt think it was important and were finding out it is important "
