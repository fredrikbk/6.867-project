when parallel parking was new and meters seemed un american parking on city streets today is a cinch compared with the s when free unlimited parking was considered every americans constitutional right just as their grandparents had tied their horses to the general stores rail american drivers expected handy curb space for their cars when they went to town by the s however there were too many cars and too few curbs the result was chaos employees of downtown businesses hogged spaces for whole days some merchants deliberately parked their cars in front of competitors stores other drivers circled the narrow streets waiting for a rare free space trucks loading or unloading double parked in most cities there were no marks on curbs to delineate spaces in the few timed spaces enforcement by chalking the tires was easy to beat and the art of parallel parking was in its infancy "none of our cities were designed for motor traffic and only in the west were they young enough when the automobile arrived en masse to adapt themselves to the new traffic medium " wrote arthur pound in the atlantic monthly magazine in for drivers downtown bottlenecks were maddening but for retail businesses that depended on customer turnover they were ruinous some large cities tried banning all parking on a few major thoroughfares but many shoppers wouldnt walk even a few blocks from their car to a store they took their business to the periphery of the city in the oklahoma city chamber of commerce decided it had to do something about the citys downtown parking problem a local newspaper editor carl magee was charged with finding a solution mr magee invented the park o meter the nations first parking meters crude single coin machines that charged a nickel an hour were installed in oklahoma city in july public opinion ranged from mockery to indignation one day two couples set up a folding table and four chairs in a parking space deposited a nickel in the meter and played a rubber of bridge but many drivers believed that charging for parking was downright un american the "newfangled nuisances " "damn foolish contraptions" or "gypometers " opponents said illegally infringed on the individuals right to free use of the public streets they amounted to a tax on automobiles depriving owners of their property without due process "this is just a combination of an alarm clock and a slot machine which is being used for further socking the motorist who is already paying enough in taxes " argued william gottlieb of the automobile club of new york there was little legal precedent for cities trying to tax parking although in an english coachman was indicted for allowing his carriages to remain an unreasonable amount of time in a public street "every unauthorized obstruction of a highway to the annoyance of the kings subjects is a nuisance " the court ruled "the kings highway is not to be used as a stable yard " in oklahoma city a local lawyer quickly filed a legal challenge to the meters and obtained a temporary restraining order eventually oklahoma courts ruled the meters legal but in the alabama supreme court declared birminghams parking meters to be an unauthorized exercise of the citys taxing power and ordered them removed other state courts allowed parking meters but only if their primary purpose was to regulate traffic not to raise revenue a distinction that quickly faded in the lean days of the depression mr magee already a wealthy man before his invention was an unlikely parking consultant as a crusading newspaper editor and lawyer in new mexico in the s he had been instrumental in exposing the teapot dome oil scandal which resulted in albert b fall then secretary of the interior going to jail mr magee also did a series of reports on corruption in new mexicos courts leading to his arrest and conviction for libel he was later pardoned by the governor subsequently one of the new mexico judges mr magee had targeted in his series ran into him in a las vegas hotel and knocked him down mr magee pulled out a revolver and fired at the judge killing a bystander instead he was tried and acquitted of manslaughter but soon after left new mexico for oklahoma where he started a weekly newspaper mr magees invention spread fast by the early s there were more than parking meters operating in the u s retailers liked the regular turnover of parking spaces and most drivers resigned themselves to a practical necessity a few resentful drivers tried to "beat" the meter inserting an inventive range of slugs trolley tokens washers plastic discs used in board games foreign coins paper clips amusement park ride tokens in providence r i police found a carat gold wedding ring heavy blows to the head of the meter could also sometimes buy time in san antonio a local newspaper reported in that city officials were allowing parking meters for horses "mr john farmer can ride up in some mode of conveyance drawn by horse wrap the reins around the meter insert his nickel and ankle off to transact his business " email me at cynthia crossen wsj com
