boss talk no the ceo isnt sir richard branson virgin atlantics ridgway balances profit innovation and keeps the planes on time sir richard branson is the founder chairman and brash public face of british carrier virgin atlantic airways ltd but chief executive steve ridgway is the one who quietly keeps the airline running from virgins founding in with a promise to be a different kind of airline it has grown into one of the worlds most unusual carriers it flies only long routes and offers more amenities than most rivals its "upper class" premium cabin a blend of first and business class grabs attention with innovations like inflight manicures and complimentary limo rides to and from airports the family of brands in sir richards virgin group from music stores to cola to cellphones all are presented with an air of hipness and iconoclasm mr ridgway once a designer of ocean racing yachts and a championship racer must deliver that image to passengers aboard virgin atlantic in the me too airline industry balancing originality and profitability is tough carriers need to squeeze as many people as possible onto a plane and charge the highest fare possible countless airlines have failed trying to boost service while cutting prices on aug virgin atlantic gets a new sibling virgin america which will connect san francisco los angeles and las vegas with new york and washington d c the two carriers are separate companies but will cooperate carrying connecting passengers like virgin atlantic virgin america promises innovations that it says will offer superior service for low fares with the prospect of rising competition across the atlantic next year thanks to partial deregulation of the market mr ridgway talked with the wall street journal about airline branding and management excerpts wsj as an international carrier virgin is small by global standards but youve got a big brand how do you make such a big footprint with such a small foot mr ridgway weve only got planes but we are a dedicated long haul carrier we only fly big twin aisle aircraft so while its not that many planes we put a huge amount of capacity in the market its over five million passengers which is not to be sneered at add to that other aspects of the virgin group and for the final element add richards persona combine those things and you have a situation where we clearly do punch above our weight from day one we wanted to be known for our innovation its ironic we fly identical boeing and airbus aircraft as other carriers and yet we do make our experience feel different its the culmination of the way we approach design and innovation and above all its about the chemistry of the people who work for virgin and their commitment youth and fervor wsj how is it for you as ceo to have such a high profile chairman grabbing all the attention mr ridgway richard is a huge asset he is the persona of the business and many of the other virgin companies hes a sort of global personality ive long known that he and i have been really close friends for a very long time and we work together well hes not involved in the day to day running of the business he trusts us to do that i think he trusts my instincts we have very similar philosophies in terms of what were trying to achieve so he doesnt have to bring up the ideas theres no shortage of ideas around our company and among our customers the art is choosing the good ones and he has a good instinct for that he is fantastic in the things that matter this is still a very political industry its the last great global industry that hasnt had the shackles of regulation taken off it he is amazing in engaging in punching above his weight in political circles he remains a great pr spokesman an icon for the business and he is amazing when we do our big marketing pushes and route launches hes done two inaugurals already this year and hes unsurpassed on that we get huge bang for our buck in firing up new markets and new routes with the combination of our brand and our personality and him and he remains very wedded to the airline he retains incredibly good instincts for the consumer he and i are the champion of the consumer proposition that has been at the forefront of the whole virgin atlantic philosophy for over years and that was the revolution we put the customer at the heart of the business that wasnt how airlines were run historically they were run technically by operational people who didnt really like passengers because they turned up late and dropped peanuts everywhere wsj virgin has introduced many appealing innovations like inflight massages and seats that spread flat but its easy to spend money in the airline business without making a profit how do you decide which goodies to splurge on mr ridgway fundamentally its around the value proposition and what consumers will pay for our single biggest innovation was always to try to wrong foot the market weve always positioned our products half a notch out of the convention the big upper class revolution apart from what we provide in terms of the limousines and massages all that was put together as a first class product but sold at a business class fare premium economy between coach and business was pretty close to a business class product and service but sold at an economy class fare and the big value added in economy was that we were the first airline to be completely egalitarian years before anyone else and put seat back video in all cabins it wasnt just for the beautiful people at the front of the plane wsj do you ever have ideas for innovations that seem too crazy and what if an idea fails mr ridgway as an airline driven by the customer proposition we probably have disproportionate resources although not hugely in terms of talent our design teams our service development teams we really put focus on putting the right people in there we have no shortage of ideas we also have confidence about doing things that consumers probably wouldnt recognize they would want until they see it we obviously do research but often we have gone to consumer groups with ideas that have bombed and weve just gone ahead and done them anyway and people have said "wow this is great " the most famous example was our club houses upper class lounges they go way beyond what other airlines do with their lounges when we did the first one back in the early s we went to consumer groups with a whole plethora of features and options and most of them they couldnt get their heads around they wanted somewhere that was quiet somewhere they could get a snack and somewhere they could make phone calls when we said to them "would you like to have your hair cut or your shoes shined " they said "we dont want any of that " we put it all in there anyway and they all went "oh wow this is great " wsj it was a pretty big risk to do that no mr ridgway i think thats the whole point as a company you have to be confident in yourself about what you can do consumers dont know what they dont know if i had said to you years ago youd be sitting here with your blackberry youd have said "rubbish " i think you have to have confidence in your own people and your own teams despite the customers by all means go and validate it and tune it and some of it if you get it wrong you have to go change it if you are an innovation led company you should not be frightened of failure in fact for every eight or ideas you generate maybe only one or two of them will come to fruition the trouble is if you have things that dont work and you become very critical of that i think youre in danger of being very cautious and going backwards at the end of the day it comes back to what can you afford to give the customers in terms of offering the best value consumers recognize value wsj even in the airline industry mr ridgway were living in a very polarized world now youre either an absolute price leader youre a ryanair a southwest airlines a wal mart and youre just hugely efficient and you will not be touched on price or cost or youre over on the quality end of the market with the guccis and the pradas and youre a quality leader i think thats what we are that drives many of the decisions around the quality of our products and the quality of our services its in our dna wsj starting next april any airline from the european union will be allowed to fly from anywhere in the eu to anywhere in the u s youve talked about starting new services from the continent what prospects do you see mr ridgway we have a franchise that goes beyond airlines with the whole virgin group thing we can take that brand and that franchise and take some opportunities and fly from new york to paris or frankfurt or milan or wherever we will look at that very actively i think that of all the airlines that can do it its probably far easier for us to do it than for lufthansa to take their brand to london or british airways to take their brand to paris i think thats really quite exciting its exactly the situation we were in when we started against ba could we put a proposition together to carve out enough market share to make a living there are two ways of doing it either you barrel in with large aircraft and do a full offering across the product spectrum or given our positioning and our franchise keeping to the premium market probably our instinct would be to start off with a premium offering and target the fact that some of the european carriers have a weaker premium offering than we have you could start off doing that without a huge risk around market share and the fact is we have got this presence in the u s market in the u s corporate market the most important market is to london so we are a player in that market and the fact is these organizations and individuals also have traffic to places like paris and frankfurt so we come in with that franchise already there wsj london and especially heathrow airport is one of the worlds best airline markets but next april more u s and eu carriers will be allowed to fly between heathrow and the u s not just yourselves british airways american airlines and united airlines how will that change your business mr ridgway i dont think it will change it hugely weve already been competing with all these other carriers anyway and ba remains the dominant competitor theyre the ones we always want to see off i think when we see off ba we by definition see off the others as well especially in terms of the quality of the offering
