theory &amp practice critics see some good from sarbanes oxley as law turns five they say its too costly but it exposes problems before they explode invitrogen corp spent about &# million and hours of employees time last year reviewing its inventory counting procedures computer system access and other "internal controls " the checks required by the sarbanes oxley corporate reform law found small gaps in documentation but no hint of accounting fraud officials at the carlsbad calif biotechnology company think the costs are excessive but they say sarbanes oxley helped to spur other changes that made invitrogen a better run business directors meet more often without executives present multiple ombudsmen field employee complaints ethics training is more rigorous and chief executive greg lucier requires his lieutenants to take more responsibility for their results "sarbanes oxley brought a lot more focus to the efforts we were already taking " mr lucier says "invitrogen investors are better protected because sarbanes oxley regulations have been put in place " invitrogens experience is instructive as the sarbanes oxley law marks its fifth anniversary today the law passed overwhelmingly by congress in the wake of scandals at enron corp worldcom inc and elsewhere has proved costlier than executives would have liked by the end of this year public companies in the u s will have spent more than &# billion to comply estimates amr research a boston technology research firm that figure covers everything from staffing to consultant fees and technology but even critics acknowledge the law has done some good "there is without question greater accountability in the boardroom " says thomas lehner an official of the business roundtable a washington group representing big company ceos more boards resolve potential problems "before they fester and explode " concurs john olson a senior partner at gibson dunn &amp crutcher who advises directors at about a dozen concerns and institutional shareholders hurt by the scandals applaud the laws impact "sarbanes oxley really has been a critical safeguard in reassuring investors and restoring confidence in the integrity of companies financial statements " says dan pedrotty head of the afl cios office of investment the sarbanes oxley statute demanded more rigorous internal controls forced top executives to certify the accuracy of financial results and created a watchdog for auditing firms it also expanded the role of board audit committees and required companies to take "whistleblower" complaints more seriously related stock exchange rules bolstered boardroom independence by requiring regular private sessions of independent directors among other changes "in the minds of the investing public those are important safeguards and i think in fact they are " mr lehner says securities and exchange commission chairman christopher cox said last week that the law helped to restore confidence in u s financial markets he also said that compliance costs for the law are falling and that the review of internal controls has "contributed significantly to more reliable financial reporting " during the first years after the law took effect the heightened focus on internal controls prompted hundreds of companies to disclose "material weaknesses" in their accounting and to restate prior financial results in for example medical products maker baxter international inc cited errors in income tax accounting and said it would restate financial results from through the third quarter of the restatement increased the companys previously reported stockholders equity by about &# million for to but didnt alter revenue or earnings a spokesman says baxter fixed the errors and declines further comment more recently the wave of restatements and weakness disclosures appears to have crested as more companies fixed old problems and avoided new ones in nearly of companies with annual revenue over &# million warned of material weaknesses reports corporate executive board a washington research firm last year that proportion dropped to the number of companies restating financial results nearly tripled to from between and according to proxy advisers glass lewis &amp co in the first six months of this year though the number of companies with restatements fell to from in the year earlier half invitrogen officials say theyve always imposed strict ethical and financial controls but sarbanes oxley requires extensive reviews to ensure that financial controls are sound last year that meant that the employee company with annual revenue of nearly &# billion monitored about accounting processes and controls according to kelli richard vice president of finance three years of such reviews have uncovered only minor issues involving documentation of procedures and small variations during the integration of acquisitions directors and executives say "at the core controls were fine " says donald grimm invitrogens lead director and a retired eli lilly &amp co executive "but sometimes at the edges they werent as good as they should be " last year for example a new software system in europe delayed customer invoices swelling accounts receivable the boards audit committee asked internal and outside auditors to investigate further and concluded "there was no accounting or financial reporting issue " says raymond dittamore a retired partner of ernst &amp young and an invitrogen director who is chairman of that committee chief financial officer david hoffmeister says the initial scrutiny of internal controls mandated by sarbanes oxley cost &# million to &# million in last year the tab was &# million because invitrogen no longer needed numerous outside consultants nonetheless mr hoffmeister says employees "are still spending the same amount of time" on compliance he and other invitrogen officials say sarbanes oxley has had a big impact in other ways too messrs lucier and hoffmeister now must swear to the accuracy and completeness of financial results so mr lucier requires nearly other executives including those overseeing functional groups such as law and information technology to certify their reports to him before sarbanes oxley top executives reviewed results by talking to eight financial controllers world wide "you sit across from your fellow board members and look them in the eye " says mr lucier who arrived in "you know you have to certify results you realize that has a lot of consequences " mr lucier also beefed up invitrogens code of conduct each employee must take a minute tutorial about the code annually then agree in writing to observe it the revamped code dubbed protocol is available in languages and contains colorful examples of hypothetical misdeeds such as falsified accounting for warehouse shipments in order to achieve profit targets in late invitrogen assigned ombudsmen to all of its major sites where they handle complaints from would be whistleblowers complaints involving accounting or financial results get forwarded immediately to mr dittamore "no significant violations have been raised " says john skousen invitrogens vice president of compliance in before sarbanes oxley became law invitrogens outside directors began meeting among themselves now the audit committee also meets in executive sessions the sessions encourage frank discussions giving directors more chances to say "this doesnt smell right we have to go back and dig deeper " mr grimm says in april mr lucier surprised the board by proposing to promote an executive to a newly created post during the executive session that followed the nine independent directors objected that the official lacked the right experience directors said "we dont think this is going to work " mr grimm recalls so "we took that back to greg " heeding their protests mr lucier says he agreed to phase in his colleagues new duties that approach "satisfied everyones concerns " mr grimm says
