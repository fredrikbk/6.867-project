the daily fix contador emerges with victory as tour de fiasco ends in paris online edition alberto contador a year old spaniard on the discovery channel team yesterday won a tarnished tour de france tarnished because a half dozen top riders either failed drug tests were banished for evading the testers or are in forced retirement or suspended for drug cases "although the racing itself in this tour was splendid give or take performances by alexandre vinokourov and michael rasmussen that apparently owed more to their pharmacists than to the riders it is impossible to argue that the race was not a fiasco a debacle " samuel abt writes in the international herald tribune iht "the question now is where will the sport go and what future does the tour de france have " results mr abt quotes from a survey by the french newspaper lequipe are troubling but inconclusive more damning are the words of two english columnists "if you produce an event in which nobody cares who wins you have created antisport " simon barnes writes in the times of london "in subnuclear physics when particle and antiparticle interact the result is simultaneous annihilation it is the same with sport and antisport all sports contain particles of anti sport the trick is to stop them interacting with sport that is what failed to happen in the tour de france the result has been spectacular " the guardians richard williams noticed seven time champ lance armstrong looking on as mr contador won and wrote "the discovery channel teams ceremonial parade yesterday will have been their last at least under that name since the title sponsor is due to quit armstrong and his co owners may find it hard to secure new backing given the possibility of a more general exodus of companies angered by the tide of bad publicity " nonetheless mr williams ends on a hopeful note writing that the paris crowds for sundays finish "showed enough enthusiasm to suggest that we have not seen the last of this permanently beleaguered yet remarkably durable and often beguilingly beautiful institution " the annual finish along the champs elysees "is among the most stirring sights in all of sport and all the scandals of the past week could not change that at least " in the iht jere longman writes that fans can be expected to forgive and forget not just this tarnished tour but other recent sports scandals "fans keep making accommodations " mr longman writes "they rationalize even persist in willful denial about the transgressions of their heroes staying devoted to sport as entertainment and facilitator of moral development however quaint that notion can seem " fans might have reached their breaking point last week if the fantastical worst case scenario imagined by slates josh levin had come to pass among mr levins imagined lowlights "jason mcelwain the autistic teenager who won the nations heart by making six three pointers in his first and only high school basketball game was not really a teenager and was feigning his autism white house spokesman tony snow announced today the president was deeply saddened to hear that the young man we knew and loved as "j mac" is actually former nba sharpshooter tim legler snow said in his afternoon press briefing " for the provincial english fan who is blissfully unaware of the names michael vick michael rasmussen and tim donaghy this season "might be the worst ever summer of sport " the uks observer writes the paper looks back on a woeful season and then looks way back at the far better times of summer eager for one cynicism free sports highlight fans came to cooperstown n y to watch cal ripken and tony gwynn be inducted into baseballs hall of fame a gathering that shattered prior records "not that it was crazy here sunday but a yard sign at a house just down the road from the hall of fame induction ceremonies read parking &# with free house sportslines scott miller writes from the town of bursting at its seams the washington posts thomas boswell adds "to give a sense of the jaw dropping scope of the scene neither ripken nor gwynn ever in his career had played a game before so many fans since no major league ballpark holds so many for comparison when brooks robinson was inducted here in a crowd of set what was then a record on this sunday however a throng worthy of any world series had trekked as a pilgrimage and testimony to their values to one of americas more inaccessible villages " at least a few of the came to see the induction of the st louis post dispatchs rick hummel who gets his due from colleague bernie miklasz watching gwynn and ripken who got their due appreciation from the fix here and here respectively accept their honors gave baltimore sun columnist peter schmuck hope "that the good guys

cooperstown to the playing fields where barry bonds remains two home runs shy of passing hank aarons career record bonds is presumably not one of mr schmucks good guys but sportslines gregg doyel has identified several likeable traits about bonds in his recent travels with the record chasing san francisco giants slugger "i like that bonds spent minutes with a u s soldier recently and i like it even more that until you read this sentence you had no idea " mr doyel writes "before being deployed to iraq the soldier wanted to see bonds play in person bonds heard the guy was in town and soon he was meeting with the solider and his wife in the dugout before a game the media never knew about it " sportswriter and bonds biographer jeff pearlman who spent more time researching his subject than the chasing pack isnt as ambivalent "barry bonds is evil " mr pearlman told deadspins will leitch in a no holds barred interview warning bad language because fans in san diego and los angeles are closer to the pearlman end of the bonds spectrum than the doyel end bonds may do whatever it takes not to break the record during the giants upcoming six game tour of those rival cities including swinging at a pitch he did so yesterday for the first time in such situations tom verducci writes on si com because he really wanted to tie the record at home "for bonds this city is the land of make

outside of this safe house and it threatens to be rather ugly " yahoo sports jeff passan another bonds tracker recounts minutes he and fellow reporters got to spend with their subject yesterday "covering bonds is a trip back to middle school and the alpha male where hes the object of everyones attention and the rest of the room stands rapt to every movement " mr passan writes so that the fix can hit for the scandals cycle here are looks at the woes facing two leagues in the midst of awful offseasons reflecting on the nbas gambling ref problem bill dwyre writes that his paper the los angeles times and others should follow the model of the new york times sports section and cut out gambling data "the headlines have been huge the journalistic hand wringing and outrage notable " mr dwyre writes about the nba "and in a news sense that is the correct reaction but there is also an old saying about people who live in glass houses and throw stones would not the pulpit been that much more comfortable had this paper and most others refrained from offering betting information as a daily fare would not the horror expressed over this breach of morals and ethics have been more credible
