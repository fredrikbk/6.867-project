the real wiretapping scandal last tuesdays senate judiciary committee hearing at which attorney general alberto gonzales was insulted by senators and ridiculed by spectators was washington political theater at its lowest but some significant information did manage to get through the senatorial venom directed at mr gonzales it now appears certain that the terrorist surveillance program tsp authorized by president bush after was even broader than the tsp that the new york times first revealed in december it is also clear that mr gonzales along with former white house chief of staff andrew card tried to preserve that original program with the knowledge and approval of both republican and democratic members of key congressional committees unfortunately they failed and the program was narrowed today the continuing viability of even the slimmed down tsp an indispensable weapon in the war on terror remains in serious doubt the administrations most immediate concern since has understandably been whether al qaeda sleeper agents already inside the u s would carry out additional catastrophic strikes to counter this real and continuing threat president bush authorized the national security agency nsa to intercept a full range of al qaeda communications presumably on a global basis the tsp was not implemented pursuant to the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa which permits a special federal court to issue surveillance orders when americans and others are targeted for intelligence gathering inside the u s rather than utilizing fisas cumbersome and restrictive procedures the administration relied on the presidents inherent constitutional authority as commander in chief to monitor enemy communications in wartime as presidents have done since lincolns day in addition the administration correctly relied on congresss sept authorization for the use of military force against al qaeda in the supreme court ruled that this statute authorized the president to employ all the "fundamental incidents of waging war " this by any reasonable standard would include secretly listening in on the enemys phone calls and reading their faxes emails and text messages at least that is what one would have thought in december however a firestorm of controversy erupted when the new york times published a story describing the tsp although it was clear from the beginning that the program targeted al qaeda a particular communication was intercepted based on the presence of a suspected al qaeda operative on at least one end and not directed at ordinary americans going about their daily routines the administrations critics quickly wove the tsp into their favorite overarching anti bush narrative they cited it as just one more example of a supposedly power hungry president the new "king george " chewing up our civil liberties administration officials including attorney general gonzales repeatedly explained the tsp to congress and the public presumably to an extent consistent with continuing national security imperatives in particular they said that only communications where at least one party to the conversation was outside of the u s were intercepted purely domestic calls were not in play but after months of congressional pressure and having failed to secure new legislation that would have fundamentally revised fisa the administration announced in january this year that it had reached an agreement with the special fisa court to bring the tsp under judicial auspices the administration also claimed that the program remained as encompassing as before so that no national security interest had been compromised by the new arrangement the tsps defenders were skeptical given how fisa orders are normally sought and granted it is difficult to believe that they could be used to surveil all conversations of legitimate security interest such as those involving people who are not full fledged al qaeda members but who are its witting or unwitting supporters intercepting the full spectrum of al qaeda communications is indispensable to obtaining a full picture of its activities and protecting the american people from attack and while the fisa concession put new restrictions on a program that had successfully protected america from attack since it did not dampen the tsp controversy in may former deputy attorney general james comey described before a far more congenial senate judiciary committee a dramatic late night confrontation in march it involved mr comey fbi director robert mueller mr gonzales and mr card all gathered in the hospital room of then attorney general john ashcroft mr ashcroft who must have signed off on or at least have known about the tsp years before had transferred his authority to mr comey for the duration of his gallbladder surgery mr comey refused to re approve the program which was expiring the next day because of legal concerns and the white house wanted mr ashcroft to overrule him mr ashcroft however now sided with mr comey reportedly he and others even threatened to resign if mr comey did not get his way the matter quickly reached the president who authorized mr comey to revise the tsp the result it should be emphasized was the restructured tsp which was subsequently revealed and vociferously attacked by the administrations critics in december those critics in and out of congress immediately seized upon mr comeys may testimony as proof that mr gonzales had lied to congress when he stated earlier that there was no disagreement at justice regarding the tsps legality last tuesday however the circumstances of this midnight drama and the nature of the issues at stake got a lot clearer mr gonzales who obviously is still trying to explain things without revealing tsp details that remain classified noted that the emergency visit to mr ashcroft came after a meeting with white house personnel and the so called "gang of eight" the heads of various congressional intelligence committees who agreed that the tsp had to continue predictably a number of "gang of eight" democrats dispute this consensus but they were clearly aware of the program and presumably white house logs can verify their meeting attendance what now seems equally indisputable is that mr gonzales did not lie to congress top justice department officials had all approved the tsp to which he was referring the disagreement described by mr comey involved the original tsp in place from this also explains mr gonzaless statement tuesday which prompted calls for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate him for perjury that the white house meeting with congressional leaders was devoted to discussion of "other intelligence activities " in the language of congressional intelligence oversight even minimal differences between one program and another can constitute "other" distinct intelligence activities in this context mr gonzales was clearly referring to the original tsp the details of which remain classified and not the tsp although it is impossible to know for sure it is a good bet that the original tsp to which mr comey objected was broader than the program and that it permitted interception of al qaeda communications entirely within the united states and may also be connected in some manner to datamining efforts as suggested in sundays new york times such interceptions unlike the monitoring of international wire traffic could not be plausibly claimed to fall outside of fisas language although they could certainly be justified based on the presidents wartime authority to spy on the enemy evidently mr comey didnt think so or at least was unprepared to issue a compliance certification on the point reasonable minds can disagree here but there was nothing inappropriate about white house officials trying to have mr comey overruled by his boss john ashcroft certainly could have reassumed his authority as attorney general even in his hospital bed what has gotten lost in all of this increasingly sordid game of political gotcha is the viability of a critical program in the war on terror the tsp was brought under the fisa courts jurisdiction this january allegedly without impairing its effectiveness but fisa orders are not permanent they must be periodically reissued and fisa judges rotate as an editorial on the facing page of the journal first reported friday well placed sources say that todays fisa compliant tsp is only about "one third" as effective as the version which in turn was less comprehensive than the original program this is shocking during a summer of heightened threat warnings and should be unacceptable to congress and the american people the problem is particularly acute because fisas framework has been rendered dysfunctional by the evolution of technology fisa was enacted in a world where intercepts of purely foreign communications were conducted overseas and were entirely exempt from the statutory strictures only true u s domestic communications were intercepted on u s soil and these intercepts were subjected to fisas prescriptive procedures yet with todays fiber optic networks functioning as the sinews of the global communications system entirely foreign calls say between al qaeda operatives overseas often flow through u s facilities and can be most reliably intercepted on american soil subjecting these intercepts to fisa strictures is absurd moreover the very fact that the intelligence community operates in a state of continued uncertainty about what precise surveillance parameters would be allowed in the future instead of having the collection efforts driven entirely by the unfolding operational imperatives is both unprecedented in wartime and highly detrimental in past wars as fighting continued valuable battlefield experience was gathered causing weapons systems military organization and combat techniques to improve consistently in this difficult war with al qaeda by contrast the key battlefield intelligence gathering program has been repeatedly emasculated congress obsession with the tsps legal pedigree has become the major threat to its continued viability rivaling in its deleterious impact the infamous "wall " much criticized by the commission which prevented information sharing between the justice departments intelligence and law enforcement divisions it is hypocritical for those in congress who preach fidelity to the commission recommendations to behave so dramatically at odds with their spirit the question judiciary committee members should have been asking mr gonzales was not whether he had misled them he clearly did not but whether the tsp is still functioning well the question the public should be asking those senators and with not much more civility than the senators showed mr gonzales is what are they going to do about it if the answer is no messrs rivkin and casey served in the justice department under presidents reagan and george
