bancrofts jockeying over murdoch deal goes down to the wire the bancroft family and its advisers headed into the final hours of deliberations over the fate of dow jones &amp co yesterday amid heated jockeying and negotiating that threatened to create a rift between the companys board and some family advisers according to people familiar with the matter still the companys fate remained too close to call these people said michael b elefante the familys lead trustee indicated to some on the board last night that he has slightly less than of the overall vote news corp likely needs family votes representing roughly of the overall vote to succeed mr elefante has given family members a deadline of today at p m to present him with voting agreements to sell shares to news corp which has offered &# a share or &# billion for the company the family which controls of dow joness shareholder power through a complicated web of trusts has been deeply divided over the decision some family members have committed to vote in favor of a sale but others oppose the deal for fear that news corp chairman rupert murdochs style of journalism would damage the integrity of dow joness publications including the wall street journal after the signed voting agreements are received mr elefante must inform dow joness board of the results of his polling as of late last night nearly of the votes favored the deal according to a person close to dow joness board common shareholders representing of the overall voting shares are expected to vote for the deal in overwhelming numbers thereby ensuring a majority news corp needs to assure a comfortable margin it is unclear whether news corp would proceed with less than that in one sign of the emotional upheaval of recent days jane cox macelree one of the most prominent members of the family resigned from some of the trusts she oversees according to people familiar with the matter ms macelree is against the sale but her children have come out strongly on both sides of the debate her daughter leslie hill a dow jones director has been working to drum up alternatives to mr murdochs bid her son crawford hill however wrote an impassioned defense of the sale to his family members in an email last week before her resignation ms macelree helped oversee trusts controlling roughly of the companys overall votes she has quit trusts holding of the vote on which she had veto power and thereby continues to serve on trusts holding her resignation cleared the way for the cook branch of the family which controls of the companys votes and is represented on dow joness board of directors by elizabeth steele to vote in favor of a sale to news corp ms macelree has told family members she is concerned that if she votes against the deal for those shares she might be liable to the beneficiaries who want a deal according to people close to her branch of the family in addition to tallying the voting agreements that continued to come in from family members over the weekend mr elefante a partner at hemenway &amp barnes the boston law firm that manages most of the familys trusts was also facing resistance from other hemenway &amp barnes lawyers who were demanding news corp pay more for the familys supervoting class b shares the people familiar with the matter said michael puzo and timothy fidgeon two partners at hemenway &amp barnes who sit as trustees on some of the familys largest trusts indicated that they wanted news corp to pay more for the dow jones supervoting b shares more than of which are owned by the bancroft family this "price differential" strategy also invoked by trustees of some bancroft shares held in denver is opposed by dow joness board and could generate litigation from shareholders who dont receive the preferential treatment but it is possible that such a demand is a tactic designed to flush out a few extra dollars from news corp for all company shareholders in a call last night with a committee of dow jones directors who have been negotiating the deal some of the directors and advisers said the actions of messrs puzo and fidgeon were disappointing according to people on the call they added that a premium for supervoting shares would not be supported by the board or by news corp these people said a person close to mr murdoch said he is comfortable with walking away at this point if the family doesnt accept his offer at &# a share christopher bancroft a dow jones director who had been trying to raise money to buy out other family members and block a deal is obstructing efforts by hemenway &amp barnes to change the voting structure of the biggest bancroft trust known as article which controls of the companys voting power say people close to the situation mr bancroft has spoken out against a deal with news corp splitting the trust would have diluted his influence two of the four main beneficiaries of that trust elisabeth goth chelberg and mr bancrofts older brother hugh are in favor of a sale according to people familiar with their thinking hemenway &amp barnes had been trying to split the trust to reflect the views of all the beneficiaries a move that would have diluted mr bancrofts power by opposing the deal and voting against the wishes of the beneficiaries mr bancroft might expose himself to litigation another group of trusts managed by denver law firm holme roberts &amp owen have decided to vote against the deal and were continuing to hold out for an additional to over the &# a share news corp has offered the denver trusts have argued that the supervoting b shares which each have votes are worth more than common shares in addition to the wall street journal and its international and online editions dow jones publishes
