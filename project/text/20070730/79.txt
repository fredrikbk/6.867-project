stock declines spur new look at risk picture with returns thinning emerging markets no longer as attractive like travelers taking separate paths to the same destination stock values in different parts of the world are converging toward a single level that can make for a bumpy ride declines in u s markets last week were felt across the globe forcing investors to reconsider how much risk they are prepared to shoulder and at what price in recent years investors have done well by investing in regions and sectors that were comparatively cheap like emerging market stocks and small capitalization companies and watching prices rise with values approaching the same level this source of returns is disappearing "its going to make it harder for there to be as big a difference in returns from one region to another " says steven bleiberg head of global asset allocation at legg mason inc as recently as april shares in emerging markets were at a significant discount to their counterparts in developed markets by the end of last month that discount had all but vanished three morgan stanley capital international indexes representing emerging markets developed markets outside the u s and canada and the u s itself were all trading at between and times their components earnings for the previous months the broad based rally in global stocks of the past few years "largely leveled the playing field " ronald frashure co chief investment officer of acadian asset management which manages &# billion wrote in a report "table thumping opportunities elude our vision " last weeks unrest in the markets hasnt really changed the picture he said in an interview "the differentials have remained pretty much the same because everything has been highly correlated " he said the dow jones industrial average which had closed at its latest record highs earlier in the month tumbled for the week to its worst week in more than four years the standard &amp poors stock index fell for the week and the nasdaq composite index dropped shares were hit hard in europe and asia in response especially in south korea and taiwan on friday south koreas benchmark index the kospi dropped this morning japanese and south korean stocks were trading down "the world still begins with the u s " says uri landesman a senior portfolio manager at ing investment management "i dont think its over the stuff sparking this fear is real " the latest market turmoil exposes one of the more notable features of the bull market investors have plowed into small cap stocks traditionally considered more risky sending their values up toward those of blue chips investors also have snapped up emerging market shares at such a pace that their valuations are nearly in line with stocks in developed markets for some market watchers such close valuations raise a red flag signaling that emerging markets as a whole are too pricey stocks in emerging markets have traded at a discount because they involve more risks than their developed counterparts share prices are more volatile political risks are greater and interest rates are generally higher making it more expensive for companies to borrow money as long as those risks remain some say it doesnt make sense for values of shares in developing countries to match or outstrip those in developed markets "should emerging markets move to a premium it may be time to sell " says geoffrey dennis an emerging markets strategist at citigroup adding that he expects such shares "to underperform for a period of time because they just got too rich " others contend that the vigorous economies and strong earnings in many emerging markets could send these countries stocks to still higher valuation levels emerging markets are "a very different animal than they used to be " says leila heckman of heckman global advisors a unit of bear stearns asset management with stock values at such compressed levels around the world it is important for investors to know which markets still enjoy a slight edge in terms of cheapness one candidate europe where shares are comparatively inexpensive at the end of june the components of mscis european index were trading at times earnings over the previous months valuations can "still help in differentiating individual markets " says ms heckman within the emerging markets universe for example the price earnings ratios for stocks in particular countries can range from as low as to as high as so it pays to choose carefully rather than investing in the asset class as a whole u s stocks may also hold renewed appeal "we were always way underweight the u s in our global funds but not any more " says david herro a portfolio manager at the oakmark funds who manages &# billion in global and international funds "were just as enthused about what were finding in the u s as we are overseas " if investors in emerging markets remain bullish current market values suggest that investors in developed markets may be "too bearish " says shigeki makino a portfolio manager at putnam investments who manages &# billion in global stocks global growth is strong and stock values remain reasonable by historical standards mr makino says during the tech stock bubble u s shares traded at more than times the previous years earnings mr makino is keen on shares in the u s europe and japan with lower valuations but whose businesses hinge on demand from emerging markets they include german steel firm salzgitter and japans mitsui o s k lines a shipping company mr frashure of acadian says his firm has estimated returns for the next five years for a variety of regional stocks in local currency terms in that time period it predicts that u s large cap stocks and emerging market shares will return and a year on average respectively "we certainly dont see the same relative opportunity" as several years ago he says
