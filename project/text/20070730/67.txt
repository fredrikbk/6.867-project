rising japanese investment abroad weakens yen deepens economic imbalances tokyo japans financial services companies are trying to coax the countrys prodigious savers to think globally urging them to invest their nest eggs abroad where they can expect to reap much higher returns after years of extraordinary low interest rates at home and with a large percentage of japans population looking toward retirement that advice is starting to take hold but while investing abroad makes sense for the japanese individually the resulting outflow of cash had been pummeling the already weak yen which only began strengthening earlier this month and worsening imbalances in the nations economy as yet only of japans &# trillion in personal savings is invested abroad while more than half is held in cash and domestic bank deposits by contrast u s households keep less than of their savings in cash and deposits with the bank of japan holding its key rate at interest paid on japanese deposits is low so those assets earn almost nothing that is largely why the countrys households have become important players in the so called yen carry trade that involves either buying mutual funds that invest abroad or borrowing yen at japans low interest rates and selling them to acquire investments denominated in higher yielding currencies such as australian and new zealand dollars as a result investment trusts the japanese equivalent of mutual funds are recording record inflows investment trust foreign assets rose by trillion yen &# billion in april to trillion the largest one month increase since the statistics were first compiled back in "this is the self defense for japanese households " says masaaki kanno chief japan economist for j p morgan securities in tokyo "they are moving their money offshore as a vote against the japanese system of low returns " mr kanno worries this growing exodus of funds will aggravate japans economic imbalances perpetuating its overdependence on exports in part by weakening purchasing at home "a side effect of low interest rates and the outflow of investment funds is to send wrong signals to the market about the value of the yen " he says "return on investment is so low we are falling into a deeper trap " here is how that "trap" has evolved in recent years as japan has shaken off an economic slump that lasted more than a decade the bank of japan has kept interest rates low to encourage economic growth but low rates crimp the returns that japans savers and others can earn on bank accounts and other japanese assets that in turn keeps the value of the yen weak relative to other major currencies which encourages exports low returns on savings and declines in wages which account for of household income have caused japans aging population worry about having enough money for retirement keeping domestic demand weak consumer spending accounts for just of japans gross domestic product according to data from morgan stanley not only is that well below the in the u s it is the same as india a much less developed economy this tepid domestic demand leaves exports as the japanese economys main growth engine as japanese savers venture abroad to invest the outflow of cash is putting even more pressure on the yen though in recent days the dollars weakness has arrested the japanese currencys plunging value but the yen continues to weaken against other asian currencies like the korean won that puts an even stronger tailwind behind japanese exporters making them an even bigger contributor to the countrys economic growth but also setting the stage for potential trade frictions and other problems the yens weakness has encouraged some japanese manufacturers to expand output capacity eventually when the yen recovers much of that new capacity may be idled mr kanno fears the bank of japan is wary about raising rates with little sign of inflation also the central bank is haunted by the memory of erring several years ago when it raised rates prematurely chilling the economy breaking out of the weak yen trap will require japans government and its consumers to change their habits tokyo could help assuage nervousness about retirement by shoring up the countrys pension system which has fewer working age people to support it one way might be for the government to seek higher yielding investments for japans foreign reserve and pension fund assets rather than relying mostly on safe but low yielding u s treasurys and japanese government bonds those assets now earn as little as one fifth of the returns of large u s public pension funds such as the california public employees retirement system according to one senior official at japans financial services agency if the japanese economy which expanded a modest last year is to grow enough to support higher wages and investment returns japanese consumers will have to do their part by relaxing the grip on their pocketbooks creating a more balanced economy will require a healthy increase in domestic demand a feat export powerhouse china is also trying to pull off of course the chinese many of whom lack the rice cookers and other consumer gadgets taken for granted in japan have more room to expand their consumption for china the question is whether the country can grow rich before its population grows old for japan which is already rich the challenge is to persuade its citizens that in getting older they arent doomed to get poorer
