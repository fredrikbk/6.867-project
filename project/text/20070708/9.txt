profit strategy set the bar low leap over set expectations low then exceed them and make people happy that classic strategy has been practiced time and again in the world of corporate earnings announcements and investors are hoping that the second quarter earnings season which picks up steam this week will bring such positive surprises theres a particular reason for stock investors to be edgy this year earnings growth at large u s businesses has clearly slowed companies in the standard &amp poors stock index reported consecutive quarters of double digit year over year earnings growth from the third quarter of through the final quarter of last year the streak ended in this years first quarter when s&amp p earnings climbed according to data from thomson financial wall street analysts tracked by thomson currently expect second quarter profits to be up from last years second quarter alcoa aa typically one of the first large companies to report releases its numbers tomorrow still some investment firms are looking for stronger albeit still single digit profit growth and stocks could get a boost if the optimists are correct "we think people are gunning to the low side on where earnings should come in " says ryan detrick chief technical strategist at schaeffers investment research "we dont necessarily need double digit growth" to send shares higher but "we think analysts have overdone it to the down side" on the estimates last week in a holiday interrupted week of light trading the dow jones industrial average rose and the nasdaq composite index gained so far in the dow industrials are up and the nasdaq is up brian rauscher director of portfolio strategy at brown brothers harriman is another earnings optimist "people have continued to underestimate the strength in the global economy the weak u s dollar and the share buybacks from the larger cap companies " he says an estimate of around earnings growth is "more than reasonable mr rauscher says "but i think well get in the neighborhood of to " growth wall street analysts consider many sources in developing earnings estimates for the companies they cover but guidance from the companies themselves weighs heavily mr rauscher says "there is very little motivation for management to give positive forward guidance" that is to nudge earnings expectations upward "unless theyre sure its going to happen " companies instead often aim for "safe" guidance which reduces the risk of negative publicity or a big drop in the stock price if actual earnings prove disappointing over the past few years of strong earnings growth the results posted by the s&amp p companies have consistently exceeded analysts estimates as of the start of each quarterly period that was the case in of the double digit quarters according to thomson coming into in contrast analysts expected stronger profit gains than the big companies actually reported vs the actual but those estimates were cut over the course of the first quarter with many analysts looking for low single digit gains and a few even expecting profit declines in the end the first quarter results helped fuel a weeks long bull market because the expectations had been cut so low that companies easily exceeded them this time around the current consensus estimate of growth is up a bit from the estimate of as the quarter began in april positive second quarter earnings surprises could certainly be beneficial to the stock market during the first quarter reporting period shares were coming off a big downturn and investors were ready to push prices up smartly on some positive news these days in contrast stocks have been trading in a range not moving too much in either direction for a few weeks the dow industrials and the s&amp p are both near record levels while the nasdaq is at a multiyear high so if the earnings news is favorable there is still likely to be some upside but it might not be as notable as in the last period besides even though things seem to be fine right now there are definite risks lurking in the economy housing is in the midst of a turndown that most people think will last for some time and defaults have risen in the subprime mortgage industry which serves buyers with sketchy credit histories since the state of housing usually has a strong impact on the outlook of consumers who have kept the u s economy propped up for years the housing problems could begin to seep into corporate sales and earnings wall street is keeping its eyes on certain sectors for notable earnings performances both good and bad for example the energy sector including oil companies plus related machinery and services firms is expected to perform extremely well on the back of high oil prices "we are in the middle of a long term growth cycle for this sector simply because oil is so high and expectations are that it will stay above &# a barrel for the next few years " said charles rotblut senior market analyst at zacks investment research oil closed friday at almost &# a barrel and last summer it went above &# investors will be paying a lot of attention to technology sector earnings as well the tech heavy nasdaq index is outperforming other indexes year to date and in the past couple of weeks tech stocks have been on a particular tear that includes names such as apple aapl which just introduced its attention getting iphone and intel intc which has seen its stock climb so far this year however earnings reports from tech companies "might be more mixed there might be areas that dont do as well " mr rauscher says mr rotblut of zacks agrees "i think were going to see a lot of companies with earnings that arent very good at all " he thinks companies such as chip makers advanced micro devices amd and broadcom brcm may have a tough time due to "a combination of inventory levels and a decline in average selling prices " analysts tracked by thomson expect amd to post a loss and broadcom to report a drop in per share earnings email forum sunday wsj com
