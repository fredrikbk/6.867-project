marketwatch for financial advice cfp or cfa scott kays has spent what he estimates to be about hours scaling the investment professions equivalent of mt everest and hes no more than two thirds of the way there the atlanta based investment adviser recently took the second of three rigorous tests to attain the coveted chartered financial analyst or cfa designation the distinction is a career pinnacle for anyone absorbed in nitty gritty investment research and analysis and the route to the top is demanding on his examination day in early june mr kays and about other hopefuls filled a large room in atlantas world congress center for three hours in the morning and another three in the afternoon the test takers would be grilled about the inner workings and valuation of stocks bonds hedge funds derivatives and other exotic investments in countries around the world that day almost people faced the same hurdle mr kays will find out in august how he did if he passes hell advance to the third final test but why would mr kays who attained the certified financial planner or cfp mark more than two decades ago knock himself out in this grueling quest for the grail with apologies to sir edmund hillary because its there "for someone who really wants to expand their knowledge especially of the investment area the cfa curriculum is just great " mr kays says "its helped me do a much better job of actually analyzing the investments themselves i have a much better understanding of what drives valuation different markets and investment returns " the cfa exam takes a hard analytical look at stocks bonds hedging strategies and company financial statements people who achieve the designation typically manage institutional money and mutual funds or become involved with corporate finance so if you have an adviser who is among the few who have earned the cfa designation or if his or her firm has a cfa on the payroll consider it a plus in contrast certified financial planners maintain a broad based approach to retirement education taxes insurance estates and other life issues investing is a major part but just one part of the big picture "you cant just be crackerjack on investments and get through the cfp certification exam " says karen schaeffer a rockville md based financial planner and chairman of the cfp board of standards which regulates cfp practitioners "it would be hard to do financial planning without understanding investments but theres a great deal of financial planning that goes on" beyond investment strategies yet with many financial advisers now steering clients beyond mutual funds and exchange traded funds into individual stocks and bonds there can be a need for the expertise the cfa mark endorses "if i were looking for someone who was going to manage a portfolio of individual common stocks and do the selection and analysis id look for the cfa designation " says john markese president of the american association of individual investors "the cfa has the ability to look at the financial statements and arrive at an informed opinion " he adds of course you have to understand stocks bonds and other investments to attain the cfp certification but its a more generalized knowledge thats relevant to straightforward personal finance if your adviser starts highlighting more specialized portfolio strategies mr markese recommends asking what in his experience and education makes him qualified for the task "if someone has the cfa on board " he says "thats all the more evidence that they have the confidence to do it " deciding to put clients into individual securities prompted mr kays to pursue the cfa charter his level exam in june for example covered derivatives currencies and other sophisticated investing topics plus hes logged many hours poring over balance sheets and income statements to get to the root of a companys accounting and valuation "the cfa takes one area and goes into tremendous detail " mr kays says of the process "you dig a two foot hole feet deep the focus is on investments hard core investments not estate planning or life planning " that finer appreciation of investment techniques also led david strege to seek the cfa mark years ago the west des moines iowa based adviser is a rare investment professional with both the cfp and cfa distinctions "the cfp certification is more about comprehensive financial planning helping individuals with all facets of their financial life " he says "the cfa really focuses more in depth with the creation of investment portfolios and manager or individual securities selection it helped train me to ask appropriate questions " still only about of the cfp holders in the u s also claim the cfa charter just one in five cfa aspirants completes all three levels there are currently a total of cfa designees world wide "the cfa program is the ultimate meritocracy " says bob johnson managing director of the education division at the cfa institute the cfa programs governing body "anyone can enter you have to prove your way out " "its the big a analysis " mr johnson says "it has always been extremely challenging but the investment management profession has gotten nothing but more complex over time " he adds
