small business handling the risks of a seasonal business from ice cream stands and landscapers to ski shops and hotels many small businesses are seasonal meaning they rake in cash just a few months of the year but with this seasonality comes great risk what if the weather during the peak season turns adverse or a sharp surge in gasoline prices keeps customers at home theres no opportunity to make up that business later in the year there are ways seasonal businesses can avert some of the risks of relying onone or two seasons for profitability here are some ways to make it work manage cash carefully perhaps most daunting to seasonal business owners is cash management and control of spending since the bulk of revenue sometimes all of it flows in during just a few months of the year fighting the temptation to spend it when its there and saving enough for rainy days and off peak periods is an important aspect of keeping a seasonal business afloat "its not like a year round business where you have this constant flow of cash so you always have money to spend " says matt roberge the year old manager of shallow shaft restaurant an upscale eatery in the ski resort town of alta utah about miles from salt lake city the restaurant does to of its food sales during ski season yet opens for part of the summer to serve hikers mr roberge says that its important for seasonal businesses to evaluate their cash situation constantly and to always stash away a sizable sum for the off season he looks for ways to pinch pennies in the unpredictable summer months such as cutting inventory of foods that dont sell well and using a skeleton staff work year round one issue for many seasonal businesses is that they lose visibility in the off season so part of the challenge is keeping customers connected and using downtime as a time to regroup re evaluate the business plan and expand customer relations bobbi and jeff griggs own the beach butlers a concierge service for beach travelers in rosemary beach fla the couple use the slow winter months to introduce themselves to upscale property owners who might want to suggest the business or even offer the concierge service as a courtesy to guest renters they also send holiday cards to the previous summers customers in hopes theyll remember to call on their next vacation "its what brings me business before the onset of the busy season and after the busy season " ms griggs says other businesses choose to stay open year round by switching their focus to a different niche many ski shops for instance sell bicycling gear or kayaks in the summer not only does this supplement revenue but it also hedges the risk since mild winters may inspire people to ride bikes other seasonal entrepreneurs start a new business altogether in the off months nancy swenson and craig white owners of beach farm inn a wells maine bed and breakfast earn of the &# to &# of the inns annual revenue between the fourth of july and labor day a rainy summer ms swenson says can take a sizable bite out of revenue while the couple offer various off season promotions like cooking class weekends to rev up the inns guest numbers

his handmade furniture or nearly half of the total revenue generated annually by the inn he uses the inn to help market the furniture since the rooms are furnished with many of his crafts "there are years where the weather is terrible or things happen in the world that you just cant control " mr white says "having that extra income acts as a buffer " market creatively some seasonal businesses are able to extend their season by finding creative ways to get customers interested in their offerings year round wayne bronner owner of bronners christmas wonderland a frankenmuth mich christmas decor store with year round employees finds he can keep visitors buying christmas goods all year by tying promotions and marketing to timely holidays and seasons throughout the year in the days leading up

collection a gift set of ornaments for newly married couples that sells for &# he also offers sales and discounts in the off season to spur more sales for valentines day he has a " " sale off any item that costs more than &# the store uses quirky advertising like billboards to attract summer travelers who might be looking for a fun stopover the store "markets the novelty of shopping for christmas decorations in july " mr bronner says mr roberge in alta utah says his restaurant has boosted its summer traffic by revamping the menu with lower priced fare like burgers salads and sandwiches that appeal to hikers rather than the steak and seafood crowd it attracts in the winter months another advantage to staying open most of the year is you dont lose as many employees who would otherwise leave at the end of high season buy protection another way to protect a seasonal business from bad weather surprises is buying insurance or insurance like contracts weatherbill com and horizon weather
