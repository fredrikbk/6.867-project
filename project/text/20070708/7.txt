mutual funds quarterly special report global stock funds any room left the strong performance of foreign stocks has prompted many investors to dive into international stock mutual funds but advisers and analysts caution that latecomers should probably inch into the pool instead industry watchers expect global stock markets to be more volatile over the next months which means investors who place big bets now may be in for a bumpy ride international funds are still a good buy advisers say but the best strategy may be to build up exposure to foreign stocks using "dollar cost averaging " which calls for investing smaller sums at regular intervals tempering enthusiasm for a hot category is rarely easy and international stock funds have been hot indeed so far in in a repeat of last year investors have spurned u s stock funds for their world equity counterparts which invest primarily overseas in may investors dumped &# billion into foreign stock funds while pulling &# billion out of u

stock funds is driven by a five year history of outsized gains wariness about the u s market and optimism about earnings prospects overseas and while analysts caution investors to moderate

wealth management a unit of pnc financial services in pittsburgh mr stone says pnc generally keeps of a typical clients stock portfolio in international equities but that the company has bumped that allocation to in recent years second only to stocks of large u s companies foreign stocks still look reasonably priced he says with the dow jones euro stoxx an index of blue chip european firms trading at times estimated earnings compared with times for the standard &amp poors stock index he feels foreign stocks and the funds that invest in them have further room to climb "but i wouldnt expect doubling performance " he says andrew lo director of the mit laboratory for financial engineering at the sloan school of management in cambridge mass points to two factors with the potential to slow world wide stock gains rising interest rates and the chance that a weak dollar could rebound some central banks have raised rates in recent months including the bank of england last week and others have suggested they may do so those moves could help long term economic growth by keeping inflation in check but higher rates can hurt stock returns in the short term by increasing borrowing costs for consumers and businesses likewise when the dollar goes up relative to foreign currencies u s investors see their foreign stock returns trimmed thats because investments denominated in other currencies lose value when translated back to dollars a stock thats stuck at euros is worth &# when a euro costs &# but its worth only &# if a euro sells for &# fund managers increasingly believe the dollar is going to strengthen according to a june survey of global fund managers by merrill lynch the bulk of respondents said the dollar is undervalued while the euro and the british pound look rich

for despite the potential for a slowdown in returns from foreign stocks financial advisers cite several reasons to include them in a portfolio international stocks are a good diversifier meaning they can buoy a portfolio when the u s market slumps but more importantly experts say the overall prospects for overseas companies have improved with globalization and political climates in key countries

to the auto industry where domestic auto makers have lost market share to foreign firms like toyota motor and bmw group as a prime example of why investors need foreign exposure some best in class companies he says are found abroad the opportunities for growth overseas can also exceed domestic prospects consider the cellphone market he says in countries like china and mexico where cellphones are less common than in the u s providers are signing up customers at a pace thats unparalleled here "you have much faster growth using the same technology " mr fries says that growth spurs the
