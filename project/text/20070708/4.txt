love &amp money home sweet unprotected home my wife amy had one thing to say to me recently when i called home while picking up our daughter "well " she said "i nearly burned your house down " apparently amy had just put some oil in a skillet on the stove when she went to check on a noise in the garage when she returned the oil was popping and smoking she quickly moved it but some of the oil spilled and caught fire on the burner she quickly doused the flames but as i listened to her the one thought that i had was that we really do need to buy that fire extinguisher that i assured our insurance agent wed get in i know that im not alone in putting off until tomorrow the things i should have done last year but i also know that this lackadaisical attitude is especially stupid when it comes to the biggest investment most of us will ever make our house amys minor mishap lit a fire under me to not only go buy that fire extinguisher but to check up on other items ive been putting off for too long after all when your home is your castle do you really want your castle to lay in ruin because of your laziness heres why its so easy to put off all the things you need to do to protect your house your house doesnt do anything it just sits there cars ding and flash lights at you for every little upset door ajar gas low oil needs changing our minivan wont let us open the side door if the gas cap is open my house not once did it ever warn me about the leaky roof it didnt give me notice that the air conditioner was on the fritz until i turned it on and felt the unwelcoming breeze of tepid air on a steamy day everything that needs to be maintained or protected is basically up to you to remember to do and with so many other pressing things to do on a daily basis the nonmandatory chores like taking time to stop by the home improvement store to buy a fire extinguisher keep getting pushed to the bottom of the to do list pretty soon those chores are so far down the list that when youre at the store for some other reason you dont even remember you need a fire extinguisher but our houses relative silence cant be the only explanation after all ill go out of my way to get my oil changed and my car washed even if the car isnt telling me i should how then do i justify the effort needed to protect a &# jeep and not the actions necessary to protect a house that cost more than times that amount it makes no sense some of it is pure laziness and some of it may be that unlike the car the task of maintaining a house is just too big we cant get our arms around it so we dont even try thats the explanation a new jersey friend gives for not finishing a paint job after a house painter he hired abandoned the work five years ago "part of the house on the side is barely primed " he says "not only is it ugly its no doubt hurting the shingles and i still dont do anything about it its crazy " his reason "the house has many things that need attending to i need to get somebody to look at the foundation on an addition we did and make sure it isnt cracking trees need pruning the basement needs to be sealed better its all daunting so unless something really bad is staring you in the face you just put it off " worse he knows this is just the sort of issue that can come back to haunt you eight years ago while renovating his house contractors found termite damage that required additional repair work that added about &# to his costs today though he still doesnt have a pest control service come out and check for termites on a regular basis "i know its crazy " he says "but the to do list to protect this house is bigger than i have time for now and its bigger than my brain can handle so i stick my head in the sand " my philadelphia friend tara is in the same situation she has smoke detectors that need to be installed and others that need new batteries a piece of her front door has fallen off and she hasnt repaired it yet theres a leak in the bathroom that needs to be fixed it has been "ages " she says "since ive cleaned my gutters and i need to get an exterminator and a tree cutter to deal with carpenter ants " but after waiting so long she now has a plan of attack "im taking off two weeks in july just to take care of my house and the many things ive let go its not my perfect choice for a vacation but i really have no other choice i fear the collective strain of those little problems is going to add up to a bigger problem if i dont deal with it and i just dont have the time during my regular work week " for a while now amy and i have needed to deal with several issues in our house that ive put off frequently to amys consternation theres the fire extinguisher for one in addition a storm several months back ripped a small line of shingles off part of the roof i havent done anything about that either and then theres our homeowners insurance given that i write about insurance frequently in my job i am well aware that homeowners after years of living in a house often end up with woefully inadequate insurance coverage im a living example of that hurricane katrina not only reshaped my state in it revalued the local real estate as many hurt by the storm relocated to baton rouge housing prices here surged as did the cost of construction the result is that our house is now worth about more than when we bought it thus if amy had been successful in burning down the house our insurance coverage likely wouldnt have paid us nearly enough to rebuild the house we have for that reason im calling some contractors this week to figure out what rebuilding our house exactly as it is would cost in todays market then ill be talking to our insurance agent about changing our coverage and in case youre wondering we now have that fire extinguisher in the kitchen and one in the laundry room just in case
