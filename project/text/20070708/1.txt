how couples can maximize social security new research suggests there could be an optimal strategy for couples trying to decide when to collect social security in short a wife should jump early and her husband should wait if our mailbox is any indication many couples arent sure when to file for social security some guidance came in the june issue of the journal of financial planning alicia munnell director of the center for retirement research at boston college and mauricio soto a researcher at the center set out to determine the best age for women to claim social security in doing so the pair also calculated how a wife and husband could accumulate as many social security dollars as possible during their years together and during the life of the surviving spouse given various differences in ages and pre retirement income their conclusion wives generally should claim benefits at the earliest eligibility age and husbands generally should delay filing until you can read the study at fpanet org journal click on "past issues and articles" for june in theory most healthy women should wait until their mid to late s to collect benefits and men should start earlier thats because women are more likely than men to live beyond the "break even" age at which the accumulated value of higher benefits for a person who postpones retirement will start to exceed the accumulated value of lower benefits for a person who chooses early retirement dr munnell and mr soto though determined that when a man and woman are part of a couple each should consider the contrarian path their findings are based in large part on differing income levels and thus differing social security benefits for men and women age differences between spouses life spans and on the fact that a surviving spouse typically a wife can collect of a deceased spouses social security benefit a husband who delays benefits until age is actually helping his wife in the long run by increasing the value of her survivor benefit this assumes the husband earned more than the wife during their working years which is often the case the wife meanwhile by claiming benefits at age is bringing social security dollars into the home for the longest period possible two caveats if a wife and husband are about the same age and her benefit is expected to be about one third of his benefit or smaller the " " recommendation doesnt work as well both spouses should delay benefits second decisions about social security shouldnt be made in a vacuum when it comes to retirement finances couples can help themselves in several ways in later life says dr munnell "my advice generally is that women and men if theyre healthy should keep working for as long as they possibly can and reduce the amount of time theyre dependent on their savings "
