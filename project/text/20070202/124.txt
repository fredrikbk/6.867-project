weekend journal the drivers seat chryslers first suv misses the mark does "luxury" mean anything anymore overused by marketers of virtually every sort of consumer product the term has been so abused by auto makers lately that legendary general motors chairman alfred sloan must be turning in his grave mr sloans famous dictum about product strategy seems to have morphed into "a luxury car for every purse and purpose " while traditional upscale brands like mercedes benz have recently gone down into the &# range the average u s retail price for a new vehicle has been climbing it hit &# in up since according to the national automobile dealers association further blurring the line between luxury and everyday is that common high volume cars and trucks now are routinely equipped to out spec the luxury models of just a few years ago even civics have navigation systems these days the result is a class of so called luxury vehicles that are neither expensive nor equipped with features that truly separate them from the pack the latest entry daimlerchryslers first chrysler badged sport utility vehicle a model only slightly more luxurious than indoor plumbing thats because the aspen is pretty much just a tarted up dodge durango a three year old model whose only redeeming feature is its optional liter hemi v engine the hemi retains its appeal in the chrysler producing a whopping horsepower and foot pounds of torque the same as in the durango to the uninitiated this is plenty it moves the aspen about as quickly as youd want to go in a pound full size suv and it affords maximum towing capacity of pounds anyone who likes power will love the hemi anyone who doesnt well they probably havent driven a vehicle with one under the hood of course the fun has to end sometime and in this case that would be at the pump despite a cylinder deactivation system thats designed to save gas by shutting off four cylinders when full power isnt needed a week of real world driving in a four wheel drive aspen produced only mpg over miles its epa fuel economy rating is a more generous mpg combined mpg in the two wheel drive version the aspens standard liter v performs even worse giving up one mile per gallon and horsepower to the hemi if youre thinking that most buyers of luxury suvs dont care about gas prices and fuel economy youre right but buyers of pseudo luxury suvs sold at bargain prices likely do and thats the aspen demographic its starting price of &# including destination charge is almost &# less than the base price of a cadillac escalade and more than grand less than a lincoln navigator thats all you really need to know about the aspens sales pitch its cheap so much so that anyone with the jack to roll in the caddy or navi is as likely to cross shop the aspen as they are to consider a subcompact suzuki the real competitor is actually gms plebeian full size suv the chevrolet tahoe it was completely redesigned as a model and its good enough that we could just end the discussion of the aspen right here not only does the chevy have a more cohesive design more efficient engines to choose from and a nicer interior its quieter and drives more like a modern luxury sedan your local chrysler dealer can probably do a good job of showing you on paper all the ways the aspen is "better" than the tahoe it does cost less and then theres the hemi again but spend a few minutes behind the wheel and youll discover the aspens sloppy steering and numb suspension around town this gives the vehicle a not entirely undesirable lincoln town car kind of ride but at highway speed the floating feeling and all the play in the steering can make it difficult to manage thankfully the aspen comes with standard stability control what you wont notice during a test drive is how quickly the interior in the aspen can show its age my test vehicle had just over miles on it and already the light colored plastics and seating surfaces looked old and worn chrysler isnt known for high quality interior finishes and the aspen doesnt remedy this reputation the optional leather seats are covered with a tough and shiny material that more resembles vinyl than anything once worn by an animal whatever happened to chryslers soft corinthian leather for that matter whats become of chryslers design department this is an organization that just a decade ago prided itself on delivering maximum curb appeal today with the notable exception of the sedan the chrysler brand lineup is an aesthetic embarrassment the aspens sole distinguishing visual characteristic the metal strakes that trim its hood is borrowed from the crossfire a sports car so unpopular that chrysler dealers managed to sell only of them during all of december hardly the sort of vehicle you want to iconify yet the crossfires look also graces the tedious new sebring at least that model doesnt pretend to be a luxury vehicle contact us at driversseat wsj com owners manual how the chrysler aspen
