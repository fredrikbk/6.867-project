sixth game for the pensacola pelicans of the american association lowering his season era to and raising his hopes that a big league organization might pick up his contract that night he and some teammates jumped in a swimming pool for kicks mr begnaud dove into the shallow end the resulting injury to his spinal cord ended his baseball career and changed his life on yahoo sports jeff passan chronicles whats happened to mr begnaud since then "turning over is a real adventure " he writes "the first time begnaud tried he couldnt do it same for the second time and the third time and on and on even now its a struggle a strapping year old reduced to teaching himself things he learned before he turned painting is a real adventure because his fingers no longer move begnaud uses a special instrument and with only the atrophied muscles in his arms guiding his hand makes jagged brushstrokes and yet how beautiful was the first piece he finished a major league baseball logo the symbol of what he wanted to be and no longer can begnaud reaching back one last time only to be jerked forward by reality " jerked forward by reality but not undone by it as mr begnaud tells mr passan "my accident did not change who i am it only changed the way i do things " if the colorado rockies win the nl west next year perhaps they ought to vote apples steve jobs a playoff share last year brian jones then the rockies assistant coordinator of video coaching and a colleague started experimenting with loading videos of at bats and pitching performances an invaluable and time honored scouting tool for players onto ipods "i showed it to todd helton " mr jones tells espn coms jayson stark "and the next day he brought his ipod in and we put all his hits on there dating back to " as mr stark notes "there were of those hits by the way and when heltons ipod didnt instantly explode or anything the rockies knew they were on to something eventually more than two thirds of the roster had piled on and turned this team into baseballs official isquad every player gets his own custom set of videos loaded onto his personal ipod sorted by date hitter pitcher and opponent and updated every week or so " jason jennings for one credits the ipod viewing with helping him turn around his season mr jennings is now a member of the houston astros and one imagines hell be telling his new teammates about the rockies practice if they dont know already that is mr stark says players on the philadelphia phillies florida marlins seattle mariners cleveland indians and boston red sox are either already using ipods for game preparation or have asked their organizations about it which makes mr stark wonder whats to come "one of these days we predict youll see a pitcher take a walk behind the mound during a key at bat pull out his ipod and take a quick video refresher course before launching the big pitch of the night " he writes "heck if nfl quarterbacks can get plays radioed right into their helmets why not so then you know whatll happen jennings laughed instead of getting kicked out of games for using pine tar well get kicked out for using our ipods " englands rugby team is being remade and simon barnes of the times is approvingly quoting nietzsche head coach brian ashton has picked jonny wilkinson for the teams fly half despite mr wilkinsons uncertain status trying to return from injury andy farrell "a truly great rugby league player who has hardly played any rugby union at all" and brought jason robinson back from international league retirement wheres nietzsche come in mr barnes passes along his cry that "the secret of realising the greatest fruitfulness and the great enjoyment of existence is to live dangerously build your cities on the slopes of vesuvius " mr wilkinson writes mr barnes "may be hopelessly rusty when he finds himself at the sharp end of an international he may break down again farrell still a trifle vague about the rules and customs of his new game may find himself yards offside and nullifying englands crucial breakthrough and the very idea of having not one but two wigan old boys in an england rugby union side smacks of defiance if these selections go wrong ashton will look pretty silly but at least he has gone into the game with a joyful life affirming embrace of risk and that whether england win or not is wonderfully sympathetic all things being equal we prefer a side who are willing to live dangerously " speaking of rugby did you know sacramento is its west coast capital so says marcos breton of the sacramento bee who then offers a nice rugby primer "the games are a sight to behold and if youre wondering why this space is plugging an obscure sport the answer is simple rugby players lay it on the line " he writes "rugby coaches put in the equivalent of full time weeks for little or no money rugby people really do it for the love of the game its not a cliche its real " these are not happy times for the university of cincinnati bearcats on the season but just in the big east "mick cronins biggest challenge as uc basketball coach is to keep his players from feeling like wile e coyote " paul daugherty writes in the cincinnati enquirer "how many times do the bearcats a run off a cliff b take an anvil to the head or c think the dynamite is food before whatever is left of their enthusiasm disappears in a cloud of loss dust bless em the bearcats are defending the alamo every night " after games mr daugherty writes "its fair to say this season is no longer about winning at least not in the big picture sense its about learning what winning requires cronin calls it developing the fiber and backbone of who we are the bearcats are into the serious fiber and backbone development portion of the schedule the hope is they keep their chins from scraping the floor " edwin pope has worked for the miami herald for more than years a move prompted by an atlanta journal constitution editor turning down a &# requisition for a much needed pencil sharpener that means incarnations of that game were not discussing eighteen wimbledons forty kentucky derbys eight olympics hes approaching stories and topping million words mr popes colleague armando salguero offers a nice overview of a long career the herald has gathered mr popes coverage of that big sunday sporting event a nice page thats also handy for teaching kids their roman numerals and dont miss dan le batards tribute to his friend and mentor "the excess of todays event is a bit much for someone like you who comes from another time " he writes "but there you are again nonetheless frisked and jostled by security at yet another checkpoint its like watching yoda standing in line for a ride at disney sportswriters have moved on to television and radio with more fame than we deserve but you are antique proof that evolution isnt the same thing as progress youve always been a scholar edwin putting weight and literature in the playpen thats what lured me into this work and this life all i wanted was to be you i grew up in south florida reading your columns you took me places you taught me how to love sports and words and reading before
