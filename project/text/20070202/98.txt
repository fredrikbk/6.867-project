the expat life when music is magic at the expat prom i listen to music all day long but nothing compares to the feeling that washes over me at a great live show at once meditative and adrenaline pumping its something i need to experience every once in a while unfortunately doing so has proven quite difficult in beijing where every large venue is currently closed for olympics renovation that is why i didnt hesitate to fly to shanghai to see eric clapton last week a couple of years ago i passed on a free ticket to see clapton at madison square garden in favor of playing some mediocre blues in a friends basement i could have attended that show for a &# train ticket and a minute ride this one cost &# plus two days of my life and about miles of traveling but i never considered not going i sometimes find myself wrestling with just how much american popular culture to seek out i welcome the virtual absence of tv from my life but scramble to find new episodes of "the sopranos " "the wire" and "deadwood " i dont miss going to movies but i embrace podcasts a voice inside me says that i should be exploring china instead of spending my time and money on something i might do "back home " but this concert was different i had to go music has always been important to me in eighth grade i chose the late allman brothers guitarist duane allman as the subject of my "biography of a great american" assignment twenty years ago i profiled blues guitarist buddy guy for my college newspaper and ive been getting paid to do similar stories ever since the music i love has given me a livelihood but also much more it has become a part of me which is why news of the clapton show was so exciting i also had good reason to think that this would be a particularly stirring concert mr claptons current band includes two guitarists i have long admired doyle bramhall and derek trucks whom i have covered for guitar world magazine for years since he was an year old phenom though i wanted to attend the concert as a "civilian" letting the music wash over me rather than analyzing it and turning it into a job i couldnt resist the lure of a good story about someone whose career i have followed for so long i arranged to take derek and doyle out for a lunch interview the afternoon of the show the story will appear in guitar world we enjoyed great soup dumplings noodles and oolong tea but my real nourishment came from conducting the interview it was the kind of music oriented dialogue i have steered countless times but rarely since moving to china i didnt realize how much i missed it until i waded back in after lunch we rode over to the dong tai lu antiques market where we strolled down narrow lanes filled with tiny shops selling old cameras phonographs ethnic minority goods and more derek and doyle enjoyed being out in the real china like any first class business travelers they often find themselves snugly secure in the comfy but homogeneous international hotel bubble busting out for a brief exploration was a relief one i was happy to guide i dropped them back at the four seasons then rode over to my hotel bizarrely located inside shanghai stadium the location was perfect for the concert which was next door at the seat grand stage my friend matt had secured a block of tickets and at p m we gathered in a suite for tsingtao beers and chips with several other beijing contingents obviously i wasnt the only one craving musical sustenance on the short walk to the arena we passed through a wall of scalpers and several smiling chain smoking military policemen the backstreet boys concert i attended in beijing last year featured intense security with dozens of military policemen and strange seating arrangements that divided the chinese crowd into small sections on the floor in contrast walking into the clapton show didnt feel too different from entering a concert in america an australian usher asked if we could find our seats and smiled as we said yes we settled into the th row and i took in the crowd which was about western around us less so in the arenas further reaches a chinese lady in front of me appeared to be both bored and annoyed all night as if she would rather be anywhere else most of the crowd looked enraptured but subdued likely due to claptons avoidance of many of his hits instead of playing "tears in heaven " "after midnight" or "i shot the sheriff " he dug deep into his archives opening the show with five songs from his old band derek and the dominos while others may have been puzzled by the song selection it was just what the doctor ordered for me an impassioned version of jimi hendrixs "little wing" was a holy moment offering just the musical cleansing i craved he also barely addressed the crowd and while this surely riled some fans i gave him props for not uttering a lame "ni hao shanghai " the set ended with a fiery version of "layla " which finally swept the crowd off its feet as the band took a group bow and walked off waving i heard wild screaming behind me and smiled at the sight of three chinese guys gleefully yelling and stomping their feet when the group returned for an encore a rush of people surged forward i joined them and we ran right to the lip of the stage it suddenly felt very much like we were in a high school gym like eric clapton was playing the expat prom pushing gently together and straining to see over the little girl on her dads shoulders in front of me i had a homey feeling standing in shanghai just feet away from eric clapton playing "crossroads " a favorite old blues tune felt like nothing less than winking at life then it was over people stomped and cheered and clapped and i felt certain a second encore was coming but the house lights came on and a disappointed sigh ran through the hall we filed out into the cold drizzly night walking amidst a crowd buzzing with that familiar en masse post concert high we retreated to a bar on the th floor of my hotel overlooking the lit empty soccer stadium and the expat prom continued well into the wee hours one of the people in our group someone i dont know well said to me "you really looked like you were feeling it tonight with your eyes closed and that look on your face " i have no idea what i looked like but i knew exactly what he meant the next day i bumped into an acquaintance on the flight back "that was a lot of travel for a little bit of concert " he said "but it sure was good " exactly have you lived someplace that prompted you to grapple with how much popular culture to pursue have you traveled a long way for a concert or other event was it worth it im looking forward to hearing from you share your thoughts readers respond write to me and ill post selected comments in a future column please let me know if you want to share your thoughts but dont want your letter published below are selected edited responses to my previous expat life column about beijings pollution problems it drew an unusual amount of response from chinese readers several of whom did not want to have their letter printed and several others of which i posted in the forum mr paul i so enjoyed the articles i have read of your experiences including the one about your trip with your parents but am not familiar with all of your columns we are hoping to visit china in october for about one month and i am curious about any other times you have written about travel within the country thanks marcia freed marcia thanks for the kind words you can go to online wsj com search aggregate html and see a list of all my articles the following regard travel within china discovering china with visiting parents hills offer escape from the city a trek off the beaten path pays dividends seeing a different side of china when the big attraction at the zoo is you i share exactly the same feeling as you about pollution in beijing i studied and worked in beijing for years before coming to the u s last december i was back for weeks and was scared by how dirty the air was the only two days i saw the sun and blue sky were after a storm the strong wind of the storm carried away the particles and returned the sky i started to crave storms i hope you write more articles to arouse social awareness i was very disappointed when the mayor told the wsj that there would be no problem for beijing to continue development of the auto industry i wish he would read your article take care and stay healthy steve thank you for presenting us the environmental situations of beijing its very very good not only beijing but also other big cities in china are facing almost similar problems i think all these environment situations are caused by the rapid growing economy and it will only be solved by the growing economy since when people get wealthier they will realize and require a better life including clean air and government a wealthier government will have the resources to take actions to on it rong liu
