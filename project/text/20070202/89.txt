senates minimum wage rise to face test in house business tax breaks to meet resistance limits on shelters washington the senate overwhelmingly approved a &# increase in the federal minimum wage but the business tax breaks paired with it face hurdles in the house on a vote the senate backed the boost in pay for low wage workers as well as about &# billion over years in tax breaks for businesses such as restaurants that could be affected by the higher wage to pay for the sweeteners a condition of support for many senate republicans the bill would limit the use of certain tax shelters close loopholes and increase taxes on executive compensation the offsets have spurred criticism from business groups which hope to persuade lawmakers to change or drop some provisions during house senate negotiations business lobbyists may be helped by some house democrats who say the tax breaks are unnecessary or too large or who take issue with some offset provisions the minimum wage bill illustrates the democrats discovering just as republicans did before them that moving their agenda through the house is only a first step while the house swiftly passed a slew of legislation as part of the democrats" hours" agenda many of the provisions face hurdles or slower passage in the senate where democrats have a slim majority and procedural rules give more power to the minority despite strong support for the minimum wage increase members of the house and senate havent laid out yet how to resolve their differences senators say they are confident they will be able to deal with a constitutional precedent requiring tax legislation to originate in the house possibly by attaching the minimum wage package to a separate house passed tax measure but the question remains how will the house and senate work out the impasse over tax breaks the house passed its minimum wage increase by a wide margin and without the tax breaks in the senate version rep charles rangel the new york democrat who is chairman of the house ways and means panel has criticized the tax breaks "im not authorized to pay that much money for it " mr rangel said after a meeting tuesday with senate finance committee chairman max baucus d mont on this and other issues mr rangel said he wants to let the issue "stew" in the senate after the vote yesterday mr baucus said the house and senate would be able to "harmonize" their bills "im confident that our dedication to a minimum wage increase is stronger than any differences between our two bills " he said senate majority leader harry reid d nev yesterday questioned whether "we need all these business pieces of sugar" in the legislation rep richard durbin d ill the assistant majority leader said a minimum wage increase could emerge from a house senate conference without the tax breaks "if we go through the process and go through a conference and the message comes back you can have the minimum wage stripped down or not at all then well face another vote " mr durbin said "we need republicans to pass it if they continue to oppose it then it will not pass " the stalemate over the minimum wage is a contrast with the swift action in the house last month during the new majoritys first hours in charge house democrats reduced restrictions on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research strengthened house ethics rules and agreed to a pay go requirement that new spending and tax breaks shouldnt increase the deficit they rescinded tax breaks for oil and gas companies and required the federal government to negotiate with drug makers over prices in the medicare health program among other bills some of the " hours" items have a good chance of getting to the presidents desk though they will take time to wend their way through committees senate democrats have indicated they support strengthening pay go requirements for example and also want to reduce the cost of student loans on other issues such as fulfilling certain commission recommendations the senate may have other ideas on medicare price negotiation the senate may take a different tack than the house mr baucus has said he supports removing from current law a prohibition on government negotiation with drug companies while the house version requires the government to do such bargaining it is unclear what mr baucus might pursue in the finance committee and whether a softer approach would do anything to temper what senate republicans have promised will be strong opposition david rogers contributed to this article
