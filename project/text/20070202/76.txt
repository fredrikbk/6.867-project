new management in africa chinas expansion begins to stir resentment investment boom fuels colonialism charges a tragedy in zambia chambishi zambia chinese president hu jintao embarked on an upbeat tour of africa this week doling out aid and lauding chinas growing economic and political ties with the continent but there is little love for china in this ramshackle township which had to be dropped from the agenda of president hus weekend visit to zambia because of likely unrest set amid rolling hills in zambias copper belt chambishi was supposed to be a showcase of sino african friendship chinas state metals conglomerate china non ferrous metal mining group co bought the mothballed copper mine here in bringing plenty of jobs and investments initial gratitude however quickly turned into seething discontent as the new chinese owners banned union activity and cut corners on safety in dozens of locals were killed in a blast at the chinese explosives facility serving the mine the worst industrial disaster in zambias history then the following year protesting zambian employees were sprayed with gunfire "the chinese they dont even consider us to be human beings " complains albert mwanaumo a former chambishi miner who says he was shot by a chinese supervisor "they think they have the right to rule us " similar feelings of resentment about chinas unfolding scramble for influence in africa are beginning to bubble up across the continent african leaders still hail chinas burgeoning involvement as a solution to africas woes and a welcome alternative to the west but among ordinary africans appreciation of this unprecedented influx of chinese investments products and settlers isnt nearly as uniform recognizing this opinion shift south african president thabo mbeki has repeatedly cautioned in recent weeks that china risks replicating in africa a "colonial relationship" of the kind that existed under white rule these concerns testify to chinas maturing as a global economic and political superpower a force thats beginning to challenge world wide influence of the u s and europe thats especially true here in africa a continent dismissed by many westerners as a hopeless case and treated by beijing as a high priority area of national interest nowhere has this grass roots backlash been stronger than in zambia in elections last fall opposition leader michael sata ran for president on a platform of outright china bashing unleashing against beijing the same kind of fury that populist radicals in latin america or the middle east direct at the u s "zambia is becoming a province no a district of china " he thundered "weve removed one foreign power and we dont want another foreign power here especially one that is not a democracy " though mr sata failed to dislodge the china backed incumbent his patriotic front movement secured widespread support it now controls zambias capital city lusaka and most municipal governments in the nations copper rich mining areas following the zambian campaign similar political sentiments came to the open in neighboring countries such as namibia zimbabwe angola and lesotho "among ordinary people a very strong resentment bordering on racism is emerging against the chinese " says henning melber a former activist in namibias struggle for majority rule who now heads the dag hammarskjoeld foundation think tank in sweden "its because the chinese are seen as backing the african governments in oppressing their own people " chinas hunger for raw materials is the main reason why its become so involved in african affairs sino african trade in more than quadrupled to more than &# billion since and is expected to hit &# billion by angola has overtaken saudi arabia as chinas main source of oil with large scale supplies also flowing from sudan and nigeria chinese companies have sought guineas bauxite namibias uranium and the assortment of rare metals that are found in the congo formerly known as zaire in zambia a landlocked country of million the main draw for china is copper and the recent outcry is rooted in the tragic events that followed chinas investment at the mine in chambishi china non ferrous metal mining purchased the mine which had been shuttered since for &# million it stepped forward after a canadian company that had initially won the tender pulled out of the deal investing more than &# million in the property the chinese conglomerates zambian unit called nfc africa mining plc restarted production in late ramping up output to reach metric tons of copper concentrate last year dozens of chinese managers and supervisors settled in the township a maze of trash strewn dirt alleys set across the paved road from the mine inside the mine itself a red chinese flag was hoisted above a wall covered with inspirational words of wu bangguo chairman of the standing committee of the national peoples congress "to rouse yourself in vigorous efforts to make the company prosperous " as part of its prosperity plan the mines management paid zambian employees less than the minimum wage currently &# a month and strictly prohibited union activity according to employees and union officials a memo to staff which still hangs inside nfc africa offices warned of "severe punishment" for anyone attending meetings of the "so called action group of union organizers which is illegal " people suspected of union involvement were fired on the spot says gillian mubanga the current union leader at the mine to drive up production and save on costs nfc also established on the chambishi property a joint venture with the beijing general research institute of mining and metallurgy dubbed bgrimm explosives ltd it set out to manufacture cheap explosives for the regions mining industry "bgrimm turning your rocks into gold " boasted advertisement billboards that still dot the roadsides across zambias copper belt region then one sunny morning in april chambishi was rocked by a huge blast earth shook and windowpanes broke in nearby houses a runaway chemical reaction turned the bgrimm facility into a giant fireball pulverizing the entire structure a total of zambian employees of bgrimm were killed their charred body parts strewn around the smoldering crater eyewitnesses say the chinese staff had hurriedly driven away from the site shortly before this explosion occurred local residents theorize that the chinese realized something was about to happen and didnt bother warning african employees before fleeing themselves unable to identify individual remains the victims families have had to bury plastic bags packed with flesh randomly collected at the site anger against the chinese was intensified by widespread belief that safety rules had been flouted in pursuit of profit at the plant "the chinese didnt care about our children they just sacrificed them " said iris chibuye a grieving mother whose year old son sledge and year old daughter vennie a computer technician educated in britain both died in the bgrimm disaster though the chinese government sent condolences to victims families and eventually paid compensation of about &# per killed employee the anger didnt abate as the zambian government began an inquiry into the accident the absence of union oversight was cited as the key cause of safety failures at bgrimm public pressure made it impossible for the mines management to continue prohibiting union activity any longer in november nfc africa deputy ceo wang xiaowei shook hands with zambias national union of miners and allied workers leader albert mando and signed a collective agreement that finally installed new safety measures and promised a salary increase assuring that the company treats its zambian workers as "family members " mr wang also urged the union "to understand that the high operational costs may often compromise the working conditions of employees " according to nfc africas in house newsletter after drawn out negotiations with the unions nfc africa set july as the date for giving its workers back pay in accordance with the new agreements miners had been expecting payments of as much as &# each but were told on payday that they would receive only a few dollars and in some cases even owe money to the company on the evening of july night shift miners stunned to hear that they wouldnt be getting the expected cash stopped work vandalized equipment and beat up a chinese supervisor the following day furious morning shift employees blocked the main road in chambishi with tree trunks and stones marching toward the mine as a scuffle broke out at the gate mine security fired at one of the protesters wounding him according to witnesses as false rumors that he had been killed spread across chambishi another group of about nfc africa miners from a later shift rushed toward the residential compound of chinese employees set on a winding road inside the township at the white and blue gate into the walled compound a chinese supervisor known to the zambian miners simply as mr qui took out a shotgun and opened fire as the crowd approached according to witness accounts hit by the shots three demonstrators collapsed on the ground blood gushing out mr mwanaumo a year old jackhammer operator who says he didnt take part in the initial protest ran to the site after hearing that a close friend had been shot as mr mwanaumo pulled his injured comrade away a new volley of fire burrowed into his back according to his medical report two lead fragments are still lodged in his body too close to the vital organs to be safely extracted in the local hospital a day after these shootings mr qui hastily left chambishi mr mwanaumo like the other wounded workers was fired feeling too sick to work he spends his days in a tiny dark hut set amid sewage soaked mud hoping that relatives and friends will collect enough money to file a compensation lawsuit investigation continues the zambian government investigation into the incident is still continuing as is the inquiry into the bgrimm disaster xu riyong nfc africas company secretary and manager of administration declined to discuss the details of these events or elaborate on mr quis status saying that the company has already made a comprehensive report to the zambian government on the matter "by complying with the laws of zambia we are confident that no problems will come to us " said mr xu the only nfc africa official who agreed to be interviewed for this story "we will do our best to run this mine successfully we have to keep quiet and to keep working why should we fear " the zambian government has so far apportioned no blame for the chambishi tragedy in an interview zambias minister of mines kalombo mwansa declined to forecast when the investigations into the explosion and the shootings at the mine might be concluded when the report will be released and whether any penalties might be levied against the chinese company in the meantime he said nfc africas bgrimm affiliate has been allowed to rebuild and reopen an explosives factory at the site of the tragedy nfc africa has also announced that it will invest &# million into a crude copper smelting plant in chambishi president hu was scheduled to visit chambishi this weekend to lay the cornerstone for the smelter but according to zambian officials this part of his schedule was called off because of planned protests by miners and families of bgrimm explosion victims the risks in chambishi are real sitting next to mr mwanaumo the worker who was shot in july a friend currently employed by nfc africa warned of even bloodier unrest to come at the mine "there will be a strike soon if they dont improve our salary and a lot of people will die " he said "this time the police wont be able to contain us " the management seems to be getting the message on a recent afternoon workers were busy at the chinese staffs chambishi residential compound perched on the perimeter wall they reinforced fortifications installing a new row of high voltage fencing atop an existing layer of spiky glass shards
