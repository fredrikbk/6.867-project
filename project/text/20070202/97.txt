the evening wrap better know a lawyer viacom borrowing a tactic from faux newscaster stephen colbert put youtube on notice but the infant terrible of the internet appeared unfazed by the media giants fit of pique viacom the parent of mtv comedy central and nickelodeon demanded that youtube immediately pull the plug on more than videos that had been posted on the immensely popular google owned web site without its approval weary of seeing clips from "the colbert report" or "spongebob squarepants" get thousands upon thousands of clicks on the video sharing site without seeing so much as a nickel itself viacom tersely stated that youtube and its new overlords in mountain view failed to set up promised tools to filter copyrighted footage and continue to host "vast amounts of unauthorized video " youtube was equally laconic "its unfortunate that viacom will no longer be able to benefit from youtubes passionate audience which has helped to promote many of viacoms shows " a company representative said viacoms move wasnt exactly a bolt from the blue viacom and youtube werent making much progress on a distribution accord despite long talks and last week news corp slapped youtube with a subpoena demanding that it unmask a user who uploaded pirated episodes of "" and "the simpsons" to the site some networks have reached a measure of peace with youtube but the standoff between traditional media firms with twitchy litigation fingers and a site that sees itself on the media vanguard is unlikely to go away weve seen this movie before of course the recording industry faced a similar challenge from napster and though traditional labels managed to bulldoze that site in its original form it was a pyrrhic victory the downloading issue though less pervasive hasnt vanished and with record sales in the cellar the music companies have the appearance of besotted rock n roll dinosaurs being propped by embarrassed roadies television and movie firms many of whom toil under the same corporate umbrellas as the wounded music firms seem eager to avoid making the same mistakes theyre also hungry to cash in on the geyser of ad dollars they see in the online video business one solution they have explored is joining forces to set up a youtube rival but they also seem aware of the power youtube holds and dont want to be left out in the cold "our hope is that youtube and google will support a fair and authorized distribution model that allows consumers to continue to enjoy our very popular content now and in the future " viacom said such talk indicates viacom still wants to deal as much as the company desires to protect its property it also wants that property to be seen by as many eyeballs as possible and youtube is uniquely suited to deliver them "this is a negotiating move " wrote ubs analysts who cover google they said the terms of any deal between the two companies will have far reaching implications for the medium and they believe that google will pay up "now in the early days to establish its long term position " that could come at some expense to googles margins at a time when investors are already wary though google once again trounced expectations when it released earnings earlier this week its stock sank as investors fretted about future pressure on operating income which grew by a mere during the fourth quarter instead of doubling or tripling as it had in quarters past but a dent to margins in the short term may be easier to stomach than an expensive legal battle down the road stocks mixed after jobs data the

meaning even if january appeared to be wobbly its hiring was constructed on a solid foundation joshua shapiro chief u s economist at mfr inc wrote that the result "should be viewed alongside the very strong gains that preceded it and we seriously doubt that it represents anything more than a blip in what looks to be a quite robust labor market " economists at morgan stanley said the data was

complaint the bush administration filed a grievance with the world trade organization over chinas alleged payment of subsidies to chinese manufacturers the white house has generally taken a gingerly
