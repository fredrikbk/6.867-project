weekend journal review theater famous father furious family new york frank lloyd wright like so many great artists was a lousy family man this amply documented fact inspired richard nelsons "franks home " a play about the master architect who designed the guggenheim museum invented the carport and conducted a love life complicated enough to fuel a miniseries or two mr nelsons play first seen earlier this season at chicagos goodman theatre in a production now being presented in new york by playwrights horizons is partly a domestic drama and partly a meditation on the meaning and significance of art the second part is better than the first i see more than my share of plays about uncaring parents and their resentful children and while "franks home" covers that oft trod ground plausibly enough i didnt find mr nelsons rendering of the old old story to be especially original or memorable far more interesting are the scenes in which wright peter weller talks about his work seeking to persuade his angry son jay whittaker that its quality redeems his failings as a father and husband "beauty is not just a pleasure an ornament an extra its our life and death our reason our meaning " mr weller whose face will be familiar to viewers of "robocop" and " " plays wright as a cocky fast talking sharpie a la jimmy cagney a characterization that has nothing to do with the grand th century manner of the real life wright but is very effective in its own way the rest of the cast is equally strong especially mr whittaker one of chicagos best young actors and harris yulin whose portrayal of a seedy weary louis sullivan wrights aging mentor is deeply moving i gave a blitzing earlier this season to robert falls the goodmans artistic director whose shock effect "king lear" the first scene was set in a urinal was the worst professional production of a shakespeare play ive ever seen im relieved to report that his staging of "franks home " by contrast is deftly paced and admirably unfussy both of which bode well for his coming broadway revival of eric bogosians "talk radio " thomas lynch the designer has cleverly set the action in a semi abstract open field thereby avoiding the necessity of showing or suggesting any of wrights famous buildings the only piece of "authentic" decor is a lone wright style armchair wright buffs who run to the obsessive should be warned that this is not a docudrama mr nelson has played fast and loose with the facts since his main interest is not in putting frank lloyd wright on stage but in exploring the internal dynamics of a dysfunctional family whose head happens to be a genius for this reason i wonder whether "franks home" might have been a better play had its author made the whole thing up from scratch instead of hanging his plot on the hook of a great mans life the dance critic edwin denby made a devastating remark about leonide massine a once famous choreographer who made bad ballets set to the symphonies of beethoven berlioz and brahms "like a cigarette company he is using famous names to advertise his wares " "franks home" isnt nearly that bad but when you compare it to a masterpiece like fallingwater its not nearly good enough either washington the nations capital is playing host to a city wide season long shakespeare orgy "shakespeare in washington " which runs through june consists of plus presentations by arts organizations drama companies dance troupes opera houses symphony orchestras museums celebrating the life and work of the greatest of all english speaking playwrights i dipped my toe into the stream by paying a visit to the folger shakespeare library where the classical theatre of harlem about which ive been hearing terrific buzz is midway through a six week run of "king lear " the company proved to be every bit as good as its reputation and its "lear " previously seen in new york and miami is a highly impressive piece of work alfred preissers production is set in ancient mesopotamia and the program contains some fancy talk about how he conceives of the play as "a fairy tale in which lears family is analogous to the universe " ignore it please mr preissers "lear" is a straightforward colorfully costumed staging full of highflying rhetoric and flamboyant physicality one of the actors actually does a backflip like the american shakespeare centers blackfriars playhouse in staunton va the folger theatre has an elizabethan style open stage that mr preisser uses very very skillfully pushing his cast pell mell from scene to scene andre de shields is a fine lear lean and mad eyed while ty jones and ken schatz make strong impressions as edmund and the fool ive seen more subtle "lears " but few that were quite so unabashedly exciting as this one i brought along a friend whod never seen the play performed and she was riveted from start to finish me too mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com
