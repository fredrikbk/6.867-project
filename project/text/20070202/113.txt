weekend journal on sports wardrobe for dan capozzi the weeks preceding the super bowl are an exercise in multitasking sleep deprivation and crisis management together with his office staff hell work hour days interviewing dozens of job applicants fielding customer calls and logging schedules on a &# proprietary software system on sunday his company expects to generate up to of its total annual revenue in a matter of hours mr capozzis business providing racy entertainment for super bowl parties since its debut in as a lopsided novelty game between rival pro football leagues the super bowl has become an unofficial american holiday with its own set of rituals and its own unique economy in recent years companies that advertise male and female "strippers" or "exotic dancers" for private parties have joined caterers beer vendors and pizza delivery shops on the list of businesses that have to prepare for an onslaught of sales on game day super bowl sunday is the industrys busiest day of the year not only does the money earned during the game account for as much as a quarter of a typical agencys revenue major agencies say the number of super bowl orders has been growing by per year tony hassan the owner of erotic image in detroit says hes booked shows for sunday and will bring in as much as &# nine times the normal revenue for a february weekend "its a little like the christmas season for retailers " he says for dancers and managers this growing demand though good for the bottom line creates a logistical puzzle sufficient for a business school case study since the super bowl comes at a time when demand is in a deep seasonal trough managers have to start preparing weeks in advance tracking down dancers they havent seen in months hiring and training new ones and making sure nobody is out of shape nearly every customer who calls wants a show at halftime which puts the agencies in a bind not only is it impossible to know when halftime will begin but the window is too short for anything but one abbreviated performance another challenge as many as half the potential customers call at the last minute forcing managers to scramble on game day "its an extreme peak demand scenario " says j michael harrison a specialist in production and operations management at stanford universitys business school "you cant shift demand to another time its costly to recruit and train workers and there may be a quality degradation that will mar your reputation " though he has never studied this particular industry dr harrison says the challenge looks daunting "i dont see too much room for creative solutions " the business of for hire exotic dancers is a small and comparatively tame subset of the adult entertainment industry most companies are small local outfits licensed as theatrical booking agencies their dancers are independent contractors who earn most of their compensation in tips agency owners say total nationwide sales are probably less than &# million while they run the gamut from highly organized corporate services with strict rules to cheap and disreputable outfits where dancers may dabble in drugs and prostitution these agencies dont end up in police reports as often as some other types of adult businesses while widely identified as "strippers" in media reports the alleged victims in the recent duke university sexual assault case were dispatched by escort services for years exotic dancers did the bulk of their business during the spring wedding season at bachelor and bachelorette parties but as a result of everything from the thriving chippendales male review in las vegas to a series of striptease workout videos by carmen electra business is growing janet jacksons "wardrobe malfunction" during the super bowl halftime show combined with provocative commercials and programming on competing networks featuring lingerie models have helped give the game an undercurrent of raunchiness while the bulk of the customers are still young single men agency owners say theyre getting more calls from women and from people throwing co ed parties at mr capozzis agency centerfold strips in new york the staff began preparing for the super bowl right after the new year by kickoff sunday they will have placed dozens of ads for new dancers in places like craigslist org and the village voice conducted interviews hired new dancers fielded hundreds of calls and scheduled more than shows at the height of this weeks madness marketing director marc landau said his shaving and showering routines had fallen by the wayside and hed traded business casual for a pair of shorts by the time he leaves the office its nearly midnight and his ear is sore from cradling the phone sometimes he says "i just walk outside and scream " the pressure can take a toll on performers too by sunday most say they have already worked two nights in a row and are usually running on short sleep and unlike bachelor parties where guests usually know what to expect and bring lots of cash for tips super bowl partygoers sometimes have a hard time tearing themselves away from the game in genevieve gray arrived to perform at a super bowl party in springfield mass she changed into a football jersey and started the show the problem the hometown new england patriots were playing in the game first the partygoers wanted to keep the volume up on the television drowning out her music after a few seconds of dancing one onlooker glanced at the game and shouted "wait a minute stop " after the play was over he said "ok go ahead " though the customers finally turned off the tv ms gray says she earned only &# in tips from all her shows that day about half what she earned last year when the patriots did not make it to the super bowl of all the logistical challenges the biggest is this how to handle the inevitable crush of calls on game day in boston john galland of shamrock entertainment chooses to embrace the procrastinators while he offers a discount for early bookings and sends dancers to football stadium parking lots to promote the companys super bowl shows hell field of his total requests at the last minute some of them from as far away as maine and vermont "some people think its like ordering a pizza " he says to capture the late business on game day he turns his two room office into a command post with some dancers and drivers on standby and a buffet stocked with cold cuts pasta trays cookies and soda during sundays game hell be dug in at his desk wearing gym pants and sipping bottled water hell be holding a phone and sometimes two while scribbling out work orders and plotting each new booking with color coded push pins on a map of new england to make sure drivers can change course on the fly he insists that every drivers car be equipped with a gps system "were able to cover most of the requests that come in that day " he says "a lot of places are not able to produce " of course not every agency wants to rather than trying to accommodate stragglers mr hassan of erotic image in detroit has a different approach upselling the customers who book early starting in january mr hassan spends a significant portion of his advertising budget marketing a &# super bowl package that includes four performers a pre game hostess to greet the guests a dancer to perform at halftime and a separate "intimate duo" to perform after the game this plan not only allows customers to watch the game without interruption it creates supply chain efficiencies a pregame hostess will have plenty of time to travel to a second party to perform at halftime and later to travel to a third party to participate in a postgame show by limiting the number of dancers working mr hassan can guarantee top dancers good earnings and avoid sending out inexperienced recruits he often sends trainees with the veterans to observe though mr hassan says he could increase bookings by if he took late orders he thinks the strain on his employees would not be worth it on super bowl sunday he closes the office and takes the day off "its a big spike in business out of nowhere " he says "but its not a day that freaks us out " the business does have pockets of difficulty with so many dancers on the road during the super bowl blizzards and breakdowns are common worries as are sudden cancellations "sometimes someones girlfriend or wife comes in and puts a kibosh on things " says mr galland there are regional differences too jeff cleboski of houston hot bodies says the super bowl isnt a busy time in texas because most people would rather concentrate on the game "football is like religion down here " he says if theres any development that could cut into this business its the growing number of party hosts who want to do it themselves platinum stages of newport beach calif a company that sells portable stripper poles that can be installed in living rooms says sales in the two weeks before the super bowl will account for of its &# million to &# million in annual revenue "the people using our products are your basic housewives and moms " says kim homuth the companys director of operations "but we do get some drunk guys on there too people send me pictures " nonetheless exotic dance companies are finding new ways to segment the market for customers who dont want full nudity many will send waitresses clad in bikinis or shirtless male bartenders wearing bowties and white cuffs some market their services to fantasy football leagues that watch the game together theyre also slowly persuading customers that its okay to book a postgame show beyond the fatigue the intense schedule and the fact that she only gets to see a few snippets of the game ms gray the exotic dancer from boston says she should make about &# more during sundays game than on any other day of the year she says she prefers super bowl parties to bachelor parties because no two are alike crowds can be young or old mixed or all male wealthy or working class "its like going to the zoo " she says "youre never sure what kind of animal youre going to see "
