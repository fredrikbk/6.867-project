russia and iran discuss a cartel for natural gas potential clout alarms big european buyers previous effort fizzled russia and iran which hold nearly half the worlds natural gas reserves are talking about creating an opec like organization for gas a move that has the potential to unsettle energy markets and redraw geopolitical alignments gas accounts for a growing share of global energy use but the nations that produce most of it dont work together to influence markets thats a stark contrast to the oil market in which members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries manage output to keep prices at levels they favor during his annual news conference in the kremlin yesterday russian president vladimir putin said "a gas opec is an interesting idea we will think about it " his comment comes days after iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei publicly called on a visiting kremlin official to establish a group of natural gas producers similar to opec russia and iran are the worlds largest and second largest holders of gas reserves respectively while there are several reasons why a gas cartel isnt likely to work as well as opec has managed the oil markets the talk has alarmed big gas consumers particularly in europe which gets a quarter of its gas from russia a cartel would be less menacing economically in the short term to the u s which still gets most of its gas within north america still over time the market is becoming more internationally flexible as shipments of liquefied natural gas rise u s imports of lng have more than doubled since though they still account for a small fraction of gas consumption here other western countries are seeing demand for the clean burning fuel climb even as their home grown supply of gas declines these shifts have turned gas in the last few years from a humdrum commodity into a prized fuel increasingly subject to geopolitical spats comparing gas prices is difficult because until recently there hasnt been a global market for the fuel asian gas delivery contracts have tended to be pegged to the price of crude oil while in the u s spot gas prices are typically set by trading at a louisiana pipeline hub u s gas cost between &# and &# per thousand cubic feet in the s but has averaged more than twice that in recent years a contract for the delivery of gas in march closed yesterday on the new york mercantile exchange at &# per thousand cubic feet up over the past few weeks due to the cold weather the prospect of russia and iran working together to influence markets cant be comforting for western countries while russia doesnt have the same pariah status as iran moscow has under mr putin faced increasing criticism for using its vast energy riches as a diplomatic lever early last year state controlled gas giant oao gazprom cut off supplies of natural gas to neighboring ukraine in a pricing dispute that briefly reduced the volumes delivered further down the pipeline in europe together russia and iran hold more than of the worlds known gas reserves according to the bp statistical review of world energy moscow has cultivated relations with tehran in recent years building a nuclear power plant in iran and last year selling it air defense missiles moscow has also resisted efforts to increase international pressure on iran over concerns about tehrans nuclear ambitions in his remarks yesterday mr putin rejected charges that russia uses energy as a political weapon and he downplayed any price fixing rationale for creating an opec like structure "we do not intend to set up a cartel but i think its right to coordinate our activities " he said "bearing in mind the key goal of absolutely reliable supplies to the main consumers of energy " a previous effort to create an organization of gas exporters fizzled and many are doubtful this one would succeed the gas exporting countries forum which included russia iran and qatar was formed in but hasnt met since "at the moment they havent gotten it together to even meet much less coordinate anything " says jonathan stern director of gas research at the oxford institute for energy studies in britain as for talk by russia and iran of a gas opec he says "im unexcited by it " it isnt known exactly how a gas cartel would operate but opec has been a huge market force for decades for a period in the s opec members set prices for their oil and western countries paid up but oil demand eventually fell because of the high prices in response opec started cutting back output to influence prices and let market forces do the rest that is still the strategy it employs today in recent months alarmed about falling oil prices opec announced production cuts totaling million barrels a day talk of creating a gas cartel appears partly to be an outcome of dissatisfaction among gas suppliers with the emerging international gas market after investing billions of dollars into boosting output over the past five years "its difficult to place all of this gas in the market at a price that theyre comfortable with " says ira joseph executive director of international gas at pira energy a new york based energy consultant the discussion of a cartel he says is "in large part a reflection of that " india and china both growing importers of tankers full of liquefied natural gas have used their huge demand potential as leverage in negotiating long term pricing there is concern among gas suppliers that other asian buyers in particular japanese and korean utilities may seek similar pricing when numerous long term contracts begin to expire in coming years while oil is traded in a global marketplace gas is bought and sold in fragmented markets the u s for instance gets most of its gas from domestic sources as well as canada and trinidad europe gets most of its gas from the north sea russia and exporters from north africa and the middle east russias interest in pooling its gas supply would be unusual given that it never joined opec despite being the worlds second largest oil exporter perhaps because it didnt want to submit to quotas set by other countries it has resisted past calls to curtail output to support prices still mr putin has been working to strengthen moscows ties with other major gas producers after he visited algeria last year gazprom last month reached a series of cooperation agreements with algerias sonatrach europes no supplier european union energy commissioner andris piebalgs called for an explanation from algeria and russia since they could use their share of the european market to potentially fix prices next week mr putin travels to the persian gulf on a trip that will include the first ever visit by a russian leader to qatar which controls the worlds third largest gas reserves iran state television quoted mr khamenei as saying on monday "iran and russia can establish the structure for an organization of gas cooperation like opec as half of the worlds gas reserves are in russia and iran " earlier this week qatari oil minister hamad al attiya said on television that he thought it would be difficult to form a gas producers organization but didnt rule it out he pointed out that most gas supply contracts are typically long term because of lngs up front production costs extending more than years that would undercut any concerted effort to make short term adjustments to production or otherwise influence prices
