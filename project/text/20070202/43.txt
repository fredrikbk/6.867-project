first class will go down with steerage when health care titanic sinks your jan editorial "illegal health care" on the fourth circuit court of appeals ruling in maryland is probably the most persuasive case that could be made for why we need comprehensive health care reform either that or waste millions upon millions of dollars trying to bail faster in this sinking ship the american people are certainly smart enough to find a solution and make sensible decisions about trade offs the huge disparity between what small employers must do and what large employers can do is a dire inequity not to mention a huge drain on our local and national economies it is time to stop introducing divisive legislation and find ways to work together the first class went down with the third when the titanic sank we have the chance to do so much better as a nation i just hope we dont blow it by leaving solutions to partisan politics or stakeholder groups kathleen oconnor founder and ceo codebluenow seattle you argue that the fourth circuit decision concerning marylands "wal mart tax" could "spell trouble" for health reforms recently enacted in massachusetts this position fails to take into account the fundamental difference between marylands legislation which would have required certain employers to spend at least of payroll on employee health care or remit such amount to the state and massachusettss legislation which imposes a &# annual fee per full time employee on employers who do not make a "fair and reasonable" contribution to employee health coverage the fourth circuit essentially found that because no reasonable employer would choose to pay of payroll to the state the maryland law functioned as a mandate to require employers to establish an erisa governed health plan and spend of payroll on such a plan such state mandates are clearly pre empted by erisa the federal law that governs nearly all employee benefit plans the incentive in the massachusetts law however is not significant enough to force employers to make changes to their erisa plans unlike the maryland law the rational action for employers to take in massachusetts would be to pay the &# per employee fee a much less expensive option than making a "fair and reasonable" contribution to employee health coverage because the incentive under the massachusetts law does not function as a mandate the massachusetts law is likely to survive an erisa pre emption challenge amy b monahan associate professor of law university of missouri columbia mo
