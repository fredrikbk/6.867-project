weekend journal hollywood report new flick yada yada yada seinfeld pitches bee movie by mocking it not that im a control freak or anything as a year old jerry seinfeld dreamed of what hed do when he grew up "i fantasized about working at an ad agency and carrying one of those black samsonite briefcases " he says while the new yorker ultimately made his fortune in another career he has always harbored a special interest in advertising so when it came to preparing audiences for the november release of his movie debut "bee movie " the comic decided to take a crack at it himself the result is an unusual two part "teaser trailer" that rips apart his upcoming animated movie about a disgruntled bee taking on new york in the deadpan style that made his "seinfeld" television show a hit it depicts a production in chaos as he and his team attempt to make the movie in live action rather than animation the trailers the second of which airs next week have mr seinfeld struggling to act in a ridiculous bee costume before director steven spielberg comes to the rescue by suggesting it might be easier to make a cartoon instead mr seinfeld who is writing and producing "bee movie " and voicing the lead character barry bee benson says he wanted the previews to cut through the clutter in a crowded hollywood marketplace "whos not tired of the usual trailers with all the excitement loud music and quick cuts " mr seinfeld says "theyre exhausting and annoying " in that way he says attracting attention for his movie is no different than the challenges he faced on tv or in comedy clubs "they all desperately crave a breath of fresh air " he says the year old comedian has pushed the envelope before in the advertising world he co wrote and appeared in a series of high profile commercials for american express including an innovative series of internet ads in dubbed "webisodes " the big budget campaign had him goofing around with an animated superman and jumping off cruise ships "then the money ran out " he jokes "cheap advertising isnt as fun " he found other opportunities though including a european television campaign for mercedes benz for his documentary "comedian " he also co wrote an ad that spoofed traditional movie trailers the "anti trailer" made fun of the dramatic voiceovers common on hollywood movie ads at one point mr seinfeld says he even considered starting his own advertising boutique after his show ended but he got busy instead with his return to stand up "i never got the briefcase but i got to see what the advertising world was like " he says it was the american express campaign that indirectly led to "bee movie " mr seinfeld initially approached fellow east hampton n y resident steven spielberg about directing the webisodes mr spielberg was busy on other projects but the two met for dinner and during a lull in the conversation mr seinfeld says he mentioned an idea for a movie about bees called "bee movie " mr spielberg liked the idea and passed it onto jeffrey katzenberg another co founder of dreamworks skg mr katzenberg had previously approached mr seinfeld about voicing a character in another animated movie but mr seinfeld declined because he wasnt happy playing a role he hadnt written himself now mr katzenberg asked whether mr seinfeld wanted to do an animated film of his own mr seinfeld wrote "bee movie" with a couple of friends from his television days he says he soon found himself involved in the animation as well he spent many hours poring over everything from the design of the costumes to the hand gestures of the characters "its not that im a control freak or anything " he laughs when he went to dreamworks animation with his trailer idea it took some convincing dreamworks animation is a well oiled machine when it comes to marketing its movies and mr seinfelds plan was risky trailers usually involve pulling footage from the film a relatively inexpensive exercise mr seinfelds idea of using live actors required a separate production but grabbing the attention of audiences is tough especially in animation where there has been a flood of movies about furry animals if a movie doesnt take off on its first weekend its often toast studios are therefore under increasing pressure to build buzz in advance of a films release that has made early "teaser" trailers more appealing especially if they can make a splash on the internet dreamworks plans to release both "bee" trailers online and in movie theaters last years comedy "borat " for instance made its mark by releasing four minutes of the movie online before its appearance in theaters within hours people were frantically emailing it to friends matt rosenberg who heads the entertainment practice at interactive ad agency organic says such teaser material has to be strong to make that work "if not its just another ad for a lame movie " he says to help make the trailers mr seinfeld turned to christian charles and gary streiner both of whom worked with him on the american express job he brought in chris rock and other stars whose voices are in the movie for the live action sequences including one where the characters are pelted by powerful hoses and have to dodge giant windshield wipers on an oversize car window "it was terrifying " he laughs "you could have screamed my leg is caught and no one would have heard you " the second trailer depicts more chaos with mr seinfeld wriggling in his ill fitting furry costume and the set falling apart audiences get their first glimpse of the animation in the finale with mr seinfeld morphing into his animated character and performing a number of stunts after mr spielbergs suggestion to make a cartoon instead of a live action movie mr seinfeld says adjusting to movies was tough at first because of the sheer length of the project compared with making a tv show or second ad "by the time you get to minutes youre so tired of everything " he says "coming up with a satisfying third act takes a long time " but animation was appealing for a number of reasons like stand up theres time to polish the material and even go back and reshoot scenes theres also no restriction on where the scenes are set still he says his new movie has the feel of his television show "its dialogue driven and adult in some of the tones it has " he says "there are things for kids too but it feels more like watching an episode of my sitcom " in the film a college educated bee voiced by mr seinfeld becomes disillusioned with his sole career option making honey he takes an adventure outside the hive and finds himself adopted by a new york florist when he discovers that people eat honey he launches a campaign to get justice for bees mr seinfelds co stars include renee zellweger as the florist matthew broderick as his best bee friend and mr rock as a mosquito would he do an animated movie again "absolutely not " he jokes "this has taken four years out of my life my next move will be cutting the engines and coasting on my previous accomplishments " beast movies jerry seinfelds bee movie joins a crowded field studios have released a raft of animated films featuring animal characters over the past year heres how five
