weekend journal taste houses of worship jimmy carters siren song "southern baptists were the first free church movement to start a civilization its called the south " dont you wish you had quipped that but credit goes to duke universitys curtis freeman who says he got it from his colleague stanley hauerwas the noted theologian at any rate that civilization has since been transformed almost beyond recognition and now exists only in fragments one sizable chunk is the southern baptist convention sbc the largest protestant denomination in the u s with a membership exceeding million souls if former president jimmy carter has his way however soon there will be a formidable alternative the sbc has often been in the news in the past few years following the ascendancy of hyperconservatives such as paige patterson currently president of southwestern seminary in fort worth a former theology professor at southwestern recently told the associated press that she had been compelled to leave her job because the bible prohibits women from teaching theology to men no wonder many southern baptists are restless some have started or reinvigorated baptist seminaries that serve as alternatives to the ones dominated by hard liners many have simply minded their own business shaking their heads and doing their best to ignore the diktats of mr patterson and his fellow commissars others including president carter have left the denomination in protest earlier this month mr carter went a step further he announced the formation of a new coalition of "moderate" baptists to counter the sbc image and to change the perception of christians in public life the nice baptists lets call them are to include several historically african american baptist denominations and some smaller baptist groups that are mostly white together amounting to it is claimed more than million members "we hope to emphasize the common commitments that bind us together rather than to concentrate on the divisive issues that separate us " the washington post quoted mr carter as saying "theres too much of an image in the baptist world and among non christians that the main permeating characteristic of christian groups is animosity toward one another and an absence of ability to cooperate in a spirit of brotherhood and sisterhood " at first glance it seems strange to cast this "moderate" baptist initiative which patently seeks to establish a rival to the sbc as a rebuke to divisiveness perhaps mr carter is seeking to deflect charges that the proposed new group will be a vehicle for democratic party politics former president bill clinton also raised a southern baptist did join mr carter at the jan coalition announcement which promised a convention to promote a "new baptist covenant" early in no doubt politics the sbc is a republican stronghold so the nice baptists can be a democratic counterweight is part of the picture yet there is more than that underlying the rhetoric of mr carters proposal whats on display here is a persistent fiction in public discourse a phony account of our common experience first comes an exaggerated emphasis on discord then the promise that at last someone is proposing to transcend division to work for the good of us all you can find this same script for example in bill moyerss manifesto "a new story for america" in the jan nation magazine there we are given "the real political story the one most politicians wont even touch the reality of the anonymous disquieting daily struggle of ordinary people the leaders and thinkers and activists who honestly tell that story and speak passionately of the moral and religious values it puts in play will be the first political generation since the new deal to win power back for the people " really a look at any newscast will remind us that we havent reached the promised land nevertheless americans of every stripe routinely work together for a dazzling array of common goods and while christians all too often fall short of the example set by the one whose life is supposed to be their model still every day and in every city southern baptists and methodists and willow creekers and pentecostals join hands with fellow believers and with those who dont share their faith to feed the hungry to shelter the homeless and to provide disaster relief all over the globe many like my wife volunteer for hospice organizations and spend some of their time each week with the dying none of this means that americans agree across the board on matters of faith and politics or on which team to root for in the super bowl some of our disagreements are trivial many are not but mr carters suggestion that the nice baptists will lead their fellow baptists and by implication the rest of us out of the wilderness is absurd it grossly underestimates the extent to which americans are already looking for common ground and it grossly overestimates the impact of whatever new initiative or candidate is being hailed be it the "new baptist covenant" or "a new story for america" or the charisma of barack obama one of mr carters fellow organizers mercer university president william underwood suggested that the new coalition will address global ills such as the resurgence of malaria and starvation in africa wonderful theres no shortage of work to be done but please spare us the trumpets and zithers
