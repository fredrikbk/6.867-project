why lenovo cant tame u s as shipments drop buyer of ibms pc division shifts marketing lenovo group ltd is trying to prove to the world that it isnt just a chinese company and the fiscal third quarter results it reported yesterday indicate it has a way to go nearly two years after it purchased the personal computer division of international business machines corp for &# billion becoming the worlds third largest pc company by sales lenovo still is struggling to increase its presence in the u s and generate profit outside asia lenovo groups sales in the americas region fell to &# billion from &# billion for the quarter ended dec reflecting the companys continuing effort to turn around the business and maintain its market share "the americas remain a problem " said chief financial officer mary ma "were losing money and were seeing revenue decline " lenovo hopes to improve its fortunes in the u s by revamping its supply chain and increasing marketing efforts lenovos globe spanning business is unusual even in todays increasingly globalized world the companys shares are listed in hong kong but lenovos headquarters is in raleigh n c and its top executives are scattered around the world the company has a chinese chairman and an american chief executive lenovo is owned by the state run chinese academy of sciences but stresses that the academy has no board members and exerts no influence lenovo continues to experience strong growth in its core chinese market where unit shipments rose in the quarter ended dec helping to increase the companys total profit from a year earlier to &# million lenovo holds more than of the pc market in china and made gains on its chief rivals dell inc and hewlett packard co in asian markets lenovos global sales edged up to &# billion lenovos u s operations have been hit by some of the same market dynamics that have hurt dell which said this week it was reinstalling founder and chairman michael dell as chief executive after the company lost its spot as the worlds no pc vendor to hewlett packard mr dell succeeds kevin rollins both dell and lenovo have focused heavily on selling computers to large businesses in the u s which has been the weakest segment of the u s pc business in recent quarters while lenovos chinese business is largely based on selling to consumers through its roughly retail stores the companys u s business has been built around the thinkpad line which it inherited from ibm hewlett packard which attracts more business from consumers and small businesses has been better positioned to exploit the growth areas of the u s market helping it increase its lead over dell and lenovo amid a market slowdown just days before the management shake up at dell lenovo announced a change of its own which many analysts read as a sign that the company was poised to rev up its u s operations last week the company said scott smith an ibm veteran who oversaw lenovos business in north and south america was resigning for personal reasons lenovo has walked a tightrope as it has tried to smoothly integrate the ibm business into its global operation initially the company left many ibm managers in place in an effort to leverage ibms existing relationships with customers and to reassure its u s corporate customers that the quality of the ibm brand wouldnt change because of the takeover but ibms pc business had been unprofitable for years and some analysts say the old ibm leadership wasnt well positioned to turn the business around "the u s is a very challenging market and unfortunately they had the same people running the business " says kirk yang a managing director for citigroup investment research in hong kong "they changed the name but they didnt change the company " the company wouldnt say when it could expect to see a turnaround in its u s business though chief executive bill amelio said the company is nearing a "tipping point" after aggressive cost cutting and a &# million restructuring launched last year "i believe this business is doing all the right things globally with a strong sense of urgency " mr amelio said lenovo says mr smith will stay with the company for another month and rory read senior vice president of operations will take on mr smiths duties on an interim basis despite the companys struggles lenovo is eager to expand into new areas of the u s market including selling directly to consumers last year the company introduced its first lenovo branded computers to the u s market and forged a partnership with retailer best buy co to help with sales lenovo also has launched a series of marketing initiatives in the u s to promote the lenovo brand name including a marketing partnership with the national basketball association and lenovo which has the right to use the ibm thinkpad name until also is adding the lenovo name to thinkpad models to get customers accustomed to its name even as lenovo ramps up its marketing efforts in the u s the company is facing a threat from behind as taiwans acer inc the worlds fourth largest computer seller nips at its heels acer which also is taking on lenovo in emerging markets like china and india has been aggressively pushing into the u s market and has struck deals with major retailers including wal mart stores inc compusa inc and circuit city stores inc
