the morning brief a russian iranian duet in the gas market the wall street journal online ascendant roles for russia and iran have been among the more prominent shifts in the world wide balance of power in recent years and a more overt alliance between the two in the globalizing natural gas market may be in the works russian president putin said yesterday during his annual winter news conference that russia would consider cooperating with iran in a gas version of opec though he stopped short of endorsing cartel like price fixing as the new york times reports he also denied russia has used its own considerable petroleum resources as a political tool russia and iran are the nos and holders of natural gas and mr putin spoke just days after ayatollah ali khamenei the supreme leader of iran called on visiting kremlin officials to work on a coalition of gas producers as the wall street journal notes mr putin also reiterated his opposition to irans development of nuclear weapons as did the office of french president jacques chirac following his flip flop on the issue this week the international herald tribune reports but the russian leader also emphasized the right of iranians to access nuclear technology he also criticized u s ambitions to build part of a missile defense system in eastern europe but said russia has the missiles to thwart such a system anyway and he dismissed the importance of both alexander litvinenko and the former kgb agents poisoning while the prospect of russia and iran joining forces to influence markets "cant be comforting for western countries " as the journal says its the kind of oil industry alliance that hasnt yet developed with gas and might not work as well as opecs collaboration natural gas was difficult to move from region to region for a long time and even comparing global gas prices is difficult because the sources in asia and north america say arent always affected by the same factors still as the journal notes with the growing ability to ship liquefied natural gas the market has become more internationally flexible and u s imports for example have more than doubled since moreover between them russia and iran control about two fifths of global gas reserves and they have individually and at times in concert taken steps that elevated their own political influence at the expense of washington the russian foreign ministry yesterday said it backs an international atomic energy agency idea for a "time out" on u n sanctions over irans enrichment of uranium iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad meanwhile reiterated that u n sanctions wont slow his countrys nuclear program and boasted that iran is rapidly becoming a "superpower " the times reports mr ahmadinejad whose support in irans power structure has diminished in part because of worries he undermines iranian influence abroad said irans strength isnt based on military or economic capability "our power comes from our capability to influence the hearts and souls of people and this scares" the west parsing irans role in iraq iran and syria have been invited by iraq to an international conference in baghdad aimed at promoting support for the iraqi government "on security and other issues " talks that could include the united nations and the arab league but not the u s the los angeles times reports those invitations came as the bush administration wrestles with how to follow up on allegations that iran is supplying materiel deadly technology and other support to iraqi militias that have been used against american forces u s ambassador zalmay khalilzad said days ago that the u s was on the verge of making such evidence public but senior administration officials tell the new york times that president bushs national security advisers ordered a delay apparently for the second time those delays have raised questions about the quality of the intelligence backing the accusations and some administration officials tell the times "there was a continuing debate about how well the information proved the bush administrations case " there is mention of iran in a long awaited national intelligence estimate on iraq that the intelligence community presented to mr bush yesterday but iran isnt a focus of the report the washington post reports the new nie "outlines an increasingly perilous situation in which the united states has little control and there is a strong possibility of further deterioration " sources familiar with the document tell the post it reaches no conclusion on whether iraq is already in a civil war and holds out the possibility of improvement "but it couches glimmers of optimism in deep uncertainty about whether the iraqi leaders will be able to transcend sectarian interests and fight against extremists establish effective national institutions and end rampant corruption " the post says the violence yesterday in iraq included twin suicide bombings at a market in the southern town of hilla which killed at least people and wounded the times reports exxon sets another earnings record exxon mobil earned &# billion last year on revenue of &# billion and as it was widely reported

actually lower than a year earlier and while some u s politicians and industry critics showed what the times described as "predictable" outrage at the numbers the decline in gasoline prices since last summer has sapped some of lawmakers and consumers anger exxons biggest challenger may be "what to do for an encore " the wall street journal notes rising production costs and lower commodity prices may make it difficult to turn into another record year but "for exxon wall street is hoping its reach and breadth will help it continue to draw out new supplies of oil and natural gas and eke out fatter margins than its rivals on its so called downstream business which makes and sells refined products like gasoline " the journal says also of note detroit free press ford motor fell out of the
