weekend journal review tv design for delirium bravos new talent competition reality series "top design" follows a familiar formula wednesdays p m est it began this past wednesday with a group of men and women who are or consider themselves to be gifted interior designers and each week at least one contestant faces elimination by a panel of judges the producers invariably cast a few jerks and nutballs to spice things up or else encourage otherwise decent folks to be rude to each other on camera whenever possible products are plugged in this show with admonitions such as the one telling contestants to place their "pratt and lambert paint order " its too early to say whether "top design" will feature a stunt as arresting as the one on the just concluded season of bravos "top chef " which featured a night of high jinks that culminated with one beefy chef incapacitating a wee colleague in a full nelson and literally wiping the floor with him or whether someone will be kicked off the show for cheating as they were earlier this year on "project runway " so far however "top design" already has a couple of people you love to hate and there are hints of unparalleled cattiness to come the latter began in the first episode when one middle aged male contestant complained of a "queeny" atmosphere he was then teamed up to design a room with a young fellow who explained that when he was a child and "the other kids were outside playing baseball i was inside watching dynasty and commenting on the interiors " one contestant complained because his designated female design partner was an "old lady " ouch we folks who watch these shows love that stuff and identifying with various contestants is what drives the frantic blogging about who won or lost each week and who deserves to get the big prize designer todd oldham who hosts "top design " is almost too kind to the contestants speaking to them in a nursery rhyme voice yet the judges including new yorks jonathan adler and elle decor magazines margaret russell may make up for that "if i lived here" one judge says of a designers space "id shoot myself " no contestant wants to hear that his or her artistic creation looks "like a litter box" or something at "an assisted living facility " but we do and we lap the insults up speaking of litter boxes the shows first winning design after contestants were asked to create a room that would function as a "sanctuary" had no comfortable seating and featured a sandbox floor accented by a big rake and an enormous yellow ceramic pepper if touches like those and lime green walls are your idea of exciting style you may get some good decorating ideas from this show which is full of buzzwords like "minimal" and "eclectic" and as one contestant described his style "stanley kubrick meets funkadelic " as someone who prefers to live among furniture and other items that are more than minutes old i was awed and amused by the general awfulness of it all this week brings two good programs of the mystery and detection sort although one may be hard to locate the most easily accessible is pbss masterpiece theater presentation of "the ruby in the smoke" p m sunday check local listings the time is and the setting is victorian london where a young woman perhaps or so named sally lockhart mourns the recent loss of her father in a ship sinking shes living with a nasty aunt and owns nothing except a pistol her father gave her shes lovely though and can understand accounting and speak hindustani both skills she picked up during a childhood in india where her father was posted with his shipping company soon however sally billie piper discovers that she is at the center of a deadly plot involving a huge ruby that belonged to a maharajah before the indian mutiny of and may now be hidden somewhere in or around london hot on the trail of it is a toothless crone named mrs holland julie walters who will and does happily kill anyone who impedes her search for the gem sallys task and she has no choice but to accept it is to avoid mrs hollands dagger and find the ruby herself the movie is adapted from a book by philip pullman that is the part of a quartet of sally lockhart thrillers the victorian setting is no bar to adventure that will excite modern folk young and old alike the smoke of "ruby in the smoke" comes from opium and the plot takes us through an opium den and its beds of wasted denizens it also features the dastardly machinations of a chinese triad gang more vicious it would seem than the modern mafia best of all through all the thrills and chills what could be scarier than being chased through the streets by a homicidal old lady who wont stop following until youre dead we never see blood flow and dont need to in order to get our kicks along with the doughty sally we confront pirates drug addiction secret codes and even the threat of white slavery on the trail of a glorious gem what could be more fun well there is "rosemary &amp thyme" although it will take some work to find that this engaging british series about a pair of gardening experts who solve crimes on the side just finished a three year run in the u k while a number of pbs stations here are showing it the times and dates vary from city to city some examples follow below a station search for "rosemary and thyme" will be well worth it the action takes place around lovely formal houses and estates in england and on the continent where the two protagonists travel to restore and repair glorious gardens rosemary boxer and laura thyme are middle aged women who met at a rough time in both of their lives after rosemary lost her job as a university botany professor and laura an ex cop was devastated by her husband running off with a poppet theyve found their calling as rescue gardeners however even though their work is interrupted each week by a murder on the grounds which the ladies then solve the whodunit part of the story is always complicated enough to keep us guessing with scads of suspects that range from evil members of the landed gentry to greedy handymen at magnificent country hotels the underlying premise of a dead body in the larkspur or whatever at every location they visit is of course ludicrous yet the friendship between rosemary and barbara despite their individual quirks is believable enough in a series so charming and absorbing that it works like a tonic on a tired mind after a long day in the real world to find it start with your main local pbs station and if that fails move on to other ones in your area in maryland for instance the show is on maryland public television channel saturday from p m san franciscos kcet channel also shows it saturday but from p m in new york try wliw channel from p m tuesdays
