some brokers cant flee past court to rule on what wall street firms show in the u record of ex employees in wachovia securities told securities regulators that it had fired broker joseph esposito for improperly recruiting customers before joining the brokerage firm the information filed on a standard form was entered into a database on brokers employment records maintained by the national association of securities dealers the industrys self regulatory body there was one problem mr esposito had never worked at wachovia the richmond va firm offered him a job but then withdrew the offer after accusing him of improperly soliciting clients it took nearly four years and a costly arbitration process before wachovia a unit of wachovia corp bank agreed to an amendment that removed the accusation and that said the form had been filed by mistake mr espositos experience provides a glimpse into an issue that affects thousands of wall street employees and potentially millions of investors each time a broker trader or investment banker leaves a firm the employer has to file a so called u form to the nasd that explains the reasons for the departure that information is reviewed by the nasds enforcement department and is put into a database that prospective employers can peruse to check brokers backgrounds to see for example if they have been fired for cheating clients the u forms arent available to the public but sometimes information from them including customer complaints ends up in another database that is publicly accessible yet it is very difficult for employees to challenge what is on the form once it is submitted especially in new york the heart of the countrys financial community in several other states court rulings protect firms from defamation lawsuits only if they didnt knowingly or recklessly file something false on the form known as "qualified privilege " in new york some courts have ruled that information on u forms is completely immune to libel claims via an "absolute privilege " this month the new york court of appeals the states top court will hear arguments on whether those rulings should be overturned to make it easier for brokers to dispute what employers say about them it is a hot issue on wall street most disputes about u forms end up in arbitration and arbitrators often follow local laws when deciding cases so it would become even more difficult if not impossible for brokers to win in new york if the top court grants employers absolute protection lawyers for brokers say brokerage firms argue the information on a u form should receive absolute protection because it allows them to provide an unvarnished account of an employees departure without fear of a lawsuit the securities industry and financial markets association wall streets lobby group says without such protection firms "will be inclined to understate the reasons for an employees termination " some employees say firms knowingly put false information on the form either to derail the career of a potential competitor or to deflect attention during an investigation "certain firms are absolutely ethical and wont use the u as a negotiating ploy " says david wechsler a lawyer specializing in employment cases who represented mr esposito but others use the form to "hold employees hostage " mr wechsler said mr esposito now works at another brokerage firm mr wechsler denies his client solicited business in anticipation of moving to wachovia though the firm agreed to remove that accusation from the u form it insisted to arbitrators that it was truthful there is no official count of how many brokers have successfully fought a negative u filing but an analysis by law firm liddle &amp robinson indicates that since arbitrators found more than instances of u forms containing information on brokers in new york and elsewhere that was wrong and in some cases defamatory terminated employees receive copies of their u forms once the form is submitted the "reason for termination" can only be changed through arbitration or a court proceeding when kethe cicconi was fired from the new york branch of mcginn smith &amp co in the firm wrote in his u that he was dismissed for poor performance mr cicconi sued citing defamation both the trial court and an appellate court ruled against his defamation claim relying on a previous ruling that the u was subject to absolute privilege the appellate court ruling came on a vote but mr cicconi received backing from an unexpected source one of the dissenting judges who had voted for the original ruling in favor of an absolute privilege in changed her mind "the cloak of absolute privilege has generated distorted and false filings " wrote justice betty weinberg ellerin of the appellate divisions first department the states top court is scheduled take up the issue feb the case involves a suit by chaskie rosenberg an insurance broker fired by metlife inc the new york insurer which must file u forms on certain insurance agents wrote on mr rosenbergs form that he was "a possible accessory to money laundering violations " he denies the allegation a metlife spokesman declined to comment
