weekend journal taste de gustibus practically dutch in the heart of sin city amsterdam when a belgian politician called the netherlands a "cesspool of sin" in dutch foreign minister ben bot knew that his country could no longer be blase about its libertine reputation not when its southern neighbor usually the subject of many barbed jokes here was laying claim to the moral high ground so mr bot gathered his ambassadors around him and told them to go forth and counter the "foreign press caricatures" of the netherlands thats a tough job when the facts paint a rather bizarre picture holland has legalized prostitution and euthanasia and it tolerates the use of soft drugs the state makes sure that children as young as receive sex education and contraceptives if they want them little wonder that two years after mr bots softer image offensive the stereotype of the average dutchman is still that of a pot smoking dude who visits an underage prostitute just before pulling the plug on his mothers life support machine having recently moved to the capital of this "cesspool " ive seen a very different picture the dutch dont strike me as a bunch of post moral ultra liberal hedonists on the contrary theyre rather ordinary even conservative folks the netherlands is a country where people wash their cars on weekends and lovingly place garden gnomes in their flower beds how immoral or uninhibited can a society be where not one but three christian parties vie for votes and a popular proverb basically the national motto translates as "act normal thats crazy enough " acting "normal" doesnt include indulging in any of the legalized vices either the society that taxes away extreme disparities in wealth also frowns on extreme behavior to unmask the dutch conformist behind that anything goes facade i recently explored amsterdams notorious red light district at night "yeah sure " some readers might be thinking now but let me reassure them and my fiancee that this was a legitimate journalistic assignment penetrating the heart of sin city for evidence of dutch guilt or as it turned out innocence my gaze seriously honey never fell on the women displaying themselves in the windows and focused solely on the other passersby my experience seemed to confirm what locals had repeatedly told me ordinary dutchmen might visit the bars and restaurants in this neighborhood but they are not the ones thronging the narrow alleyways to look for sexual gratification i heard many languages spoken as i strolled the reddish gloom but rarely any dutch and a stray local on the prowl is likely to be as furtive and afraid of public contempt as any upstanding burgher every person i asked for directions turned out to be a tourist in a nearby coffee shop the experience was similar the patrons were almost exclusively foreigners coffee shops for those unfamiliar with the local euphemism may also serve coffee but usually only as a side order to the main course cannabis for the record i neither smoked nor inhaled only dutifully reported also abstaining would seem to be the average dutch citizen so what accounts for the strange existence of rather mainstream moral codes amid centers of lust and psychoactive substances paradoxically while dutch policies might be liberal or libertarian in effect they derive from a fairly paternalistic conservative instinct mixed with a good dose of pragmatism that pragmatism goes back at least to the th century hollands golden era as a great seafaring power in those days the country was a puritan stronghold but even the pious dutch who offered the mayflower pilgrims a temporary home acquiesced to amsterdams emerging red light district early on this nation of world traders concluded that it couldnt stop the worlds oldest commerce yet then as now many of the prostitutes clients were foreigners mostly sailors in the old days mainly tourists today the modern dutch consensus is that making outlaws of prostitutes and soft drug users only pushes them underground and into the hands of real criminals better to control and regulate such behaviors by legalizing or in the case of cannabis tolerating the otherwise objectionable the dutch word for this is gedogen which has no equivalent in english yet roughly means permitting what is officially illegal the dutch hope that this approach will let authorities focus on fighting serious crimes such as the forced prostitution of human trafficking and allow soft drug users to hang out in places where they arent so likely to bump into dealers of more dangerous narcotics like heroin the added bonus this is still a nation of traders after all is that once brothels and marijuana cafes are legal you can tax their profits practicality is sometimes taken for licentiousness yet the dutch dont offer sex education and contraception at an early age as part of a social experiment to promote or condone teenage sex they are simply attempting to regulate the inevitable or at least whats believed to be inevitable the euthanasia law is in another category altogether since it grew out of a conviction that it is morally right to allow patients to end their own suffering but here too the dutch also saw a need to be realistic by codifying and regulating what was already taking place in hospitals and homes without rules and supervision some statistics seem to show that the dutch are onto something with their approach to the baser human desires the netherlands has one of the lowest drug related death rates in the industrialized world and far fewer abortions or teen pregnancies than in comparable western societies and where gedogen doesnt seem to work the dutch are willing to stop looking the other way for a minute and fine tune their policies late last year amsterdam authorities began legal proceedings they hope will close down about of the windows in the red light district where owners are suspected of using the sex business as a cover for money laundering on closer inspection it turns out that a lot of the finger waggers and other outside critics are mistaken the netherlands isnt so much a cesspool of sin as it is a well of pragmatism even if it must be said that pragmatism attracts a whole lot of sinners mr schwammenthal is an editorial writer for the wall street journal europe see related letters "letters to the editor slippery legal situation in
