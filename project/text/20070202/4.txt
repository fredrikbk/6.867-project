bombing in paris barring a surprise jacques chiracs year run in politics is likely to end later this year when the french elect a new leader theyre certainly going to miss him in tehran the french president gave a fitting valedictory in an interview published yesterday in the new york times international herald tribune and le nouvel observateur speaking monday mr chirac reversed years of public rhetoric by proclaiming himself indifferent to a nuclear armed iran "having one atomic bomb maybe a second one a little later well thats not very dangerous " mr chirac said "where will iran drop it this bomb on israel it would not have gone meters into the atmosphere before tehran would be razed to the ground " his aides quickly realized their man had committed the gaffe of saying what everyone thought he really believed and so left out those passages from an official interview transcript the journalists also got a return call from the president on tuesday in which he noted that "i should have paid better attention to what i was saying and understood that perhaps i was on the record " we can guess they needed no such clarification in tehran on or off the record mr chirac was merely confirming what the mullahs have long believed which is that the europeans simply arent serious about preventing them from going nuclear monsieur le presidents version of mutual assured nuclear destruction could also stand some parsing he seems to think that tehran would never launch an attack for fear it would be annihilated in return but assuming israel were destroyed first what other country would risk a counterattack itself by nuking millions of iranian civilians to avenge israel france the same country that wouldnt even let u s jets fly over its territory to drop a few conventional bombs on libya we doubt many israelis will share mr chiracs faith in nuclear deterrence against islamists who prize martyrdom mr chirac wont make public his political intentions before march but in one recent poll only of the french want him on the ballot again privately chirac aides believe that only a foreign policy crisis say over iran could revive his political career his remarks this week make it more likely that iran will become a crisis but at least we can hope he wont be around to make it any worse
