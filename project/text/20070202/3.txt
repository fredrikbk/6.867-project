between state and revolution "mizanan ya na " will they hit or not in tehran these days this question is the talk of the town the "they" is seldom spelled out yet everyone knows that it refers to the united states the question is wreaking havoc on irans fragile economy by fomenting an atmosphere of uncertainty even before the sanctions imposed by the u n security council start to bite many in tehran expect the security council to decree even tougher sanctions in march when the ultimatum for the islamic republic to halt its uranium enrichment program will end the khomeinist leadership is divided over the reality of the threat and over ways of dealing with it president mahmoud ahmadinejad claims that the u s is in no position to do much damage and counts on the new democratic majority in washington he calls them "the wise people" to restrain george w bush the bulk of the khomeinist leadership including the "supreme guide" ali khamenei however take the threat seriously and are preparing public opinion for a climb down by the islamic republic the american naval build up in the persian gulf the new u s offensive against irans agents and armed clients in iraq tehrans failure to seize power in beirut through its hezbollah proxy and plummeting oil prices are all cited by ayatollah khameneis entourage as reasons why a climb down might be necessary sometime in the next few weeks iran is likely to offer a "compromise formula" under which it would suspend its enrichment program as demanded by the security council in exchange for a suspension of sanctions this will be accompanied by noises from tehran about readiness to help the u s in iraq plus possible concessions in lebanon and over the palestine israel issue the expected climb down is sure to bring back the baker hamilton "realists" with fresh calls for offering the mullahs a seat at the high table it would also prompt the guilt ridden "idealists " who blame the u s for whatever goes wrong in the world to urge "bush the warmonger" to engage the islamic republic in a constructive dialogue whatever that might mean the french and the russians would applaud the mullahs and urge the americans to be "reasonable " so what should the bush administration do when and if the mullahs unveil their compromise formula first is to see the mullahs move as deja vu all over again each time the mullahs are in trouble they become the essence of sweet reasonableness they deploy their traditional tactics of taqiyah obfuscation kitman dissimulation and ehtiat caution to confuse the "infidels" and divide their ranks the iranian leadership did this in the early days of the khomeinist revolution in by persuading the clueless jimmy carter that the ayatollah was the only force capable of preventing iran from falling into communist hands in and they seduced the reagan administration with an offer of releasing the american hostages in beirut in exchange for the secret u s arms deliveries iran needed to stop the iraqi advance in they stopped their attacks on kuwaiti oil tankers in the persian gulf after an american task force sunk the revolutionary guards navy in a hour battle in fear of an even bigger u s military attack persuaded ayatollah khomeini to "drink the cup of poison" by agreeing to end his eight year war with iraq in the mullahs offered a "grand bargain" to the clinton administration as a means of averting u s retaliation for the iranian sponsored killing of american soldiers in an attack in khobar saudi arabia the second point to bear in mind is that a suspension of uranium enrichment will cost the islamic republic nothing iran does not have any nuclear power plants and thus does not need enriched uranium anyway even if the country does not have secret parallel nuclear facilities it could always resume weapons making activities once it is no longer under pressure successive u s administrations have assumed that the problem with the khomeinist regime lies in its behavior which they hoped to modify through traditional carrot and stick diplomacy the problem with the regime however is its nature its totalitarian ambitions and messianic claims being an enemy of the u s indeed of all democracies is in its political dna a scorpion stings because it is programmed by nature to do so a regime that is the enemy of its own people cannot be a friend of others the threat that khomeinism poses to stability in the middle east and beyond it to international peace will not be removed until iran once again becomes a normal nation state with the interests and ambitions of normal nation states for more than a quarter of a century iran has suffered from an affliction faced by most countries that experience revolution the conflict between state and revolution makes the development and practice of moderate domestic and foreign policies difficult if not impossible leading a revolution is like riding a bicycle one keeps going for as long as one continues to pedal regardless of the destination to stop pedaling means to fall as a nation state iran may be a rival and competitor for other nations but it would not be an existential threat as a revolution however iran can indeed must be such a threat not only to its neighbors but also to a world that it regards as "the handiwork of jews and crusaders " the khomeinist revolution has not succeeded in destroying the plurimillennial idea of iran as a nation state but each time the khomeinist revolution found itself on the defensive the western powers including the u s helped it restore its legitimacy and regain its breath the same illusions that produced the detente which arguably prolonged the life of the soviet union have also helped the khomeinist revolution survive long after its sell by date today iran is once again facing the schizophrenia imposed on it through the conflict between state and revolution a majority of iranians including many in the ruling elite wish iran to re emerge as a nation state the u s has no interest in helping the khomeinist revolution escape the consequences of its misdeeds this does not mean that there should be no diplomatic contact with tehran or that pressure should be exerted for the sake of it nor does it mean that military action "to hit or not to hit " is the only question worth pondering with regard to the islamic republic no one should be duped by a tactical retreat in tehran or a temporary modification of the regimes behavior what is needed is a change in the nature of the regime the chances of setting such change in motion have never been as good and the current showdown should be used to communicate a clear message as a nation state iran can and will be a friend as a revolution it would always remain a foe mr taheri is author of
