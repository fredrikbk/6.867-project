bush senate allies to seek iraq benchmarks washington trying to stem defections over iraq president bushs senate allies want a vote next week calling on the baghdad government to "make visible concrete progress" toward political military and economic benchmarks the resolution announced at a hastily called press conference late yesterday is designed to slow the momentum behind a tougher iraq measure crafted by sen john warner r va the former chairman of the senate armed services committee sen joseph lieberman the connecticut independent who usually caucuses with democrats is among the sponsors but the support comes overwhelmingly from republicans led by sen john mccain r ariz as recently as wednesday mr mccains office had expected no announcement of an alternative iraq measure so soon but with the warner proposal becoming a serious threat waiting until next week was no longer feasible "we want to make sure that its out there " mr mccain said the senate floor debate due to begin monday reflects broad discomfort in both parties over mr bushs plan to increase u s troop levels in iraq by chiefly to quell sectarian violence in baghdad army gen george casey the departing top commander in iraq told a senate panel yesterday that he had initially requested about half that number before the president adopted a more ambitious approach at the same time a new report by the congressional budget office says the number could be higher than once additional support personnel are counted by the cbos estimate the full commitment could run as high as troops costing &# billion to &# billion depending on whether the peak deployment lasts four months or months but the pentagon and congressional staff familiar with the militarys request disputed the cbos analysis and said the total included support staff to complement those already on the ground in iraq sen mccain has criticized gen casey who is now being succeeded in iraq by gen david petraeus for not being more aggressive in waging the war and seeking more u s troops but his own resolution reflects the conflict that gen casey described in his testimony how to balance the u s military might with the need to prod the iraqi forces to take more of the lead first among mr mccains benchmarks is a major commitment of "new iraqi security forces to partner" with the larger number of u s troops other requirements include "disarming individual militias as circumstances warrant " distributing oil resources and building an independent judiciary the resolution doesnt spell out what options the u s should pursue if prime minister nouri al maliki fails to meet the benchmarks and a recent meeting in baghdad between a house delegation and iraqi officials including mr maliki showed the limits of congresss power to pressure the iraqi government rep john murtha d pa chairman of the house appropriations panel that oversees funding for iraq said he warned that unless more progress was made congress would be reluctant to fund new equipment for the iraqi forces mr murtha and others in the delegation said the iraqi reply was that the maliki government would then secure it elsewhere "i was stunned " mr murtha said a handful of liberal democrats notably sens russell feingold of wisconsin and christopher dodd of connecticut announced their opposition to the warner language yesterday as too weak in its opposition to the administrations policy but at this stage the virginian has a strong chance of commanding a solid majority in the senate even among the republicans reluctant to join him there is little contentment with the direction of the war sen judd gregg r n h an ally of the white house had surprised many this week when he said he was "considering" supporting the warner language mr gregg said yesterday he had decided not to vote for the measure concerned that the debate is more "a political exercise than a substantive exercise" and that he didnt want to be part of a public rebuke of the president but mr gregg said he continues to have "serious reservations" about the administrations policy see related letter "letters to the editor bravery resolution by iraqs leaders" wsj feb
