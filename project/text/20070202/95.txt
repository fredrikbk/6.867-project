the afternoon report rough draft a sorry reading on january hiring seemed anything but the ideal way to end a week of winning economic reports but optimists can take heart the headline appears to be written in pencil goldilocks has had a good run first there was the news that the economy grew at a brisk clip during the fourth quarter after a less than stellar six month stretch moreover even as the expansion found its second wind inflation remained on its best behavior the federal reserve said it would keep a close watch that prices didnt race out of control but made clear no tinkering with interest rates was imminent the only cause for concern appeared to be a flimsy reading on manufacturing but factories have been stumbling along for some time without doing much damage to the rest of the economy the picture as a whole looked just right as that popular fairy tale blonde would have it but then this morning another fly buzzed into the porridge the labor department said that employers added jobs to nonfarm payrolls during january a small gain thats not of the type normally associated with a well balanced expansion adding another dash of stringent flavor the unemployment rate snuck up to at first glance that might have put even the sunniest optimist off her breakfast but some digging showed that the report may not have been near as bad as it looked as has been the case for several months running revisions to previous reports made the job market appear much stronger than the top line suggests when viewed in isolation the governments number crunchers found jobs that theyd missed on their last count of november and december meaning that even though januarys numbers appeared to be wobbly they were nonetheless built on a solid foundation joshua shapiro chief u s economist at mfr inc wrote that the headline result "should be viewed alongside the very strong gains that preceded it and we seriously doubt that it represents anything more than a blip in what looks to be a quite robust labor market " economists at morgan stanley granted the new data was "certainly a disappointment" but said one soggy month simply isnt enough to soak "a relatively tight labor market showing some modest acceleration in wage pressures " the revisions werent the only element making januarys report a difficult read weather also helped to gum up the works as topsy turvy temperatures around much of the country injected more than a little turmoil into the economy for example builders in the balmy northeast kicked lots of new projects into gear but some economists think that strength has merely been borrowed from spring and that as the months wear on activity will even out meanwhile snowstorms in other corners of the country helped grind business to a halt morgan stanley noted that people told labor department surveyors that they werent at the office or the construction site during january due to gnarly weather about north of the january average since with all that washing through the data the only real certainty appears to be that yesterdays jobs numbers will be easier to understand tomorrow stocks mixed after jobs data the employment report left stocks
