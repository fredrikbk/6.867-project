economists react jobs report is a perfect picture of a soft landing economist says the jobs added to nonfarm payrolls in january fell short of the economists had expected but upward revisions to november and december to and respectively were encouraging the unemployment rate ticked up to and wage growth slowed suggesting a favorable mix of economic growth and low inflation at the start of following are some economists reactions the bls annual benchmark revisions added a whopping additional jobs that were somehow missed in their initial estimates of u s employment growth that shocking upward revision translates into of total employment growth in the u s in madeline schnapp trimtabs investment research our primary interest is in the sub groups that affect the staffing stocks primarily the temporary help numbers and here the news is starting to look good much has been said about the november and december numbers posting year to year declines but the reality is that the staffing numbers were generally flat throughout the exception was december when the numbers were up from the average in january the numbers were up these are not big gains and only represent two months but if we are going through a soft landing the gains could represent the beginnings of a recovery ty govatos cl king the january employment report paints a perfect picture of the u s economy and labor markets making a "soft landing " stuart hoffman pnc financial services group when is disappointing not necessarily disappointing when you are working with government data take the employment report january payroll gains were less than expected and the unemployment rate actually rose so has the economy hit a soft spot not necessarily yes businesses were not in the greatest hiring mood last month but the bureau of labor statistics revised the numbers and the upward revisions were huge for the fed this just adds to the belief that the economy is in decent shape and nothing needs to be done until inflation decelerates into their desired range joel naroff naroff economic advisors most of the data in the household survey are consistent with a strong labor market but there are a few signs of deterioration the percentage of unemployment attributable to workers voluntarily quitting their jobs a measure of workers confidence in the economy fell to from a cyclical peak of in may the number of workers who report being discouraged over their job prospects is up from year ago levels and the unemployment rate for black teens has drifted up to dean baker center for economic and policy research this report appears to be severely distorted due to the good weather in the northeast during the survey and bad weather in other parts of the country the first boosted construction employment due to good weather in the northeast while the second may have boosted the unemployment rate lowered the average workweek and may have restrained earnings growth nevertheless the sharp decline in the number of people voluntarily leaving their jobs does suggest some level of weakness in this report but we wont know the extent of the actual strength or weakness in this report until next month drew matus lehman brothers global economics one soft month is not a trend but this report is much easier to square with the claims ism and help wanted reports than earlier stronger data finally note the modest rise in wages rising but not surging overall weak but a run of reports like this is needed to move the fed ian shepherdson high frequency economics moderating employment growth in january indicates gdp growth is slowing from its robust fourth quarter pace gdp growth should be less than three percent in the first quarter of peter morici university of maryland relative to december softness in january was concentrated in the private service sector which saw a k advance down from +k the fact that the shortfall was in services which is not where a sudden economic slump would manifest itself lends further support to the notion that the january report was more of an aberration than anything else joshua shapiro mfr inc the persistent pattern of sizeable upward revisions to prior months employment gains begs the questions as to just how soft the employment gain in january truly was the initially reported payroll increases have been revised higher for eight consecutive months from a phillips curve perspective this report slightly lessens labor market concerns by showing a little more slack and a marginally slower increase in average hourly earnings however these readings on unemployment and wages are well within the monthly volatility of the data and cannot be judged to be significant at this point john ryding bear stearns u s economics this report was certainly a disappointment but it does not really alter the underlying picture of a relatively tight labor market showing some modest acceleration in wage pressures moreover while income growth and factory output appear to have stagnated in january bad weather and other temporary factors such as a downtick in vehicle assemblies played a role we expect to see some improvement in the employment
