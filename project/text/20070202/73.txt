politics &amp economics how lebanons army could hold key to peace amid political crisis protests the troops may be last institution that can prevent a civil war beirut lebanon for almost six months lebanese army soldiers have helped control one of the worlds most volatile flashpoints patrolling near lebanons mile border with israel now its troops are shouldering an even more urgent and in many ways more difficult task standing between fellow citizens from rival groups on the same beirut streets where the civil war that still haunts lebanon raged two decades ago the job is severely testing what may be the last lebanese institution that still holds public confidence and perhaps the only one keeping the deeply fractured society intact yet without a quick settlement to the political crisis that has paralyzed the government since november current and former army leaders warn street violence like last weeks could spiral beyond the militarys ability to contain it "the unity of the army is the only thing that keeps this country from meeting the definition of a failed state " says elias hanna a retired general in the lebanese army and a strategic analyst about soldiers have been patrolling the capital since december that is when government opponents led by hezbollah the shiite muslim political social and militia group flooded downtown beirut in an effort to topple the u s backed government they contend it lacks constitutional legitimacy given the resignations of six ministers including five shiites in november tensions peaked last week when hezbollah called a general strike and its supporters burned tires and blocked roads to beiruts airport although some members of the current government wanted the army to break through the barricades commanders decided to let the protests play out hoping they would relieve pressure according to current and former senior officers by jan the wisdom of that strategy was clouded by doubt as a cafeteria brawl between shiite and sunni muslims at a beirut university spilled into the streets ensuing violence spread leaving four dead and about wounded clashes flared across the city and beyond in scenes reminiscent of lebanons civil war complete with rooftop snipers about soldiers including three officers were among the wounded according to a senior commander who isnt authorized to speak officially with perhaps one exception soldiers helped contain the violence by not returning fire they were under strict orders to avoid actions that could cause the fighting to escalate the senior commander said in the days that followed last weeks clashes all sides seemed to breathe easier many fear the calm is temporary they say the armys ability to maintain order cant last forever making a political resolution urgent nizar abdel kader a retired senior army general and others close to the current army leadership say senior officers warned rival political factions last week that soldiers couldnt keep the peace on beiruts sidewalks forever "the tension was raised to a degree where it is now too risky to believe that the army can continue with the same effectiveness in quelling these clashes " says mr abdel kader who is a columnist for the lebanese arabic language newspaper ad diar since last weeks violence the armys efforts on beiruts streets seem to be most intense after sunset soldiers man mobile checkpoints often stopping each passing car some are waved through quickly while others are closely screened to be certain they arent ferrying armed men another echo of lebanons past in the tent city near martyrs square where government opponents have camped for weeks protesters are nervous about who may be plotting against them but thankful for the presence of soldiers throughout the city "we will lift our hats and bow in front of them " says mohammad kawar a year old cab driver and hezbollah supporter the groups leader hassan nasrallah has pledged that his followers wont push lebanon into civil war even if of them are killed if street violence does resume there are other factors that could make it difficult for the army to minimize the soldiers in beirut include members of special forces and "intervention" units men trained to respond aggressively to any threat members of lebanons internal security force who are better prepared for a mission of this type remained in their barracks last week their participation might prove combustible since their leaders are viewed by some as being too close to the government the soldiers also are drawn from the same ethnic and religious groups now in conflict "the army reflects the fabric of this society " gen hanna says he and others also note that the integration since the early s of each unit sunnis shiites christians and others serve side by side is a major benefit the entire man force also has endured the physical stress of a high alert for months since the summer war between israel and hezbollah and under the united nations security council resolution that ended that conflict the lebanese army in tandem with a beefed up u n force is responsible for patrolling hezbollahs stronghold in the south to deter renewed fighting mr abdel kader says the beirut mission is the most physically psychologically and emotionally draining for any soldier "after all " he says "you are facing your own people "
