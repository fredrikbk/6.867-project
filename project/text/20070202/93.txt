style &amp substance you should be so average male models get a new look as fashion targets regular guys theres a new look in mens fashion and it doesnt have anything to do with the clothes some menswear designers and fashion magazines are starting to choose male models who look more like "regular" guys its all part of an attempt by the mens fashion industry to broaden its appeal for years the runways and fashion magazines have been dominated by male models who are either super thin and boyish looking overly muscular or immaculately groomed metrosexuals these looks were intended to appeal to the fashion press trend setting gay men and sometimes women who were buying clothes for the men in their lives for many guys however the reaction was "thats not me " now with more men than ever before doing their own clothes shopping some designers see an opportunity "were not just designing for a small specialty audience were designing for guys in illinois " says john crocco creative director for menswear at perry ellis a division of perry ellis international inc which holds its fall runway show today at new york fashion week "we have to be realistic this is a business " of course the fashion worlds idea of "average" is far removed from the real worlds at a recent casting call for todays show of duckie brown menswear the search for a more natural look meant guys who looked too manicured too heroin chic thin or too buff and tanned were shown the door john bartlett another designer whose show kicks off new yorks fashion week today says he deliberately sought "clean cut dudes but with a more rugged feel than normal " it was the same story at milans mens fashion week in january where observers say some trend setting designers also changed their looks dolce &amp gabbana sent fit classically good looking male models down the runways instead of the intimidating muscular hunks and impossibly thin young things of shows past ultra trendy dsquared and versace also went for a similar role model some in the industry note the emerging attitude on male models parallels the debate over dangerously thin female models and is tied into a fashion cycle thats starting to emphasize healthy beauty "fashion over the next two years is going to have to move on since what was cutting edge in the s has now become very dull " says david wolfe creative director at new york based fashion consultancy doneger group but there are business reasons as well "designers are clearly more conscious that their consumer is a very very broad spectrum of male " says sean patterson president of the wilhelmina models agency who notes that more heterosexual men in particular are taking an interest in dressing well more regular looking models can help tone down edgier styles and make them more appealing to these guys he adds "its about being more in touch with men having models that look interesting and not too perfect " says jason kanner director of the mens division at the major model management agency that said some labels such as dior homme and prada continue to employ the androgynous thin male models that are practically a trademark for them and the fashion industrys take on "regular" guys is still a striking look the models are still mostly in their s and while perhaps fit and toned like any regular gym goers their faces stand out in a crowd terron wood a foot pound model who is held up as an example of the new style male model by his agency major model management says he has been told he looks like a cross between richard gere and tom cruise the year old began modeling last year in january he won coveted spots in the dolce &amp gabbana valentino and bottega veneta shows in milan in new york hes appearing in shows for perry ellis and john varvatos tom julian director of trends at ad agency mccann erickson credits celebrities like actor ashton kutcher a former model himself and tv shows like "entourage" and "greys anatomy" with showing men that guys can be stylish without being too muscular too thin or too manicured "chiseled without being too pretty" is how mr julian describes the new look that suits men like richard frank a year old advertising executive in baltimore who says hes interested in what actors like george clooney are wearing but ignores runway shows and fashion ads because the models are "alien to me " designers he says should use "more normal looking men as models not overweight or unattractive men exactly but guys who are more representative of the look i think most men are all going for " the shift comes as men are buying more designer clothes for themselves retailers have been actively trying to lure in male shoppers bringing in new styles more frequently and holding events such as men only shopping evenings at the same time a shift away from women doing the shopping for men has helped drive the trend last year of men bought their own clothes compared with in according to marshal cohen chief industry analyst with market researcher npd group at middle of the road j c penney men now make of the purchases of mens clothes a reversal from about five years ago when women made of the purchases that means nowadays the model can make or break a buying decision for male shoppers "if you have a model that looks more normal it can bring fashion closer to the average guy " says tommaso de nardo a year old stockbroker in new york "that would probably encourage me to get that product over another product "
