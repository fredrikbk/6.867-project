weekend journal the wealth report death certain taxes not so much bushs cuts cant explain fall in estate tax haul have rich stopped dying amid an explosion of american millionaires the irs has released a surprising statistic the number of u s citizens who filed returns stating they owe estate tax fell to in down by more than one third from during the past decade the internal revenue service estimates the number of estates slated to pay the tax has fallen by more than much of the drop was expected after the bush administration tax cuts of which gradually raised the minimum wealth level required to trigger the tax to the current &# million from &# many estates that used to be subject to the tax now fall below the threshold by the threshold will be &# million most of the estates that once paid the tax were valued at &# million or less yet the rising exemption doesnt explain the entire drop the other forces behind the decline in estate taxes levies on the assets of wealthy deceased citizens that the republicans call the "death tax" and democrats have dubbed the "paris hilton tax" could have important implications for both policy makers and wealthy families between and the number of millionaire households in the u s more than doubled according to the federal reserve there are now nine million households in the u s with a net worth of &# million or more including the value of their primary residence the number of households worth &# million &# million and &# million has also more than doubled so the huge increase in the millionaire population especially at the high end should be showing up in the estate tax payments but it isnt total collections from estates valued at &# million or more fell to &# billion in from &# billion in the top estate tax rate fell to from during the past five years but some economists say that doesnt explain the estate tax decline for these megaestates edward wolff an economics professor at new york university believes the drop is due in part to what the wealth management industry refers to as "tax efficient estate planning " in other words the wealthy and their sophisticated accountants and trust and estate lawyers are getting better at finding legal ways around the tax in the s mr wolff did a study of estate tax returns and compared it with his own "simulated estate tax collection " which he created by applying typical mortality rates to the millionaire population as counted by the federal reserve his finding more than half of the estates that his model predicted should have paid an estate tax hadnt in for instance estates paid estate taxes compared with that should have paid according to his simulation the irs collected &# billion from the estate tax in his analysis showed it should have collected &# billion the irs declined to comment about the study while mr wolff hasnt run the numbers for more recent years he says the basic finding that the wealthy often avoid the tax likely still applies "people can undervalue their assets for tax purposes or find other loopholes " he says "the estate tax policy leaks like a sieve " the business of finding those loopholes is thriving while tax planning for the wealthy has been lucrative for years it has accelerated with the recent advent of complex trust structures family limited partnerships grantor trusts various investment products hybrid life insurance policies and charitable giving vehicles the tax strategy business has become an important component of the wealth management business david handler a trust and estate attorney with kirkland &amp ellis in chicago believes that most of the drop in estate taxes is because of the rising wealth threshold but he says more sophisticated tax advice has also helped reduce total collections "the investment firms have really put estate planning on the front burner " says mr handler "people in my business are always coming up with new structures and adding all sort of technical tweaks " there may be a second less visible reason for the drop in estate taxes the rich are getting younger the year old google guys twenty something founders of youtube billionaire hedge fund partners who are in their s and top executives who can earn tens of millions in annual pay long before they retire are all part of what economists and sociologists believe is the youngest generation of wealth ever therefore they arent dying as fast as the overall population or generating estate taxes finally there may also be a more benevolent reason that fewer of todays big estates are paying up philanthropy has caught on big among the wealthy in recent years inspired by givers like bill gates and warren buffett many of todays top givers may be deciding to leave more money to charity and less to their kids and the government the total charitable deductions from estate tax returns in was &# billion up from &# billion in the irs says among those who were required to pay an estate tax the jump in charitable deductions was even higher to &# billion in from &# billion in
