weekend journal tastings for valentines day think pink as sales bubble we try rose champagne a heartfelt choice this year you have the chance to show your valentine that you are both romantic and hip heres the key rose champagne weve been recommending rose champagne to lovers for years because its blushing color and complex demure tastes are so very romantic suddenly rose champagne has become very trendy world wide exports of rose champagne more than doubled from to according to the office of champagne usa to a new high imports of rose champagne into the u s also hit a record last year in of all champagne imported into the u s was rose up from in numbers from acnielsen are even more striking sales of rose champagne rose by volume for the week period ending on nov while sales of all rose sparkling wines rose by an even greater percentage by volume in the same period to be sure there are many other fine wines for valentines day when its right theres no more romantic wine than red burgundy american pinot noir is a good bet too for the same reasons it can be silky with some sexy earthiness and theres always saint amour from one of the villages of beaujolais the history of the name has nothing to do with love but that will be our secret but there is something very special about rose champagne the real thing from the champagne district of france and heres good news the surge in interest in pink bubbly has led to more rose champagnes on shelves at better prices when we first wrote about these wines eight years ago they were generally rare and precious our best of tasting both in and in was louis roederer cristal rose which then cost about &# in fact most of our favorites were quite expensive the big exception was pommery which then cost &# or less and was good enough to go bubble to bubble with the big boys when we went shopping for rose champagnes this year we were surprised and pleased to find a far larger selection in fact there were so many that for the first time we were able to conduct an entire tasting of roses that cost less than &# this eliminated some excellent pinks such as the cristal and veuve clicquot la grande dame but it still left us with plenty while there are thousands of small champagne producers and many of them make a pink bubbly we generally stuck to the names youre most likely to see such as piper heidsieck and moet we did include just a few small production wines such as camille saves whose regular champagne is a long time favorite for this tasting we included only real champagne which always makes a special statement for valentines day though more good pink bubblies are being made all over the world including california while most still rose wines are made by leaving the juice in contact with the red grape skins for a short time most rose champagne is made by adding a little bit of red wine pinot noir to the cuvee the colors run the gamut from light blush to red because rose champagne has a little more taste and body than regular champagne but the same mineral acidic intensity its nicely complex and interesting and tends to pair well with food especially romantic dinners of course we have returned from our blind tasting with good news the average quality of the wines was excellent less than of all champagne is rose and its clear that winemakers make it with a great deal of care most of the wines were quite good with beautiful bubbles lovely color and mouth watering acidity not only that but the average price of our seven favorites was around &# which is a real bargain considering the price of a dozen roses these days our old favorite pommery by the way was good but not among our favorites it now costs around &# we also wish it had a bit more color while we tend to prefer rose champagne with more of a blush than a true red color this was far too pale as a valentines day choice especially since it costs about more than regular pommery our first bottle was so light colored that we bought a second thinking perhaps there was some kind of labeling mistake but the second had the same faint tint our best of tasting really put it all together it was elegant and romantic smooth yet intense with well integrated pure tastes and a lovely long tasting finish darn if it didnt turn out to be louis roederer again this time the vintage rose which costs just a fraction of the cristals price with rose champagne all the rage dont wait until the last minute to pick up a bottle get one today and start planning your valentines day around it this is a wine that we promise really is good
