costume change for u s fashion firms a global makeover tommy hilfiger finds assimilating in europe requires a new look dusseldorf germany facing flat demand in u s stores american clothing marketers are venturing into unfamiliar terrain overseas and often finding they have to change how they do business in downtown dusseldorf a boutique called hilfiger denim displays clothing that most americans would never associate with the preppy red white and blue tommy hilfiger brand the upscale loft like space one of hilfiger denim stores in europe is a new concept catering specifically to european tastes unlike hilfigers traditional u s stores with their white walls and brightly lit interiors this store has dark stained wood floors and mink gray walls mens shirts made from high quality cotton are designed to suit german mens preference for woven shirts retailing for the equivalent of &# far more than the shirts hilfiger sells in the u s to compete with european premium jeans brands like diesel replay and g star hilfiger features slim fitting jeans hanging on butchers meat hooks priced at &# three times as much as the once popular baggy tommy jeans formerly sold in american department stores the moves by tommy hilfiger corp spotlight a trend playing out across the u s apparel industry as designers and clothing makers focus on expanding their sales to europe and asia hilfiger has been in the forefront of american designer efforts to break into international markets at new york fashion week which begins today hilfiger is returning after a two year absence with a lavish runway show featuring some of its european designed clothes "it is not enough being in u s department stores only to sit in a sea of private label and lots of markdowns and sales " says year old tommy hilfiger creative director of the brand "we still view the u s as an important region but it may not be as important as europe and asia because of the growth opportunities there " while american soft drinks and fast food are ubiquitous around the globe american apparel makers have had less success selling overseas they have long contracted with factories in asia and elsewhere to manufacture their clothes but until the late s they relied for sales growth on the big u s retail market with more than department stores and other specialty chains those that did venture abroad from nautica to the gap since the s encountered fragmented and highly regulated markets that had unique tastes sizes and distribution networks european consumers who regard paris as the birthplace of couture and revere italy for its heritage of fine fabrics and footwear have snubbed american designers of upscale fashion "most american brands tend to take every strategy used in their home market products pricing marketing and apply it in the same way" overseas says karl heinz salzburger vf corp s president of europe middle east africa and asia now pressure is growing on u s apparel makers to try harder overseas the u s clothing market has grown less than annually in recent years retail chains are consolidating it has become impossible for a fashion house to dominate the u s retail market the way hilfiger once did in the early s when it was carried in department stores and more than discount outlets across the country todays big chains such as federated department stores inc and kohls corp focus a third or more of their merchandise on their own private labels or exclusive brands that are not sold in other stores "you become vulnerable if you are just going to operate in the u s marketplace " says fred gehring who headed tommy hilfigers european operations before becoming chief executive of the whole company last year hilfigers growing international operations have helped stabilize the company as it turns around troubled u s operations under the ownership of private equity firm apax partners last year vf reintroduced its nautica mens sportswear brand in europe for a third time after two failed attempts before vf bought the label it has also boosted international sales of its north face line of outerwear to about half of total sales in part by adapting to local tastes europeans like orange coats and a more body conscious fit says mr salzburger new york based diane von furstenberg studio expects to boost its international sales to of the total from currently says president paula sutter thats already well above the level for most u s apparel makers margins in europe can be to higher than at u s department stores says fernando silva a principal at apparel consulting firm kurt salmon associates hilfiger began its push into europe in and took some hard knocks mr hilfiger then at the height of his popularity in america stormed into london in with a new store on bond street and a gala featuring celebrities such as model kate moss and actress goldie hawn the hilfiger organization "gave into the demand" from retailers eager to stock the hot product and flooded stores with too much merchandise admits avery baker executive vice president of marketing for hilfiger the buzz surrounding the store opening evaporated quickly the company was hurt by counterfeits and confusion among consumers with an unrelated cheap lookalike brand called tommy sport "we spent months trying to de hype the brand " ms baker recalls cutting back accounts with other stores and trying to get rid of excess inventory poor sales forced hilfiger to close its bond street store a year later it eventually acquired tommy sport to rid itself of the problem in the u s meanwhile tommy hilfigers sales peaked at &# billion in when the hip preppy tommy logo became ubiquitous on menswear jeans cosmetics and accessories in addition to the problems such as department store consolidation affecting all apparel makers hilfiger faced competition from upstarts such as urban wear labels sean john and rocawear and the racy abercrombie &amp fitch fashion editors believing hilfigers fashion moment had passed largely ignored the brand as hilfiger started to cool in the u s the companys european division based in amsterdam since enjoyed steady growth under the direction of mr gehring a dutch born former executive at polo ralph lauren in europe he adapted its business to the european retail culture hilfiger went after big department stores as a u s apparel maker normally would and got its merchandise in galeries lafayette in paris and el corte ingles in spain but mr gehring also wooed small accounts mostly independent boutiques and signed of them in countries "the fragmentation of dealing with all these little mom and pop stores is so alien to american businesses " mr gehring says yet "these stores are the backbone of every major brand " to serve all these small shop owners "tommy europe" opened regional showrooms instead of centralizing distribution as many american companies do in europe each showroom features around sample lines of merchandise for the retailers to view as a result operational costs account for about of sales in europe compared with to in the u s says ludo onnik hilfigers chief financial officer mr gehring says the expense is worth it in the battle against homegrown brands "the competitors we faced in germany are all strong local german brands many of whom have showrooms in all the six major cities which a retailer can get to an hour away by car " he says the european division also tweaked its marketing it nixed american packaging for underwear which showed beefy muscular men in briefs and boxer shorts european competitors showed lankier gents and sometimes racier poses to stand out in the crowd hilfigers packages in europe now feature a woman in bra and panties standing seductively behind a man in boxer shorts or briefs on the fashion side hilfiger increasingly found itself departing from its u s lineup in hilfiger introduced its core u s mens sportswear line in europe including the companys signature cotton knit sweaters hilfiger soon discovered the sweaters which were popular in the u s didnt play well on the continent "you cant give those away in europe " mr gehring says noting that european men prefer wool sweaters the next year hilfiger europe starting using lambs wool hilfiger europe decided to give jeans and pants in europe a slimmer silhouette than those sold in the u s "baggy jeans didnt sell" in europe says mr gehring it also has shrunk and hidden the oversized flag logos famous in the u s after a few years mr gehring decided that merely tweaking the u s collection for europe was producing a "flat and uninteresting" line in hilfiger made a radical decision design the clothes for europe from scratch in europe today hilfiger has a design staff in amsterdam of people creating collections that adapt the hilfiger look to a more sophisticated upscale european audience italians tend to buy more luxury items such as leather jackets and cashmere sweaters so the team created pieces for that market german men dress conservatively and are willing to pay more for woven cotton sport shirts hilfigers shirts sold in europe are made with higher quality cotton bumping their retail price to about &# or &# more than in the u s "you have to have a collection range broad enough for local tastes in different countries but it still needs to be cohesive " mr gehring says the company also adjusted its brand strategy while hilfiger captured a chunk of the teen market in the u s with its tommy jeans line its european customers were more likely to be between and years old so it avoided using the youthful sounding tommy jeans name in europe last year with the u s company struggling mr gehring teamed up with apax partners to buy hilfiger for &# billion subsequently mr gehring was named hilfigers chief executive and he has been shuttling between amsterdam and hilfigers new york headquarters in the year ended march europe accounted for of the companys &# billion in sales including countries in asia south america and elsewhere international sales represented of the total hilfiger says its operations in europe and overseas are profitable the strength of the european operations gives mr gehring the opportunity to restructure operations in the u s last year he closed its unprofitable childrens wear and tommy jeans divisions in the u s to focus on its profitable core sportswear business the company closed of its own u s stores in and mr gehring says he is concentrating on improving results at u s department stores where wholesale revenue has shrunk to &# million from &# billion in while competition from americans is growing in europe hilfiger believes its decade of experience gives it an edge "this is a slow growth proposition that people underestimate " says michael phillips a principal of apax who is based in munich a company cant easily build a shop on prime streets in european cities because "those store locations just arent available " he says mr silva the consultant thinks american brands that reflect "a unique american lifestyle such as hip hop outdoors and sports oriented brands" have the best shot of making it overseas hilfiger further extended its reach into europe in when it bought chanel designer karl lagerfelds namesake label the company will tap into mr lagerfelds fashion expertise next week during new york fashion week when the hilfiger runway show will be staged by the same europeans who do the fashion presentations at the house of chanel for the first time tommy hilfigers mens and womens collections will come mostly from the companys european team mr hilfiger says the designs "will show the public how we are recreating american classics that are slightly more grown up and sophisticated " he says
