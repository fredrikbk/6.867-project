weekend journal review film because i said so orders up laughs forgets the humor as nasty mom keaton is just shrill mafioso should have been a hit as almost everyone knows by now the early part of the year has become a dumping ground for dreadful movies still "because i said so" constitutes unusually toxic waste its toxic to mental health a hideously shrill sitcom in which a little boy with add is no more agitated than the production that surrounds him and its a waste of considerable talent not to mention precious time the underlying theme is an overbearing mom diane keatons daphne a prosperous single mother micromanages the lives of her three daughters driving them crazy in the process unbeknownst to one of them milly a sweet self doubter played by mandy moore daphne places an online personals ad on her daughters behalf and deems one of the respondents mr right hes a rich insufferable architect played semi insufferably by tom everett scott the plot presents milly with a righter alternative gabriel machts johnny a musician and single father with a son named lionel hes the kid with add but plot is a kind word for the rusty machinery that propels this repellent farce and wrong is the only word for movies sense of itself in a righter version lionel would be a deal breaker for any woman in johnnys life not because he has add but because hes profoundly obnoxious and milly a professional caterer would treat her delusional mama to poison tapas if i seem to be dwelling on this foolish film its partly because of diane keaton the inimitable comedienne weve adored in half a lifetime of comedies and dramas from "annie hall" through "the godfather" to "somethings gotta give " now shes playing senior citizens which is fine but this garishly unfunny citizen out monsters jane fonda in "monster in law " and the spectacle is depressing another reason for obsessing a righter word about "because i said so" is what it says of hollywood studio production not all studios or all productions the studio behind this one recently gave us such varied substantial fare as "united " "miami vice" and "inside man " but this film bespeaks a truly startling mistrust of the movie audience and whats more a disrespect for the feature film medium yes of course it was conceived as an unpretentious entertainment pitched mainly to girls and young women yet that doesnt explain the nightmarish quality of the finished product pratfalls abound but theyre frantic and pitifully clumsy for artful pratfalls see steve martin cute reigns milly and johnny meet cute milly drives a cute van lives in a cute house on a cute venice california canal johnny teaches cute children and oldsters to play guitar mother and daughters gabble incessantly as in the old days of radio when everyone was afraid of dead air daphne yells at her cars navigation system which in turn overacts milly snorts when she laughs her disease is insecurity but the studio and its hired hands seem to have suffered from the same affliction a mistrust of simple humanity a fear that human beings in the audience might not understand the human beings on screen without being coached by crude acting and outsize reactions there isnt an honest moment in the movie though the script does provide a brief respite its when daphne under pressure from a long suffering daughter takes a pledge of temporary silence mafioso "mafioso" was made in and was seen only briefly in this country in the s its a product of the glory days of italian cinema according to the production notes the phrase baciamo le mani which occurs several times in this delightful black comedy means literally "we kiss your hands " but serves in sicily as a salutation showing the highest respect for the recipient a big baciamo le mani then for the director alberto lattuada who died two years ago at the age of and another for his star the great also recently late alberto sordi who lifts buffoonery to the level of high art sordi plays a modern man of a special kind a sicilian antonio badalamenti who has made a solid success of himself in northern italy a striking main title sequence prepares us for his career with an intricate dance of heavy machinery the sequence might pass for an alternate prelude to "modern times " and what do you know nino turns out to be a time and motion specialist one whos about to take his skeptical wife on vacation in his natal sicily the storys basic irony is that nino cant escape his relatively primitive past nor does he want to he loves sicily and wants his wife to do the same as sordi plays him with invisible skill and enormous gusto nino is a big hearted bumpkin inside an urban sophisticate the movie is about the essence of south among other things one thinks of fernandels comic roles set in provence but its also very much about the mafia a decade before "the godfather " and we know something big is up when the local don in ninos home town tells a flunky "keep an eye on him he may be the one " the one for what im bound to silence by a blood oath but i can tell you this if "mafioso" is playing near you take the time to make the motion the situation sometimes cinematography can lend apparent authority to amateurism thats the case with "the situation " a drama set in contemporary wartime iraq that was written didactically but still murkily by wendell steavenson its her first script and photographed brilliantly by sean bobbitt the director philip haas gave his shooter plenty to shoot the modestly budgeted physical production is impressive filming actually took place in morocco and the cast does what it can within the coarse camouflage of its roles connie nielsen as anna an american journalist who as ms steavenson herself did writes for magazines from iraq damian lewis as dan an american ultimately a quiet american intelligence officer and some good actors from the maghreb and the middle east speaking in various accents anna wants to understand iraqs lethal chaos but she like the movie is in over her head the situation in "the situation" is grimly photogenic yet persistently opaque dvd tip diane keaton has distinguished herself in many dramatic roles in such films as "mrs soffel " "the little drummer girl" and "shoot the moon" the last unfortunately unavailable on dvd but shes never been more impressive than as louise bryant the writer who leaves her husband for john reed the radical journalist played by warren beatty in "reds" mr beatty directed this remarkable film from a screenplay he wrote with trevor griffiths
