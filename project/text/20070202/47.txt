feds inflation dilemma if policy makers opt for a target should it be hard or soft washington federal reserve officials in debating whether to adopt an explicit target for inflation have discussed whether an implicit or "soft" target might be preferable the continuing debate reflects fed chairman ben bernankes belief that the central bank needs to develop a clearer more systematic way of communicating its intentions to the public to lessen the chance of any market jolting surprises currently the feds official aim is to achieve "price stability " but it doesnt specify what rate or range of inflation it thinks would fulfill that goal mr bernanke has long favored setting an explicit inflation target an increasingly common practice among foreign central banks many of those banks strive to keep inflation at or near proponents of this approach say that adopting an explicit inflation target for the u s would reassure americans discouraging self fulfilling inflationary expectations if for example the economy overheated or energy prices jumped it also would give financial markets a better indication of the feds likely response to shifting economic conditions at mr bernakes behest the feds policy making federal open market committee has been studying possible changes in how it communicates its forecasts statements and meeting minutes while the member panel has also considered adopting an inflation target fed officials emphasize that such a move is far from certain among the drawbacks to an explicit target is potential resistance on capitol hill and internal discord over what if any number should be picked that has prompted fed officials to take a look at an implicit target which would communicate the feds preferred inflation rate without having the force of an official goal fed officials say one form of implicit targeting would be to extend the horizon of the feds economic forecasts beyond the current two years with the inflation forecast for the last year of the period representing the feds implicit target another would be to poll all fomc members on their personal definition of price stability and publish the resulting range rather than forcing them to agree on a single number or range but officials have significant misgivings about both approaches primarily because they sacrifice clarity and accountability the very benefits that targets are meant to achieve the federal reserve act defines the feds goals as both price stability and maximum employment mr bernanke has long argued that a target is consistent with that "dual mandate " he argues that a target stabilizes the publics expectations of inflation which enables the fed to lower interest rates during a slump with less fear of setting off a run up in prices but some fed officials fear that argument is too subtle for many in congress who might contend that an inflation target elevates price stabilitys importance over that of employment barney frank the new democratic chairman of the house financial services committee opposes an inflation target while acknowledging that the fomc has the authority to adopt one "there is a little bit of concern that the mandate doesnt extend to picking any particular number " said ken kuttner an economist at oberlin college in ohio who wrote about inflation targets while on the staff of the federal reserve bank of new york "there would naturally be people saying hey im reading your mandate here guys give us your target number for full employment and nobody wants to do that a lot of the gains from ambiguity have to do with finessing that kind of situation " another drawback of an explicit target is the continued disagreement within the fed over both the wisdom of adopting one and over what the number should be if one were adopted one way to minimize both problems would be for the fomc rather than announcing a target to lengthen its current semiannual forecast a range of forecasts by individual fomc members to three or four years from the current two because that would ordinarily be long enough for the feds interest rate actions to achieve any inflation rate the central bank desired the fourth year forecast could be construed as a target without being called one a shortcoming of this approach is that if a big shock such as a jump in energy prices drove inflation up sharply it could take more than four years to get it back to the target unless the fed was willing to drive unemployment sharply higher another is that the forecast would include unemployment and congress might see that as an implicit target for which the fed should be held accountable another approach would be to poll all fomc members on what constituted price stability and to publish the results the bank of japan adopted a similar approach last year and announced that its nine policy board members views ranged from zero to inflation but officials say that despite the appeal of the approaches both are flawed and thus may not be much better than the status quo if the fomc claims its target is only a forecast it would be less accountable for missing it and that means the public and investors would be less likely to incorporate it into their own behavior the polling approach suffers from the fact the target could change every year with the composition and inclination of the fomcs members without agreement on a single target policy makers could respond differently to the same inflation picture
