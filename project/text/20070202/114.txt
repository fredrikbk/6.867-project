weekend journal review books great yet gloriously earth bound a history of the english speaking peoples since by andrew roberts harpercollins pages &# the cheery but indomitable shade of winston churchill hovers over andrew robertss "a history of the english speaking peoples since " not only does mr roberts the author of biographies of lord salisbury and lord halifax quote churchill more often than any other figure but in his effort to offer "the next stage" of the story that churchill unfolded in his own "history of the english speaking peoples " mr roberts conscientiously champions the implacable love of freedom that guided the great statesman published in the mid s churchills four volume opus takes readers from roman britain up the death queen victoria in churchills purpose was to trace the rise of britain and her dominions of course but he also celebrated the "inseparable link" that had grown up between the u s and the rest of the english speaking world particularly as churchill notes in his somber concluding pages at a moment when the cold war was confronting the entire world with new threats mr roberts elaborates these churchillian themes in a book that is both hugely entertaining and pointedly admonitory his wide ranging curiosity and nimble prose will captivate readers who dont otherwise think much about th century history or the imperatives of the "anglosphere " the book is a trove of anecdote information and apothegm i was happy to learn for example that the dour kaiser wilhelm ii was not above making a joke when in for obvious reasons the british royal family changed its official name from saxe coburg gotha to windsor the kaiser said he looked forward to seeing a performance of "the merry wives of saxe coburg gotha " a small joke perhaps but still mr robertss tough mindedness though also guarantees that his book will make many enemies the guardians of established opinion will be especially displeased among the many received pieties he challenges is the idea that world war i began in a naive outpouring of war enthusiasm "the true mood of the country " mr roberts notes referring to britain "was one of sombre concerned realism " he also explodes the myth propagated by john maynard keyness immensely influential "the economic consequences of the peace " that world war ii was precipitated in large measure by the "greedy" and over harsh provisions of the versailles treaty in fact mr roberts shows the treaty should have been harsher dividing germany into two or more parts instead it left germany "in a physical position to launch her fifth war of territorial aggression in three quarters of a century " the guiding supposition of mr robertss book as of churchills is that the english speaking peoples primarily the citizens of britain canada australia new zealand and the u s emerged in the th and th centuries as the worlds principal tribunes of liberty the differences that separate them are outweighed by abiding commonalities of outlook and temperament like what mr roberts approvingly quotes from a speech that churchill gave at harvard in "law language literature these are considerable factors common conceptions of what is right and decent a marked regard for fair play especially to the weak and poor a stern sentiment of impartial justice and above all a love of personal freedom " just imagine how such a catalog of common conceptions "on both sides of the ocean among the english speaking peoples" would be received at harvard today history seems to have vindicated churchills invigorating tone at the moment eight of the worlds largest businesses are american the other two are british the english speaking peoples account for of the worlds population but their economies produce more than a third of the global gdp their military might and cultural reach dwarf the claims of every rival just as the english language itself has become a kind of intellectual global currency how different the world looked in when mr roberts begins his story though britain was at the height of its power france russia and germany also contended for supremacy the idea that a century later the english speaking peoples would be challenged only "by some disaffected fanatics from the rump of the ottoman empire " mr roberts observes "would have astounded the kaiser tsar and french president alike " what happened shortly before he died in bismarck the former german chancellor was asked what he thought was the decisive factor in modern history he replied "the fact that the north americans speak english " that the americans and their northern neighbors spoke english put the continental powers at a disadvantage because it was already clear that the u s was on its way to an ascendancy analogous to britains and for good reason the "bourgeois earth bound english speaking peoples " mr roberts declares "refuse to dream dreams see visions and follow fanatics and demagogues " they are relentlessly gloriously practical how much does the english language itself figure into this drama mr roberts touches on this question only glancingly i suspect that the answer though unquantifiable is "rather a lot " hegel remarking on the advantages of german as a language for philosophy noted that "some of its words even possess the further peculiarity of having not only different but opposite meanings so that one cannot fail to recognize a speculative spirit of the language in them " it is difficult to imagine any english speaking philosopher one that hadnt been corrupted by hegel anyway making a capacity for self contradiction the grounds for philosophical excellence mr roberts has structured his book around the four great assaults on the political liberty championed by the english speaking peoples the prussian militarism of world war i the axis totalitarianism of the s and early s the soviet communism of the cold war and todays great peril radical islam in every case he shows the west was slow to respond and suffered serious setbacks in early engagements "an englishmans mind works best " he quotes one wag saying "when it is almost too late " to date the english speaking peoples have prevailed will they prevail again mr roberts notes that it is one of the curious features of the societies forged by the english speaking peoples that the greatest threats to their success and stability often come not from external enemies but from "vociferous critics within their own society " in one sense of course tolerance for dissent is a testament to the strength of liberal democracy but when does such criticism spill over into moral fecklessness and failure of nerve part of mr robertss mission in this ambitious book is to remind us that the future of the english speaking peoples depends largely on how we answer that question mr kimball is the author of "the rape of the masters how political correctness sabotages art "
