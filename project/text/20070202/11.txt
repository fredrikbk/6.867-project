buy a backdating stock why shares dont react like regulators for the scores of companies swept up in the options backdating scandal repercussions have included financial restatements regulatory investigations and executive resignations in what would ordinarily seem like bearish news however there may be some buying opportunities a number of bets have paid off as many stocks have dipped on adverse disclosures about possible backdating only to bounce back within weeks days or even hours gartmore small cap fund had nearly a return last year partly because it purchased stocks when they fell on backdating news says charles purcell senior portfolio manager of the &# million fund "the underlying businesses were the same and we were going to get past this eventually " he says "its taking advantage of the groupthink " one of gartmores buys was foundry networks inc a manufacturer of telecommunications network gear in late june foundry announced a federal inquiry into its options practices sending its shares down about to near &# in the subsequent weeks but foundrys stock bounced back to more than &# while the investigation continued thanks to a strong third quarter the share price fell only jan the day foundry announced the results of the inquiry and stripped its chief financial officer of financial reporting responsibilities and unseated its chief executive from the chairmanship the stock is once again trading on the nasdaq stock market above &# a share "in hindsight it looked like free money " mr purcell says the rise in shares of foundry and other companies with potential options backdating issues highlights a big difference between the current rash of investigations and accounting scandals on wall street of the past decade stocks of companies such as worldcom and enron never recovered from their accounting improprieties because they had large effects on the companies bottom lines the options scandals fall into the realm of executive compensation which historically has had less impact on stock prices while the additional payouts are technically coming out of investors pockets the amounts make a relatively small dent in companies financial health brian barish president and director of research at cambiar investors a denver investment management firm with more than &# billion in assets says he doesnt want to trivialize the backdating issue because "it is still cheating" if done in violation of securities rules but he says even in cases involving wrongdoing "it didnt bespeak other ethical violations in the business " helping embolden investors have been the high profile cases of stock prices that have overcome downward pressure from the backdating scandal apple inc for instance reported on june irregularities in the granting of options including a grant given to chief executive steve jobs the next day the stock price declined to &# on the nasdaq but by the end of july the shares were back over &# amid strong earnings shares are now trading in the &# range thanks in part to the results of the companys internal investigation which absolved mr jobs of misconduct as well as the buzz generated by apples new iphone a government inquiry is continuing to be sure investors have good reason to be wary when a company falls under an options investigation cloud it is illegal to date options earlier than the time they were awarded which can make them more valuable if it isnt properly disclosed to shareholders shares of some affected companies have gone down after initial announcements and stayed down vitesse semiconductor corp was trading on the nasdaq in the mid &# range before a march page one wall street journal article highlighted an unusual pattern of options grants to the then ceo the company launched an investigation which uncovered numerous accounting irregularities and led to the termination of three executives one of whom remains on the board vitesses stock price is currently at less than &# a share in over the counter trading a wall street journal analysis aided by birinyi associates of the stock prices of more than companies whose names have surfaced in options backdating investigations shows that nearly of those firms underperformed the nasdaq composite index last year the dow jones industrial average outperformed of those stocks last year the dj wilshire index a broad market beat about two thirds of the companies stocks but many of these stocks probably underperformed the market averages for reasons other than the options scandals and there are enough exceptions to attract contrarian investors the companies became caught up in options investigations at different points in the year and were at different points in resolving the investigations at years end so this is simply a rough comparison of performance also as the options backdating discussion evolves investors are recognizing that the degree of wrongdoing if there is any covers a wide spectrum three former comverse technology inc executives have been charged with criminal fraud two have pleaded guilty there also have been a number of high profile executive departures including ceos at companies such as unitedhealth group inc cnet networks inc and mcafee inc but some of the inquiries have resulted so far in little more than financial restatements some companies have conducted internal investigations that exonerated key executives which has generally seemed to satisfy wall street even if federal examinations are continuing last month for instance take two interactive software inc said in an sec filing that a former chief executive "engaged in a pattern and practice of backdating options " shares dipped slightly on the nasdaq but rebounded later in the day "people started to think maybe they were cleaning up their act " says arvind bhatia an analyst with sterne agee &amp leach in dallas mr bhatia rates the stock a "sell" and sterne trades in take twos shares it hasnt provided any investment banking services to the company
