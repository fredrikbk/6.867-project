u n report adds pressure to global warming fight a report being published today that more authoritatively and explicitly links human activity to global warming is expected to increase pressure on governments and companies to reduce fossil fuel emissions a summary of the new report put together by hundreds of scientists and backed by more than governments is expected to assert that human activity is "very likely" the cause of a global warming trend in recent decades it comes as governments and some of the worlds biggest companies are wrestling with a big challenge how to apportion among companies and consumers the economic pain that is expected from significantly curbing fossil fuel emissions the new document contains "a strengthening of findings a narrowing of uncertainty and filling up of the gaps" linking human activity to long term warming trends said rajendra pachauri chairman of the intergovernmental panel on climate change which is publishing the report today the ipcc was formed by the world meteorological organization and the united nations environment program this summary document doesnt contain prescriptions for action though its conclusions will inform the debate about how to respond to climate change parts of the full report due for release later in the year will deal with the impact of climate change options to fight warming and the associated costs already governments and companies are acting the european union two years ago began imposing emission constraints on several big industries and is in the process of tightening those restrictions a similar battle is brewing in the u s where democrats who recently gained control of congress are discussing plans to cap greenhouse gas emissions u s electric utilities emit large quantities of carbon dioxide and are likely to be the first to be regulated the new u n assessment is likely to spur these efforts one reason for the growing political consensus is that the data linking fossil fuel emissions to rising temperatures are becoming more reliable president bush in his state of the union address last month implicitly endorsed the notion that fossil fuel emissions contribute to global warming after laying out a series of policy proposals to encourage oil alternatives such as ethanol he said such technologies will in addition to curbing u s dependence on foreign oil "help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change " steve johnson the administrator of the u s environmental protection agency hailed the ipcc report saying "although many of the findings contained in the report are not new they are a reflection of increased certainty of observed trends and heightened reliability of climate computer model predictions this is very helpful and useful to us " similarly exxon mobil corp which has in the past made strong public statements about remaining uncertainties in global warming science now says climate science is growing more robust exxon says it has stopped funding several groups that questioned the validity of concerns about global warming the new report raises a key estimate of how much earth is likely to warm as a result of an increase in greenhouse gases it also predicts that human induced warming will increase the intensity of hurricanes an issue of particular interest to the insurance industry the assessment states that there is a chance that global warming is caused by humans according to a person familiar with the document the previous ipcc report published in had said humans were "likely" the trigger for warming trends which indicated a probability of a link the new report also says a doubling of greenhouse gases will likely raise the planets temperature by more than two degrees centigrade at a minimum the person said the assessment six years ago said the temperature would likely rise by a minimum of degrees centigrade the revised numbers could alter forecasts about the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on drought rainfall and other weather patterns the assessment states that human activity is leading to warmer oceans which in turn is likely to give rise to more intense and damaging hurricanes the possibility of such a link has been hotly debated in recent years especially since hurricane katrina slammed into the gulf coast in the ipcc assessment isnt the last word on the subject of climate change still the report which was put together by hundreds of scientists over several years is particularly influential because it knits together findings from peer reviewed and published scientific studies in addition governments are required to reach consensus and sign off on the exact wording says veerabhadran ramanathan a climate scientist at the university of california san diego and editor of part of the u n report "this is like a once every six years check up for the planet its a pretty compelling and convincing case that the patient is sick " john j fialka contributed to this article
