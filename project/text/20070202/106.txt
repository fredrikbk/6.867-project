watching super bowl ads could make viewers cringe this years super bowl will be filled with moments of pain and embarrassment and not just for the indianapolis colts and the chicago bears as they go head to head madison avenue has prepared a series of ads for super bowl xli airing sunday night on cbs that will likely make audiences cringe or laugh or do both at the same time coming from marketers including anheuser busch cos blockbuster inc and pepsico inc the string of ads suggests that comical violence or gross out scenarios are proving as popular as ever if not more so as a way to get attention one spot for video rental company blockbuster shows a cute and cuddly rabbit stomping on a mouse computer generated another for online job site careerbuilder com features office workers clad in combat outfits made from office supplies brawling over a promotion two ads for anheusers bud light go even further in one a game of rock paper scissors goes painfully awry "you go for extremes" on the big game says peter krivkovich president and chief executive officer of cramer krasselt the agency behind the careerbuilder spots "remember you are in the most competitive arena " while the audience for the game is enormous roughly million viewers in the u s last year according to nielsen media research many people watch in crowded party like settings whats more the broadcast carries a total of about spots costing this year as much as &# million for seconds of airtime so advertisers go all out to make sure their ad stands out over the years marketers have adopted other approaches in several depended heavily on broadly crude humor such as anheuser buschs ads that showed a horse passing gas and a crotch biting dog complaints from viewers and the famous janet jackson half time show debacle prompted advertisers in to abandon the cheeky approach in favor of playing up nostalgic themes mastercard inc for example aired a spot that featured familiar and comforting icons such as the pillsbury doughboy charlie the tuna and mr peanut this years super bowl will include plenty of ads aiming for laughs as audiences have come to expect another careerbuilder commercial shows employees running for their lives as a barrage of pencils used as darts are shot at them "run " screams one of the employees "they are looking for volunteers for a training seminar " another character yells in a panic other spots though are likely to make viewers squirm more than laugh a commercial from mars inc shows two mechanics sharing an odd moment while lingering over a snickers bar a long way from some talked about commercials of the past such as an eds ad that showed cowboys herding a group of cats against the backdrop of spectacular prairie scenery more famously apple computers ad launching the macintosh showed a dazzling futuristic vision of the world the increased emphasis in recent years on shocking viewers reflects "agencies and clients trying to get as much bang for the buck" for commercials that are often expensive to produce and place says david baldwin executive creative director at havas sas mckinney + silver some think the trend is about something simpler "people really like to see other people get hurt as long as its not too serious " says dale backus a year old amateur filmmaker from cary n c a finalist in a contest held by pepsico s frito lay for members of the public to submit ads for the super bowl mr backus produced a spot that shows a driver distracted by a woman eating a bag of doritos having a car accident "we all laugh when people get hurt in goofy and unexpected ways " mr backus adds during and after last years game one of the most talked about commercials showed a man demonstrating how his cellphone from sprint nextel is a crime deterrent by hurling it at the head of his friend who collapses angie read a sprint nextel spokeswoman says the spots popularity was shown by surveys of super bowl viewers conducted by media outlets it is also one of consumers favorite sprint ads in recent memory she says citing emails from fans moreover advertising professors request the ad to show to classes saying its combination of humor and surprise make it a good example for marketing students to scrutinize some ad executives suggest the cringe tactic carries some risk violence or tasteless tactics must be used carefully says mr baldwin at mckinney + silver since the super bowl draws a broad audience that often includes family and children advertisers must be sensitive not to trip certain sensibilities "when you live on the edge sometimes you get cut " adds mr baldwin another pitfall such ads may get lots of attention during the big game but may fall short of a lasting marketing victory says mike hughes president and creative director at interpublic group of cos martin agency consumers will probably remember the incident that made them cringe more than they will any larger marketing message products with a long history and well known brand name such as pepsi or coca cola co or budweiser can get away with the tactic he says but smaller advertisers could stumble "every once in a while these things break through in a way that lasts " says mr hughes but more often than not the buzz around the ad is fairly short lived
