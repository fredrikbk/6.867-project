business world paid to listen congress once thought it had a political and policy winner in raising taxes on the private equity industry now its not so sure complains republican sen charles grassley "there are powerful forces in this town that have been organized specifically on this issue that are probably going to be able to slow it up into next year " his democratic partner in this waltz max baucus chairman of the finance committee adds "its a very complicated subject " hooray for special interests to recap private equity partners pay only capital gains tax at on their "carried interest " though some critics say carried interest is more akin to wage income and should be taxed as wage income at the top rate of these critics argue on fairness grounds but as mr baucus notes its complicated carried interest pays off only if theres a profit when an investment matures usually after several years of careful management and the isnt off the top but only after outside investors earn a "hurdle rate of return " usually a year pe compensation in short is highly at risk highly conditional and much delayed unlike a salary which is paid biweekly and after being hit with tax is available to invest or spend remember in some ways the treatment for capital gains is a rough substitute for indexing long term gains for inflation one shoe to drop was a study by university of pennsylvanias michael knoll who looks closely at who pays what and finds that the proposed tax hike wouldnt be the big revenue raiser congress hopes he was channeling myron scholes a nobel economist and hedge fund manager who taught the world that to understand who pays a tax you have to look beyond whose tax return it appears on mr scholes himself points out that pe operators earn their living by managing companies but the companies themselves dont get a deduction for managements compensation as they would if they hired managers directly or brought them in as consultants thats one reason it might be easier than some think for pe funds to reorganize their businesses to avoid the tax hit mr scholes also notes that if theres a target for income tax its the value of the so called carried interest at the moment its transferred from the outside investors to the managing pe partners i e before anybody knows whether it will pay off this "option" could be valued its essentially a "call option" on of the final profits of a venture over and above the per year due investors but mr scholes suggests instead a rule of thumb of carried interest might be taxed as wage income now we wouldnt put it past some legislators actually to understand the considerations raised here but lets be realistic what suddenly has produced a stalemate on an issue where congress seemed primed for action is private equity opening its campaign and lobbying checkbook in a big way hooray we say again for special interests let us consider more closely private equity is a target because its rich and also can make its voice heard because its rich riches obtained by providing services that obviously somebody somewhere must value shareholders in public companies like selling out to pe operators at a market premium pe investors like making a profit from sprucing up these companies and reselling them voila a special interest is born in our society with the means and incentive to defend itself voters are still the ultimate arbiters of course but congress is finding that taxing the pe plutocrats doesnt move many votes whatever the polls say legislators also have to worry about unpopular side effects that voters havent considered say knocking a prop out from under stock prices let congress not kid itself in the round logic of the markets private equity supports stock prices it represents a large pool of capital that has a higher value use for companies than their current public shareholders might which brings us to the personnel story of the week jim press leaving toyota for chrysler he was toyotas highest ranking american a member of its board a year veteran an international business statesman of the first rank he was a highly valued player on the winningest team in the auto industry all of which he will be giving up to assist chrysler now owned by the private equity firm cerberus capital management he may be motivated by the challenge that chrysler represents even more than the vast sums he will undoubtedly be paid if successful but like any rational person he doesnt give up a secure high paying job in favor of another job one that if successful would yield billions in profits for his new employer without expecting to share in those rewards himself thats the way the world works thats the way private equity works if mr press had left to run the red cross nobody else would be getting rich off his efforts and he wouldnt expect to either which just shows the pe revolution isnt merely the product of a "tax loophole " its about concentrating management incentives and talent to wring more wealth out of businesses that arent doing so well in other hands in any case private equitys fat returns are likely to be reduced by competition before congress can get its hands on them but looming is the real fight over the bush investment tax cuts on capital gains and dividends guess whos going to make sure congress hears arguments about why preserving these benefits is vital to u s prosperity once more hooray for special interests
