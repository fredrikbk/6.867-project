quadrupling of net profit for the quarter ended in june still as of june it had securitized and sold close to &# billion in bonds based on residential mortgages according to a nomura web site its stubbed toe on subprime mortgages is an unpleasant reminder of how it once again was tempted by a fast growing u s business that turned out to be less promising than many believed before it started packaging and selling residential mortgage bonds nomura had a thriving business trading them for its customers mostly u s institutional investors and hedge funds because the bonds arent publicly listed the trading business gave nomura information about the prices of the instruments that few people had the new york based fixed income team at the time led by alex noujaim a morgan stanley veteran who had co founded a boutique brokerage before joining nomura soon realized they could securitize mortgages for less than what they could be sold for mr noujaim left the bank in shortly after

trying to sell the loans it has on its books nomura chief executive nobuyuki koga has said shutting the business is among the options the company is now looking at
