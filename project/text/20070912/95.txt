pepsi steps into coke realm red china ahead of olympics new can adds color to cola competition chinas cola wars just got a little confusing in most countries the major rival colas are delineated by color coca cola co s can is red while that of pepsico inc is blue but in china pepsi has departed from tradition and launched a red can as part of a new marketing campaign pepsi officials say they made the move to support chinas national sports team coordinating the design of pepsis can with the color of chinas national flag but the new can which is all red except for a blue stripe on one side has raised at least a few eyebrows because of its resemblance to coca colas olympics themed cans cao ling ling a year old pepsi drinker was taken aback monday as she picked up the new can for the first time in a supermarket "this is so weird " ms cao said turning the can around and around in her hand "i usually just go for the blue can its easy to spot the red can just doesnt look right " like cokes current design the new pepsi can also features olympic athletes though they are different from the ones on the coke can because coca cola has exclusive contracts with some athletes in addition to being an official sponsor of the beijing olympics pepsi is a sponsor of team china the national team that represents china in various international sporting events including the asian games an ad accompanying the introduction of the red can has been posted on youtube leo tsoi marketing director for pepsi in china said the companys decision to "go red" had nothing to do with coke instead he said it was in response to positive feedback the company got from a survey of pepsi drinkers who he says supported the campaign as a "bold move" and appreciated pepsis support of their national team "we are going red for team china " mr tsoi said "we wouldnt be doing a program that is simulating the competitor " coca cola company officials appeared mostly amused by pepsis move when shown photos of the red can "red great idea why didnt we think of that " said kelly brooks a spokesman for coca cola based in atlanta he didnt comment on whether coke would ask pepsi to desist from marketing its cola in a red can or seek other action against the company the dueling cans come as coke and pepsi try to lure more chinese soda drinkers to their brands in what is a critical market for growth coke holds a commanding lead of overall carbonated soft drink sales in the country with a market share in led by its coca cola and sprite brands against pepsis share according to beverage digest a u s based beverage industry trade publication but pepsi has slowly been increasing its share according to market researcher euromonitor international coke sold billion liters of carbonated drinks in china last year more than its sales volume in pepsi sold billion liters last year more than in pepsi brought out the new can with a low profile introduction to the chinese press last week "we must admit it wasnt an easy decision for pepsico global or pepsico china to change our package to red color and it involved much discussion and consideration " said pepsico china chief executive shi dakun in a news release at the time "but we firmly believe its a right and worthwhile decision " pepsi said the red can is just a temporary promotion that will last through the end of the year but the decision could have risks for both coke and pepsi because china remains a place where companies continue to struggle to build brand identity and brand loyalty among fickle consumers said david ketchum ceo of marketing and communications firm upstream asia consumers "move around all the time an ad or a promotion will make them jump on that brand for a little while then move on to the next one " he said but tapping into national pride by "wrapping themselves in the flag" as the olympics near is gutsy guerrilla marketing mr ketchum said pepsi is "tapping into the olympics spirit but stopping just short of just being an olympics sponsor " by adopting red pepsi is muddying the waters for coke said tom pirko president of bevmark llc a beverage industry consultant "you dont ever want to allow coke in china to be like coke in the u s where its so iconic " he said for their part cola drinkers interviewed at a beijing supermarket said they would know the difference between the colas immediately from the taste even if they mistakenly pick up the wrong can "i would know from the first sip " ms cao said "pepsi and coke are very very different " pepsi has marketed its signature cola in a blue can internationally since and a white can with a red and blue design for years before that at the beginning of this year pepsi rolled out a new design globally with a regularly changing series of images all in shades of blue it made its debut in the u s in january and in china in march a pepsi spokesman said the company has used national colors on promotional packages before such as yellow and green on a package last year in brazil the two companies cola cans now on the shelf in china dont look exactly alike pepsis can is a darker red than cokes and its famous red white and blue globe logo is displayed prominently which "makes the brand identification crystal clear " a pepsi spokesman said coke has its brand name in all sizes printed from almost every angle on its can it also has only one large photo per can of a sponsored olympic athlete ma jin a year old college student in beijing said she thinks the pepsi package looks strange but she wouldnt mistake it for coke the cola she prefers "i would have thought it was a new brand of cola " she said "it does make me wonder if they changed their taste though i might try it one day to see " pepsis new can also displays the winners of an online photo contest in which people submitted pictures of themselves rooting for team china and then voted to determine who would win a spot on the cans mr tsoi said the contest drew million submissions and million votes which was larger than any global campaign of this sort ever run by the company some pepsi fans like the new look even if it is red "i thought it was a good idea when i saw those promotional cans theyre supporting team china " said meng fanling a year old retail clerk said bevmarks mr pirko "if youre going to a party you wear the right clothes and the right clothes in china are red "
