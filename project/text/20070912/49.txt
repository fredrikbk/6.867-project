dont leave us behind hong kong markets plea government addresses challenge from china closer mainland ties by acquiring a small stake in the citys stock exchange hong kongs government is trying to grapple with a big and increasingly urgent challenge to avoid being sidelined by the astonishing transformation and growth of chinas financial markets investors have greeted the stake purchase announced late friday as a sign of hope not defense on monday they pushed shares of the exchanges holding company hong kong exchanges &amp clearing ltd higher believing the move heralds closer ties to the thriving exchanges of shanghai and shenzhen yesterday hkexs shares retreated to hong kong dollars us&# each on profit taking the hang seng index fell slightly yesterday but it has soared as well in recent weeks on expectations of capital inflows from chinese individual investors and general optimism about the markets exposure to china growth so far despite the recent turmoil in global stock markets started by a u s housing downturn the index remains up about this year in recent years investors have been right to share that optimism feeding chinas demand for capital hong kongs stock market has hosted some of the biggest share offerings ever seen including initial public offerings for two chinese banks last year that raised more than us&# billion but early this year chinese regulators began encouraging chinese companies to raise their money on the domestic exchanges shifting some momentum in particular to a newly resurgent shanghai exchange and cutting into hong kongs pipeline of new listings several of the largest chinese initial public offerings this year are taking place in shanghai not hong kong including a share offer for china construction bank corp that could raise as much as &# billion china construction bank is already listed in hong kong in the first half of this year chinese issuers raised us&# billion through ipos of which us&# billion was raised on chinas domestic exchanges according to data from thomson financial the move hinted at the potential damage to hong kongs status as a financial center if the chinese flow of new offerings stays inside chinas closed but hugely liquid domestic markets "i think the time pressure is quite serious for the hong kong stock exchange " says lan xue china strategist for citi investment research in hong kong "losing status as chinas primary listing market is severely damaging to hong kongs long term development " hong kongs government which runs the former british colony autonomously from the rest of china is quietly trying to stave off the threat last year it tapped policy advisers in the financial community to come up with a plan their recommendations included establishing "strategic linkages" between the stock exchanges of hong kong and the mainland the governments increase in its stake in hkex to from less than making it the biggest shareholder in the company appears to be a small step toward building those ties according to a person familiar with the matter the stake sets up the groundwork for among other possibilities a swapping of government held shares in the shanghai and hong kong exchanges a share swap would require shanghais membership based exchange to become a company whose shares would likely list on the exchange while such a change isnt certain "its something that should be done " said a chinese government official involved in financial sector policy "this is a world wide trend " closer ties between hong kong and shanghai would follow the global trend in consolidation and linkups among exchanges seeking ways to expand their platforms cut costs and boost profits a listing of shanghais exchange wouldnt be likely until after changes to the communist party leadership are sorted out by march the chinese official added a tie up between hong kong and shanghai could benefit china as well as hong kong it could expose people who run chinas domestic exchanges to hong kong counterparts with more experience working with international investors and a more sophisticated regulatory system it could also allow for a healthy release of pent up potentially dangerous domestic liquidity if it led to new channels for chinese retail investors to trade in hong kong shares chinas capital controls and lack of investment options have combined to turbocharge stock prices on the mainland just about doubling the shanghai composite index this year that has raised fears of an asset bubble that could burst inflicting serious economic injury on a new generation of chinese stock buyers last month china announced the launch of a pilot project to allow domestic investors to open accounts for trading in hong kong shares but details are still being worked out that delay highlights the daunting obstacles to closer ties for one china retains tight control over the convertibility of its currency the yuan free trading across the exchanges would likely mean the removal of those controls and it is unclear how long that process will take almost since the inception of stock trading in china years ago chinas domestic exchanges have maintained two classes of shares so called class a shares denominated in yuan were meant for chinese investors while class b shares denominated in either u s or hong kong dollars were for foreigners when beijing cracked down on illegal domestic purchases of class b shares in the class b market collapsed to a quarter of the value of its class a counterpart leaving foreigners with little role in chinas key
