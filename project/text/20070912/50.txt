fashions trend outsource the web designers need for control yields to desire for growth armani demands reshoots bologna italy designer giorgio armani has been on the cutting edge of fashion for decades but like many fashion brands hes trailing when it comes to the internet managing world wide shipping logistics and warehousing was just too much for his company which excels at designing suede heels and satin dresses to get over the hump and sell the emporio armani brand online the designer had to break a high fashion taboo relinquishing control of distribution sales and customer relationships to outsiders he chose to hire yoox group spa a bologna based web retailer to create a new online boutique www emporioarmani com which went live late last week in the u s as they have expanded their businesses around the globe such brands as emporio armani christian dior and bottega veneta have insisted on owning and managing almost their entire chain of boutiques in order to keep tight control of their image and their customers embracing the internet ran counter to that strategy the mediums widespread accessibility clashed with the exclusive image that high end fashion brands try to convey moreover most luxury goods companies didnt have the skills to navigate online commerce "its like franchising the virtual part of a brands commerce " says federico marchetti who founded yoox seven years ago over the past two years though many fashion houses from louis vuitton to dkny have made the leap realizing that they must connect with consumers who lie outside their network of stores e commerce boutiques are increasingly becoming a clever way to expand their territory without the crushing investment and headaches of rolling out new stores the strategy carries risks however by using companies like yoox to help them sell online fashion brands are rendering themselves vulnerable to pitfalls not unlike those presented by franchising in the s and s during those years such companies as yves saint laurent dior and burberry cheapened their images by farming out their names to local partners in dozens of countries for use on cheap items from umbrellas to cigarette lighters in order to re establish their exclusivity fashion houses have become much more cautious in the past decade thats why some of the biggest fashion houses gucci louis vuitton hermes dont sell clothes online instead they try to stick to items that dont need to be tried on for size such as bags and watches for the few brands that have ventured online without a partner such as gucci providing basic customer service notably free shipping on returns can be expensive and cumbersome selling items like &# silk cocktail dresses on the internet is so complicated that many labels from chanel to dolce &amp gabbana to versace offer nothing more than photos and store addresses on their web sites mr marchetti a former luxury goods analyst started yoox in as a way to sell stock from the previous season over the internet for such labels as roberto cavalli and diesel his site still sells designers overstock at discount prices but last year he decided to expand by offering to produce the technical and logistical backbone for labels that wanted to move online in exchange for a cut of the sales so far some brands have approached yoox for help mr marchetti expects to guide half of them to the web by the beginning of when yoox plans to get a stock market listing gsi commerce inc a pennsylvania based e commerce operator counts burberry plc and polo ralph lauren corp as clients but setting up shop online has proved tricky marni an avant garde italian brand with an artsy edge was the first to launch itself with yoox on a site that went online a year ago figuring out how to depict the brand was difficult because marni doesnt advertise gianni castiglioni the brands president suggested replicating the store design online a photographer went to several marni boutiques shooting low tables globe lights and the metal arcs that serve as the stores clothing racks a collage of the shadow images now provides the sites background "we wanted the same look of our real stores " says mr castiglioni that hasnt always been possible marni didnt want its clothes photographed on mannequins for fear such images would made the products look more ordinary yoox was convinced the clothes wouldnt sell unless shoppers could see them on a human form the compromise a frock is shown suspended as if on a hanger until the shopper clicks on it when it appears on a mannequin the site has done nearly &# million in sales in its first year mr castiglioni says about as much as a flagship store emporio armani had even more demands it wanted to introduce its site in the u s to fill in the gaps in its store network gaining access to untapped cities such as chicago a european site is scheduled to open next year and one for asia will follow armani wasnt taking any lessons on how to create a fashion aura during meetings with yooxs team at the companys milan headquarters over the course of a year mr armani would blow into appointments and spew ideas of what he wanted the year old designer was obsessed with the idea of making the site look sophisticated and not like a catalog says robert triefus giorgio armani spas vice president for communications he had his store design team hand over the architectural plans of the brands flagship store in milan so that yoox could map the web site around it visitors to the site can turn left or right just as they would at the milan store and the site even reproduces the video screen walls of the actual store but mr armani wasnt satisfied with the results and sent back the early drafts with changes he wanted the site to look three dimensional and he wanted a spotlight to shine on each product as it moved across the screen a technique used in his stores to impart elegance yoox had never used such a visual effect and it had to invent a new software code using shadows on adjacent items to create the optical illusion shooting photos was also a problem the web retailers photographers shoot items a day for yooxs own site but emporio armani kept nixing yooxs pictures some lacked the glossy fashion magazine quality that armani wanted the numerous reshoots slowed the process down and emporio armani was forced to pay yoox an extra fee to rush its products to the front of the line at the companys bologna warehouse recently mr marchetti pointed to a metal cart of emporio armani leather bags that had jumped ahead of other yoox com merchandise waiting to be photographed "these have to be shot again " he said but even emporio armani concedes that having a reliable e commerce site outweighs the risk of entrusting the brand to an outsider mr triefus expects the internet boutique to become one of the lines biggest stores within the next few years though he wont disclose sales targets and the cost of opening up shop on the web is a fraction of the real estate and design expenditures that would go into opening a store on a famous shopping avenue "we dont have to worry about the location if we opened on the wrong corner " says mr triefus
