politics &amp economics how iraq hearings segue into campaign debate u s officials face broad skepticism mccain is outlier washington after two days of tough back and forth in congress the debate over president bushs iraq strategy now moves to the campaign trail where the wars trajectory could prove decisive for several candidates the second day of congressional testimony by the two top u s officials in iraq gen david petraeus and ambassador ryan crocker gave presidential contenders from both parties a chance to serve up views on mr bushs troop surge mr bush is expected to endorse the generals plan for troop reduction in iraq in a white house speech tomorrow night after a relatively mild reception monday in the house gen petraeus and mr crocker yesterday faced heavy bipartisan skepticism in the senate as they outlined plans to reduce u s troop levels in iraq gradually through july they reiterated hopes that iraqs warring factions will find ways to reconcile the men went before two senate panels heavy with presidential contenders three democratic hopefuls sens joseph biden of delaware christopher dodd of connecticut and barack obama of illinois didnt question gen petraeuss assessment that the larger presence of u s troops has lowered violence rather they suggested that the american sacrifices were being made in the service of an overall strategy that has little chance of success sen hillary clinton of new york was the most critical of gen petraeus saying his report on improving security conditions "required a willing suspension of disbelief " she then cited other statistics that suggested little to no progress the senators all hammered iraqi politicians who have shown little will to reconcile "we have now set the bar so low that modest improvement in what was a completely chaotic situation is considered success " sen obama said "at what point do we say enough " on the republican side the candidate with the most at stake in the surge may be sen john mccain of arizona sen mccain who has long experience in foreign policy has backed mr bushs strategy sen mccain sought to portray any major shift in strategy that would reduce u s troop presence beyond the level recommended by gen petraeus as the equivalent of admitting defeat to radical islamists and iran he told gen petraeus and mr crocker that congress now had to choose whether "to build on the successes you have had or set a date for our surrender " after yesterdays hearings he set off on a three state "no surrender tour" to try to build momentum in a campaign that began to falter several months ago his schedule is heavy on campaign stops at veterans halls across iowa new hampshire and south carolina at one of the hearings sen mccain said the u s should continue the surge as long as necessary his favored line "we cannot choose to lose in iraq " but the hearing highlighted how sen mccain has become something of an outlier even among members of his own party other republicans expressed willingness to stick with the surge through next summer but were hesitant to make a long term commitment to iraq unless there is significant progress toward political reconciliation "in my judgment some type of success in iraq is possible but as policy makers we should acknowledge that we are facing extraordinarily narrow margins for achieving our goals " said sen richard lugar of indiana the top republican on the foreign relations committee nebraska sen chuck hagel who announced this week that he wouldnt run for re election next year asked the two officials "is it worth it the continued investment of american blood and treasure " the democratic presidential candidates praised the effectiveness of the u s military but suggested its sacrifices would be for naught unless the white house adopted a new strategy sen biden a foreign policy heavyweight who is trailing far behind in the democratic primary race called the surge strategy "fundamentally flawed " he has said the u s should push for a "federal" iraq with a weak central government in baghdad and largely self governing regions drawn along ethnic and religious lines mr crocker suggested that such an outcome was possible but that the iraqis would have to come to it on their own like most democrats sen biden wants to end the surge now and pull u s troops out of iraq at a much faster pace than gen petraeus advocates the general has recommended reducing the troop count to by july from about now other democrats argued that the only solution was to set a timetable for withdrawing u s troops in an effort to force iraqi officials to reconcile "the administrations message to iraqi leaders continues to be that they are doing just fine " said sen carl levin the democratic chairman of the senate armed services committee "that is the exact wrong message to send to iraqi leaders who dawdle while their nation is torn apart by sectarian strife " sen clinton who has had to defend her vote to authorize the invasion of iraq struck a much more combative tone than her chief rival for the democratic nomination sen obama who has built his presidential campaign on his opposition to the war of the four democratic hopefuls she was the only one to dwell on the sept terrorist attacks suggesting the iraq war had been a distraction that had given fuel to al qaeda instead of focusing on the past sen obama questioned the future of the u s mission in iraq "we are now confronted with the question how do we clean up the mess and make the best out of a situation in which there are bad options and worse options " sen obama asked the general and the ambassador he will lay out his newest iraq thinking in a speech this morning in iowa an adviser said sen obama will draw a sharp distinction between the iraq portrayed by the petraeus and crocker assessments while "laying out what the costs have been for the u s in terms of american blood and treasure " sen obama wont put forward a precise timetable for u s troop withdrawals the adviser said
