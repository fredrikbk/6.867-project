china to ban lead paint in toys regulators promise better surveillance following recalls responding to a public uproar over a rash of recalls u s and chinese regulators moved to ban the use of lead paint in toys and promised changes to the way chinese imports to the u s are scrutinized for safety compliance but neither government offered many details about how such a ban would be enforced chinas local governments often disregard national directives that might result in losses of tax revenue and jobs consumer and safety groups yesterday praised the agreements as a good first step but said follow through and enforcement would be key "its not clear what the impact of these new measures will be on toys that are going to be purchased for the holidays " said janell mayo duncan senior counsel at consumers union "as we move forward we need to be assured that theres monitoring going on and that these promises are being kept " the most concrete aspect of the agreement signed yesterday by officials of the consumer product safety commission and chinas general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine or aqsiq is the prohibition on using lead paint in toys u s law has long prevented manufacturers from using the toxic metal in childrens toys but many chinese suppliers have either ignored the prohibition or followed looser standards that has led to a wave of recalls of lead tainted toys sold in the u s this year "no longer can the industry tolerate an ask no questions mentality " said nancy nord the cpscs acting chairman "the stakes are just too high " toy makers said the measures would dovetail with their plans to increase inspections in china "we look forward to working with both parties to ensure that toys sold in the usa continue to be the safest in the world " the toy industry association said the regulators also adopted plans designed to better educate chinese suppliers about u s standards expand information sharing between the two countries and increase inspections of goods before they leave chinese ports while the cooperation could improve the cpscs ability to monitor events and supply chains in china the brunt of the changes will fall to the chinese authorities to carry out in the months ahead chinas central government faces challenges in implementing directives because local governments often seek to protect local businesses even if those businesses break the law in addition many of chinas export industries are dominated by smaller companies that often arent familiar with basic safety standards or arent able or willing to meet them some differences remained between u s and chinese regulators ms nord sought to quell u s consumer anxiety over the safety of chinese made products saying the steps being taken would make consumer products safer aqsiq officials argued that design flaws are often as much to blame as manufacturing ones they said u s regulators could be doing more to turn away shady exporters at its borders in an interview at aqsiqs beijing headquarters this week director general li changjiang said the person agency is stepping up efforts to certify law abiding exporters and to "severely punish" and "blacklist" companies with lax practices mr li urged u s regulators to block imports from companies that arent certified by aqsiq in some recalls involving pet food and toys this year he said american distributors were working with companies that arent certified by chinese authorities julie vallese a cpsc spokeswoman said looking at the safety practices of exporters could be "instructive because it flags potential problems " but the agency will "stick with" its "enforcement system and focus on products with possible hazards " an fda spokesman said the agency looks forward to continuing its dialogue with the chinese on food safety the agreement is unlikely to quell lawmakers desire to overhaul the cpsc so it can better tackle the safety hazards posed by products made around the world today a senate committee is set to examine the cpscs response to unsafe products from china democratic sen mark pryor of arkansas chairman of another senate committee that oversees the cpsc plans to introduce legislation that would increase hazard disclosure requirements for manufacturers boost third party testing of childrens products and strengthen the cpscs budget and ability to levy penalties for noncompliance "i applaud the cpsc and china for their efforts to make toys safer for our children " mr pryor said "however this agreement alone will not prevent dangerous products from ending up on store shelves and into consumers homes " the cpsc is also considering rules that would ban lead in childrens metal jewelry mr pryor wants to ban lead in all childrens products
