cranky skies fliers behave badly again as era fades airline personnel bear brunt of dissatisfaction rep filner faces charges for a brief time after sept civility seemed to reign in the skies above america "we had the most humble passengers ever " says frank slade a year flight attendant who now works for northwest airlines "yes maam no sir " today the picture isnt so pretty mr slade says he has been verbally assaulted by passengers twice in the past six months and he had a third insubordinate flier ejected before the plane took off "theyre not restrained at all in manner " he says american airlines told the transportation security administration in july that a passenger on a flight to new york had slapped a flight attendant across the face when the plane was ordered emptied in miami after bad weather kept the flight from leaving police were called after a summer of packed flights delays lengthy security procedures and dwindling on board amenities airlines are dealing with what many employees experts and frequent fliers themselves feel is a worrisome deterioration in passenger comportment "abnormal aberrant or abusive behavior in the context of the air travel experience" is back with a vengeance says andrew thomas an assistant professor of business at the university of akron who has written books about air rage and aviation "insecurity" and maintains a web site called airrage org mr thomas sees an entitlement mind set in todays flying public especially among business travelers "nobody tells a lot of these guys no " he says "so when a flight attendant tells them to turn off the phone or the blackberry or that they cant have another drink they dont know how to hear no " he says the numbers of unruly passenger cases tracked by government agencies vary and in many instances underreport the problem according to authorities the federal air marshal service shows a steady increase from when it began automated record keeping airport police at some large hubs also say their numbers are up in the past few years and anecdotal evidence suggests the problem along with numerous lesser displays of passenger rudeness and intolerance is on the rise mala amarsingh a jetblue airways corp attendant was standing in the las vegas airport in june waiting to hitch a ride to new york to start her shift an intoxicated female passenger approached her started cursing threatened to beat her up and then spit in her face the flight attendant says she lost her cool cursed back at the passenger and later was terminated by the airline for "inappropriate behavior " jetblue wont comment about personnel matters but says "customers traveling today are more frustrated by delays and perceived service lapses " ms amarsingh thinks "uniformed flight attendants are walking targets for passenger frustrations " which "absolutely" have gotten worse in her more than six years in the job sara nelson a united airlines flight attendant and spokeswoman for the flight attendants union says she "wouldnt necessarily say passengers are more out of control " but declining service standards mean "they have more opportunities to show their unreasonable side " ms nelson says she recently witnessed a female business traveler in her s grab an agent in the jetway when the united worker took away the travelers carry on bag to check because the overhead bins were full ms nelson says she also saw family members whose flight was canceled "claw" a customer service agent until her arms bled when the agent couldnt get them onto another flight bill horoszko a hinckley ill chemical marketer and frequent flier observes that "tension levels have just gone through the roof" because of delays cancellations and long security lines but travelers share the blame he says "its like passengers are entitled to be ignorant rude and arrogant because they purchased a ticket " he says "people are so full of themselves now its ungodly " in july a doctor who missed his northwest flight in seattle allegedly called three times to say there was a bomb on board hoping the plane would return so he could make the flight according to a federal bureau of investigation affidavit filed in u s district court in seattle the plane did come back but the doctor was arrested for allegedly making a false threat against an aircraft last month a female united airlines baggage employee at dulles airport called the metropolitan washington airports authority police after a passenger allegedly attempted to enter an employees only area pushed aside the womans outstretched arm and refused to leave officers interviewed the traveler u s rep bob filner a california democrat from chula vista and before releasing him advised him that the united worker would be pursuing charges a local magistrate issued a summons for the congressman to appear in court oct on misdemeanor assault and battery charges rep filner in a statement said "i did not want things to turn out as they did with offense obviously taken and much misunderstanding " earlier he disputed accounts of the incident as factually incorrect and said the charges were "ridiculous " united says it "regrets that the customer experienced a delay in claiming his bag " some passengers choose to fight carriers service lapses with nonviolent means for greg hansen president of a portland ore marketing and research company the last straw was a may united flight to san francisco that was delayed for nearly three hours because of mechanical problems he says the carrier should have alerted him about the delay before he got to the airport since the airline knew about it at least two hours before the scheduled departure he complains that united agents in portland didnt have any information about the delay a longtime united flier mr hansen sent numerous emails to airline officials including glenn tilton chairman and chief executive of ual corp uniteds parent company mr hansen sent a reporter copies of many of them ultimately mr hansen sent the ceo an invoice demanding immediate payment of &# for "lost productivity missed business meetings and personal activities lack of on time arrival failure to deliver the promise stress and related damages" going back to united offered him a &# travel voucher then two &# travel vouchers but mr hansen rejected that and insists the airline owes him the equivalent of more vouchers "if it was an isolated once only thing i think i would be overreacting " he says of his demands "but this is a long time relationship " he now says that although his "frustrations are valid " he has tabled his campaign for restitution united which acknowledges contact with mr hansen says if it cant get its customers where they were headed without incident "we think compensation is appropriate " lonny glover national safety and security coordinator for the association of professional flight attendants the union that represents american cabin crew members is convinced that things are getting worse passenger misconduct "happens every day " says mr glover a working attendant who says he receives the same reports american gets from its crews in august mr glover says a passenger on a flight to dallas from buenos aires drank two thirds of a bottle of his own duty free liquor got into a confrontation with several passengers then urinated in the cabin before passing out in his seat police were called to meet the plane aside from giving their attendants and airport agents better training and more support airlines can sue passengers for damages carriers also have a final secret weapon their own "no fly" lists of customers they wont transport under any circumstances see related letters "letters to the editor the sardines on jetliners are rude why is this a surprise " wsj sept
