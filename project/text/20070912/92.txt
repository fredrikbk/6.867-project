one midwest city picks condos over industry waukegan ill most midwestern towns do everything they can to lure manufacturers this city of on the shore of lake michigan is trying to kick some out for decades waukegan has suffered economically and environmentally theres been an exodus of manufacturing and industrial jobs from the area and its lakefront has been contaminated by toxic chemicals now the city wants to transform its decaying lakefront which stretches for about four miles into a waterside haven of parks upscale condos and retail stores but city officials see two longtime employers as blots on their pristine vision a hulking national gypsum co wallboard plant and a lafarge sa cement distribution center "there is a great jewel and that is the lakefront " says bill hudnut a senior resident fellow at the urban land institute a nonprofit research group in washington that helped map a plan for waukegans downtown harbor "that jewel should be burnished to its brightest effect to our way of thinking that does not mean heavy industry " but industry is putting up a fight this summer national gypsum battled a city legislative effort that would close the harbor to commercial vessels and effectively shut off the companys access to gypsum rock which the company heats pulverizes and mixes with water to make the key component in wallboard dozens of national gypsum employees and a number of lafarge workers spoke out at recent city council meetings and other community gatherings and marched in a july th parade wearing "save our jobs" t shirts national gypsum says its year old factory employing about workers in &# an hour jobs is profitable has been upgraded with the latest technology and has at least years of life left local workers are "not going to get an &# to &# an hour job making mocha frappuccinos " says steve rogers who manages the plant lafarge also wants to maintain its waukegan operation "we do support cleaning up the harbor and we would like to work with the city " says larry brewer manager of the lafarge waukegan center which employs about a dozen workers mr brewer says the city doesnt want to co exist with his company waukegan some miles north of chicago and about an hours drive away has come to a conclusion that cleveland kenosha wis and other lakefront cities reached years ago whereas shipping and manufacturing once dominated their shorelines these towns now want housing boating and boutiques to reign "were just looking to capitalize on an underperforming asset " says ray vukovich waukegans director of governmental services "wouldnt you pay more for a condominium not overlooking a pile of rock " but ushering manufacturers out of the harbor is a gamble for waukegan although the citys master plan calls generally for the development of condos stores and other waterfront amenities no specific plan is on the table and it isnt clear where the money would come from to finance new development the city says the majority would come from the private sector but isnt clear about the rest waukegan has steadily gained population in recent decades especially in its western section as the suburbs of chicago have filled out waukegans unemployment rate was in july down from in july the unemployment rate for all of lake county was in july and in july still waukegan hasnt been able to shake its reputation of high crime and economic decline says ruth wuorenma a former commercial developer who grew up in waukegan and helped the city select and oversee its master plan she says the redevelopment would draw people from around lake county one of the wealthiest in the nation for shopping boating and to live "think of it as an open spot within this area of great wealth " ms wuorenma says "if people can step back and see with a little bit fresher eyes what people who arent from there can see i think theres huge potential for waukegan " some early investors think the payoff might take time "in the next two to five years theres probably going to be a great potential here but its not there yet " says tim mcdonald owner of a waukegan real estate development firm his company is spending about &# million turning the old waukegan hotel overlooking the lakefront into condominium units founded in the mid s waukegan evolved into a rail connected manufacturing and shipping hub between chicago and milwaukee when national gypsum opened its wallboard plant in the lakefront was the regions economic center supplying about to jobs the harbor began to deteriorate in the s and s as manufacturing slipped against foreign competition and companies drifted more to roads to supply and distribute their products the toxic chemicals polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs were discovered on the land where a marine motor manufacturer had been located and in the harbor outboard marine corp had released hydraulic fluid containing the pcbs through floor drains into the harbor and soil according to the illinois environmental protection agency in after laying off hundreds of waukegan employees in the s outboard marine went bankrupt and shuttered its employee plant on the water its departure left the lakefront free of big industrial employers "we just said look as long as were being treated this way lets make it a recreational harbor " says mayor richard hyde who was a city council member at the time the city invited the urban land institute to help it craft a new vision in the council adopted a page master plan sprinkled with sunny drawings of busy promenades and lush greenbelts the two decade plan foresees the growing populations of waukegan and lake county flocking to the downtowns marina restaurants shops and newly redeveloped theater the master plan also urged the city to encourage industry on the harbor to move to another part of the city young professionals empty nesters and young families will supplant and boost the property tax base more than manufacturing city officials say "were going to treat the lakefront like our front yard instead of our backyard " says david motley a city spokesman in may the nine members of the city council unanimously passed a resolution that said it would approve a cleanup plan if it featured some key conditions the plan would have to call for federal legislation transferring responsibility for the harbor from the army corps of engineers to the city and a barrier would be installed to keep commercial ships out national gypsum learned about the resolution the day after the meeting in an email from the city "i was very surprised " says mr rogers who joined the waukegan plant in the fall of the company insists it can co exist with the condos and related projects and is pushing the council to reconsider its plans it says it likes its lakefront location because its cheaper to bring in gypsum rock by boat in recent years it planted trees on a grassy berm around its property and says it will plant more on the side facing the plot where the city envisions condos rising the company says it hasnt been found responsible for any harbor pollution today the harbors future is murkier than ever in august the city council approved a cleanup plan that included modified conditions from its earlier resolution but the u s environmental protection agency said it wouldnt approve the project without that approval the project couldnt get critical federal funding last week the city filed a lawsuit against national gypsum lafarge and other harbor industries claiming that they are liable for cleaning up the harbor under the federal superfund law the city says the vessels the companies require for their business stir up the polluted sediment with their propellers and aggravate the problem national gypsum says its reviewing the lawsuit and doesnt own the ships that bring its gypsum rock it contends the lawsuit is another effort to pressure industry to leave lafarge says its also reviewing the lawsuit and intends to stay at its current waukegan location for the years remaining on its lease
