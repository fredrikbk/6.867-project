petraeus takes the beltway so the two men best qualified to give an honest and comprehensive account of events in iraq have marched through congress to say and show that the surge is working and americas goals are still within reach yet its a sign of the u s political debate that their evidence of progress seemed to make the headlines in none of our leading news sources yesterday instead the "news" seems to be that general david petraeus has recommended that some u s troops can rotate out of iraq by the end of this year and that u s forces might be able to return to pre surge levels by next july if progress continues thats no small matter but it obscures the larger message of the testimony by the general and ambassador ryan crocker to wit the u s is gaining ground in iraq often in the least expected of ways consider some excerpts from mr crockers testimony the iraqi government puts its cell phone spectrum up for auction it nets a better than expected sum of nearly &# billion at a recent conference in dubai "hundreds of iraqi businessmen met an equal number of foreign investors newly interested in acquiring shares of business in iraq " iraqi oil is now flowing out of the country via turkish pipelines and the international monetary fund predicts economic growth for iraq of this year in the vicinity of abu ghraib men many of them former sunni insurgents have joined the shiite dominated iraqi security forces the iraqi government is quietly offering jobs or retirement packages to thousands of former soldiers many of them one time members of the baath party significantly it is doing so without taking the politically sensitive steps of declaring a general amnesty or enacting legislation on de baathification as mr crocker notes these developments "are neither measured in benchmarks nor visible to those far from baghdad " its a point that seems to have been missed by democrats on the senate armed services and foreign relations committees as well as by such republicans as john warner and dick lugar their collective view seems to be that iraq is a lost cause because the government of prime minister nouri al maliki has failed to achieve "national reconciliation " on the grounds that a series of legislative benchmarks have still not been met we dont know anyone who opposes "national reconciliation " though perhaps only on capitol hill would it be measured by the quantity of legislation passed rather than the quality of life for ordinary iraqis in the u s these measures tend to be inversely correlated yet "reconciliation" isnt something that precedes basic security it follows from it in his testimony general petraeus noted that violent civilian deaths have declined by in iraq and in baghdad car and suicide bombings are down by nearly since march another astonishing turnabout here too the good news comes from the least expected of places anbar province where sunni tribal leaders and many former insurgents have realized their best interests lie with the u s and a democratic iraqi government in which they have a say and not with al qaeda critics claim this realization has nothing to do with the surge but surely the tribal sheikhs would not risk fighting al qaeda unless they believed the u s and iraqi government had shown the will to stay and prevail progress in anbar would also have been harder had mr maliki not agreed to allow the arming of sunni tribal leaders despite the danger that could pose to shiite power mr maliki has also shown political courage by allowing the u s to go after the mahdi army of moqtada al sadr who only last year helped the prime minister get his job mr sadr recently agreed to a unilateral ceasefire after some of his men attacked shiite worshippers in karbala like al qaeda in iraq he too may have overplayed his hand and one reason for the surge to continue is to give general petraeus time to further degrade mahdi elements this will leave the iraqi security force in a stronger position to keep order after the surge one element thats still missing is the non interference of iraqs neighbors in its affairs with democratic presidential hopeful dennis kucinich paying court this week in damascus it was especially useful to hear general petraeus describe syrias role in iraq as "malign" and provide specific details of irans killing of u s soldiers and iraqi government leaders our own sources say iranian backed forces are now responsible for of u s casualties the problem of iran in iraq is worth another editorial but as the surge continues president bush is going to have to get far more serious about proving to tehran that there really are "consequences" for killing americans so far mr bush has shown the opposite as for u s politics the lesson of the last few months is that the way to gain ground on capitol hill is not with the promise of troop withdrawals as our experience in vietnam showed such withdrawals quickly become a congressional addiction all americans want fewer troops in iraq most americans also want that drawdown to be honorable and victorious the way to stop or slow the calls for too rapid withdrawal is to succeed in making further military and political progress in iraq the success of the surge so far has bought mr bush more time and support to press the initiative in baghdad and the larger middle east he owes it to general petraeus and u s troops to exploit this opening on every front including syria and iran
