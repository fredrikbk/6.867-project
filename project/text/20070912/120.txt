the afternoon report looking post putin online edition russian president vladimir putins nomination of a new prime minister surprised both hangers on and kremlinologists handicapping the horse race to succeed him after todays dismissal of prime minister mikhail fradkov mr putin nominated a little known cabinet official to be the next prime minister the move left onlookers to puzzle over its significance as the end of mr putins term looms mr putin explained the dismissal of mr fradkov which also triggered the automatic break up of his cabinet by saying it was needed to "prepare the country" for elections on dec however his nomination of victor zubkov an obscure official currently tasked with overseeing the governments anti money laundering efforts did little to clarify who will follow the popular russian leader the news of the prime minister change came amid speculation in the russian press that mr putin would likely put forward a clear favorite to be the next president though the transfer of power has a relatively short history in post soviet russia the prime ministers post is seen as an important stepping stone to the presidency mr putin himself served as prime minister before moving into the presidential slot after boris yeltsins resignation at the turn of the century today the two favorites to follow in his footsteps are former defense minister sergei ivanov and gas giant gazprom board chairman dmitry medvedev earlier today vedomosti a leading russian newspaper cited a kremlin source saying mr ivanov would be named prime minister a move which would make him the overwhelming favorite to win presidential elections in march and while the surprise nomination of mr zubkov makes the political picture murkier it doesnt necessarily mean either of the two leading candidates have been knocked out of the running said sarah mendelson a senior fellow at the russia and eurasia program at the center for strategic and international studies "if i were a betting gal id say this is not the person who is going to be the president in march " she said "but i would also say no one knows who the president is going to be " stocks rise as oil gains again
