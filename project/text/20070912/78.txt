making the grade how to get your kid a good credit report like many college kids my daughter hannah ended up with a credit card problem but it wasnt the problem i feared as students head off to college many parents worry that their sons and daughters will apply for a fistful of credit cards and amass a heap of debt indeed of freshmen have credit cards and they carry an average balance of &# according to a study by college lender nellie mae but in her freshman year hannah didnt rack up a single charge because she had a heck of a time just getting a card getting carded to be honest i dont really want hannah to have a credit card but i do want her to have a decent credit score and one of the best ways to earn that score is to get a credit card charge a small sum each month and then dutifully pay off the balance but which card for years hannah had regularly been offered credit cards by the continental frequent flier program so i figured the folks there were eager for her business instead what she got was a swift rejection next hannah applied for a credit card specifically designed for college students that earned her another rejection on the grounds she had insufficient credit history that got me curious so i headed to annualcreditreport com where once a year you can get a free copy of your credit report from the three major credit bureaus i retrieved one of hannahs reports and sure enough she had no credit history indeed credit expert john ulzheimer author of "youre nothing but a number " says pulling your kids credit reports should probably be your first step that will allow you to see what sort of history your child has and whether there are any errors that need correcting seeking approval got a kid like hannah with no credit history if your child has a checking or savings account see if the bank will also give your kid a credit card alternatively your child could apply for the store cards offered by many retailers which are typically easier to get than general use credit cards college students might also respond to one of the credit card solicitations they receive on campus these however dont seem as prevalent as they used to be hannah has received only a few offers through the mail and has never seen a card issuer with a booth on campus and some of her friends at other colleges report the same thing if your child has a blemished credit history the only option may be a secured card with these cards you put down maybe &# or &# as collateral that sum then determines the cards credit line before applying for a secured card check that the fees are reasonable that the card issuer reports to the major credit bureaus and that the card converts to an unsecured card after a year or two mr ulzheimer says secured cardholders should charge only a nominal sum each month since they could hurt their credit score by using more than or of their available credit another trick if you buy a new or used car for your teenager have your child cosign the auto loan "i wouldnt buy a brand new hummer to establish a credit record for the kid " says scott bilker founder of debtsmart com "but if youre going to buy a car anyway it would be a quick way to get a credit record " with hannah however i didnt use any of the above strategies instead i simply added her name to my visa card within a month the cards credit history was included in her credit report so shes now in good shape to apply for a card on her own there are two ways to add a child in the past many parents have included their children as authorized users this strategy might work through the end of mr ulzheimer says but the credit bureaus are closing this loophole because it was being abused by some credit repair businesses what to do you could add your child as a joint account holder be warned while authorized users arent legally liable for a cards debts joint account holders are in addition if you want to end the arrangement you cant just take your child off the joint account rather you have to cancel the card entirely costly education some students have trouble getting credit cards while others struggle with them just of graduate students pay off their credit card bills in full each month among undergraduates with credit cards the average balance is &# source nellie mae
