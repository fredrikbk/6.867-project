common sense for long term investors dont sweat the volatility smartmoney i was somewhat surprised this week when i got around to checking my portfolio for all the recent turmoil it was exactly where it had been the last time i checked which was over a week earlier this confirms something ive long believed which is that volatility in and of itself should be meaningless to the long term investor most people i know are far too transfixed by the value of their assets at any given moment when they should be focusing on some point in the future when they will actually need their assets for a down payment on a home for college tuition or for retirement as ive said many times if you need your savings right now you should be in cash or a cash equivalent not stocks then you have no volatility for everyone else the only thing that matters is what your assets are worth when you need them the fact that recent market upheavals have barely dented my own portfolio has reinforced my view that many stocks werent especially overvalued even at their recent peaks this summer at least compared with assets like real estate this may come as a revelation to people mired in news of the subprime and credit crises but for many stock investors this wasnt a bad summer at all not only are major averages still positive for the year but many stocks are higher now than they were at the markets peak july out of curiosity i took a look at a list of stocks that were higher in mid august at the markets recent low point than they were july there were of them with market capitalizations of more than &# million theres no guarantee they will keep gaining of course but they do provide something of a road map for times of market turmoil the vast majority were in two sectors consumer nondiscretionary and health care the classic defensive sectors in times of market slumps both areas have underperformed in recent years among the prominent high quality companies that were higher in august than july are beverage giants coca cola and pepsico at &# and &# respectively this week both are just under their week highs two others are procter &amp gamble and kimberly clark all are the kind of large cap growth companies ive been arguing arent overvalued two other companies ive previously recommended and own drugstore and medical benefits chain cvs caremark and organic grocery purveyor whole foods market also made the list among the large number of health care companies that made the list in all were merck biogen idec celgene idexx laboratories becton dickinson and medtronic i dont own many individual health care companies preferring exposure through exchange traded funds and mutual funds they havent done as well as these individual stocks but still show gains over the past year for the ishares global healthcare fund and for the ishares nasdaq biotechnology fund so lets keep things in perspective as the market reacts to data like last weeks weak employment report there may well be more bad news and more volatility before we gain some clarity about the future strength of the economy that doesnt mean patient investors need lose any sleep james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
