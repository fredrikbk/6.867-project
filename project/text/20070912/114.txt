technology gets inside hurricanes new technology on the ground and in the air is giving meteorologists better tools to measure the size and strength of hurricanes before they hit land potentially saving lives and millions of dollars among the innovations is one that allows measurement of surface weather conditions from feet up and one result of the data has been the ability to better determine how much of a coastal area should undertake a costly evacuation the improvements are even more important because weather experts have forecast a long term cycle for hurricane seasons which run from june through november to include more storms than usual for the next years or so due to warmer ocean temperatures this year the national oceanic and atmospheric administration the governments weather research arm expects between seven and nine hurricanes to form in areas that could affect the u s that includes between three and five major storms of category or higher with winds of to miles per hour and a storm surge pushing waves six to eight feet higher than normal there is no way to tell where the storms may originate all hurricanes start in the ocean as small tropical storms once hurricanes have been identified special aircraft in the u s air forces hurricane hunters squadron fly into the storm to collect real time information new equipment in the past two years has increased the accuracy of data by said lt col roy deatherage a meteorologist in the air force reserve command rd wing at keesler air force base in mississippi the biggest improvement came just before hurricane katrina hit in when the air force unit upgraded its fleet of aircraft to lockheed martin corp s c j planes lt col deatherage said the aircraft are faster and safer in turbulent air than their predecessors the c j cockpit can also accommodate a wider range of technical devices lt col deatherage flew into the eye of katrina just as the storm hit land "we were able to collect a higher resolution of data than ever before " he said "we were looking at the same data but sampling more often as we flew " data are sent by satellite to noaas hurricane center lt col deatherage and other pilots fly missions at an altitude of feet it takes about two hours to cover an x pattern radiating out about miles on each side of the storms center in a busy hurricane year the hurricane hunters flew that mission times public affairs officer maj chad gibson said the hurricane hunters missions add details to satellite pictures collected by noaa "its like a medical procedure where the satellite photo is the x ray and then we do a biopsy " he said this year the data grew more detailed with the addition of the stepped frequency microwave radiometer made by prosensing a private systems engineering company in amherst mass nicknamed "the smurf " the radiometer was built for the u s navy to measure ocean salinity it has since been redesigned to sense microwave radiation emitted from foam created on the ocean by winds at the surface computers then calculate the wind speeds based on the levels of microwave radiation in the past computer models could only estimate surface conditions last week the sfmr closely followed hurricane felix tracking its movement and strength when hurricane dean last month crossed mexicos yucatan peninsula scientists for the first time were able to measure the weakening of a hurricane after it crosses over land even though dean kept moving north through the gulf of mexico the storm was too weak to pose a threat to the u s the scientists determined "the sfmr allows us to see the structure of the hurricane hours before landfall " lt col deatherage said although he was surprised by its accuracy he said the technology does have limitations for example it doesnt work in shallow water additional diagnostic tools are on the way the air force is considering adding an infrared system currently being fitted on c j reconnaissance planes for the u s coast guard
