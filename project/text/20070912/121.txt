the daily fix spygate between pats jets is really a family quarrel online edition what did the new england patriots know and when did they know it the nfl has reportedly determined the pats cheated by videotaping the new york jets coaches sending signals during sundays pats win new england video assistant matt estrella was approached by league security officials during the games first quarter and had his camera and videotape seized sanctions could include suspensions fines and lost draft picks the last an old standby for football misdeeds whats the advantage of videotaping signals anyway in the boston globe mike reiss offers a primer in paranoia and a road map of the borderline incestuous pats jets family tree that tangled family tree isnt a sideshow in the new york daily news rich cimini writes that jets coach eric mangini formerly one of pats coach bill belichicks assistants arrived last year with inside knowledge of the pats sign sleuthing and it was the jets who tipped off nfl security mr cimini supplies lots of dirt including juicy details about an under the grandstand dispute that eventually came to involve mr estrella league security jets security pats security and new jersey state troopers yes really the pats have long been suspected of skullduggery though the fix should note that calling your opponent a cheater is often the last refuge of the beaten and the incident has brought out the long knives of belichick detractors sticking with the daily news gary myers says the coach if guilty should be suspended for the pats jets rematch in december "he should not only be suspended for a game but just as important be banned from the patriots facility for the entire week leading up to the game " mr myers writes "no meetings no practice how could the nfl keep belichick away from his team since the league is always thinking of new marketing tools one club official suggested an nfl sanctioned ankle bracelet it would have to be color coordinated of course to match his hoodie with the sleeves cut off " thats mild compared to msnbcs bob cook who also wants mr belichick suspended but for "a bad attitude that has played out in ways that makes terrell owens queasy only belichicks lack of throwing furniture and his omnipresent monotone keeps his reputation from completely spilling over into bob knight territory hes a jerk but not one you hear screaming a lot " mr belichick by the way ensured columnists full employment tomorrow with comments this morning that were right out of the conditional grudging athletic apology playbook he said hed spoken with nfl commissioner roger goodell about a "videotaping procedure" and "my interpretation of the rules " then said "although it remains a league matter i want to apologize to everyone who has been affected most of all ownership staff and players " last night the chicago cubs coughed up a lead in houston and wound up losing to the astros in that coupled with the milwaukee brewers win in pittsburgh left the cubs a game back in baseballs tightest race and left the chicago tribunes phil rogers shaking his head "if the cubs are going to play baseball in october they must win the winnable games in september " he writes "perhaps you can go in one run games in april and may as the cubs did because there is time still to win your share of the close ones but if they let games get away in september the cubs are going to find themselves watching the milwaukee brewers in october trust me theyre going to like this less than anyone including the television networks " farther east the philadelphia phillies division hopes are slim with to play theyre six back of the new york mets to whom phils outfielder pat burrell conceded the crown yesterday but theyre just very much in contention for the wild card thats not terribly comforting for philadelphians though the phils missed a wild card berth by one game in by three in and now stand games behind the san diego padres in this years hunt can the phils make up the difference inquirer columnist bob ford says no and blames the clubs starting pitching "the phillies starters as a unit arent capable of producing the kind of stretch the team will need eventually even just to sneak into the postseason " he writes adding that "there is nothing to do now but wait the wait watch the games fall slowly off the schedule with a win here maybe a couple here a loss here another until the team comes to rest somewhere right around wins same as last season in the hunt but just behind the baying pack it will be another solemn end and another year tacked to the lengthening string of frustration but at least everyone concerned is used to it " in a philly com poll accompanying mr fords column readers were asked which team is the greatest threat to the phils wild card chances the winner so far "themselves " with of the vote ah philadelphia its being billed as the shame bowl on saturday michigan and notre dame will meet with both programs in crisis the wolverines kicked off their season with a shocking loss to appalachian state then got crushed by oregon the formerly fighting irish have the worst offense of division i a schools and so far their season shows losses to georgia tech and penn state "i smell a dead wolverine in the middle of the road " writes mike downey in the chicago tribune "and oh man whatever is in that leprechauns pot right now sure isnt gold michigan vs notre dame coming up saturday has gone from a classic college football confrontation to the stink bomb of the century i never thought id live to see a day when a game between these gridiron monsters of the midwest would be to see which one of them gets to begin the season this is sad its like watching muhammad ali when he didnt pack a punch anymore or like watching willie mays play center field for the mets it is sad to everyone except those people out there who dont care for michigan or notre dame one itty bitty bit they must all feel as if aladdin has granted them two of their three wishes " in the detroit free press drew sharp writes that "a winless michigan facing a winless notre dame for the first time provides irrefutable evidence that god has a sense of humor both programs find comfort in their delusions both believe that this weeks criticisms and catcalls are a by product of envy rather than honest assessments that maybe just maybe neither is as good as its reputation this week proves there is justice " saturdays game between the miami hurricanes and florida international universitys golden panthers will be on espnu why the high profile coverage for a game thats expected to be a canes romp because of the two teams epic brawl last october a scene that made a deadspin hall of famer out of fius amod ned who hobbled into the fracas on his crutches in the miami herald greg cote says bloodthirsty voyeurs will be disappointed the brawl sparked firings on both sides fius don strock and miamis larry coker are both gone and a zero tolerance policy for fighting at miami "there will be no greater hub of brotherhood and sportsmanship in america and certainly no more mannerly place in south florida than the orange bowl on saturday " mr cote writes adding "the usual careening honking road rage might be going on all around the stadium this is miami but inside the bowl you can expect a festival of fair play players at the strong behest of their administrators and new head coaches will do everything but wear flowers in their helmet ear holes and say my bad after hard tackles miss manners should be in the broadcast booth for a proper analysis of each teams neighborliness " tip of the fix cap to reader garey g ris found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at
