pyongyangs blues north korean diplomats the worlds least accommodating individuals have suddenly turned cooperative in february they agreed to shut down their only working reactor declare the full extent of their nuclear programs and disable all of them for a surprisingly low price of about &# million of fuel oil and a promise of normalization of relations in july pyongyang actually switched off its yongbyon reactor in the presence of inspectors from the u n s international atomic energy agency whom they had kicked out in december earlier this month assistant secretary of state christopher hill after two days of bilateral discussions with north koreas kim gye gwan in geneva announced that pyongyang would complete its extensive february denuclearization promises by the end of this year just yesterday at the norths invitation inspectors from the u s china and russia arrived in the country to examine methods of disabling its nuclear facilities although it is unclear if pyongyang has actually agreed to the year end deadline there has been stunning progress in our long stalled efforts to disarm north korea some such as john bolton writing in these pages essentially say that washington is making concessions to obtain the appearance of cooperation mr bolton is certainly right yet previous administrations have been willing to offer benefits and have not gotten even this far moreover pyongyang flatly turned down president bushs "bold initiative " discussed in late and early to improve relations so the question remains why is north korea signaling it wants to give up its nuclear weapons programs at this time north koreas crafty leader kim jong il undoubtedly has his eye on the south korean election calendar especially the presidential contest this december he surely wants to create good news to help defeat the surging grand national party which has a more skeptical view of the north than the "progressives" now in power yet electoral politics in the south as important as they are to pyongyang hardly explain the dramatic events taking place in the nuclear negotiations there are it appears more fundamental reasons for pyongyangs recent about face first and foremost north koreas economy shrank in for the first time in eight years according to the bank of korea the contraction estimated at followed a increase in crop yields are bound to be worse this year devastating floods last month triggered by the heaviest rain in years destroyed more than of the norths rice and corn fields according to official media although the bad news may be hyped to obtain aid from the international community the north korean economy will certainly be worse this year than last some observers are talking about another famine kim escaped much of the blame for the last one which killed an estimated two million people in the middle of last decade but his disastrous policies are clearly responsible for todays falling agricultural output the bad economic news comes at an especially sensitive moment for kim he flew in a team of german surgeons to perform secret cardiac surgery in may of this year probably a bypass judging from photos taken in early july he has lost large patches of hair on his head and tires easily his slow recovery from surgery cannot be helping him mediate the conflict between two of his sons jong nam and jong chul who are jockeying to succeed him the older of the two jong nam just returned to pyongyang after living in beijing and macau in semi exile after he was nabbed in for trying to enter japan under a fake dominican passport he appears to be gaining in the succession struggle with his younger half brother but the matter is unresolved and bound to be a source of continuing instability for the regime the turmoil inside pyongyang and the recent progress on the nuclear front fits into a pattern the most important nuclear agreement between the u s and north korea the agreed framework was signed just three months after the july death of kim il sung the nations founder pyongyang entered into that arrangement when kim jong il had yet to consolidate power and when it appeared that north korea would collapse the agreed framework rescued the kim dynasty strengthening the regime by providing an economic lifeline of heavy fuel oil and construction for light water reactors more important the agreed framework signaled to pyongyangs elite american acceptance of the regimes existence in the wake of kim il sungs passing by signing this document the clinton administration refused to call it a "treaty" to avoid the need for senate ratification washington bought time for the one man regime that at that moment had no man to run it after kim jong il managed to formally assume power and guide the north to economic stability he pushed ahead with his nuclear weapons efforts by late he felt confident enough to have one of his envoys boast to james kelly christopher hills predecessor that his nation had a secret uranium weapons program the kim family apparently bargains over nuclear issues only when regime succession is in jeopardy so the bush administration has a narrow window to actually disarm the worlds most militant state probably no more than nine months once the regime steadies itself it will not give up its weapons the apparent progress of the last few months is an indication that once again the country is shaky this is not a time for the bush administration to make any more concessions mr chang is the author of "nuclear showdown north korea takes on the world" random house
