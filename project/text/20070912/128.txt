the who what where of the whydah from slave ship to pirate vessel real pirates cincinnati museum center through jan the exhibit then travels to philadelphia phoenix and other cities cincinnati samuel bellamy didnt set out to be a pirate keep that in mind as you tour the exhibit galleries in "real pirates the untold story of the whydah from slave ship to pirate ship " the pistols and pikes cannons african gold and yes silver pieces of eight displayed here at the cincinnati museum center through jan then traveling to philadelphia phoenix and other cities were the result of plan b when bellamy sailed from cape cod in the fall of he was after treasure from the spanish plate silver fleet wrecked in a july hurricane along the florida coast just north of todays vero beach alas by the time bellamy got there not only had the easy pickings been removed by indian divers drafted by a spanish relief expedition sent from havana but the english pirate henry jennings had also dropped by and collected a tidy amount though jennings had arrived after most of the treasure had been sent back to havana he was able to take the rest thoughtfully brought to dry land by the spaniards and awaiting shipment in a lightly guarded fort on the beach rather than return broke and humiliated bellamy his business partner palgrave williams whose father had been the attorney general of rhode island and their crew decided to "go on the account" nautical slang for turning pirate during the next year and a half they had a remarkable run sailing with edward teach the soon to be notorious "blackbeard" henry jennings whom they double crossed and other buccaneers during this "golden age of piracy " capturing more than vessels one of the last of these prizes taken in february was the whydah a slave ship built in london in the whydah was a galley a fast sailing well armed vessel that didnt draw much water allowing her to get in close to the west africa coast to pick up her human chattel without fear of running aground when bellamy now known as "black sam bellamy " boarded her she had already offloaded her slaves and was carrying a cargo of sugar and indigo and chests of silver and gold the pirates not only kept the specie they kept the ship it had taken their sloop the sultana three days to overtake the larger whydah which proved she was a good sailor plus there was more room for their loot but two months later just after capturing the mary anne a small boat loaded with madeira wine which may have had something to do with what happened next the whydah itself sank in a storm on april just off wellfleet on cape cod bellamys home he and others died as the breakers tore the ship apart and crashed down on those who tried to make it to land only two men on the whydah survived the ordeal but the seven pirates onboard the captured wine ship were able to run her on to the shore and make their escape from the sea before they and the whydahs tiny remnant were captured and tried for piracy six of the nine were hanged in boston it wasnt piratical bloodshed that frightened the authorities there is no record of bellamy having killed anyone after a ship surrendered to him rather it was the pirates challenge to property and hierarchy in "the history of the pirates" long thought to be by daniel defoe writing under a pseudonym though that attribution is now disputed the author has bellamy declare "i am a free prince and i have as much authority to make war on the whole world as he who has a hundred sail of ships at sea and an army of men in the field and this my conscience tells me " while the speech was likely dreamed up by the author of "the history " bellamy was known to refer to himself as the robin hood of the sea and at the trial of his fellow pirates the prosecutor noted that spartacus had been a greater threat to rome than hannibal finding the remains of the whydah was always barry cliffords plan a he had grown up on the cape hearing stories and legends about the ship from his uncle bill while many scoffed and scholars assumed that any treasure had either been found by beachcombers soon after the storm or was never there in the first place mr clifford persevered and found his first whydah artifacts in but it was only when the ships bell was found after years of diving that skeptics admitted that mr cliffords wreck and the whydah were one and the same he had found the first ever documented pirate shipwreck inscribed "the whydah galley " around its top and submerged at eye level in a large tank of water to preserve it from the elements the bell is the first object encountered as visitors enter the show mr cliffords team is still diving on the site today and has brought up thousands of items more than of which are on view here the long and complicated recovery saga is best told in mr cliffords book "expedition whydah " written with paul perry but the story of the whydah herself bellamy and his crew is given concrete form in "real pirates " it was obvious from his prepared remarks at the press briefing and subsequent interviews at the exhibition itself that neither time nor controversy lessened mr cliffords enthusiasm for the project he seemed as eager in person as in his book to give the slave ship whydah as much attention as the pirate ship whydah early attempts to construct a whydah museum in boston and tampa fla were scuttled by accusations that the ships african history had been played down to make sure that slaverys role was properly explained the organizers of the exhibition national geographic and arts and exhibitions international and the cincinnati museum center formed an advisory panel of academics and scholars to review the content of the show happily the panel seems to have provided more than just political insulation and emphasizing the ties between africa and america both profitable and cruel has lifted "real pirates" from easy popularity and made it revelatory providing connections that link the aztecs of mexico and ivory from african elephants to puritan divine cotton mather who preached to the condemned pirates and john f kennedy jr who made the first dive on the whydah when it was found in indeed the vessel was named after the largest slaving port in africa now known as ouidah on the coast of benin an illustration of "williams fort at whydah " in the first gallery a sort of puff piece promising talented but tractable workers talks of "the natives who are accounted the best husband men and worst warriours in guinea " displayed nearby is a silver branding needle used to mark slaves with the name of the ship that took them to the new world next to it are shackles cast from the void left when the original object eventually rusted away underwater and an iron bar seven of which bought one person a short but fascinating video of ouidah shows the actual beach where the enslaved people were loaded onto boats and rowed out through the surf to the ship but fortunes could change in fact almost of all pirate crews were of african descent and there were blacks among bellamys crew that captured the slaver as well as at least one indian and whites from many nations including holland sweden france england scotland and the new england colonies pewter spoons and plates buckles and cufflinks scissors candlesticks a teapot clay pipes and gaming tokens navigational instruments and carpenters tools brought up from the wreck give a hint of everyday life on board the whydah there are some "pirates of the carribean" esque tableaux of a tavern and bellamys cabin in a life size reproduction of the whydahs stern complete with mannequins in period dress but theres nothing wrong with this as they are bracketed by plenty of actual artifacts and will help to hold childrens interest and the large and dramatic murals painted by greg manchess illustrating incidents from bellamys cruise including the pirates swarming aboard a french merchantman off cuba provide just the right sort of boys own adventure atmosphere a la howard pyle or n c wyeth but what will really get the kids and adults too are the rooms full of weapons coins and ingots with chests seemingly full of silver reals some of which you can actually touch and akan gold from ghana worked into beads and ornaments theres a wonderful pistol of wood and brass found with a silk ribbon and hemp holster its escutcheon is decorated with the face of the oak holly king a celtic deity also meant to represent william iii of england though the pirates themselves seemed to have had jacobite sympathies with the exiled stuarts when thomas davis a ships carpenter captured on the st michael was reluctant to join bellamys crew one pirate said "damn him he is a presbyterian dog and should fight for king james " in the end davis was forced on board he was one of the two men who escaped both the shipwreck and the hangmans noose the other john julian was a moskito indian probably sold into slavery without trial not so lucky was young john king almost years old when he drowned that stormy april night king had threatened to kill both himself and his mother if she did not let him join the pirates when the ship they were passengers on was captured by bellamy one of his silk stockings and small leather shoes are on display mute testimony of what could happen to a real life jim hawkins hero of stevensons
