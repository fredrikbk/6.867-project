lord of the files his jazz discography rocks in the original dixieland jass band made the first jazz record the five man band had just come to new york and stirred something of a midtown meltdown with its guilty pleasures "disaster is coming to hundreds of young girls " one guardian of public morals warned fortunately public morality was no concern of columbia records which promptly recorded the band and kick started the history of recorded jazz as landmark firsts go the odjb may not rank with gutenberg or even lindbergh still here we are years later with a large legacy on our hands if someone were to assemble a list of every jazz record it would cover about printed pages which brings us to tom lord a jazz researcher in vancouver british columbia who has done just that mr lord became hooked on the music at age when he saw louis armstrong in "the glenn miller story " but it was his success as a mechanical engineer and president of an international container company that permitted him to pursue his private passion for records he is now most noted as the compiler of "the jazz discography " a huge work that he began in the s and that eventually grew to page volumes at a retail cost of about &# but such reference works have a way of becoming obsolete the moment theyre published so mr lord did it differently he built his information empire on a database not a manuscript it was a leap of innovation that has allowed him to move beyond books and produce "the jazz discography" as a single cd rom version available at www lordisco com whose extraordinary search options can navigate millions of names numbers and songs with a few keystrokes the result is a treasure trove full of surprises that will fascinate any student of american music eager to know the most recorded songs the most recorded musicians and the nature of jazz itself a discography is a mix of bookkeeping and excavation after the odjb made its splash jazz dipped underground and sped through the next years with an amiable disregard for its own accumulating history it wasnt until benny goodman became a sensation in the s that jazz acquired a curiosity about its fabled past in charles delauney became jazzs first boswell when his page discography "hot discographie " was published in france it would be the rosetta stone for all record research to follow listing master numbers labels dates personnel and catalog numbers for hundreds of jazz sessions over the next years the science of discography grew and evolved mr lord picked up the baton in the early s using his computer skills to develop an index for the canadian jazz magazine cadence "i did it in a computerized spread sheet called lotus a dos based program that cross referenced interviews record and book reviews in computers were pretty new things but after developing that database i began to think there could be an application in the discography field i figured it would take me about three or four months to do the database well it ended up taking me three years a discography looks very simple in print but theres a lot behind it in terms of programming also theres the sheer task of sitting down at a keyboard and typing decades of detail into a database at times its just an overwhelming task " mr lord hired several assistants who hammered away at the endless procession of names and numbers when enough data piled up to fill pages mr lord explains a new volume would appear eleven years and volumes later he finally made it through the zs in another eight books of indexes and addendums followed bringing the total work to volumes in but by then publishing had changed and in "the jazz discography" appeared as a cd rom for the first time it was programmed to search leaders musicians and songs and went up to the year since then fresh entries have been added in annual revisions the latest version has expanded search options that include dates words and phrases search the phrase "wall street " for example and youll find one tune called no kidding "the provincial correspondent to the wall street journal " there is only one record of that song by dick goodwin in but mr lords database shows versions of "body and soul " making it the most recorded melody in jazz history new zealand disc jockey john joyce used mr lords latest cd rom to break out a list of songs logging more than recordings he found in all of which surpassed versions following "body and soul" are "st louis blues" "summertime" "sweet georgia brown" "take the a train" and "round midnight" such lists are fascinating because they impose a sense of order on the chaos of factoids of those songs for example are by duke ellington six by george gershwin and three by cole porter one third were written by working jazz musicians the rest by songwriters the most recent is erroll garners "misty " with recordings since but the late critic whitney balliett didnt call jazz "the sound of surprise" for nothing mr lords complete song index shows versions of "hey jude " each of "blowin in the wind" and "mrs robinson " plus slumming tours of "satisfaction" "purple rain" three and even "thriller" two almost as surprising is what the data say about musicians of the most recorded jazzmen for instance four are bassists including milt hinton who tops the entire list at sessions ellington is a close second of the most recorded jazzmen in history i count only nine still living suggesting the scarcity of recording opportunities in recent decades among those not among the most prolific are miles davis john coltrane dizzy gillespie charlie parker and oscar peterson not in the index at all are washington attorney leonard garment and former fed chairman alan greenspan an understandable omission perhaps yet each played bebop saxophone in the henry jerome orchestra of and can be heard on an obscure jerome cd called "a taste of crazy rhythm " according to mr garments autobiography this is the kind of oversight now easily corrected beyond such gee whiz trivia though a discography by its choices defines its domain "thats a whole other thing " says mr lord "what is jazz i dont know that i want to get into that it would be impossible with the number of recordings im handling to listen to every one even if they were available frankly in the end its an arbitrary call but we try to include any recordings that have jazz content or performers in them " so blues singers bessie smith and ma rainey who recorded with many jazz musicians are in while a rural bluesman like robert johnson who didnt is out tony bennett frank sinatra and bing crosby are covered selectively as is rosemary clooney there are surprises here too jackie gleason who fellow traveled with jazzmen on his mood music albums claims sessions lawrence welk gets six and kenny g is listed as a sideman on two early dates even frank zappas "jazz from hell" is included nora joness "come away with me" is also in but with the notation "limited jazz content " so jazz geeks may quibble about this inclusion or that omission but mr lord has cast a wide net knowing that revisions will be easy and that in the years since the first jazz record the definition of jazz has become a moving and often controversial target now with its legacy securely digitized the music has a basic reference work that can move as fast as the music mr mcdonough writes about jazz for the journal
