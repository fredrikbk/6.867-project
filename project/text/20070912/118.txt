small banks risk catching credit ills their branches may be far from wall street but some regional banks may be exposed to the same kinds of issues that are causing headaches for the worlds largest financial institutions hungry for growth in recent years regional banks have pumped up their traditional investment portfolios by buying loans that have financed the leveraged buyout boom and like their larger brethren some also have formed off balance sheet vehicles that issue commercial paper short term debt that many companies use as an alternative to bank loans those strategies worked well when markets were flowing and credit quality remained unusually pristine but that might not be the case for long amid concerns of a slowing economy and as investors shy away from markets that have suffered in the wake of the subprime mortgage fallout cleveland based national city corp zions bancorp of salt lake city and comerica inc of dallas are among a number of banks that could see the value of their loans fall if the economy worsens analysts say the potential exposure isnt a serious threat to the overall financial health of these institutions for now but the banks may well need to address these issues in coming months by boosting reserves which cuts into earnings cutting back lending or scaling back some other operations as a result investors and analysts are scouring financial filings to determine regional bank exposure to the markets turmoil in recent days a number of banks have disclosed additional details about their exposure david konrad of boutique financial services firm keefe bruyette &amp woods says that a number of regional banks will have plenty to lose if the leveraged buyout boom continues to dry up and if the companies being acquired run into trouble in a slowing economy banks could be forced to write down those loans which would cut into earnings although large banks typically lead the massive financings that accompany leveraged buyouts they often syndicate those loans to other investors including regional banks those other buyers of the loans typically dont receive any of the fees that big banks receive from putting the deals together but share in the risk of default in a weakening credit environment "it really makes it hard for a reasonable return if you are just a participant" in the loans mr konrad says mr konrad recently examined the number of syndicated loans that banks were involved with last year as well as the percentage of them in which they were only a participant meaning they werent generating any additional fees from the deal among the banks he cites as being most at risk to a market downturn is national city which last year was involved in syndicated loans and was a participant only in of them last week national city provided some additional information for investors saying that it is sitting on &# billion of highly leveraged loans from customers some of the total came from private equity deals the company said mr konrad also cited comerica which participated in syndicated loans last year of which were on a participant only basis in a speech to investors and analysts yesterday comerica chairman ralph babb stressed that the bank regularly seeks to develop revenue generating relationships from companies involved in syndicated deals such as cash management foreign exchange or bond issuance "we typically allow up to two years to obtain these additional products and services or we exit the credit " he said "we dont compromise our credit standards return expectations or exposure guidelines in order to participate in a syndicated facility " off balance sheet commercial paper conduits have proved another source for investor angst in recent weeks that is because banks often agree to provide emergency funds to the vehicles if they cant resell their short term notes when they come due when that happens banks are essentially forced to lend the conduits money that can constrain the banks lending ability and prospects for growth like the leveraged loan exposure the biggest conduit exposures and commitments to provide backstop funding in terms of absolute dollars are at the major international money center banks like citigroup inc j p morgan chase &amp co and bank of america corp but a handful of regional banks have exposures that although small in dollar terms are sizable when measured as a percentage of total assets zions for example is affiliated with a conduit that has about &# billion in assets according to materials handed out in advance of a presentation that chairman and chief executive harris simmons is expected to give today at a lehman brothers financial services conference in new york that would be equal to about of the banks assets according to a recent research report by bank of america the zions presentation added that the bank hasnt had to provide funding through liquidity backstop agreements to the conduit among other banks with conduit exposure pittsburgh based pnc financial services group inc says it has liquidity commitment to conduits of &# billion which is equal to about of assets "economically its not something we are worried about " said william demchack vice chairman at pnc "these are good clients " so far investors fears about banks having to bail out conduits on a large scale havent materialized still even smaller banks conduit exposure can be chunky when looked at as a percentage of assets colonial bancgroup inc montgomery ala has liquidity backstop agreements for conduits that are less than &# billion but those commitments are equal to of assets according to federal reserve data in a statement colonial chairman and chief executive robert lowder said "our liquidity position is strong best it has been in years our partner in the commercial paper vehicle isnt experiencing any problems selling commercial paper on the assets "
