ternium venezuela strike three year pricing deal investing in venezuela requires a strong stomach even for friends of the countrys mercurial president hugo chavez latin american steelmaker ternium sa has been grappling with this lesson since may when mr chavez first threatened to nationalize the companys venezuelan unit sidor ternium fended off nationalization in late august when it signed a three year agreement with the venezuelan government over domestic steel prices and supply terniums tenacity in sticking with its sidor operations illustrates both the economic benefits at stake for the company and the political symbiosis between the venezuelan and argentine governments ternium which is based in luxembourg but owned by closely held argentine industrial group techint operates in argentina mexico and venezuela techint formed ternium in to consolidate steel assets in latin america ternium has a market capitalization of about &# billion and generated net sales of &# billion in the second quarter terniums american depositary receipts which have been trading around &# on the new york stock exchange have recovered about since mid april when ivan hernandez venezuelas vice mining minister said the government should have a majority stake in sidor mining minister jose khan later said that his deputys remarks reflected his personal opinion and not an official government stance but mr chavez made his own nationalization threat against sidor in early may the shares remain off their week high of &# a level reached in mid july before global financial markets began tumbling under the agreement with the venezuelan government sidor will set domestic prices for its products based on average prices for comparable exports local prices are expected to fall as a result though j p morgan analysts said in a research note that "something of this nature was already largely expected and reflected in terniums share price " ternium also agreed to grant a discount for venezuelan cooperatives and local companies involved in social programs and offer a discount on products used in state development projects the company may be facing lower prices in venezuela but the agreement appeases the chavez administration and "makes them welcome in the years to come" so ternium can "make their money in peace " said mark turner a peru based latin american equity analyst at hallgarten &amp co by locking in three years of stability for its sidor operations ternium is able to tap into a red hot construction sector that is growing rapidly as the venezuelan government pours money into development projects such as hospitals and roads and infrastructure ternium declined to comment on its operations in venezuela and said it wasnt giving further comment on the sidor agreement beyond a press statement issued on aug the day the deal was signed in the statement sidor reiterated its plan to make &# million in capital investments between and &# million of which is earmarked for an environmental protection plan j p morgan said the company planned on the &# million in capital expenditures before the sidor agreement was reached ternium said earlier this month it would also invest more than &# million over the next four years to increase capacity in argentina central and south america make up most of terniums sales but the company expects the north american percentage to increase as it consolidates results from mexican steelmaker grupo imsa which it acquired in late july for &# billion in the first half of north america accounted for about of terniums net sales of long and flat steel products while central and south america accounted for of net sales the company is projecting north americas percentage of net sales will jump to about including imsa but sustained growth in mexico is less certain given the countrys vulnerability to a slowdown if growth were to decelerate in the u s in contrast venezuelas economy is growing at a breakneck pace gross domestic product was up in according to central bank data the construction sector expanded last year "the venezuelan government of course was keen on reviewing the terms of the contract but also not necessarily keen on pushing out a large steel operator at a time when venezuelas construction sector is growing at a very robust pace " said patrick esteruelas an analyst at the eurasia group a political risk consulting firm based in new york "the chavez administration is under increasing pressure to make sure enough steel is produced " investors do take mr chavezs nationalization threats seriously given the governments success earlier this year in taking controlling stakes in heavy oil projects that were formerly majority owned by foreign oil majors the government also nationalized the telecommunications and electricity sectors sidor was a special case because of argentinas friendly relationship with venezuela the two governments are ideologically aligned in their dislike of many multinational companies and wall street interests venezuela is also one of argentinas most important financiers as a regular buyer of the countrys sovereign debt mr chavez "has often proved to be very reluctant to seize the assets of one of argentinas marquee firms at a time when argentina and venezuela are growing closer " mr esteruelas said techint president paolo rocca is one of argentinas leading businessmen and has close ties with the government of president nestor kirchner the argentine government was an active player throughout the talks in the early august conference call ternium chief executive daniel novegil said he was optimistic about reaching an agreement with the venezuelan government because "from a political standpoint argentina remains one of the main partners one of the main friends of the venezuelan government and we continue having support from the argentine government " lately the two countries relationship has come under strain in early august a venezuelan businessman was caught with &# in undeclared cash on an argentine government chartered plane from caracas to buenos aires officials from both countries state owned oil companies were onboard the flight the cash scandal was poor timing for the kirchner administration because first lady cristina kirchner is running for president in october elections analysts say the argentine government was eager to get relations with venezuela back on an even keel from mr turners point of view venezuelas calculus in the sidor nationalization threat was likely much simpler "the whole thing may have been a plan to get cheaper steel prices for the venezuelan local market " mr turner said
