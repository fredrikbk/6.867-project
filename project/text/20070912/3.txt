allison debt draws buyers but its hardly an all clear after a fitful summer the market for buyout debt is tenuously stirring again investment banks led by citigroup inc sold investors &# billion in loans for allison transmission inc that was less than a quarter of what the banks were forced to take on their own books after they postponed a loan and bond sale by allison in july the banks were also forced to sell the loans at a steep discount to their face value a sign of the big hurdles the market still needs to overcome allison is an auto parts supplier formerly a unit of general motors corp that was taken over by carlyle group lp and onex corp when banks had problems selling its debt in july credit markets were just starting to turn south the sale now is important because it is a sign markets are reopening but it is hardly an all clear "a &# billion sale is impressive and shows theres some life out there but you cant push too hard " says andrew feltus a high yield portfolio manager at pioneer investments in boston "theres still a bit of a standoff in the market " bankers sold the &# billion slice of the allison loan to a group of hedge funds loan funds and commercial banks at cents on the dollar a price that means the banks suffered a loss on the sale the loan bore an interest rate of percentage points above the three month london interbank offered rate up from the percentage point margin that the bankers first shopped the deal at back in july in recent days and weeks bankers have been quietly canvassing individual fund managers and commercial banks to find out what prices they would be willing to accept in order to take on buyout debt that couldnt be sold during a tumultuous summer marked by postponed deals and diving bond and loan prices much bigger deals await buyers including the &# billion needed to fund the buyout of first data corp that debt sale gets under way this week along the way banks and private equity buyers are finding they need to make potentially painful concessions to lure back debt investors in the case of first data its buyers kolhberg kravis roberts &amp co agreed to include performance requirements known as covenants in its debt that hadnt previously been required analysts said the allison debt sale indicates some buyers are returning to the market for especially risky corporate debt the allison deal was the largest sale of buyout loans to investors since a &# billion sale by the finance arm of chrysler llc in late july according to standard &amp poors leveraged commentary &amp data still the size of the sale shows the market has a long way to go before returning to normalcy "i was surprised that &# billion of the deal was all they can scrape together " said justin monteith at kdp investment advisors wall street firms which also included lehman brothers holdings inc and merrill lynch &amp co had planned to raise &# billion from loan and junk bond sales in july to fund the allison deal the company arranged an additional &# million in revolving credit facilities from the banks difficult market conditions at the time made it impossible to persuade investors to bite as a result the banks had to provide the financing directly to the company when the deal closed a banker close to the deal said the cent price indicates that investors who bought the allison loan will earn an effective yield of percentage points above libor or around annually to assuage investor concerns about the volatile credit markets the banks also effectively agreed to compensate investors if the banks sell the rest of the allison loan at a lower price in the next days analysts said banks are likely to parcel out more of their unsold buyout debt to investors in the coming weeks "its the logical way forward given the backlog of long term financing " says james moss a managing director at fitch ratings "they are trying to figure out where the market appetite is and are putting some of their loans out " the moves come as banks prepare to launch fresh sales of more than &# billion in new loans and bonds to finance buyouts of u s companies this summer around bond and loan sales were postponed after debt
