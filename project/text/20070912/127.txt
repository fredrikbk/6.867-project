the tricky matter of bringing ads to the cellphone questions for jack klues company publicis groupe media a division of publicis groupe title chairman wireless carriers internet giants such as google and yahoo advertising companies such as omnicom group and a rash of start up firms have all made aggressive moves to grab a piece of the mobile advertising pie last week giant ad holding publicis groupe jumped into the sector by acquiring phonevalley a paris based mobile marketing firm its a lot of activity for a sector that took in only &# million in ad dollars in the u s last year according to estimates from emarketer compared with &# billion on internet advertising the digital and ad giants are big believers that the mobile ad market will be huge their faith is understandable by the end of this year of u s population is expected to have mobile phones estimates research firm snl financial and for most marketers the ability to catch people on the go is simply too good an opportunity to pass up jack klues chairman of the publicis groupe media unit talks below about the issues facing the mobile ad marketplace and when video ads on wireless devices will become commonplace the wall street journal most marketers are just now awakening to the power of web ads yet most are spending less than of their ad budgets on digital are marketers spending significant money on mobile right now if not why not mr klues in some parts of the world there is significant spending in mobile marketing in absolute terms is it in excess of or of peoples ad budget probably not at this time in some parts of the world it is part of their marketers marketing mix if you look at advertisers in china you would find mobile in some way is part of the media mix i wont profess to tell you its the lion share nor is it some experimental money that they are using to see what is going on it is part of their key marketing mix its not for all marketers and not for all clients but at the end of the day when you look at it this is a huge communications channel in terms of the number of units actual phones that are out there when you think about the highly personal nature of the mobile phone device the flexibility and mobility of it in many ways it is the ultimate in highly personalized experiences in consumer media wsj some ad holding companies such as omnicom have made mobile acquisitions over the past year why was publicis late to the mobile party mr klus i would say we are not late i am not aware of any acquisitions of scale by any of them its only a matter of time that the demand from advertisers migrates to other geographies and we are now in a place to address that need wsj how real is the consumer backlash over spam on cellphones and how can the ad and mobile industries prevent the consumer backlash that occurred on email a few years ago mr klues its a very real concern the more personalized the device or the channel the more respectful the advertising needs to be of the audience but that is real on a lot of media these days its just more acute on mobile ad messaging but i think the topic of restricting spam is something that we have to be more and more sensitive about all the time i do think its real its another benefit to have these guys at phonevalley who have an understanding of what is appropriate and what is not i am confident on the potential of the medium you just have to be respectful of the kinds of messaging you put on it wsj one study has shown that consumers found a maximum of four advertising text messages a suitable number of mobile marketing messages to receive per week that seems pretty low what needs to be done for consumers to accept mobile ads mr klues i would like to believe it will be more than just mobile ads it could include full motion video or sponsoring on deck phone or banner ads i believe we are going to be able to with phonevalleys expertise do things that are more promotional in context i have seen through a presentation done by the mobile marketing people at yahoo interesting things done by a sneaker company during the nba all star game where they were doing selective messaging and driving people to store locations for free sneakers it was about sending them relevant text messages it was obvious and welcomed by consumers yet powerful enough to drive attendance wsj most cellphone advertising today is in the form of text messages which often include prizes banner ads are becoming more common when will video ads on mobile devices become commonplace what has been the holdup mr klues what we have to figure out as part of this is the kind of messaging we do on mobile devices some clients make comments like it wont be as simple as plastering second reformatted tv commercials on phones it is going to be different it wont be cutting commercials made for tv and putting them on a mobile device that would be disrespectful to the mobile consumer if it were that easy we wouldnt have needed to make an acquisition how long will it be i am not a good prognosticator the apparent early adopter success of the iphone will only accelerate the flexibility for us to use full motion video on these devices wsj madison avenue is now in direct competition for web ad dollars with digital giants such as google and microsoft the digital titans have been very aggressive with buying mobile marketing firms while madison avenue has just started to dip its toe in the water why is the ad industry not more aggressive mr klues we probably have been slow to adapt could it be that some parts of our industry are far too parochial its also what you see in america that is mobile advertising the messaging is uneven but that doesnt mean that mobile marketing isnt an important part of other peoples marketing mix in other countries wsj phonevalley has worked with many different media buying and ad firms will publicis buying the company now cause those shops not to use their services mr klues we are not going to rebrand them they are a business onto themselves one would believe they would continue to work with if not all the vast majority of their clients wsj is that realistic given that their fees will be lining the pockets of a rival holding company mr klues you know in this day and age there are lots of lines that blur and cross we live in world where there is a lot of crossover corrections &amp amplifications emarketer estimates that &# billion was spent on internet advertising in the u s last year yesterdays advertising report and tuesdays advertising column incorrectly gave emarketers estimate as &# billion wsj sept
