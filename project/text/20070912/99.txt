opec seeks soft landing for oil with crude hitting &# cartel pursues market calm and role of white knight vienna opecs decision to add more oil to world markets marks an effort to engineer something that has eluded the cartel a soft landing for high oil prices indeed oil prices reached a new high yesterday as uncertainty about global supplies overshadowed the move crude futures settled at &# a barrel in new york yesterday up so far this year yesterdays move by the organization of petroleum exporting countries to raise output limits marks the groups attempt to cast itself as a white knight to a world worried about the impact of rising oil prices it comes amid economic worries related to turmoil in the u s subprime mortgage market the u s and other nations have lobbied for months for more opec oil opec secretary general abdalla salem el badri said the groups move to add roughly barrels a day to existing opec output on nov the groups first official production increase in more than two years was taken with the end user in mind "our message to the consumer is that we care and we are concerned and that is why we increased production " he said the cartel which supplies almost of the worlds oil also is acting in its own interests the last thing it wants is to be seen as profiting from hard economic times "i think its an appropriate reaction given the tightness of the market " said antoine halff head of energy research at fimat usa llc "with the credit problems in the u s and the fragile situation there one must be concerned about the state of the consumer " opecs move could still be seen as largely symbolic demand often rises in winter because cold weather in the northern hemisphere increases demand for heating fuel oil stocks are particularly tight in europe and japan opec also has shown limited power to control price increases in recent years earlier in oils four year run up the cartel moved at times to quell prices fearing a sharp rise would hurt the global economy or erode long term demand but like many oil producing nations most of opecs members are already producing nearly flat out to meet rising world needs the thin margin between demand and production exacerbates disruptions and blunts efforts to limit price increases the move is sharper than expected oil analysts had initially expected the cartel to stand pat and earlier this week oil ministers were discussing a more modest and symbolic increase it appeared that important opec producer saudi arabia the u s s closest ally in the arab world and the cartels unofficial leader managed to sway reluctant fellow members to adopt the increase most opec members had said before the meeting that an increase wasnt necessary given the uncertainty about the demand picture because of potential fallout from the subprime mortgage markets troubles "the saudis are trying to find a goldilocks solution " said edward l morse chief energy economist for lehman brothers "what happens next is difficult to gauge " opec president mohamed al hamli said the additional barrels will be spread among the opec countries subject to quotas members iraq and angola are exempt the bulk of the increase is likely to come from saudi arabia the owner of most of the worlds untapped oil resources alone has the spare capacity among members to deliver that much additional oil opecs other members are pumping oil to their limit to take advantage of high prices a statement accompanying the opec decision left the group an escape hatch opec said it "would act swiftly" should global economic conditions worsen and oil demand weaken opec heads of state will meet again in saudi arabia in late november before gathering in the united arab emirates on dec on paper opecs move increases its output ceiling by million barrels of oil a day to million but the true amount added to world markets will be less than that totaling roughly barrels a day by some estimates because opecs production already surpasses its own output ceiling in july the nations pumped an estimated million barrels a day according to the international energy agency last month the international energy agency an energy watchdog that represents industrialized nations forecast demand will average just more than million barrels a day this winter about one million barrels a day more than opec projects "this is a smaller increase than we would have liked but i think it was more than anyone thought a few weeks ago " said lawrence eagles the ieas head of oil markets other observers argued the opec move will do little to the supply and demand balance this year because it will largely make up for two months of mexican output lost when hurricane dean barreled through the gulf of mexico last month
