betting on nanotech therapies some venture capitalists are betting that tiny instruments will drive big advances in cancer care several investors are funding start ups that use nanotechnology the manipulation of matter on the scale of the nanometer a billionth of a meter to create therapies that destroy tumors and spare healthy cells by packaging drugs with nano agents that home in on tumors directly several start ups hope to knock out cancer cells while triggering relatively few side effects a number of these companies plan to begin clinical trials shortly "theres an entire wave of important therapeutics coming using nanotechnology " said jim matheson general partner of flagship ventures cambridge mass which is contributing funding for one such venture these companies work represents some of the latest strategies in the long quest to better target drugs with agents known as nanoparticles a milestone came in with the u s approval of doxil which encapsulates the chemotherapy doxorubicin into a tiny fat bubble or liposome and another layer of hair like strands made from a type of rubber because doxil liposomes are so small about nanometers in diameter and able to circulate for long periods they penetrate the vasculature or arrangement of blood vessels of tumors once they reach the tumor tissue they slowly release the medication according to ortho biotech products lp a unit of new brunswick n j based johnson &amp johnson which sells doxil in the u s doxil is used for certain multiple myeloma and ovarian cancer patients and also for aids related kaposis sarcoma a type of cancer characterized by abnormal growth of blood vessels that develops into skin lesions or occurs internally though at least of the drug stays in the liposome while it circulates in the blood some may leak out and affect normal tissue according to ortho biotech several venture backed concerns are pursuing novel technologies outside of liposomes that may enable them to attack tumors even more effectively two of them bind biosciences inc and tempo pharmaceuticals inc are advancing research from massachusetts institute of technology the cambridge mass companies share a board member mit professor robert langer and polaris venture partners waltham mass as an investor but their technologies are different bind which closed a &# million first round of funding from polaris and flagship in january is developing a nanoparticle that enters tumors and unleashes a payload of drugs bind expects to put its first therapy in the clinic in mid for cancer or cardiovascular disease though chief executive glenn batchelder didnt say which would be first the company which may be able to apply its nanoparticles to a variety of medicines will use an undisclosed drug that has been cleared for use in the u s with the initial product that it expects to begin testing in clinical trials in tempo which raised a &# million first round in may also sees several applications for its technology but will go after cancer first said ceo alan crane unlike bind tempo doesnt use targeting agents to guide its therapies since its nanocell products are to nanometers in diameter they are small enough to slip through the pores of tumor blood vessels as a result its nanoparticle based products accumulate in tumors where they release two drugs the first collapses the tumor vasculature trapping the nanoparticle inside then a chemotherapy is slowly released and the tumor is exposed to a steady prolonged dose tempos first round financing should carry it to the start of clinical trials mr crane said though he didnt say when those trials would begin or what drugs tempo intends to use with its initial product avidimer therapeutics inc which raised first round funding in early august from flagship ventures and north coast technology investors lp ann arbor mich also looks to hit tumors hard and foil their defenses but through other means the ann arbor mich company whose "dendrimer" agents are shaped like tiny trees decorated with drugs expects to begin testing one adorned with the chemotherapy methotrexate in clinical studies next year one way tumors resist chemotherapies is by pumping them out when avidimers lead product enters a tumor the methotrexate molecules remain anchored to the dendrimer which keeps them from being expelled said ceo larry a sternson company research indicates that methotrexate doesnt need to be set free to work but avidimer can make dendrimers that release a drug if needed he said in addition to making drugs more effective nanotechnology might also make it possible to apply certain drugs to new areas alta partners san francisco and frazier healthcare ventures seattle wash saw this potential last year when they co led a &# million first round of funding for palo alto calif based intradigm corp which hopes to bring a new kind of medicine to cancer rna interference a means of silencing disease genes with rna interference therapy small interfering rna or sirna molecules disrupt the cellular machinery for translating a target gene into a protein though no sirna drugs have reached market merck &amp co whitehouse station n j saw enough potential in the approach to pay &# billion to acquire rna interference drug maker sirna therapeutics inc last year since rna interference molecules dont readily enter cells most rna interference companies have focused on diseases where the drug can be injected into a specific site such as the eye for the treatment of age related macular degeneration but localized delivery wont work for cancer patients whose disease has spread throughout their body intradigm packages sirna molecules into its nanoplex agents which search out tumors and penetrate them its first product will carry sirna molecules that silence two genes that tumors use to get an ample supply of blood to target its therapies intradigm attaches molecules that latch onto receptors found on blood vessels feeding tumors its nanoplex drugs about nanometers in diameter carry thousands of sirna molecules in animal studies of colon and kidney cancer they shrunk tumors significantly said ceo mohammad azab of course the next challenge for intradigm and the others is to shrink tumors in actual patients while early research is reasonably predictive "the human system is much more complex than the animal systems we use " mr azab said intradigm intends to start human trials in mid some start ups seek to improve diagnosis as well as treatment one is st louis based kereos inc backed with just more than &# million from rivervest venture partners st louis genentech inc south san francisco calif triathlon medical ventures cincinnati and others early next year it plans to begin clinical testing of a molecular imaging product that delivers the contrast agent gadolinium to the tumor by targeting its growing vasculature this enhances magnetic resonance imaging or mri and could enable earlier detection of various solid tumors eventually kereos intends to complement this product with one that delivers the medication paclitaxel or another chemotherapeutic drug into tumors the company expects to raise an additional &# million in to progress its imaging agent through phase ii studies and to advance its earlier stage therapeutics for cancer and cardiovascular disease according to ceo robert a beardsley
