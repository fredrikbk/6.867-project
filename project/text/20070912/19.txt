business bookshelf the making of a palace coup blue blood &amp mutiny by patricia beard william morrow pages &# on wall street its a law of nature that power follows profits after the bond traders made most of the money at lehman brothers in they ousted investment banker pete peterson as top dog and when bond traders at goldman sachs &amp co racked up big losses in investment bankers showed the door to top executive jon corzine a bond desk veteran at the blue chip firm of morgan stanley philip purcell managed to avoid such a fate for eight years through a combination of shrewd deal making boardroom gamesmanship and machiavellian divide and conquer tactics when he was finally ousted in a messy battle in spring his fall seemed all the more ignominious because he had managed to defy the natural order for so long mr purcell who grew up catholic in mormon dominated salt lake city had an outsiders history of imposing his will on organizations he joined at sears roebuck &amp co in the s with a mandate from the chief executive he expanded a financial services business partly at the expense of the retailing parent his most lasting creation the discover credit card was launched by requiring its use by sears customers who wanted to charge their purchases he gained the top job at morgan stanley in when his firm dean witter discover &amp co itself a spinoff from sears merged with morgan stanley the proud spawn of once formidable banking giant j p morgan &amp co whose motto was "first class business in a first class way" morgan stanley would now be stablemates with the new owners dean witter brokerage a second tier enterprise serving individual investors in "blue blood and mutiny the fight for the soul of morgan stanley " patricia beard presents an engaging narrative of a by now well known tale how eight former morgan stanley executives rose up to oust mr purcell the interloper who had commandeered the firm they helped to build ms beard had the full cooperation of the so called group of eight or "grumpy old men " as they came to be known among them is her former brother in law anson beard whose name like that of parker gilbert and other group members evokes the privileged set of a fitzgerald novel ms beards story is enlivened by accounts of the groups behind the scenes maneuvering but the authors wealth of access to the group of eight throws into relief the books major weakness ms beard didnt have access to mr purcell or his camp although mr purcells shortcomings did indeed fuel his downfall and thus lie at the heart of the story the authors incessant carping at his every action and her gushing treatment of his enemies as "people of character" become tiresome and one yearns for a more evenhanded view for example when mr purcell negotiates in to merge dean witter with morgan stanley in talks with morgan stanleys leaders richard fisher and john mack he asks for an unusual provision requiring a board vote to change the duties of either himself as chief executive or mr mack as president it seemed mr fisher said at the time that mr purcell "doesnt trust us" as if such caution were just another of his many character flaws but it soon develops that mr purcell had every reason not to trust the folks from the morgan stanley side because within a year of the merger they were trying to roll him agitating for mr mack to become co chief executive and complaining about the weaknesses of mr purcells hands off management style his cronies and the assets he brought to the marriage why had the merger happened in the first place individual investors were pouring money into mutual funds at a furious pace merrill lynch &amp co had become the nations no securities underwriter with the aid of its army of brokers catering to individuals dean witter discover which promoted its own mutual funds to dean witter customers until regulators intervened offered morgan stanley a piece of that action why did mr purcell get the chief executive job ms beard while noting that when the two firms merged their earnings were roughly the same doesnt give mr purcell his due by also mentioning that his firms stock market value was greater dean witters earnings were seen as steadier than morgan stanleys which involved trading and were thus more volatile but by the earnings from the morgan stanley side of the merged businesses exceeded of the total and this cold number doomed mr purcell as much as his other transgressions such as his relying on an abrasive general counsel butting heads with regulators and losing a spectacular &# billion lawsuit brought by ron perelman an appeals court threw out the verdict but mr perelman has appealed yet as messrs fisher and mack pursued their efforts to dethrone mr purcell they were thwarted by a few simple dynamics first mr purcell kept his critics down through control of new director selections an arrangement that the morgan stanley bankers barely noticed at first when mr fisher complained to the directors that mr purcells management style wasnt working he was brushed off second before mr mack left the merged firm in frustration in he was never able to unite the morgan stanley side behind him at one point just before mr mack left he and mr purcell told other senior executives that they couldnt agree on anything according to ms beard but at that potentially pivotal moment joe perella a legendary morgan stanley deal maker did not throw his weight behind mr mack he simply told the two men that it was up to them to work things out after mr mack left mr purcell moved up another morgan stanley executive as his heir apparent then another at once forestalling any insurgency and deferring succession not until the eight alumni took up the cudgels after dick fishers death in and after mr perella himself made a statement by quitting morgan stanley midway through the battle was mr purcell swept aside and mr mack restored to power this tale of subjugation and revenge has a certain shakespearean quality and in ms beards telling it also offers glimpses into the gilded lives of wall street kings she takes us into mr purcells corporate aircraft hangar and inside the lavish late in life weddings of both mr fisher and mr beard we learn that when the interoffice fighting breaks out mr perella is busy hosting a client conference at a resort in cabo san lucas mexico when mr purcells resignation finally comes parker gilbert learns of it while he and his wife are in bilbao spain visiting the guggenheim museum nice work if you can get it and keep it mr smith a reporter for the journal covers the securities industry including morgan stanley
