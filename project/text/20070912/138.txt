why some apple fans wont buy the iphone apple inc s move last week to cut the price of its iphone by &# seems like just the inducement to persuade those on the fence to buy but despite strong sales overall some potential buyers even apple devotees say the gadget still has too many drawbacks cellphone users and tech enthusiasts have fawned over the iphones elegant interface the luxury of having a full blown web browser on a phone and the coolness of rolling several of their favorite gadgets into one but some still wont buy it sticker shock is a big impediment even with the price cut the iphone at &# now is one of the pricier phones on the market and apple isnt offering the discounts and promotions that other smart phones and cellphones offer periodically for buyers also for now the phone is available only via at&amp t wireless for some who now get their cell service via another provider the hassle of switching to at&amp t is enough to stop them from buying and while some say that the email capabilities of the iphone work well enough many are still hesitant to leave their trusty blackberrys and treos still the iphone is selling fairly swiftly earlier this week apple announced that it sold its one millionth iphone days after its debut and even with the iphones hefty price tag before the reduction the phone made up of all cellphone sales in july the first full month of sales for the phone according to a survey released by isuppli corp an electronic research firm it also was able to beat the sales of all smart phone models including the blackberry series and it matched the sales of the top selling traditional cellphone model lgs chocolate isuppli estimates that million iphones will be shipped by the end of the year but even some big apple fans are holding out matthew
