calories might be off the menu a federal courts decision to knock down a measure that requires calorie labeling at new york city chain restaurants may embolden restaurant companies in their fight against a wave of new regulations aimed at obesity the ruling issued by the u s district court for the southern district of new york blocks a new york city health department measure that required some restaurants mostly chain outlets to post calorie contents on their menus and menu boards the measure was part of the citys plan to ban trans fats from restaurants which took effect this summer new york city health commissioner dr thomas r frieden says hes optimistic that the city will be able to come up with a viable alternative measure that achieves a similar effect he sees the ruling as favorable since it upholds the departments right to enact a labeling requirement even though it disagreed with the method it used to do so u s district judge richard j holwell blocked the measure on the grounds that it conflicted with federal regulations city attorneys plan to appeal the decision and are considering tweaking the measure so it would apply to restaurants that have or more locations but for now the ruling could give the restaurant industry more ammunition in fighting the tidal wave of regulations that have forced it to change the way it cooks advertises and explains its food to the nations consumers sixteen states and numerous cities and counties have proposed banning the use of trans fat in restaurant food since new york did so according to the national restaurant association pressure from federal regulators has prompted the countrys largest restaurant chains and food makers to cut back on advertising unhealthy foods to kids and using cartoon characters in ads practices that had long been a mainstay of their businesses while restaurants have largely gone along with the trans fat bans and agreed to limit their marketing to children the industry vigorously fought back against the calorie labeling law companies said it was unfair because it only applied to restaurants that already provided caloric information on web sites pamphlets or using other methods wendys international inc removed some of its publicly posted nutrition information in order to be exempt from the rule "i would hope that other jurisdictions that might be looking at initiating that kind of proposal would take pause" because of the reversal of the new york city measure said jack whipple president of the national council of chain restaurants he added that the industry has voluntarily cooperated with cities and regulators to add healthier items to menus and curb marketing aimed at children william whitman a spokesman for mcdonalds corp which lobbied against the measure said the chain applauds the labeling reversal because "posting information like this on a menu board really runs the risk of confusing customers " in part because it omits data on fat salt and other nutrients but health officials say fast food restaurants are just trying to prevent customers from seeing how unhealthy their food actually is "its a sad commentary that some restaurants are so ashamed of what theyre serving the public that theyd rather go to court than to put the information where people would actually see it " dr frieden says scale of the problem in its effort to make restaurants post caloric content new york city had pointed out the proportion of obese americans rose to in from in in new york city of adults are considered overweight and are obese americans receive an estimated one third of their caloric intake away from home
