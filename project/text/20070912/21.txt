business when investor activism doesnt pay on april mutual fund manager franklin mutual advisers llc disclosed that it owned of weyerhaeuser co and sought to alter the "strategic direction corporate governance and management" of the timber and building products company predictably weyerhaeuser shares jumped nearly that day to approach a five year high two and a half years later weyerhaeuser has sold some units and is considering selling others but its profit battered by the housing slowdown fell in the second quarter its shares traded yesterday at &# slightly below the closing level on the day franklin disclosed its stake that is a surprisingly common result of fund activism according to a new study that challenges recent conventional wisdom about these cage rattling investors the study by a harvard business school assistant professor robin greenwood and michael schor a former student found that activist funds are like a boxer with one punch they are most successful when they prod managers to put a company up for sale shares of the target company typically rise and all shareholders benefit but the authors found that activist investors have much less impact when a targeted company isnt sold in those cases the study found there is little change in the next months in the companys stock price or financial results that is true even when the company takes steps recommended by the activists such as firing the chief executive buying back stock or adding new directors "the money is in getting the target acquired " mr greenwood says "the ones that dont end up getting acquired dont end up with much of anything " mr greenwood concurs with other research showing that the appearance of an activist investor boosts a companys shares in the short run he says other investors interpret these moves as a signal that a company is in play but when the acquisition doesnt happen there is little or no payoff recent headlines point to a few examples wendys international inc was trading at a split adjusted &# when investor nelson peltz began pushing management for changes in december thanks to hopes for a sale shares are now trading well above that level at &# wendys board in late april said it would consider selling the company in july mr peltz said he would consider paying &# to &# a share for the u s s third largest hamburger chain investors in time warner inc got less benefit when activist investor carl icahns campaign to break up the media titan fell short time warner expanded its share buyback to &# billion and cut expenses but its shares were trading yesterday at &# little changed from &# when mr icahn revealed his plans in august mr icahn says he made money on his time warner stake he sold most of it toward the end of last year when time warners share price reached as high as &# he says the expense cuts have boosted time warners profitability more generally mr icahn says he and fellow activists like mr peltz are effective because directors and executives know they are willing to wage proxy fights to win board seats that could jeopardize managers jobs studies like mr greenwoods show more muted results he says because they include less aggressive funds "i do think when we come in at the very least we get executives to refocus " mr icahn says mr greenwood acknowledges that some activist investors he includes mr icahn are more effective than others but he says it is no surprise that profits dont soar at many companies targeted by activists "theyre investors theyre not operating guys " he says "they understand that this firm can be bought or sold at a higher price " likewise michael embler chief investment officer of franklin mutual advisers says the fund has been more effective at weyerhaeuser than it appears at first glance he notes that weyerhaeuser stock traded for &# in february before the magnitude of the housing slump was apparent mr embler says weyerhaeusers shares might have lost value in the past years were it not for the steps taken after his fund got involved "im not sure that where the stock is today is a reflection one way or another on the success of activist investing " he says the study has academic critics as well alon brav an associate professor at duke universitys fuqua school of business was co author of a study released last year that found a bigger influence from activist funds mr bravs group found that profitability rose at targeted firms although the increase was small and typically took more than a year to appear for investors mr brav notes these distinctions may matter little investors dont know which targets will be acquired he and mr greenwood agree that investors would still be wise to buy the stocks of any company attracting the attention of activists for the past few years that was a good strategy as a steady supply of buyout money fueled many acquisitions of companies targeted by activist funds now that money has largely evaporated amid the credit crunch so activists ability to transform companies will be more seriously tested
