the morning brief unable to steer japan abe gives up the helm online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here as if there wasnt enough uncertainty out there shinzo abe has gone and resigned less than a year after taking office saying he could no longer be an effective leader for japan and leaving the worlds second largest economy in political limbo at a nationally televised news conference early this afternoon in tokyo mr abe suggested he lacked the political capital to "push ahead with effective policies that win the support and trust of the public" and that he had thus decided japan needed a "change in this situation " despite his governing liberal democratic partys loss of the upper house of parliament in julys elections and an approval level that has lingered at or lower the year old leader vowed as recently as monday to stay in office the los angeles times notes the immediate cause of his departure was mr abes inability to push through parliament renewal of an antiterrorism law that let the japanese military normally limited to defensive action participate in the u s led operations in afghanistan and iraq the opposition democratic party of japan had threatened to block it but as the asahi shimbun reports mr abes administration has been hit by a string of financial scandals and other embarrassments that shook up his cabinet his health minister set off a firestorm in january by referring to women as "birth giving machines" his agriculture minister committed suicide in may before he could be questioned in parliament over corruption allegations the successor at the farm ministry resigned in august over an accounting scandal and mr abes defense minister had to quit over controversial comments on the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki as the bbc reports the biggest damage came from revelations last spring that mr abes government has misplaced pension records covering some million claims the huge loss suffered by the ldp party in july was just the most concrete form of mr abes growing unpopularity giving the democratic party de facto veto power over most legislation and the new york times points out that while any successor wont have to call a new general election before he or she will probably face intense pressure to do so soon before announcing his resignation mr abe told ldp executives he wouldnt step down before a successor is found the evening edition of the nikkei reports a widely viewed frontrunner is the former foreign minister taro aso though mr aso a well known comic book fan said today that it was too early for him to comment on the matter the share prices of japanese producers of manga and anime shot higher on speculation on his possible ascendance dow jones newswires reports the benchmark nikkei stock index initially rallied on the news but soon retreated and ended the day down the wall street journal says mr abes demise so soon after taking office "shows how japan badly needs a prime minister with strong leadership like his predecessor junichiro koizumi " and that without it japan "could enter a period of drift just as it confronts huge challenges such as an aging population and soaring national debt " still the journal suggests that mr aso while unlikely to make big policy changes might "exert more effective leadership " the kyodo news agency reports that the ldp will choose its new leader one week from today leadership contagion prime ministerial precariousness seems to be a theme for the day hours after mr abes announcement australian premier john howard said he will retire before the end of his next three year term if he wins elections this year and then in moscow according to russian news agencies prime minister mikhail fradkov asked president vladimir putin to dissolve his government what bernanke and paulson do dont say federal reserve chairman ben bernanke told an audience in berlin yesterday that with global investment picking up and lenders becoming more risk averse long term interest rates have started to rise as the wall street journal reports that aversion to risk could be a factor viewed by the fed among reasons to lower interest rates when fed policy makers meet next week as the wall street journal says but widespread coverage of mr bernankes speech suggests there was a lot of disappointment that he didnt just come out and say so this is silly since no fed chairman would want to limit his options ahead of time or speak for the federal open market committee before it has voted but such all too common interpretations do illustrate how much every word of policy makers like mr bernanke are plumbed for further meaning the way kremlinologists once examined who was standing next to whom at may day parades and these interpretations can vary widely take yesterdays speech by u s treasury secretary henry paulson the journal reports mr paulson said that while hes "focused" on the distress of the commercial paper market he thinks the economy can weather its current problems and under the headline "paulson confident on economy " the financial times reports mr paulson is worried that the current "crisis of confidence in credit markets is likely to last longer than any of the financial shocks of the past two decades " and under the headline "paulson warns on turmoil " for the u s in iraq plans for more of the same president bush plans to make a televised national address tomorrow night at p m et and is expected to announce he will follow the conditional prescription for iraq voiced by gen david petraeus this week before members of the house and senate the withdrawal of up to u s troops from iraq by next summer democratic leaders and a handful of republicans are already vowing to try to force mr bush to make more dramatic changes as the washington post reports since such a withdrawal would simply return the size of the deployment to pre "surge" levels the associated press notes that even if the size of the u s force in iraq is reduced from the current level of the remaining americans will probably have to perform the same mission leading the fight against the insurgency since iraqs military and police are still far able to do so in an interview with the ap the former head of central command retired gen john abizaid says it will take iraqs government three to five years before it can operate on its own and gen petraeus along with ambassador ryan crocker essentially conceded in senate testimony yesterday that "the bush administrations overall strategy in iraq would remain largely unchanged after the temporary increase in american forces is over next summer and made clear their view that the united states would need a major troop presence in iraq for years to come " as the new york times reports olson emerges at lead attorney general candidate the bush administration is close to picking a successor to embattled attorney general alberto gonzales and former solicitor general theodore olson seems to be the leading candidate administration officials tell the new york times that mr olsons candidacy began to receive greater scrutiny in recent days after the white house was rebuffed by another candidate larry thomson a former deputy attorney general and now the general counsel at pepsico the white house says mr bush hasnt yet made a decision but associates of several prospective candidates tell the times they believe the field has narrowed one lawyer close to the white house tells the wall street journal that another finalist is george terwilliger a lawyer at white &amp case who represented mr bush in litigation during the florida dispute over the election results the choice of either mr terwilliger or mr olson would suggest the president wants "an attorney general who would vigorously defend the administrations national security agenda" and be "a choice that could set up another fight with congress " the journal adds also of note international herald tribune the general commanding the european unions police training mission in afghanistan is returning to germany three months after his appointment because of wrangling with the european union nato and officials inside the afghan interior ministry senior western diplomats in kabul said and diplomats and security experts there said his self chosen early departure highlights the immense difficulties in trying to establish the small mission of european trainers at a time
