docomo takes a hit in price war discounts cut into profit for japans largest mobile operator tokyo as japans mobile industry continues to see tough competition the nations largest mobile operator ntt docomo inc is unlikely to see its shares rise significantly anytime soon analysts say nearly a year after a regulatory change set off a fierce price war japans three major operators have been engaged in a tug of war for customers that has left docomo on the losing end docomo still has a market share but it is adding fewer customers than its rivals meanwhile discounts are cutting into company profit the companys shares have already fallen since the beginning of the year compared with no rival kddi corp whose shares have risen docomos shares fell yesterday to close at yen &# kddis shares closed at yen roughly in line with the nikkei stock average which was up the outlook isnt particularly bright for the industry which is struggling to find sources of revenue that can make up for rapidly falling service prices analysts say docomo has much to lose as the dominant operator "their biggest challenge is that their revenue is not growing " says hironobu sawake a telecom analyst with j p morgan "all they can do is cut costs " mr sawake has a "neutral" rating on docomo meaning he expects the stock to perform in line with the industry over the next six to months luring customers away from rivals with attractive phones and price plans isnt a new trend in japan where most people already own phones but competition has accelerated over the past year because of the implementation last october of a rule called number portability that makes it easier for customers to switch services by allowing them to keep their phone numbers previously customers lost their phone number when they canceled service analysts say the number portability rule by itself didnt have more than a temporary impact still operators used the opportunity to cut prices and aggressively market their latest phones and services softbank corp japans third largest mobile operator introduced a plan that started at yen &# a month a low price that surprised others in the industry kddi meanwhile competed by coming up with attractive phones and compelling deals docomo has tried to keep up but has been unable to act as nimbly as its rivals though docomos phones have more features and are considered more high end they cost more to make and their higher price has made them less attractive in the april to june quarter the companys net profit fell to billion yen while revenue declined to trillion yen docomo said it expects its net profit for the year ending march to increase and revenue to decline slightly after setting these forecasts however docomo announced a new discount plan that may make it more difficult to reach the goals docomo is hoping it can compensate for some of the revenue it is losing from traditional voice services with new features such as a chip that allows consumers to use their phones as train passes identification cards and debit and credit cards but the feature translates to little income for the operators the company has been building up its lineup of phones capable of global roaming and has started making some investments in overseas mobile operators but none of its strategies are promising enough to expand its business significantly despite the big challenges some analysts say docomos position isnt as bad as it could be docomos prices are now competitive with those of its rivals and it is recovering its share of new customers these analysts say fitch ratings last month upgraded its outlook on docomos long term credit to "stable" from "negative" on the basis that the company still has a more than market share for some investors the stock is worth holding for its high dividend yield of which is more than twice as high as kddis and significantly higher than softbanks "a dominant company is destined to lose customers so that really cant be helped but docomo isnt that badly off " says tetsuro tsusaka a telecom analyst for lehman brothers mr tsusaka who just began covering the industry doesnt have an official rating on docomo china stocks
