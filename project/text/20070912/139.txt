world bank wasted money and lives in buying wrong medicine your editorial "world bank corruption" and bret stephenss global view column "mind the gap" both on sept expose the myriad illicit practices of some world bank staff and contractors particularly in indian health projects supported by western taxpayers the methods used by these bad actors to obfuscate their actions and delay often permanently their exposure are interesting seventeen months ago we published a paper in the lancet a medical journal about the execrable indian malaria program of the world bank and in particular its purchase in india of chloroquine cq which is ineffective against the fatal form of malaria and was against world health organization guidelines alternative medicines exist which are totally effective but oddly the bank chose not to buy them we equated this with "medical malpractice " the bank refused to give us numerous documents on its india malaria project when we were researching the lancet paper and now we know why they would have led us to the corruption that permeates the banks work in india the internal bank investigation from that the journal revealed fingers the actions of a firm called nestor pharmaceuticals available records show that the cq the bank bought it bought from nestor why did the bank ignore whos medical advice to avoid cq and instead forge ahead to buy this ineffective medicine from a company in india the banks investigation alleges nestor colluded with other suppliers and manufactured substandard or even chemically diluted medicines the bank investigation must continue and specifically probe whether corruption underlies the fact the bank bought the wrong medicines wasting both money and childrens lives in the lancet paper we demanded that the bank transfer the funds it devotes to malaria control to an agency better prepared to spend the money effectively perhaps the presidents malaria initiative or the global fund for aids tuberculosis and malaria we see no reason to change that suggestion roger bate fellow american enterprise institute washington amir attaran professor university of ottawa ottawa ontario mr stephens attacks the government accountability project in connection with the gaps report on the world banks anti corruption unit the department of institutional integrity int i am writing to set the record straight while the institute for policy studies remains a valuable coalition partner as do many left and right leaning organizations the gap separated from ips years ago and has always been nonpartisan in the past months alone the gap has worked with more than republican lawmakers to enact stronger whistleblower protections there is no conflict between representing clients in bank procedures and seeking better protections for staff whistleblowers in fact the bank has repeatedly sought our recommendations on policy we met with the banks deputy general counsel just last month at his request to consult on a new whistleblower policy the gap is the nations leading whistleblower protection and advocacy group and is a nonprofit organization we gather information for reports never soliciting clients nor are we allowed to profit from their cases finally mr stephens insinuates that bank staffers have no protections in speaking with the gap this is wrong whistleblowers who are not our clients but who speak with us are protected both as potential clients and by our first amendment right of freedom of association in years we have never been forced to reveal a source and weve gone to court twice to defend this right we won both times the gap is reporting on int because our sources described to us an anti corruption unit that prefers to retaliate rather than investigate a unit that punishes the messenger without even getting the message bea edwards international program director government accountability project washington
