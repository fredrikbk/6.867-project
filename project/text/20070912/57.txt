fda panel vote is a win for amgen j&amp j decision over doses for anemia drugs shows no set limit a food and drug administration advisory committee stopped short of supporting a clear cut new limit on kidney failure patients use of the blockbuster anemia drugs made by amgen inc and johnson &amp johnson but members split over what doses of the medications are appropriate the panel voted against a proposed reduction in the fdas recommended top target for a key measure used to set doses of the drugs which are sold as epogen and aranesp by amgen and procrit by j&amp j the decision was a win for the companies because the reduction would have led to a decrease in the amount of medication that doctors are supposed to give to their patients the drugs have been facing cutbacks in use amid safety concerns tied to the effects of very high doses despite their votes yesterday several committee members said they supported small trims or adjustments in the target that might effectively reduce the recommended dosage by at least a slight amount others backed a range supported by amgen which would leave the doses generally unchanged "there was no consensus" about a target said dwaine rieves acting director of the fdas division of medical imaging and hematology products the agency isnt required to follow the outside experts recommendation but it typically does just as important the federal agency that oversees medicare could potentially take the panels views into account in making coverage decisions about the drugs john jenkins who leads the fdas new drugs office said the agency hoped to finalize changes to the drugs labels in "weeks not months " those changes would incorporate yesterdays committee votes as well as an earlier one by the fdas cancer drugs advisers the new labels of procrit and epogen would also likely include an adjustment to claims that the drugs improve patients quality of life because the agency has questioned the evidence backing those benefits a spokesman for amgen said the company believes the drugs "play a critical role" in treating anemia in kidney failure patients and "we look forward to continued discussions with fda" regarding the panels recommendations in a statement j&amp j said it was "pleased" with the panels recommendations the committees equivocal decision is likely to fuel a continuing debate among doctors federal regulators and the companies over how best to administer the medications known as epo drugs or erythropoiesis stimulating agents they are prescribed for anemia which is a deficiency of red blood cells that can occur as a side effect of cancer chemotherapy and kidney disease among other causes last year according to health care information company ims health the three drugs racked up more than &# billion in u s sales the drugs sales came under pressure after all three drugs received a "black box" label warning in march highlighting cardiovascular and other risks when the medications were taken at higher than recommended doses the anemia drugs dosing is linked to their impact on patients level of hemoglobin the protein in red blood cells that binds with oxygen the new label warned that doctors shouldnt aim to get hemoglobin levels above grams per deciliter of blood in july the agency that oversees the medicare program said it wont pay to start cancer patients on the drugs unless their hemoglobin has fallen below grams per deciliter the decision has sparked objections from amgen as well as some doctor and patient groups yesterdays panel vote focused on a different patient population people taking the drugs because of kidney disease amgen estimates that about of the u s dialysis patients take one of the drugs as well as about kidney failure patients who arent on dialysis the fda asked the panel whether the top target should be set at approximately grams per deciliter for these patients amgen for its part had suggested that the proper target range should be around to in the end the panel voted against a top target of panel members said they worried about the effects of cutting the doses too far "a degree of conservatism is warranted to protect against unintended consequences " said sean hennessy a professor at the university of pennsylvania some members had suggested a top target of others said doctors should aim to achieve a hemoglobin of around but that number shouldnt serve as a top cutoff goal others backed amgens proposal of to
