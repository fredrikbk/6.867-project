fiscally fit making sense of retirement plans terri gives her uncle some guidance on how to make the most of his k online edition last week i got a call from my moms youngest brother bill ive always called him bill and not uncle bill because were so close in age im and hes in fact we played together as children weve always been close and over the years hes called on me when hes needed advice on financial matters bills recent request help him sort out the investment options in his new employers k retirement savings plan its an appeal ive heard many times over the years from family members flummoxed by their retirement plans myriad choices besides their homes retirement savings accounts are the only significant investment many of my family members have so im happy to help first a quick primer on k s these plans named for the section of the tax code that governs them allow employees to make tax deferred contributions for retirement contributions are made with pre tax income and earnings grow tax deferred until retirement when withdrawals are taxed as personal income many employers match a percentage of workers contributions bill has already taken the most important step choosing to save for retirement a survey by k plan provider vanguard group found that more than a third of employees eligible to participate in such plans dont most of them are younger workers its easy for them to put off worrying about financial needs years down the road because theyre up to their ears in rent student loans credit card bills and other costs for many that will prove a costly mistake a year old saving of her &# salary in a k with a company match would amass savings of &# million by age assuming inflation and a return if that year old waited until she was to start saving the same percentage of her &# salary shed accumulate &# and might have to put off retiring "thats why the decision to save when youre young is so critical " says david wray president of the profit sharing k council of america a nonprofit association of providers of such plans "if you wait its very hard for the earnings potential of your investments to get you where you need to be in retirement " my uncle is eager to get started saving he hasnt worked for a company with a retirement plan for a few years now that hes decided to save he needs to get familiar with his employers retirement plan most plan providers have made that easier by including basic plan information calculators and investment performance data on user friendly web sites some of the plan features bill needs to determine are what if any matching contributions his new employer makes what the vesting schedule is for those contributions and what the plans contribution limits are in addition to plan contribution limits there are government limits to how much you can save in a k no more than &# in for and thereafter the limit is indexed for inflation meaning youll be able to save more in four years when bill turns hell be eligible to make additional catch up contributions in workers years or older can sock away an extra &# a year to figure out how much my uncle needs to save he needs to set a retirement savings goal this calculator helped him estimate the amount he needs to save based on his current savings and monthly expenses his reaction sticker shock he was further behind on his savings than hed expected many workers particularly younger ones blanch at calculators showing theyll need &# million or more to retire comfortably instead of worrying about that seven digit figure my uncle needs to focus on how to get there a reasonable savings goal is for bill to put away through his own plan contributions and his employers matching contributions twice his current annual income by the time he retires as this article explains if bill can get to that level he should start getting more growth from his investment gains than from his contributions and that should help him attain the million plus dollars in savings hell need in retirement so now bill has to figure out what percentage of his income he needs to contribute to his k to meet that savings goal the average worker contributes of income to retirement plans according to the employee benefits research institute the average employer match is id try to do better however aim to save at least of gross income before any employer contributions people are living longer and health care costs continue to outpace inflation so its wise to save as much as you can to ensure you dont outlive your savings my uncle needs to do better still he needs to save of his gross income to achieve his saving goal before he reaches age when hell be eligible for full social security benefits but bills worried that if he saves that much he and his wife barbara wont be able to live on whats left of his paycheck i suggested he set the contribution level a little lower initially say to and each year when he receives a raise bump up his savings rate by until he hits the contribution limits at the very least bill should be saving enough to qualify for his employers full matching contribution that doubles his money before his contribution is even invested and because bills contributions are made before theyre taxed the hit to his paycheck will be a lot less than the actual amount contributed this worksheet can tell him how much he can expect in his paycheck now that bills decided on a contribution level he can use this calculator to help crunch the numbers to show him if hes on target to meet his retirement savings goal so on to figuring out how best to invest his funds bills plan includes stock and bond mutual funds a money market fund and the option to invest in company stock the plans web site broke out the funds performance and fees so he could easily see which funds were the strongest of the bunch among the fund offerings are target date funds also known as life cycle funds which hold a mix of stock and bond funds the closer my uncle gets to retirement age the more conservative the funds investments will become the funds managers also eliminate the task of having to rebalance the k portfolio regularly to ensure that it retains the proper mix of investments bill liked the idea of having someone else making investment decisions for him and not having to deal with rebalancing so he decided to invest in a target date fund the one drawback higher fees between the fees for the underlying funds and for additional management target date funds tend to charge higher fees typically around still he felt not having to worry about his investment mix would be worth the additional cost and hes in luck the target date fund offered by his plan t rowe price retirement has lower than average fees and its among the sectors strongest performers according to this recent journal article my uncle has more than a decade to save before he reaches retirement age so hes willing to opt for an aggressive fund in an attempt to maximize his investment returns but a portfolio dominated by stock funds isnt always the right option even for younger workers says jack vanderhei a temple university professor and fellow at the employee benefit research institute "if people think that they might need that money in the very short term for retirement a hardship withdrawal or something else they may want to consider keeping some of the money in something relatively liquid such as a money market fund " he says another common option not included in bills plan is a managed account which creates a customized portfolio based on your financial circumstances and manages the investments for you as with target date funds this additional layer of hand holding comes at a price managed account fees average about if bills plan didnt include target date funds hed be on his own in figuring out the proper asset allocation for his account unfortunately theres no one size fits all model for figuring out the right balance of stock and bond funds the proper mix depends on bills risk tolerance high timeframe relatively long and savings goal large if bill were years younger hed want to be heavily weighted in stock funds to get the maximum benefit of long term growth say in stock funds and in bond funds if he were years older on the other hand a more conservative mix stocks and bonds would be more prudent its important to remember to factor in investments held outside the k to ensure your overall portfolio is properly diversified a portfolio that invests in an appropriate mix of stocks and bonds will generally rise with the market and trim losses should the market turn lower if for example barbara had an ira that was concentrated in stock mutual funds bill might want to consider boosting the bond fund allocation in his retirement plan to balance that out many employers make their matching contributions with company stock but generally speaking you dont want to invest more than of your overall portfolio this way my uncle holds company stock in an ira that came from a former employers k retirement plan and hes been happy with its performance so hes decided to hold onto those shares instead of investing in his new employers stock through the retirement plan bills plan doesnt offer the choice between a traditional k or a roth k but if it did hed face another decision traditional k s are funded with pre tax dollars and the savings grow tax deferred until retirement when withdrawals are taxed at personal income rates as this article explains workers pay income taxes on contributions to a roth k upfront but withdrawals in retirement are generally tax free to know which kind of account makes more sense my uncle needs to consider his tax situation my uncles in his peak earning years and hes fallen behind in his retirement savings so chances are hell be taxed at a lower rate when he retires while everyones situation is different it makes more sense for bill to contribute to a traditional k so he can get the benefit of pre tax savings now if he were in his s or early s and likely in a lower tax bracket a roth k and its promise of eventual tax free withdrawals would make more sense that said theres no guarantee revenue starved lawmakers will keep their mitts off roth accounts in the future planning for retirement can seem daunting particularly if youre trying to make ends meet or are getting a late start as bill is but break the challenge down into easy to digest chunks and before you know it youll be on your way to a more financially secure future my uncles relieved to have a savings plan in place and when hes happy im happy are you actively involved in managing your k retirement savings account or do you set it and forget it what would you change about your companys
