personal business irs audit little chance but if this is peak season for audit anxiety with the deadline to file tax returns just two days off most people already see tax preparation as confusing on top of that the notion of an audit of being asked to document the claims on ones tax return is dizzying at the least and terrifying at its worst heres the lowdown on your risk of being audited how the process works and what you should expect if your return is singled out for inspection for starters relax most individual returns are unlikely to get audited and a traditional sit down audit is particularly rare the internal revenue service conducts two types of audits and both focus only on a couple of lines not the entire return except under very rare circumstances about are "correspondence audits" that require the submission of documents to clarify an item on the return after receiving the relevant records the irs may issue a proposed adjustment to your tax bill though it can be appealed the second type of audit is the more traditional one called a field or desk audit that requires a meeting with an irs agent the irs has increased the number of audits on individual tax returns to a total million in fiscal from about in fiscal still audits amounted to only about of the million total returns filed in your odds of being audited go up with your income and the complexity of your return "we dont want to spend our time examining people who are reporting the proper amount of money " notes bruce friedland an irs spokesman so the agency uses a mathematical formula to identify returns with a higher likelihood of finding additional tax due most returns those with income below &# will easily pass this test because they are less complicated in fact only of those returns were subjected to audit in and of those were correspondence audits for those making more than &# but less than a &# million about of returns were audited though were correspondence audits the odds are less favorable for the wealthy more than of returns with income of &# million or more were audited in fiscal and were in person audits "if youre earning that kind of money and we notice a problem youre going to hear from us " irs commissioner mark w everson says in a statement on the agencys web site note that a third type of inquiry which is not an audit comes from an irs computer matching program that finds discrepancies between your return and items reported by a third party like an employer or brokerage this type of inquiry should arrive within weeks of filing as opposed to a real audit notice that typically wont appear for two to three years due to backlogs at the agency if taxpayers think the letter is incorrect they can appeal otherwise they sign off and pay the additional tax you may not have to handle the scrutiny of an audit alone most tax preparation services and software offer optional assistance for audits although that extra protection may need to be purchased prior to filing for example h&amp r block and its taxcut software offers a peace of mind plan for &# intuits popular turbotax software has a similar service for &# called audit defense both services provide representation for all interaction with the irs in event of an audit including appeals though there is no coverage if you want to go to court to challenge an irs determination if you used a certified public accountant to prepare your return that person will likely represent you in any interaction with the irs "most will say that they will represent you and stand behind their work " says tom ochsenschlager vice president of taxation with the american institute of certified public accountants "but there is a limit and there may be some extra charges involved " of course if the audit is the result of the tax preparers mistake he or she will likely help solve the problem and cover related costs if you prepared your own return you can hire someone to help you with the audit process you can hire a cpa an attorney or an enrolled agent a tax preparer licensed by the treasury department to represent you in dealings with the irs while some people may not require help to produce documentation for the irs others will feel more comfortable having assistance clearly in more complicated matters it will be useful to have someone lend a professional and knowledgeable hand though the prospect of an audit will always be scary the truth is that people with legitimate deductions and proper documentation have little to fear from the irs tax professionals say in general you should keep all applicable tax records for three years after the april filing deadline according to the irs because you generally cant be audited after that period however if you underreport your income by more than the statute of limitations is six years and there is no limit if a return is intentionally fraudulent you may need to keep records for many years to substantiate the cost of securities and real estate you havent yet sold is there a bright side to tax audits h&amp r block senior tax researcher jackie perlman makes a valiant effort to find one "totally avoiding an audit is not necessarily a good thing " because it may mean you are avoiding legitimate steps to minimize your taxable income she says one way to minimize audit risk for instance "is to not take any deductions" and she isnt recommending that
