love &amp money remodeling conflict taste vs resale recently i was telling a friend about how were remodeling the master bathroom in our house her reaction "wow you dont see that in baton rouge " she meant that as a compliment i think but she also unintentionally raised a whole different issue the truth is that while my wife amy and i love the remodeling it does reflect what some in this area might consider an unusual style its the kind of style that makes people say "wow you dont see that in baton rouge " for a few weeks now ive been thinking about that comment and the underlying questions it sparked are we hurting the resale value of our home by putting in a bathroom that nobody else will want where do resale value and personal tastes cross paths when remodeling your house in other words do you temper your desire for what you want your home to be because what you want may temper a future buyers enthusiasm or do you disregard the future to enjoy the present when i told amy what i planned to write about this week she asked "why would something better lower the value of our house " because i replied "better" is in the eye of the buyer certainly no one thinks his or her tastes are bad but you dont have to look far to know that plenty of people arent being honest with themselves you might love the kitschy look of a s bathroom with the small multicolored multishaped tiles on the floor and shower walls but when most potential buyers look at that they either cross your house off their list or mentally mark down the price by the thousands of dollars theyll spend on tearing it out and putting in a new bathroom your style is their disaster but so what your personal style made you happy while you lived in the house and is that ultimately more important than the thousands of dollars you may lose on the resale a few years ago one of my longtime friends paid for an extensive remodeling to his new jersey home spending on items that he knew werent likely to come back to him in a higher resale one day all the real estate research told him that bathrooms and kitchens are where homeowners generally recoup most if not all of their remodeling dollars but he ignored the much needed overhaul of his bathroom and put in a pretty basic upgrade for his kitchen instead he poured more money into enclosing a porch so he could have a year round room with lots of windows he loves the new sunroom and has no qualms about having the old bathroom and a functional kitchen "i may feel differently years from now when i decide to sell " he says "but id hate to spend the next years walking around my house thinking this really isnt the way i want it but that kitchen and bath are going to be great attractions when i put it on the market one day " my friend christie in los angeles is taking a similar view with the remodeling of her new condominium the project has cost her about double her original guesstimates "and that means ill have to stay longer to break even " she says "but im willing to cut that deal instead of shortchanging myself in creating that nest i want " when she remodeled previous homes she says "i always considered whether the money would come back out at sale time not coming back out not going to spend it " but this time around she says "im considering the remodel work to be more spending rather than investment " another friend sees it as a pure financial decision he and his wife are remodeling a kitchen and he would love such things as a six burner stove dual ovens and other high end accessories but he says "i know theres no way wed get the tens and tens of thousands of dollars out of the house when we sell it " "we dont plan to be in this house forever and it will take someone really into cooking to want to pay up for this kind of kitchen " he says "most potential buyers would say wow this is really cool but then walk away and find something easier to live with that isnt so intimidating " instead theyre planning a buyer friendly upgrade with more traditional appliances and a less aggressive design scheme "i want our house to fit our style while were here " my friend says "but unless i plan to die here i want to recoup as much money as possible from a remodel " heres the bathroom that came with our house a faux italian look with fixtures of gold white wallpaper and clamshell sinks its a fairly cold look and not our style heres the bathroom were building an asian inspired haven with bamboo floors and a bathtub built for two theres a glassed in shower chrome body jets and lots of slate for us it all offers a warmer feel but its also a strongly asian theme uncommon in a town that hews to a safe traditional look moreover some of the upgrades such as temperature controlled faucets arent likely to improve the value at resale but add substantially to the cost so is it worth it financially speaking probably not this bath is highly stylized to our tastes and our tastes wont sit well with most potential buyers in this part of the country we could scale back the remodel to save money and design a room more likely to recoup its cost but we expect to be here many years and if so then years from now even the most buyer friendly remodel will look as dated as a s bathroom does today more important if you do plan to live somewhere for years why invest so much effort and money if the end result leaves you uninspired albeit with a slightly fatter bank account to me and amy this new room will make our house a more comfortable home and thats the ultimate message assuming youre going to live somewhere for a while the value in a remodel isnt in the resale its in the emotional payoff of living in the house you want today jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal write him at
