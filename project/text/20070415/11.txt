starting out in laws bearing gifts twenty six year old crystal lopez was uncomfortable accepting a condo in downtown atlanta as a wedding gift from her fiances parents two years ago but "when people are that generous it is very hard to say thanks but no thanks " the telephone sales executive says still she says the down side was clear after the wedding "the in laws felt like they could influence the decision making" on matters from the couples finances to what paintings hung on the walls one day ms lopez walked into her kitchen to find her husbands grandmother rearranging the cabinets not only did "i feel like i had no financial stake in my marriage i felt like my in laws didnt have any confidence in my ability to be a wife " says ms lopez who recently divorced deciding whether to accept a big financial gift from mom and dad when youre in your twenties can be difficult in part because of uncertainty about strings that may be attached and the situation is particularly sensitive for couples offered a gift by one set of in laws or the other to head off possible conflicts "spend lots of time discussing your expectations in advance" of saying yes suggests richard shadick a psychologist and director of the counseling center at pace university in new york one important consideration is to find out if the "gift" really is a gift gifts that are laced with strings can quickly become "an employment contract or a curse " says david h diesslin a financial planner in fort worth texas for example a client couple of his asked their child to build an addition in return for the down payment on a home "they wanted their room to be closer to the grandkids " mr diesslin explains some people may actually mean their "gift" to be more like a loan or even an investment giving them a stake in the real estate you are buying or a business you are starting you obviously need to understand that from the start and weigh the offer accordingly if parents think they are making an investment they may expect a more active role in managing it say financial planners often the gift is money and its important to find out if the gifting parents have ideas about how theyd like you to spend their gift and what would disturb them perhaps they want to help you pay for the wedding but not spring for a lavish honeymoon in fiji even if the gift isnt earmarked "there may be hidden expectations " says mr diesslin to find that out ask questions such as do you mind if we take this money and use it for a vacation what about a car or come right out and ask them what their expectations are if the gift is from your parents your spouse may be reticent to speak up for fear of appearing ungrateful so after you find out what the gifting parents expect the two of you should discuss the matter privately before responding suggests dr shadick if you decide that accepting the offer may create more problems than it would fix "you might want to just say i appreciate your offer but we are going to do this on our own " says judy heltzel a financial planner in salem ore another option to avoid feeling beholden for a large gift and to clarify the relationship she says is to agree to accept the money only as a loan that you will repay on a regular schedule with a reasonable rate of interest if you are accepting money as a loan or as an investment you should draft a written agreement says jennifer s wilkov the author of financial guide "dating your money " to set up a schedule of loan payments you can go online to bankrate com brm popcalc asp ms wilkov says you might even want a written agreement for a true gift if the gifting parents have expectations you can get them in writing and if they dont have expectations you can get that in writing too email diana ransom wsj com
