never lose on stocks again for a price safety nets arent just for circus performers any more for investors who are uncomfortable with the notion of losing money in the stock market a risk highlighted by the drop in the dow jones industrial average between feb and march insurance companies and brokerage firms have rolled out a number of stock related investments that are designed to never lose money but theres a catch whether in the form of so called structured products issued by brokerages or equity indexed annuities from insurers the guarantee can come at a cost of high upfront fees or hefty penalties for withdrawing money before a specified number of years have elapsed some products cap potential earnings in a good year for stocks they often have many moving parts that can be difficult to understand and arent always tax efficient the safety net investments arent made up of stock portfolios like a typical mutual fund offering instead they are contracts in one form or another in which the firm agrees to give you returns that are linked in some specified way to the stock markets performance it is vital that investors understand what they are giving up in exchange for the security these investments provide "there is a trade off " says j p armenio who runs structured products globally for morgan stanleys retail business consider a type of structured product that morgan stanley issued in february under the long name of capital protected notes based on a global basket of indices symbol gbi the notes mature in at which point investors will get back the initial purchase price plus an amount that reflects the performance of a basket of three indexes the dow jones euro stoxx index the standard &amp poors stock index and japans nikkei if the three indexes double over the next four years someone who put in the minimum investment of &# will get &# back if the indexes fall over the four years the investor still gets the original &# and nothing more but investors dont get to collect dividends from the index stocks as they would if they owned mutual funds tracking the three indexes and the promise of no losses only applies to investors who hold to maturity in the interim investors can sell the notes which are traded on the american stock exchange but might have to do so at a loss many investors havent heard of structured investments even though wall street firms have been selling them for several years but you are likely to start hearing a lot more about them thanks to some regulatory changes and the fact that firms are growing more and more comfortable with these products they are a fast growing asset class related products from the insurance industry are called equity indexed annuities they are similarly designed so that holders get stock linked returns but will also be protected in the event of a stock market decline with equity indexed annuities a key trade off is that gains are capped when stocks are soaring consider the sample annuity design shown in the table over the years through a period that included a steep bear market but also several big gains a product with this design would have returned a cumulative over the same period an investment in the vanguard index fund which tracks the s&amp p returned scott stolz president of the insurance agency of brokerage raymond james says its a mistake to expect from an equity indexed annuity the same kind of performance you expect from a stock mutual fund "it is not a substitute for a mutual fund " rather the right investor for equity indexed annuities is someone who typically buys bank certificates of deposit and wants to improve his or her return slightly but with the same protections that the cd provides mr stolz says many financial planners are approaching structured products cautiously but a number of them profess an overwhelming dislike of equity indexed annuities among the gripes annuity designs seem unnecessarily complicated and investors can be charged for surrendering an annuity as long as years after they bought it also it appears that these annuities are all too often sold to the wrong people for the wrong reason many financial planners offer stories of year old retirees who dont understand that they will face financial penalties if they want to pull out of an annuity but who are lured into the annuity because they are worried about a falling stock market "they are not short term products although they can be made to appeal to emotions caused by short term market conditions " notes tim maurer director of financial planning at the financial consulate in lutherville md he thinks conservative investors most comfortable with bank cds should generally stick to those holdings rather than venture into annuities the bad reputation of equity indexed annuities is partly deserved says john kawauchi vice president of business development of the individual investment group at insurer nationwide financial services but he says that doesnt mean there arent good alternatives out there in nationwide started offering equity indexed annuities that are easier to understand and that have only a seven year period during which the investment cannot be surrendered without penalty even such annuities though are "clearly not meant for money that you may need in the short term " mr kawauchi notes both structured products and annuities come with one very important caveat that planners say investors should not ignore their payouts depend on the financial health of the brokerage or insurance company that issued them which makes it important to deal only with highly rated firms email forum sunday wsj com
