marketwatch steps to take if a broker flubs a trade its one of an investors worst nightmares you make the right call on a stock order that would bring a tidy profit only to see your gain evaporate because your broker made an error many people react to a mistake that costs them money with irate telephone calls and emails to the broker that may escalate into threats to close the account and promises to hire a securities attorney to hammer out the grievance "were afraid were not going to get the relief were seeking and our fear takes the form of aggression " says gary goodman president of customersatisfaction com a glendale calif based management consulting firm "then we have a conflict on top of the problem and thats where things go terribly wrong " how can you right a brokers perceived wrong satisfactorily even amicably try following these four steps  fix problems not blame the first step toward resolving the dispute is perhaps the hardest dealing with your broker the trick is to confront without confrontation given the circumstances chances are the broker will be guarded so unloading a barrage of accusations can bring an already fragile relationship to a breaking point "you dont want to get into an adversarial mindset right away " mr goodman says instead of flailing against a faceless firm and finding a defensive broker hiding behind its high walls a cooperative tone makes it possible to negotiate from strength calmly and clearly ask what happened and without laying blame let the broker know you expect a timely response and a resolution "were creating an environment where the broker says i dont know let me look into this for you " mr goodman says  dont take no for an answer if youre stonewalled give the broker a different kind of limit order one that pins him down to an answer either later that same day or the next morning if the broker misses this deadline or informs you that an investigation shows your trade was executed properly then contact the branch manager and ask how to keep this dispute from going beyond the branch some companies obviously are more conciliatory than others brokerages take just over three days on average to respond to customer complaints a study by market research firm j d power shows among the largest u s firms the study says charles schwab and edward jones scored best responding in slightly less than two days on average "when people call the first time or visit the office they want resolution immediately " says james lohmann senior director of investment services research at j d power "the longer they wait the worse the overall satisfaction gets at five days or more it really starts to impact the relationship "  proving your point if the branch manager cant or wont help then youll have to climb the corporate ladder with a large publicly traded brokerage tell the public or investor relations department about your problem let them know you havent been able to get satisfaction on the branch level and that a positive outcome for your dispute not a public airing is all you want "their whole function is either to do damage control or to maintain the best image of the organization " says mr goodman "and they dont want it to be widely known that they make mistakes " at the same time write to the firms legal and compliance departments a letter or email is adequate but mr goodman suggests that sending the letter by registered mail or by overnight delivery packs a stronger punch including the firms chairman or chief executive among the recipients doesnt hurt either tell these officials that youre prepared to retain an attorney and to file a complaint with the nasd the securities industry regulator that handles of securities arbitrations and will investigate your claim but also let them know that youre willing to give the firm time to research your situation before heading in that direction  last resort suppose after all this goodwill effort the brokerage still wont budge at that point you face a decision about mediation or arbitration the nasd site www nasd com is a valuable resource offering information about the process and providing forms to request mediation or to initiate an arbitration claim theres also a section on finding a qualified attorney an asset when dealing with the brokerages own experienced legal hands regulators encourage claimants to consider mediation which can be less contentious and cheaper than arbitration with mediation both parties agree to a neutral third party review mediated decisions are nonbinding either side can disagree and proceed to arbitration which is final more than arbitration cases were closed in according to the nasd altogether eight of every arbitration disputes were resolved last year without a hearing in cases that wound up before arbitrators customers were victorious of the time "i just urge people to try to resolve it on their own quickly " says john gannon senior vice president for investor education at nasd "if you get to the firm right away there may be more options also it shows that youve identified the problem and youre being careful about whats going on with your account "
