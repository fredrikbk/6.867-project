real time readers ponder copyright email heres a collection of tips for ensuring sanity doesnt vanish with email tide online edition time for a dip into the real time mailbag recent columns about copyright and consumers rights the scourge of excess internal email and the announcement of higher quality drm free songs from emi and apple all seemed to strike a nerve with readers on to copyright discussed here as always letters have been edited you can always write to me at realtime wsj com if you dont want your letter considered for publication in an upcoming real time please make that clear thanks to everyone who wrote in karl fogel writes in questioncopyright org went around chicago with a video camera interviewing people in the street about copyright you can see the results here what we found confirmed what weve been hearing informally for years people sincerely believe copyright is how creative artists make a living even though its not and that the right to "own" your work that is to permanently control who can and cant make copies is natural and timeless even though copyright is a relatively recent invention and descended from a censorship law people also feel that copyright is largely about protection from plagiarism even though plagiarism is a nonissue in file sharing cases since they revolve around attributed copies what all this means unfortunately is that todays copyright laws may be an example of democracy working as designed we have the dmca and similar laws not because our legislatures are bought or hoodwinked by lobbyists but because constituents truly believe that firm long term control over distribution is necessary to support content creation the good news is that this myth is starting to crumble as people gain experience with the geyser of creativity available on the internet and see that it shows no signs of slowing down despite rampant filesharing but it wont be enough merely to have someone speaking "for" the people in this debate the people all of us need to understand that copyright was designed to support a particular distribution mechanism and that with distribution costs dropping inexorably toward zero drastic changes to copyright will best serve the public good mr fogel is the editor of questioncopyright org matthew g wylie writes the gist of the above column seems to be "what is the harm " if you own a vacant parcel of land in the country and someone comes onto the land without permission and goes camping without leaving a trace the other person is still trespassing even though there is no "harm" to you as the property owner one of the most important property rights is the power to exclude all the different examples that you discuss in your column may be economically beneficial transactions so if the intellectual property owner wants to exercise his power to exclude others from using his content for those transactions that is and should be his right so that he can negotiate a share of the economic benefit that the other parties are receiving from the transaction nelson d nolte writes your criticism of the courts for their decisions is misplaced the courts must follow the law that congress enacts even if it is counterproductive or just plain dumb as long as its not unconstitutional when courts go into the area of legislation to make what the judge believes in his opinion to be a better or more sensible result they are violating the democratic process we are all better off when judges interpret the law literally and leave democratically elected representatives to make law even if in particular cases this brings about a result that you may not like your calls for change should be directed at congress and not at the courts alex bowles writes consumers are absolutely getting neglected but thats not the worst if it if the anticonsumer groups out there today had their way the consumers would be legally barred from the discussion permanently consumers know this and theyve responded with counterattacks of their own i suspect the escalation wont be good for anybody to date the riaa mpaa and wipo have all made it clear that they regard fair use as anathema and a zero sum game where a "win" for consumers is a "loss" for them for them its all about control and the more control youve got the more money you can make conversely in any arena in which you lose control you lose profits ergo legal responsibility to maximize shareholder value is interpreted as a legal requirement to conduct constant attacks on any forms of distribution circulation or repurposing that a fail to generate direct profits for publishers and b fail to do so on their terms this theory misses two key points the first is that for any entertainment property to be successful it must be culturally relevant second the entertainment companies do not own the culture theyre attempting to reflect in other words consumers have a very real stake in this deal and status far greater than "read only " this status is reflected in law by fair use provisions the freedom from royalty payments on second hand book sales the ability to duplicate media for noncommercial reasons the legality of libraries and so on the activity these freedoms generates contributes to the consensus we regard as culture and in turn the raw material for the entertainment industrys continued productivity when consumers see themselves getting turfed out of participation in their own culture through aggressive interpretations of copyright law the use of new technologies to exert previously unfeasible levels of control over media or laws like the dmca that subvert fair use altogether they do not react kindly or passively nor do they waste time trying to amass political power in a nakedly partisan environment that gives access only to the well financed instead they use the power theyve already got by swiftly cutting the abusers out of the unwritten social contracts that underpin all commercial relationships forcing them into court if they want to get paid and totally ignoring shrill propaganda that says downloading music is just like stealing cars an entire generation is smart enough to see right through this nonsense deciding instead that the riaa and their ilk are pure evil and that drm is flatly unacceptable media companies have done a lot to give credence to this view by expressing a totally unrestrained desire for control first of the media itself then of the audiences experience of the media and finally of the audiences ability to refer to that media in any responses they may care to make naturally this is something that any consumer worth his salt is going to resist people dont mind paying for media but they expect a measure of ownership read freedom once theyve shelled out and they dont want to pay for the same content twice just because it comes in a different wrapper the content industry sees nothing reasonable about either one of these positions and thats the problem theirs is an aristocratic view in a democratic world and neither one can really tolerate the existence of the other on to the horrors of unnecessary internal email which i contended does far more harm to our inboxes than spam ironically this column wound up atop the online journals most emailed list which i got no shortage of ribbing about an entertaining follow up lynn gaertner johnston whose superb business blog i quoted pointed out a flaw in my being willing to be included on emails noting floodprone toilets or rabid raccoons locked in closets why communicate such a message via email "if the middle stall will overflow or the raccoon is ready to go for an ankle emailing the entire organization will not work " she wrote "who knows when people will read the message perhaps long after the plunging is done and animal control has come and gone with a bagged animal its more efficient to put a sign on the toilet stall door or lock the door from the inside likewise putting crime scene or caution tape over the closet door is the way to protect people from the rabid raccoon both these ways get peoples attention much more than another mass email and its just in time communication " shes absolutely right of course put a sign on the door why didnt i think of that well im kinda dumb but thats not news part of the problem i think is that weve become so used to email as our method of office communication that using any other method is thinking out of the box if i were at home id never dream of emailing my wife that there was an enraged raccoon in the closet id put a sign on the door put me at my desk and that doesnt occur to me amazing here are some tips from pragmatic to fanciful from readers struggling with internal spam tom abdella writes my standard is one or two sentences per message if anything more is required with few exceptions one of the sentences becomes a request to talk steve hartkopf writes about a month ago i decided to reduce my sent email production by and see what would happen predictably my emails received went down by about praise jesus note some of this strategy was pure speculation and some was skill specifically  i no longer send emails to someone i can walk to visit in three minutes or am scheduled to see in hours  i leave hand written notes rather than emails whenever possible they provide the same quality of communication as an email but lead to fewer replies and those replies tend to be hand written on my hand written note and limited to "yes " "no" or "lets discuss "  anything remotely confrontational is a phone call albeit sometimes one to preface an imminent email typically this softens the impact of the email and thereby produces fewer replies and prevents virtually all email wars  take a moment to "pause for the cause " if a subject is important and i know ill have to chime in but i can sense an email barrage brewing i simply wait until most to the energy is spent before responding at that point most of the fight is out of the combatants or their fingers are starting to numb so keyboard venting is no longer enjoyable mike kochan writes i believe the simplest and most effective means of simplifying my email clutter if only microsoft would make it happen would be to lump conversation strings automatically in outlook the way gmail and other online mail services do that way emails about a coworkers puppy could be conveniently lumped together enabling me to mass ignore them with a single thunderous "delete " bob hiss writes i was so bothered by this problem at my previous companies that i started a company to try and solve it ive looked at every solution that people have tried the solutions that have worked temporarily match what you are recommending the email recipient bears the cost of the problem but the solution requires the email sender to change his behavior unfortunately the sender has no incentive for doing so managers implement email etiquette training but the benefits only last for a short time until old bad habits return so i built a small software product that allows the manager to apply non cash postage to their teams internal email with a limited budget the sender must alter their behavior people love the concept but wont implement it which leads me to the conclusion that email overload has the same business urgency as bad weather both are fun to complain about but neither will change until managers are willing to transfer the cost of their email overload back to the people in their organization who send them the email that is supposedly overloading them and risk employee ire in the process email overload will persist mr hiss is the ceo of get back software another company seeking to get email users to budget their communications is seriosity robert rausch writes further enhancing the "are you sure" button is an application which calculates and displays the total cost of an email to the organization before its sent determined by total word count multiplied by the number of minutes it takes to read each word multiplied by the salary per minute of the email distribution list bryan chaffe writes this video has been making the rounds very funny and all too relevant scott dockter writes our company pbd worldwide fulfillment started "no internal email fridays" in july we have seen our overall internal email decrease by to how did this happen reports and reply all emails were the simplest to fix reports were moved to the company intranet and reply alls were eliminated by peer pressure many of the weekly summaries were either eliminated because they were deemed useless or also moved to the intranet more importantly we get up out of our offices and chairs and talk to each other as ceo i was guilty of emailing my assistant six or seven times a day when i could have simply walked to her desk feet away and solved things in less time simple measures with big results several articles have been written about our idea you can go to www pbd com and click on the no email link to see them i would deem to of email as useful the rest is a waste of time but i also feel i can do something about it talking to our team members about how to use email wisely and not waste time starts with the ceo and management setting the example eight months later we still have work to do on this but we are much better off than we were most importantly our customers feel better about how we are communicating with them mr dockter is the president and ceo of pbd worldwide fulfillment services finally there was my look at the announcement from emi and apple of drm free higher quality song files a lot of folks wrote in to take issue with my saying the album is dying as a format or to mourn its passing i dont think the album will truly vanish there will always be artists who like that format genres where its better established such as classical and jazz and listeners who want it but i do think the default format for new artists is moving to singles and eps another reason for that change music fans seem far more fickle than they once were once upon a time a blockbuster album at least guaranteed that your next release or two would sell pretty well and get a lot of attention now no more it feels like all but the very biggest bands are starting over with each release for that reason i think itll behoove artists to abandon the album tour nothing cycle which ive likened to cd crop rotation in favor of a steadier stream of songs eps videos and smaller scale tours that would give artists more of a chance to stay on their fans radar rob honeycutt writes why do people not feel bad about stealing music because they hate the fat cat middleman if consumers knew their cents was going to the musician i think youd see far less piracy but people know cents is going to line david geffens swimming pool with rubies note all the music on my own computer has been purchased via itunes and with drm i do not own any music taken from any other source i believe what is happening today with itunes drm emi etc has been long coming i believe the business side of music has long been sowing the seeds of discontent with their customers and when you sow discontent you will eventually reap some kind of collapse ultimately the industry will be far healthier for all this i think the middleman will become less fat the artists will become more free to express their creativity and the consumers of music will have greater variety more of the cents or &# you pay for a song will actually end up in the hands of the person who created the music in the first place it will be a smaller industry dollar wise but a healthier one i believe steve jobs for all his faults is probably the best friend to this industry in crisis randy harrison writes i disagree with your assertion that the cd configuration is necessarily dead on arrival the real problem as i see it is two fold first is cost when the music industry was in control they could charge what they wanted and they did competitive forces have forced change second is the quality issue the one song or "hit" is one thing but in recent years much of a cd was considered filler and of little value to fans why buy a cd for one or two songs i will argue that this is where change will come the "hit wonders" will probably go on a "hits as you go" plan however i foresee that many artists and their labels will see the multisong album in a new light not as an avenue to serve "filler to the masses " but rather as a means for creative expression i think this will be refreshing to many fans as well when i was growing up the single was king and the album which came later was a means for artists to strut their stuff and showcase a full set of their music not waste their fans time
