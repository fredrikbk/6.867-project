call to brave for &# billion rescue risks sparking bailout were still in shadows by post enron rules the bailout plan that is supposed to revitalize credit markets and prevent some major banks from straining their balance sheets raises two crucial questions why didnt investors see the problems coming and how could they have happened in the first place changes enacted after enron corp s collapse were supposed to prevent companies from burying risks in off balance sheet vehicles one lesson of enron was that the idea that companies could make profits without taking any risk proved to be as ridiculous as it sounds regulators made a great show of slamming closed that loophole but as the current situation makes clear they not only didnt close it all the way but the new rules in some ways made it even harder for investors to figure out what was going on that is causing headaches for investors in banks especially the biggest institutions such as citigroup bank of america and j p morgan chase all three along with assistance from the treasury department joined to craft the rescue package for what are known as structured investment vehicles or sivs these sivs along with vehicles called conduits dont get recorded on banks books because regulators and accounting rule makers gave banks a pass when crafting post enron rule changes meant to curtail off balance sheet activity all the banks had to do was structure the vehicles so that the risk of loss associated with them was ostensibly transferred to other parties then the vehicles could stay off a banks balance sheet that allowed banks to make bigger profits without having to tie up capital on their balance sheet never mind that the banks created ran and garnered fees from the vehicles but the bailout of some of these vehicles shows that banks and in turn their shareholders did shoulder a lot of the risk connected to some of these vehicles and essentially controlled them this belies the "whole legal fiction of separateness" as allowed by accounting rules said christopher whalen managing director of institutional risk analytics a los angeles research and risk management systems firm "this is the enron disease we have not killed it " he added enron structured transactions to be within the letter if not the spirit of accounting rules in a bid to keep the deals off its books and out of view of investors no one is saying of course that the big banks are literally shams like enron a spokesman for the financial accounting standards board which drafted the current rules declined to comment banks use sivs and conduits to issue short dated commercial paper and medium term notes investing the proceeds in assets such as credit card debt and mortgage securities the vehicles profit by capturing the difference or spread between the notes they sell and their investments their sponsor banks then garner these profits in the form of fees they charge the vehicles the lack of disclosure to investors about sivs and conduits along with the risks they pose is "significant enough that getting a real feel for what the potential impact could be is difficult " said craig emrick senior accounting analyst with moodys corp even if the exposure turns out to be minimal the profits banks generated from the sivs and conduits are at best going to be smaller in the future cutting into the earnings of banks such as citigroup that had significant amounts of these assets citigroup for example has nearly &# billion in sivs and conduits but its shareholders wouldnt get a clear view of this from reading the banks balance sheet instead footnotes only disclose that the bank provides "liquidity facilities" to conduits that had as of june &# billion in assets and liabilities "generally the company has no ownership interest in the conduits " the banks second quarter filing the latest available states the citigroup filing makes no mention of sivs in a letter to investors in august citigroup disclosed that it had about &# billion in siv assets although that has since declined to about &# billion a citigroup spokeswoman declined to comment banks typically agree to acquire the assets of their affiliated conduits if they cant roll over their ious but they only backstop a portion of siv assets that might make it seem like the banks have some liability and indeed some have had to step in but backstops arent a sign of ownership under accounting rules though in fact most off balance sheet vehicles conduits and sivs included dont have "owners" in the traditional sense rather they are like corporate zombies and are typically set up in offshore tax havens because of this accounting rule makers trying to clamp down on off balance sheet vehicles decided to look at who shares in the risks and rewards of a structure rather than who owns it when assessing control but banks found they could structure vehicles so that other parties would have to shoulder losses that allowed them to pass the risks test and keep the vehicles off their books fasb when crafting the new rules considered weighing the fees banks generate from running these vehicles as an indication of a reward that could also show control but the board didnt include that test fearing it would be too difficult to measure and that it could lead to over consolidation of assets that would weigh down banks balance sheets although the recent debt market turmoil and its effect on these vehicles have concerned accounting standard setters there is no plan at the moment to reconsider current rules see related article "banks seek investors for fund
