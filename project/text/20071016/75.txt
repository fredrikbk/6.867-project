medtronic defibrillator patients mull options experts advise monitoring but say fraction prone wires should be left alone if intact it has long been an open secret among heart doctors flaws in the fragile wires or "leads " connecting cardiac electrical devices to patients hearts are far more frequent than malfunctions in the devices themselves now that medtronic inc has pulled its sprint fidelis leads from the market due to their risk of fracturing hundreds of thousands of heart patients have been alerted to that reality and they must decide how to respond the company which says that patients world wide have a sprint fidelis attached to their hearts recommends that patients see their doctors immediately a cardiologist can reprogram a patients defibrillator to heighten its ability to sense a defect in a lead so it can send out a warning beep if a problem is detected some doctors are also recommending that patients sign up for medtronics monitoring system known as carelink which could alert patients to a possible fracture in the lead perhaps most important medtronic isnt recommending that the leads be taken out unless they are actually fractured and cardiologists overwhelmingly agree with that advice surgical removal of a lead is potentially deadly itself the lead sits in the patients vein scar tissue forms there and at the point in the heart where the lead attaches so extracting it can trigger bleeding which can be lethal if a lead is found to be fractured patients may have a choice of intervention doctors differ as to whether lead extraction or adding a new lead threaded through the same vein is a better approach but many patients will have to have it extracted because there isnt room for a new lead in the vein bruce l wilkoff director of cardiac pacing at the cleveland clinic counsels that it makes a great deal of difference who takes out the lead generally he says a large hospital or cardiology practice with a doctor who regularly does many such cases would be a good choice "nobody has the perception that its easy to operate and fix this " says dr wilkoff a man whom some colleagues call the "babe ruth of lead extraction " in announcing the recall early yesterday medtronic said that its sprint fidelis leads have broken at a rate apparently higher than that of competing leads including another from medtronic when the lead fractures it can have serious consequences some patients can receive unnecessary and massive shocks sometimes compared to the jolt of sticking a fork in a light socket other patients dont get the shock when they do need it to save their lives after cardiac arrest overall five patients so far have died in cases medtronic says may be related to the flaw so far of the implanted leads have malfunctioned over a month period studied by medtronic since the devices introduction in the fall of most of these thousands of malfunctions are fractures many patients will learn of a fracture when their defibrillator emits an audible beep a built in design feature meant to alert patients to potential malfunctions others about of medtronic defibrillator patients with sprint fidelis leads are part of the carelink system this computer system in the patients home transmits data from the device to the doctors office this information would include early warning that a lead is beginning to fracture robert g hauser a minneapolis cardiologist says he is beginning to enter some of his patients especially young and active ones into the carelink system no additional procedure is necessary to sign patients up for carelink defibrillators are surgically implanted in people who are at high risk of having their hearts race uncontrollably toward cardiac arrest and death within minutes for such patients not having a defibrillator would be far worse than confronting rare malfunctions still malfunctions have plagued the defibrillator industry two years ago for example there were wide recalls of flawed defibrillators from medtronic itself and from guidant corp now part of boston scientific corp back then the concern was that a short circuit or battery flaw could render the device ineffective leaving the patient vulnerable to death from the underlying disease this time the flawed medtronic lead itself can in rare instances send inappropriate and multiple shocks to the heart potentially triggering a lethal heart rhythm dr hauser who earlier this year wrote in the journal heart rhythm that his practice had seen higher than expected failures in the medtronic lead says he knows of such a case in researching the issue dr hauser says he learned of a young man in london who died after "inappropriate shocks" altered his heart rhythm medtronic declined to comment on the case a search of the food and drug administrations database of adverse events tied to medical devices turned up reports of injuries that involved a fractured lead and named a sprint fidelis device a large number of these came to the agency recently with about delivered on sept in what appeared to be a massive influx from medtronic reports of problems often increase after a medical journal publishes a study about an issue a search of this database turned up reports of deaths that mentioned sprint fidelis model leads dating back to march several of these involved infections or other issues rather than a failure of the device the report of one death which occurred aug listed "shock inappropriate" as a problem with the device another case involving a death said the device reportedly did "not deliver the full charge " the fda said it is reviewing similar products to see if they may have the same problem but daniel schultz the director of the agencys device center says that "at this point we dont have any connection to other devices " he adds that based on the information the fda has so far medtronic appears to have acted appropriately "the most important message at this point is not to follow the knee jerk reaction" and try to get the device removed says dr schultz "only in very unusual circumstances would it be appropriate to replace the device prophylactically " medtronic says that if a sprint fidelis lead is fractured it will pay for a new lead free plus up to &# for unreimbursed medical expenses some doctors say that adding a new lead threaded through the same vein is preferable to extraction and leslie a saxon chief of cardiovascular medicine at the university of southern california says many patients will simply get a new lead installed but dr hauser says he is generally recommending extraction at top hospitals the risk of death in lead extractions should be less than and the possibility that an operation will be needed to repair a torn vein would be in the range of to said charles j love director of cardiac rhythm device services at ohio state university but he says that in less experienced hands the perforated or torn vessel rate could be as high as shock to the system what to do if you think you may have a medtronic sprint fidelis defibrillator lead dont get the lead removed unless there is evidence of a fracture your doctor can reprogram the device to reduce chance of inappropriate shocks this reprogramming will increase chance that a fracture will be detected and you will be alerted if you do need a lead extracted try a major hospital or doctors practice ask about that doctors experience number of extractions and complication rate sources wsj interviews medtronic doctor and patient letters
