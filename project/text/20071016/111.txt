talking b school new focus for dartmouth m b a s venerable dean shows flexibility adapts school to changing world the turnover rate for deans has been accelerating at many business schools but dartmouth college in hanover n h is clearly in no hurry to replace paul danos the dean of its tuck school of business the oldest graduate business school this year dartmouth reappointed the year old dr danos to a fourth four year term which will make him one of the longest serving b school deans m b a track columnist ron alsop interviewed him recently about his plans for tuck the value of faculty research and the changing world of b school deans wsj what are your primary goals during your fourth term dr danos i am staying to see through my vision of creating an environment where students have unprecedented access to faculty through smaller classes and seminars thats part of our new strategy which we are referring to as tuck one major objective of tuck is to create theory to practice seminars with eight to m b a students getting direct exposure to the research process and learning more about the facultys methods of solving the riddles of the business world there will also be greater emphasis on leadership and globalization as we provide more non u s projects and add more leadership coaching we are also adding new types of communication courses that emphasize being a persuasive leader q how many additional professors will you need for the smaller classes and seminars a to achieve more one on one contact we want a student to faculty ratio of to compared with the current to that means we will need to more full time faculty bringing the total to about there has been much criticism of business schools for focusing on research with little direct relevance to the business world do you believe thats a fair complaint the biggest myth is that schools are full of egghead quantitative gurus who never think about todays pressing business issues our faculty members do conduct research on current practical business topics that they then bring into the classroom we have a philosophy that great research leads to great teaching for example punam kellers "social marketing" course is based on her research on how not for profits can benefit their constituencies by using marketing techniques developed for the commercial world and eric johnson teaches "supply chain management " which is centered on the best practices he has uncovered in his research q from your perspective how has the deans job changed through the years a the globalization of business has created world wide demand for business education and our graduates want to be prepared for job opportunities all around the world so more than ever deans are challenged to develop a curriculum that is truly global and to ensure that students are ready to lead businesses in many different economies and cultures a big part of the educational process is the sharing among our students of their experiences and the more diverse the backgrounds of our students the more learning about different global settings takes place since i have been here tuck has seen dramatic increases in the number of international students in about of the class came from outside the u s that has grown to about q many deans have told me they tire of all the fund raising pressure has fund raising been a growing part of your job and does it distract you from academic matters a the fund raising doesnt take away from academic issues it is just part of what i do there is still plenty of time to work with faculty and curriculum committees back home but i am on the road a lot and much of it is to visit alumni in the u s and around the world i meet prospective students attend alumni club dinners and of course always take time to meet with potential donors tuck has over living alumni and give a contribution to the school each year by far the highest giving rate of any business school the average annual gift is &# in addition tuck alumni give capital gifts for buildings technology research centers scholarships professorships and the like which range from &# to over &# million q more schools seem to be hiring business executives as deans these days do they face different challenges than academics like yourself a the biggest challenge for nonacademics is to get an understanding and appreciation of the faculty culture and their research and for academics the biggest challenge is to gauge business demand and predict future trends in demand for graduates i currently serve on the boards of general mills and bjs wholesale club and have found that it helps me stay in touch with all of the high level general management issues of the day there is no better way to understand the ceos perspective short of being a ceo oneself to help bridge the things each of us might be missing i have created a series of dean roundtables where deans from different institutions and backgrounds get together to talk about the future of business management education so far we have done roundtables in germany brazil and france our next roundtable is coming up in december in budapest where well talk about the european union and eastern europe many of these conversations can be accessed at www deanstalk net an international deans blog q would you consider staying for a fifth term surpassing the year tenure of one of your predecessors at tuck or have you thought about retirement and life after tuck a i am not looking to break a record but as they say time flies when youre having fun and i dont believe it is out of the question for me to continue i know a change has to happen sometime but i am not looking forward to it theres always the option of kicking back and studying opera which i love or consulting with other leaders in the higher learning industry but for now i am too busy to think of slowing down email me at ron alsop wsj com with comments or questions about business education
