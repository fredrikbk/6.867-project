the rise of the religious left everyone knows the potent force of the christian right in american politics but since the mid s an increasingly influential religious movement has arisen on the left mostly escaping the national presss notice this new religious left does not expend its political energies on the cultural concerns that primarily motivate conservative evangelicals instead working mostly at the state and local level and often in lockstep with unions its ministers priests rabbis and laity exert a major sometimes decisive influence in campaigns to enforce a "living wage " to help unions organize and to block the expansion of nonunionized businesses like wal mart the new religious left is in one sense not new at all it draws its inspiration in part from the protestant "social gospel" movement of the late th and early th centuries especially baptist minister walter rauschenbusch who believed that the best way to uplift the downtrodden was to redistribute wealth and forge an egalitarian society rauschenbusch called for the creation of a kingdom of heaven here on earth just as presidential candidate barack obama did last week at a church in south carolina the popular catholic writer john ryan also advocated that government enact pro union legislation steep taxes on wealth and more stringent business regulation when fdr adopted several of ryans ideas the priest was given the sobriquet "the right reverend new dealer " his popularity reflected the tightening alliance between americas mainstream churches and organized labor that alliance disintegrated during the s when clerics like the notorious rebel priests the berrigan brothers began to agitate for a wider range of radical causes above all a swift end to the vietnam war the more culturally conservative blue collar workers who formed the union movements core wanted no part of this the alliance has been revitalized thanks in large part to savvy labor bosses such as john sweeney who grew up in a prototypical catholic pro union household when mr sweeney took over the afl cio in union membership was shrinking from of the work force years ago to in and just today he told church leaders that "unions need aggressive participation by the church in our organizing campaigns " the afl cio launched "labor in the pulpits " a program that encouraged churches and synagogues to invite union leaders to preach the virtues of organized labor and tout its political agenda nearly congregations in cities nationwide now take part annually mr sweeney himself has preached from the pulpit of washington d c s national cathedral urging congregants to join anti globalization protests in the capital under the auspices of labor in the pulpits catholic lutheran methodist and presbyterian clerics have composed guidelines for union friendly sermons and litanies as well as inserts for church bulletins that promote union legislation one insert asked congregants to pray for a federal minimum wage hike and also if the prayers didnt work presumably to contact their congressional representatives another urged congregants to lobby congress to pass the employee free choice act controversial legislation that would let unions organize firms merely by getting workers to sign authorizing cards rather than by conducting secret ballots as is currently required the chicago based union supported interfaith worker justice iwj arranges for seminarians to spend the summer months working with union locals some seminarians have helped unionize mississippi poultry workers aided the service employees international union in organizing georgia public sector employees and bolstered campaigns for living wage legislation in california municipalities working with iwj the labor movement has spawned some new religious left groups ranging from the massachusetts interfaith committee for worker justice to the chicago interfaith committee on worker issues to the los angeles based clergy and laity united for economic justice clue in los angeles clue clergy helped crush several statewide ballot initiatives that unions opposed including one that gave union workers the option of not paying dues that would fund union political activities in memphis clergy fought relentlessly via newspaper op eds public fasts and preaching for the passage of living wage bills that since have forced local businesses to hike wages well above the federal minimum labor religious coalitions have worked spectacularly well some municipalities have passed living wage laws more than religious organizations support iwj financially including the national council of churches of the usa ncc an umbrella organization of nearly mainstream christian denominations the presbyterian church usa the evangelical lutheran church in america and the episcopal church are particularly active the alliance between labor and the religious left also enjoys the powerful backing of the catholic church whose american hierarchy though often conservative on social issues is firmly left wing in its economic views despite decades of economic progress that have reduced unemployment levels to record lows and made america a magnet for opportunity seeking immigrants leading clergy of the religious left depict the free market as a vast exploitative force controlled by a small group of godless power brokers clergy describe wal mart for example in terms that its thousands of suppliers millions of employees and tens of millions of customers would hardly recognize the reverend jarvis johnson an iwj board member has urged congregants to invite the "hurting blind and crippled" to a metaphorical banquet who are these poor abused souls "they are wal mart associates who have to wait six months to a year to qualify for a health care plan " mr johnson explained religious left leaders blindly refuse to acknowledge the considerable academic research showing that mandated wage hikes often eliminate the jobs of low skilled workers the very people whom it seeks to help david neumark for example a researcher at the university of california at berkeleys institute of business and economics research and one of the worlds foremost authorities on wage laws has found that while living wage laws do boost the income of some low wage workers they also have "strong negative employment effects " that is they vaporize jobs in one study mr neumark noted that a boost in the living wage produced a decline in employment for the lowest skilled workers of between and religious left clerics also ignore the evidence that much poverty in prosperous opportunity rich america results from dysfunctional dare one call it "sinful" behavior around two thirds of poor families today are single parent households largely dependent on government subsidies and headed by women with little education the entry level low wage work for which these mothers are qualified makes it hard to support large families and the time they must devote to raising their kids makes it hard to climb the economic ladder poverty is increasingly about the irresponsible decision to have children out of wedlock in many inner city communities where poverty is entrenched of all children are now born out of wedlock in any event the religious lefts sympathies do not seem to be those of churchgoers while the ncc and its member churches pursue a variety of left wing causes even partnering with the activist organization moveon org and featuring speakers like michael moore at events a pew poll found that of white mainline protestants and of catholics voted republican in the presidential elections those who attended church regularly voted republican even more heavily at nearly the same rate as evangelical christians in fact for four decades as the leadership of americas mainline churches has moved steadily leftward those churches memberships declined as a percentage of the u s population while the number of christian evangelicals exploded left wing clerics may be buying greater political influence with their alliance through organized labor but the price may be further alienating their shrinking flock mr malanga is senior editor at the manhattan institutes city journal from whose autumn issue this is adapted see related letters "letters to the editor the religious left and living wage a matter of faith not politics" wsj oct
