secretary of state pelosi house speaker nancy pelosi famous for donning a head scarf earlier this year to commune for peace with the syrians has now concluded that this is the perfect moment to pass a congressional resolution condemning turkey for the armenian genocide of problem is turkey in has it within its power to damage the growing success of the u s effort in iraq we would like to assume this is not speaker pelosis goal to be clear we write that we would like to assume rather than that we do assume because we are no longer able to discern whether the speakers foreign policy intrusions are merely misguided or are consciously intended to cause a u s policy failure in iraq where is the upside in october to this armenian resolution the bill is opposed by eight former u s secretaries of state including madeleine albright after tom lantoss house foreign affairs committee voted out the resolution last week turkey recalled its ambassador from washington turkey serves as a primary transit hub for u s equipment going into both iraq and afghanistan after the kurdish terrorist group pkk killed turkish conscripts last week near the border with iraq turkeys prime minister recep tayyip erdogan asked the parliament to approve a huge deployment of the army along the border threatening an incursion into kurdish controlled iraq this of course is the one manifestly successful region of post saddam iraq in a situation teetering on a knife edge president bush has been asking mr erdogan to show restraint on the iraq border somehow none of this is allowed to penetrate speaker pelosis world she is offering various explanations for bringing the genocide resolution to the house floor "this isnt about the erdogan government " she says "this is about the ottoman empire " last seen more than years ago "genocide still exists " insists ms pelosi "we saw it in rwanda we see it now in darfur " yes but why now with turkey crucial to an iraq policy that now has the prospect of a positive outcome the answer may be found in the compulsive parochialism of the houses current edition of politicians mostly democrats california is home to the countrys largest number of politically active armenians speaker pelosi has many in her own district mr lantos represents the san francisco suburbs the bills leading sponsors include representatives adam schiff george radanovich and anna eshoo all from california pointedly jane harman the southern california democrat who speaker pelosi passed over for chair of the intelligence committee wrote an op ed for the los angeles times friday questioning the "timing" of the resolution and asking why it is necessary to embarrass a "moderate islamic government in perhaps the most volatile region in the world " why indeed perhaps some intrepid reporter could put that question to the three leading democratic presidential candidates who are seeking to inherit hands on responsibility for u s policy in this cauldron hillary clinton has been a co sponsor of the anti turk genocide resolution but would she choose to vote for it this week back when bill clinton was president mr lantos took a different view "this legislation at this moment in u s turkish relations is singularly counterproductive to our national interest " he said in september when there was much less at stake in the middle east according to reuters he added that the resolution would "humiliate and insult" turkey and that the "unintended results would be devastating " if nancy pelosi and tom lantos want to take down u s policy in iraq to tag george bush with the failure they should have the courage to walk through the front door to do it bringing the genocide resolution to the house floor this week would put a terrible event of armenias past in the service of americas bitter partisanship today it is mischievous at best catastrophic at worst and should be tabled
