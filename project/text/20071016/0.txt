a cultural conversation with andre previn a classical musician enjoys improvising with jazz at composer conductor and pianist andre previn is one of the few pre eminent classical musicians who are also major jazz figures or as he once told me "im the only vienna philharmonic conductor who ever worked the apollo theatre " his latest solo jazz cd "alone ballads for solo piano" emarcy has just been released and from the opening track matt dennis and earl brents sultry "angel eyes " it is captivating in its inventive beauty the disc features delectable jazz essays on standards from the proverbial american song book and among the bakers dozen are cole porters "what is this thing called love " rodgers and harts "bewitched bothered and bewildered" and hoagy carmichaels "skylark " as well as several of mr previns own songs including "darkest before the dawn" and "youre gonna hear from me " mr previns road to jazz stardom has had some remarkable twists born in berlin he was thoroughly grounded in the austro german symphonic repertoire by his attorney father an amateur pianist who imparted his musical passion to his son by playing beethoven and brahms symphonies with the boy in four hand arrangements thereafter mr previn studied formally at the berlin hochschule fur musik and the paris conservatoire until his family ultimately fled nazi encroachment for the u s in settled in hollywood and speaking only german and some french the young mr previn rapidly learned english by going to the movies after school and attending the same double feature three days in a row he once told me about discovering jazz almost by accident during the s "i heard art tatums record sweet lorraine and was bowled over by his transformation of a fairly puerile bar tune into an amazing structure so i did something utterly crazy i wrote the damned thing down from the record playing every florid bar times talk about a waste of time for someone who wants to learn an essentially improvisational art but i learned that piece and never forgot it " previn never wrote down jazz improvisations again as he developed into a top flight jazz pianist performing with such jazz icons as oscar peterson ray brown dizzy gillespie and billie holliday his album of songs from "my fair lady" with drummer shelly manne and bassist leroy vinegar was the first gold jazz recording in history one of the great delights of his new cd is that unlike some jazz performances of old standards in which the primary song theme can be overwhelmed by the riffs and variations mr previn gives great prominence to the original melodies of each song here "that hard core jazz style is wonderful too " he says "but i think that in slow ballads its different especially the ones i chose the melodies are so good to begin with that i dont like to ring changes on them until theyre unrecognizable " at the start of our conversation he notes that he was initially skeptical when chris roberts chairman of decca label group for the u s and president of universal music group international classics &amp jazz invited him to record a solo piano disc instead of doing one with a trio or small ensemble "i told them i have to be honest with you the style i would play in is kind of forgotten today and its possible that no one would buy it " mr roberts apparently believed otherwise "so i agreed to a recording date then all i did was give them a list of tunes that i quite like and they got me lead sheets as it were all placed on a table next to the piano i would pick up the top sheet and begin to play it and if i couldnt think of anything to make of it instantly id put it down and pick up the next one in the pile and proceed with that so i made this cd in one afternoon with every track done in one take " hence this recording is exclusively improvisational and though he doesnt regard these performances as "hard core jazz " in his words mr previn declares that "if youre going to make anything even resembling jazz or related to it the music should be totally improvised " though the session was done in new york mr previn recorded on a piano by the viennese boesendorfer company whose instruments are known for their luscious rich tone and to my observation that there is a lovely softness to the whole program mr previn remarks that "these are lovely soft songs moreover the great advantage to playing alone is that there are no harmonic restrictions i dont have to match what im doing to what another player is doing so i had some fun " he did indeed proceeding through a beguiling series of keys in rodgers and harts "bewitched bothered and bewildered" and indulging in wonderfully atmospheric harmonies in kurt weills "my ship " he punctuates his rendition of cole porters "night and day" with a series of extraordinary atonal flourishes that melt into porters familiar phrases and at the very end of the song he introduces a little contrapuntal tag that alludes to the opening phrase of jerome kerns "the song is you " when i mention this to him his gentle response underscores the fleeting nature of musical improvisation "well i had no idea " while discussing jazz technique with him i ask if there is a point at which improvisation ends and memorization begins more precisely would he play any of these pieces again the same way as he does on this record "no " he says "and i can prove that because i did a jazz concert at tanglewood and dave fink my bass player suggested that i do some of the things on alone and i had to look them up to see what they were because i had forgotten what i had done " of course " he continues "if you are thinking in a general way all of jazz performance contains certain elements of memory certain patterns that work in different pieces certain tricks if you like but if youre playing with another musician whose creativity challenges you or if youre playing all alone theres more improvisation than at any other time and for someone in my profession its a great luxury to spend all night improvising " naturally discussing these songs prompts mr previn to reminisce about working "with a lot of the really best songwriters during my old mgm days and some of them greatly disliked jazz improvising cole porter for instance i was about to start writing the arrangements for the film of kiss me kate into which they had interpolated his song from this moment on and cole said to me oh by the way theres a record of that song by woody hermans orchestra and it contains everything i hate about big band writing it destroys the melody it destroys the rhythm the harmonies are all weird the tempo is insane but i know all your arrangements for movies and theyre so wonderfully theatrical that i dont need to fear and i said thank you cole and i never told him that i had made that arrangement for woody herman " mr scherer writes about classical music for the journal his new book "a history of american classical music" sourcebooks has just been published
