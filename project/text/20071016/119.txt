steady diet as burgers boom in russia mcdonalds touts discipline to maximize potential chain rations growth trimming wait lines moscow at lunch time on a recent day here khamzat khasbulatov sat in the worlds second busiest mcdonalds and watched as dozens of people lined up at its cash registers "i have too many customers " said mr khasbulatov chief executive of mcdonalds russia as workers scrambled to assemble big macs and stuff french fries into red cartons of the countries where mcdonalds corp does business none can boast more activity than russia on average each location serves about diners annually more than twice the store traffic in mcdonalds other markets that has presented the worlds largest restaurant chain with an unusual dilemma russia with its burgeoning middle class and consumer appetites for all things american is a jewel in the mcdonalds system but the company is being prudent about expansion here due partly to russias famous bureaucracy and partly to the chains own philosophical shift aggressive growth plans at mcdonalds backfired badly in the past during the s the company was fixated on adding restaurants throughout the chain as many as stores a year but by the condition of its existing locations as well as the appeal of certain menu items deteriorated two years later the companys flawed expansion strategy was hammering its profits and stock price aiming then to be "better not just bigger " the oak brook ill company reined in expansion in when mcdonalds reported its first ever quarterly loss it opened a net of new stores down from in the previous year new emphasis was placed on improving signature products like the big mac and chicken mcnuggets executives also called for an aesthetic overhaul using more muted colors and lighting schemes in the stores the changes helped lift sales and profits ushering in one of the companys most successful performance streaks to date in the past twelve months mcdonalds shares have shot up now that the company has improved operations it is preparing to gingerly pick up the pace of store building especially in developing markets like china india and russia "itd be very easy today to go in and say khamzat youve got to build restaurants because were getting phenomenal returns " says mcdonalds president ralph alvarez but "were going to stay disciplined " rather than over rely on new restaurants the company is working to squeeze more sales and profits from its existing russian locations to do so mr khasbulatov years old is taking a page from western style dining habits he introduced a breakfast menu and plans to add more "mccafe" sections serving espresso drinks to draw late afternoon and evening crowds hes also keen to bump up the number of restaurants with drive throughs and have more locations stay open around the clock "you have to keep your restaurants relevant to your consumer " he says current plans call for the chain to increase the number of restaurants here by at least a year over the next decade that would make russia one of the fastest growing markets in the mcdonalds system but so far this year the company has built only new stores shy of its goal "the bureaucracy is still very high " explains mr khasbulatov opening a single mcdonalds here can require as many as signatures from local officials real estate prices have increased as much as tenfold over the past decade and in moscow and st petersburg the big cities that are mcdonalds main focus low unemployment rates make it difficult to find qualified personnel mcdonalds began eyeing russia in when the founder of the companys canadian business george cohon lent a company bus to some soviet olympics officials during the montreal games a member of the soviet entourage told mr cohon he couldnt chat with the delegates unless he went through a "protocol department " mr cohon says he retorted "my friend the protocol is i own the bus " he took the group to mcdonalds for hamburgers and french fries and was struck by how much they enjoyed the fast food fare mr cohon flew to russia more than times over the next years to persuade government officials to let mcdonalds provide food for the moscow olympics and later to open restaurants here he lugged a video machine along to show a movie about the company because people "had no idea what mcdonalds was " he says red tape and cold war ideology kept him from sealing an olympics deal or winning the necessary approvals to open a restaurant some mcdonalds directors thought he was wasting the companys time and money says mr cohon in as mikhail gorbachevs perestroika loosened the kremlins hold on the economy mr cohon finally struck a deal with the city of moscow to open a massive location in pushkin square about people applied for its crew jobs after mcdonalds placed a single newspaper ad one was mr khasbulatov born in kazakhstan he moved when he was an infant with his family to chechnya where his parents ran a small state owned grocery store at age mr khasbulatov came to moscow and studied at the russian academy of economics after spending months as a soldier in far eastern russia he returned to moscow and took a job managing a state owned restaurant he later interviewed for a position at mcdonalds in which the city owned a majority stake mcdonalds now owns all of its russian operations mr khasbulatov was chosen as one of four managers to launch the pushkin square location on the first day of business in january of a queue of more than had formed before the doors opened at the time burgers and fries were something of a novelty many russians had never tasted the american staple before for the next few years mr khasbulatov says the lines were so long that he had to turn away customers as he closed up at night although luring customers was easy just about everything else was difficult reliable suppliers of beef patties hamburger buns and other items were so hard to find that mcdonalds spent &# million to build a facility to produce them on its own something it doesnt do anywhere else regulations restricted mcdonalds ability to convert the rubles that customers used as payment into hard currency other u s restaurant companies that tried to crack russias &# billion a year food service industry also ran into problems russian restaurant magnate rostislav ordovsky says he tried to help burger king corp open here in the late s but that the fast food company was scared off by russias poor supply chain and the ruble conversion restrictions burger king says it has been approached by russian entrepreneurs but wouldnt comment on mr ordovskys account by mcdonalds three russian locations had begun to turn a profit the chain was earning credit for introducing clean reliable restaurants and friendly service to russia "in a country where there was nothing available mcdonalds was everything " mr ordovsky says mr khasbulatov was named to mcdonalds top russia position in and later took on responsibility for the companys eastern european restaurants in russia he now oversees restaurants in cities thats a tiny fraction of the companys nearly restaurants world wide and about the same number of mcdonalds in the seattle area the pushkin square location with its seats and free wireless internet access has long drawn more customers than any other mcdonalds in the world recently its been running neck and neck with a store at munichs karlsplatz square "it is big and comfortable " says aleksander grishin a year old recent university graduate after consuming a cheeseburger french fries an ice cream sundae and a coke at the pushkin mcdonalds although mcdonalds controls more than two thirds of russias quick service food market some competitors see the chains caution as an opening "they take no risks " says vladislav dudakov president of coffee house russias largest cafe chain and a former mcdonalds manager when mr dudakovs associates call to suggest a new site he says hes able to decide whether to take it very quickly because he runs a nimbler operation than mcdonalds "they take meetings " he says "they discuss it for a long time " mcdonalds russia executives stress that their careful approach has been a key to their success mr ordovsky the restaurant magnate operates a location local chain of fast food chicken outlets called rostiks and plans to open locations over the next four years last year he began co branding rostiks with yum brands inc s kfc mr ordovsky who keeps a copy of mcdonalds pioneer ray krocs autobiography in his night table says hes fine tuning rostiks snack offerings to better compete against mcdonalds mcdonalds doesnt break out financial results for its russian operations analysts say the chains profit margins here are in the mid range or several points higher than mcdonalds global average same store sales defined as sales at stores open for at least months have also outpaced other markets growing at a double digit clip for the past several years to maintain profit margins mr khasbulatov increases menu prices four times a year on the cheapest items like a cent ice cream cone he raises prices at about half the rate of inflation prices of so called premium products like the big tasty burger the european version of the big n tasty sandwich he boosts just above inflation "we still have a huge amount of people who are price sensitive " he says breakfast foods which landed on the menu two years ago are a big part of mr khasbulatovs strategy russians are accustomed to eating morning meals of ham bread and eggs in their own kitchens mcdonalds estimates that only eat outside the home but in big cities like moscow the company discovered that commuters were leaving earlier for work to avoid heavy traffic a habit mcdonalds hopes will prompt them to stop for breakfast on their way during morning hours mcdonalds used to offer its typical lunch time fare when the early lineup changed featuring egg mcmuffins pancakes hash browns orange juice and other items some customers experienced hamburger withdrawal as a concession mcdonalds introduced the fresh mcmuffin an english muffin with a sausage patty topped with cheese lettuce tomato and special sauce it continues to be a hit mr khasbulatov wants more than half of mcdonalds new restaurants to have either drive throughs or walk up windows moves designed to thin counter lines and appeal to a growing number of motorists when mcdonalds opened its first russian drive throughs in some people got their food from the window parked their cars and brought the meals inside to eat customers bought fewer drinks because their cars often didnt have cup holders now russians are more comfortable with drive throughs executives say speed is another important factor mr khasbulatov is focusing on ways to move lines and customer traffic more quickly in some locations employees take orders on handheld devices before customers reach the counter special cooking equipment also hastens the diners experience a new toaster for instance browns sandwich buns in seconds less than half what it used to take says karina pogosova junior vice president of operations for mcdonalds russia as for the persistent crowds many customers remain indifferent "our countrys a country of lines " says andrey shatskiy a year old soap opera cinematographer while eating lunch at the pushkin square restaurant "we all got used to it " mr khasbulatov doesnt want the lines to entirely disappear "when i said i have too many customers its a nice problem to have " he says "i would love to continue to have this problem "
