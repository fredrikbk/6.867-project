an independent minded ceo faces oracle bid for software maker bea highlights growing pressure on alfred chuang to sell four years ago after oracle corp launched a hostile takeover bid for peoplesoft inc alfred chuang the ceo of software maker bea systems inc gathered his top executives for a strategy meeting at cordevalle a resort south of beas headquarters in san jose calif a procession of bankers and lawyers gave presentations about consolidation in the software industry and beas prospects as an independent player people with knowledge of the event say mr chuang was subdued during that part of the meeting these people say but once the outsiders left he became animated exhorting his team to do whatever it took to maintain control of bea now the consolidation wave in silicon valley may have finally caught up with the staunchly independent mr chuang and the company he co founded years ago oracle last week offered to buy bea for &# a share a price premium of about to beas closing price the previous day that represents an offer of about &# billion and comes amid pressure to sell from bea shareholders that include carl icahn the deal if it goes through would substantially fill out oracles shopping list for software to complement its existing products while suggesting that a certain style of silicon valley ceo may be headed for extinction a raft of software companies were started in the s and s led by colorful executives like siebel systems inc s tom siebel and peoplesofts dave duffield who made fortunes and became virtually synonymous with their companies one by one however most of those companies have been picked off by oracle or other acquirers at bea whose initials stand for the first names of founders bill coleman ed scott and alfred chuang the latter is the last man standing and mr chuang has been unusually stubborn in his refusal to sell what is one of the last independent medium size software companies left in silicon valley "often when youre king youre reluctant to give up control of the kingdom so you need a bit of an incentive to come to that conclusion " says mr icahn who is beas biggest shareholder owning of the stock and since september has been calling for mr chuang to sell the company mr chuang declined to comment for this article in an interview in august he brushed aside the suggestion that oracle could buy his company "i think the world of oracle and they are a really serious competitor " he said but if bea were acquired "i dont see how we would be able to innovate" the way the company does now he said in the past few years even as his company has struggled with a stock options probe and languishing sales mr chuang retained a flamboyant style he collects ferraris sometimes wears a leather jacket to public appearances and once rode onstage on a motorcycle to give a speech "hes a person with a lot of pride who associates himself with his company and whatever happens to the company he takes very personally " says byron sebastian a former bea vice president who now runs the start up sourcelabs inc bea was founded in with funding from the private equity firm warburg pincus llc it went public in riding a wave of corporate investment in products from young software start ups the company sells middleware a term for technology that lets disparate software programs share information with each other its first big product tuxedo helped to process software based transactions but mr chuang then chief technology officer felt bea needed to exploit the rise of the internet so he spearheaded the companys purchase of weblogic inc whose products help to build web based programs mr chuang became ceo in october succeeding mr coleman after the high tech downturn had begun companies tightened their technology budgets pressuring tech giants like international business machines corp and oracle to find new growth avenues one tactic was to enter new technology areas including middleware by ibm and oracle had chipped away at beas early lead "when youre out with a technology thats maturing and you have a lot of talented competitors with deep pockets its extremely hard to stay ahead " says scott dietzen a former bea chief technology officer now at yahoo inc after the cordevalle retreat mr chuang asked his lieutenants to devise a plan to keep bea independent several senior executives urged mr chuang to hire more engineers for weblogic and change beas pricing structure to better compete with lower cost rivals people familiar with the matter say mr chuang favored reining in spending in favor of profitability these people say some executives were so upset that they individually contacted bea board members to plead their case but the board supported mr chuang these people say mr chuang wasnt aware of these conversations according to someone familiar with his thinking some of mr chuangs top lieutenants subsequently left the company oracle spokesman bob wynne and bea spokesman kevin hayden declined to comment for this article bea maintained its position as no in middleware after ibm but the company has struggled to keep up growth in new software sales amid tougher competition meanwhile oracle ceo larry ellison began coveting bea over the past three years oracle executives approached mr chuang several times to informally gauge his interest in an acquisition though no bid was ever made say people familiar with the matter each time mr chuang said he wasnt interested they say in the august interview mr chuang said bea could grow independently but he was surprised by oracles move to publicize its bid for bea according to people familiar with the matter and events may have spun out of his control on tuesday oracle co president charles phillips sent a letter to bea naming a price and proposing to start acquisition discussions on thursday bea wrote back saying oracles offer was too low and asking for more clarity about how any acquisition process would proceed according to people familiar with the matter mr ellison then called mr chuang to reiterate oracles interest in bea and they had a cordial minute conversation afterward oracles mr phillips called beas vice president of business planning and development bill klein to clarify the process oracle had in mind according to mr phillips mr klein agreed to meet to start acquisition discussions mr klein says he never agreed to such a meeting later that night mr phillips contacted mr klein to suggest they meet the following morning at the office of oracles law firm he also asked bea to share some data about its business these people say bea believed oracle was asking for too much proprietary information and told oracle it wouldnt join the suggested meeting these people say oracle responded friday by announcing its &# a share bid sending beas stock up bea while insisting oracles offer is too low hasnt formally rejected it analysts says bea now will have a tough time resisting a sale to oracle or some other company as of yesterday no other bidders had emerged beas stock traded at p m at &# suggesting that investors are betting on a deal above oracles offer ben worthen contributed to this
