waste collection firms feel derailed by new rivals frank celli chief executive of interstate waste services inc smells something rotten metaphorically in new jersey and its not related to the odor being controlled at his waste handling facility in garfield hes distressed about a small railroad a mile away that along with others is taking some of his business because it doesnt have to follow the same rules he does mr cellis facility in garfield n j compiles and transfers garbage bags of household waste tree limbs and other debris to long haul trucks headed to pennsylvania landfills his company a subsidiary of highstar waste holding corp a closely held company based in sloatsburg n y must comply with requirements set by state and local authorities those rules cover such matters as odor control water runoff and background checks for connections to organized crime mr celli says complying with those and other rules costs him money that his rival doesnt have to spend "im already bald so i cant pull my hair out " says mr celli who complains that his garfield facility has lost about of its construction and demolition debris business to railroad rivals mr cellis frustration stems from a dust up in the waste industry thats pitting established companies against a new breed of competitor in recent years small railroads known as short lines have begun setting up facilities for collecting sorting and packing mainly construction debris into gaping ton rail cars under longstanding federal law railroads big and small are exempt from zoning ordinances and other state and local regulations that could hinder interstate commerce but as landfills have consolidated over the last years densely populated northeastern states increasingly are exporting their waste to the midwest and southeast railroads have become a conduit for moving the stuff long distances the number of rail cars hauling waste has grown almost since according to the association of american railroads "if we were controlled by a state or a town we wouldnt move a train anywhere " says jim wilson president of the new york &amp greenwood lake railway inc which has a waste handling site in passaic n j that irks mr celli "its just sour grapes " mr wilson says of his rivals complaints so far the chief battlegrounds between the short line sites and traditional waste handling companies have been in the heavily regulated northeast in such states as pennsylvania new jersey and new york it is unclear how many rail operated waste handling sites exist nationally the new jersey department of environmental protection estimates a dozen rail operated transfer sites are active within its boundaries according to the u s department of transportations bureau of transportation statistics trucks moved million tons or of the waste and scrap shipped in the latest year for which bts figures are available rail moved million tons or of waste and scrap shipments in rail operated wastes sites have sparked lawsuits and legislation earlier this year a bill was introduced in congress to force the railroads to follow state and local rules governing waste the bush administration has said it opposes such a measure because it believes railroads should operate across state lines relatively free of state and local regulation the newcomers began to crop up after congress in extended railroads exemption from some state and local rules to tiny sections of track serving industrial customers the big railroads havent been directly involved in the controversy because they simply accept the waste shipments from the smaller railroads the smaller railroads so far have been the ones establishing the waste handling facilities odors and gases from some construction debris in some cases can make people sick according to health and environmental officials small railroads say they are taking voluntary precautions to protect the public workers at the new york &amp greenwood lake railway site spray down the waste with a hose to keep down dust small railroads say they are protecting the environment by relieving truck traffic on the roadways as more waste shipments go by rail the controversy in new jersey was stirred partly by the new york susquehanna &amp western railway corp a regional carrier based in cooperstown n y a few years ago along a few miles of its tracks in north bergen n j the susquehanna opened property to local haulers of construction and demolition debris the railroad stored the debris in large open piles before loading it into rail cars for shipment to ohio state officials complained that exposed piles of refuse can be infested with vermin and material can be carried off by wind and rain new jersey regulators fined the company &# million citing violations of state environmental rules and the railroad countered with a suit in federal court arguing that the state had no right to interfere with its operations the district court ruled early this year against the state but the appellate court sent the case back with instructions to the judge to weigh each of the states rules and penalties individually nathan fenno the susquehannas president acknowledges that the open air piles "caused a lot of grief " officials complained about the companys failure to control odor and other issues mr fenno says the company has since spent several million dollars to construct buildings to shelter the piles and install fire sprinklers in some of the facilities "we believe we have come to substantially comply with the states regulations " mr fenno says
