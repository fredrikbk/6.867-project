after crash nyse got the message s exchange raised buy sell capacity thains goal per second when the stock market crashed in years ago this week the new york stock exchanges trading systems were paralyzed overwhelmed by a deluge of sell orders since then the nyse and other markets have spent billions of dollars on technology to stay a step or two ahead of a galloping increase in trading activity partly as a result on the several occasions since where markets have been stampeded the outcomes have been less dramatic one of the biggest recent tests was in february when the dow jones industrial average tumbled more than points after a drop in the chinese domestic market and a computer glitch in calculating the industrial average as the number of buy or sell orders soared systems backed up and some investors were unable to complete trades until the next day the market soon recovered but john thain chief executive of big board owner nyse euronext got the message mr thain immediately directed the exchange to double its capacity to handle buy and sell messages flowing through nyse computers which work alongside floor traders "we hit levels we never imagined wed hit " says louis pastina nyses head of floor operations the nyse was armed in february to handle about messages per second from investors seeking to buy or sell shares back in mr thain says the nyses nascent electronic systems could handle only messages per second a figure the onetime engineering student calls "scarily bad " most traders on the exchanges hardwood floor in used pencils and pads on oct "black monday" they couldnt keep up with orders flooding in via phone and computer on feb messages flowed in at a rate of per second the exchange quickly thereafter doubled its capacity to messages a second as markets fell in august when credit markets seized up the nyse was getting as many as messages per second this time systems held up without a major hitch but the volume of messages prompted mr thain to call for an increase in capacity to by years end a backlog in messages slows the execution of orders to buy and sell shares which can spook the market on volatile days message traffic has shot up proportionally faster than other measures of activity share volume for instance because many investors now buy and sell fewer shares per trade than in the past while frequently canceling replacing and amending orders as more investors move to electronic trading nyses mr pastina says message traffic is the most important predictor of the exchanges ability to handle surges in trading activity mr thain said friday that the exchange might consider charging investors based on the number of messages they send to help pay for expensive capacity expansion exchanges cant stop a market decline nor does anyone seriously suggest they should in a free market economy but they want to keep trades running smoothly so that panics dont develop out of fear that investors wont be able to buy or sell promptly "theres no question the order systems failed and that added to the panic" on oct says william freund a former nyse chief economist and now professor emeritus at pace university the dows decline that day led to a series of changes that experts say make a similar meltdown less likely among the biggest added capacity at exchanges better coordination between stock and derivatives markets development of viable alternatives when a big exchange has trouble executing orders and rules that pause trading when the dow industrials fall or more the average number of nyse listed shares traded daily in was million this year it is more than billion on aug when markets were in turmoil because of the subprime mortgage mess more than billion shares were traded "were in much better shape to handle a significant decline " nyses mr thain said in an interview last week the nasdaq stock markets executive vice president for transaction services chris concannon agrees that markets are better equipped saying that investors now use more sophisticated trading strategies and have better access to immediate information the nasdaq also now trades far more shares than in including some shares of nyse listed stocks with the increase in electronic and other off exchange trading the nyses market share in the trading of its own stocks has declined some say risks for big market moves have grown larger in recent years as a result "when you have a world where nyse is less central youre more vulnerable to a market move creating much more volatility " says michael pagano a finance professor at villanova university nyse officials say the exchanges market share actually rises in stressful times there are now fewer traders on the nyse floor which could increase volatility since some of those traders were responsible for stabilizing choppy markets mr thain says these specialists couldnt stop a major decline like the one in he is more worried about big investors who now base their trades on computer models which can exacerbate market moves by buying or selling blocks of shares at the same time one important piece of the market structure now relatively new links to make sure trades are routed to other markets when one exchange has problems completing trades rules compelling such rerouting went into effect this year but the fear is that linkages wont work as smoothly in fast moving markets some traders worry about a july rule change that can make it easier for investors to bet on stock price declines other changes play a role after the crash the nyse instituted "circuit breakers" that would pause trading for minutes or more in case of sharp declines in the djia such pauses can help traders find bargain hunting investors after selloffs says hans stoll a finance professor at vanderbilt university the exchange resets the triggers quarterly setting point change triggers based on and of the dows average level in the previous month which means this quarter a point decline of points would be needed to trigger the first halt the circuit breakers were used in when triggers were set by straight point declines not percentage moves in its first use back then the trigger went off for just a point decline the rule was re evaluated leading to todays more forgiving triggers
