house of paulson the good news about mondays announcement that a consortium of big banks is going to try to restore liquidity to the asset backed commercial paper market with a &# billion fund is that the effort seems to involve only private capital the less good news is that hank paulson and the treasury seem to have gone out of their way to leave their fingerprints on the announced "conduit " going as far as to talk up their behind the scenes role at the time of this writing the conduit to be raises more questions than it answers banks such as citibank which is heavily involved have substantial off balance sheet exposure to the asset backed commercial paper market and the sec and regulators are breathing down their necks to write down the assets in their structured investment vehicles it may be true that in some cases good assets are being marked down because investors cant distinguish the good debt from the bad but get this the announced vehicle dubbed the master liquidity enhancement conduit will only buy highly rated paper to ensure investor confidence the trouble with this theory is that investor confidence has been shaken because people no longer feel they can trust the ratings this in turn has resulted from the fact that much of the now dubious debt was rated not on the value of the collateral but on the strength of the bank such as citibank that issued it this is a structural problem with the asset backed commercial paper market and while mr paulson has called for greater transparency in part to address the issue mlec is not going to fix it by itself its even possible mlec will try to operate in the old discredited paradigm of assembling and rating these securities so were left to wonder whether citibank isnt trying in effect to pull off the same trick twice the conduit would issue debt and use the proceeds to buy otherwise illiquid commercial paper but why would anyone buy the conduits debt because j p morgan citibank and bank of america stand behind it and for good measure hank paulson says the consortium is doing the right thing thats not exactly the same as telling people the new paper is safe but its not exactly a federal disclaimer either its possible this is too cynical a view perhaps the mlec will allow an orderly write down over the course of the next year or more softening the blow and bringing investors back into the market as a concept it has a certain appeal and with investment banks bottom feeding in certain sectors already there may even be some profit in buying up distressed debt right now the open question however is whether this superconduit will establish realistic prices for the illiquid securities or will serve to mask the real value of misrated assets in order to spread out the pain and buy time for the banks most exposed christopher whalen of institutional risk analytics describes asset backed commercial paper as a market that has been "shot in the head" by the recent market turmoil and accompanying write downs if hes correct there are two possibilities either the superconduit wont find buyers or it will do so only because treasury seems to have endorsed the concept of the two the former seems preferable to the extent there are bad loans the public interest is served by having the market clear if mlec has the effect not of clearing the market but of preventing it from clearing by throwing good money after bad then we risk a banking paralysis of the kind japan suffered during the s because its banks refused to write down bad assets the current credit problems are causing enough trouble without letting them hang over the fixed income market for many more months or years theres also the risk that the assets on which the paper is based such as real estate will fall further in value and jeopardize the banks backing mlec thats when banks and investors alike start begging the feds for a bailout in the panic of j p morgan the man eventually restored order to troubled markets by stepping in with his own capital and those of other banks to buy up undervalued assets and shore up institutions that still had value todays crisis resembles that era in the way that murky asset backed securities have come acropper without much capital cushion if the banks are stepping up to provide that capital and more transparency thats a plus but the lesson still relevant today is that morgan relieved the panic by stepping in as a buyer on his own nickel reassuring the market that there were things worth buying he also forced write downs when there was nothing left to save if mr paulson wants to be a modern j p morgan hed better make sure the banks arent using him to delay their day of reckoning see related letter "letters to the editor the good and the bad" wsj oct
