a meeting to amend a more perfect constitution by larry j sabato walker pages &# americans seem to like the constitution pretty much the way it was written in philadelphia in in roughly two centuries of u s political history more than amendments have been proposed and only ratified one of the lowest rates of amendment of any democracy in the world todays events dont seem to inspire any great enthusiasm for constitutional change either say to make naturalized citizens like gov arnold schwarzenegger of california eligible for the presidency or to modify the electoral college to ensure that the winner of the popular vote becomes president so its a difficult task that larry sabato has undertaken in "a more perfect constitution " where he urges us to convene a constitutional convention and pass a flurry of amendments not that he has any great expectation of immediate success he hopes he says to stir a national discussion about americas political deficiencies that might lead a generation from now to curing them through constitutional change he acknowledges that americans for all their dissatisfaction with washington "are instinctively cautious" about fiddling with the constitution and little wonder why mess with success such cautiousness in recent decades has helped to doom amendments on school prayer a balanced budget and equal rights for women but part of the resistance to amending the constitution is simply procedural in mr sabatos view he calls congress "a graveyard for constitutional amendments " the ratification process is indeed cumbersome requiring the approval of two thirds of the house and senate and three fourths of the states mr sabato believes that a constitutional convention the first since would make things easier and it probably would for one thing only two thirds of the states would have to approve of an amendment for it to happen some of mr sabatos suggested amendments are quite sensible and according to a poll he commissioned quite popular two reflect a concern about an out of touch judiciary they would set a mandatory retirement age of for federal judges and limit their terms including the terms of supreme court justices to years "my suggested changes may encourage the humility of narrow interpretations of law judicial incrementalism by keeping judges anchored to reality " mr sabato writes serving as a judge "would become a phase in a career rather than an entire career " two other amendments are hardy perennials term limits for members of congress and a single six year term for the president "if democracy means anything " mr sabato notes "we need to take into account the publics strong disposition for term limits " he thinks that a six year presidential term would help to de politicize the white house by keeping executive decisions away from the inevitable pandering of election and re election cycles after the fifth year of any presidency mr sabato adds in a twist a national referendum would decide if the president should serve one more year or three a yes or no vote on a sitting president may be a startling suggestion but a half dozen other amendments on mr sabatos list are more tame a presidential line item veto and a balanced budget amendment are both familiar and moderately plausible ideas it might also make sense as mr sabato argues to mandate nonpartisan congressional redistricting extend house terms to three years and permit nonnatives to become president after two decades of citizenship but other amendments in "a more perfect constitution" are more extreme to trim the population of each congressional district and bring members closer to voters mr sabato would boost the number of house members to roughly from he would also add two senate seats to each of the most populous states and one to each of the next most populous states to make the senate more representative states with of the population can now form a senate majority he would also give former presidents and vice presidents a vote in the senate whew such amendments would alter the structure of american government dramatically so would mr sabatos idea of enlarging the supreme court to justices from nine a change that would permit he says "increased diversity in race gender ethnicity religion age background and ideological leanings " a member court would produce more tie votes he concedes but a single justice like anthony kennedy today would no longer have the power of a decisive "swing" vote it is certainly worth pondering all such proposals although it is easy to imagine each of them setting into motion unintended consequences if the supreme court causes controversy today just imagine what a series of tie votes would do the obvious question is whether americas political system requires such radical surgery mr sabato doesnt quite answer the question he merely insists that the "decrepit machinery of american government" lacking he thinks both fairness and accountability needs reform but how much mr sabato would reply thats for a constitutional convention to decide fair enough he actually makes a more persuasive case for calling a convention than for passing any specific amendment the chances of a runaway convention as he notes are slim given that delegates must be elected and amendments would still require ratification and the whole process of meeting to discuss the problems of american government might be so bracing in itself that elected officials would enact desirable reforms in the usual legislative way without tinkering with the constitution mr barnes is executive
