historical significance of colorados streak granted none of those wins came against teams from the american league that nl juggernaut the chicago cubs won straight in september to reach the world series and had a book written about that accomplishment but then lost in six games to the detroit tigers either the cleveland indians or boston red sox await the rockies more on those teams later in the fix and will have home field advantage but that can wait until next week last night or this morning if you were watching on the east coast belongs to those rockies fans trying to make sense of a month that upended all expectations and even overshadowed a disappointing start to the denver broncos season two bloggers who were at the clincher came home and wrote passionately about their transformed beloved rockies "towels were waved brooms were thrust skyward fireworks filled the sky " dan lucero writes on up in the rockies "i hugged my brother first then started high fiving and hugging total strangers " mr lucero references a famed quotation from sportswriter red smith about the new york giants then writes "maybe inexpressibly fantastic is an entire time zone rejoicing as one whipping white towels above their heads and making enough noise to conjure rolling thunder across the eastern plains up in the foothills and through the continental divide " mark t r donohue acknowledges on bad altitude that this rockies love is a newfound phenomenon "rockies fans might not get all the details yet the rather crude group of enthusiastic but recent converts behind me couldnt stop talking about how matt herges had done it for us all year when herges only threw innings for colorado before august st but they do understand that the team is in the middle of something utterly unique and ineffable something delicate were the rockies to fail to take care of business on this night the magic could be over like that and that would be a shame because on the whole i think it would be quite pleasant to win the world series " quite pleasant and the sort of experience that can shape a lifetime baseball fan as the world series did for your younger fixer denver post columnist mark kiszla reminds readers that celebrations like last nights belong to children whether theyre staying up past bedtime to watch the game or are inner youngsters residing inside the

diamondbacks fans that they too may be enjoying similar scenes soon before looking ahead to brighter times mr bickley pays tribute to an unlikely run to the nlcs "to the great shock of the baseball universe the diamondbacks survived on resiliency the ignorance of youth and a great fighting spirit they filled our summer months with unexpected pleasure " offense has unexpectedly ruled in the indians red sox matchup last nights early departure of bostons daisuke matsuzaka marked the fourth bad start by a nominal star in the three games played so far two of them won by cleveland "suddenly this alcs a k a the presumptive world series has taken on an entirely different character " thomas boswell writes in the washington post after clevelands win last night "except for bostons game winner josh beckett who was the dominant winner of game the hurlers who were expected to control this series have imploded now it is not the mighty of the pitchers mound but rather the meek who may decide the winner of this pennant who for instance take the indians jake westbrook whose sturdy innings of two run ball earned this win " boston globe columnist jackie macmullan questions the &# million investment in mr matsuzaka "it was another disappointing performance for the highly touted pitcher who earned elite status in his native country for his ability to pitch masterfully in the biggest settings " ms macmullan writes "he was the mvp of the world baseball classic an olympic hero a high school legend that clutch reputation has been lost in translation over here in the states where

why the occasional pilgrim goes to the ruins of league park eating a hot dog imagining how it must have been but now the indians are halfway to the world series " the new york giants won their fourth
