cartoon characters get big makeover for overseas fans powerpuff girls leggy look wows viewers in japan a brown snoopy is axed tokyo big round heads and tiny bodies make the powerpuff girls instantly identifiable to their fans in america the preteen karate superheroes star in one of the top rated shows on cables cartoon network last year though the "powerpuff girls" showed up in japan with a whole new look on "demashita powerpuff girls z " the heroines have grown up sprouted long legs and wear skirts well above their knees in the original american storyline the girls were created of sugar spice and everything nice their japanese counterparts are normal girls who acquire superpowers from a chemical reaction initiated by a rice cake once american entertainment companies exporting characters just dubbed them into other languages but in recent years asia has become the testing ground for character reinvention a process called "transcreation " the idea is to help characters designed with one audience in mind to really resonate in another culture marvel entertainment inc and gotham entertainment introduced a transcreated "spider man" to the indian market in although the original had been familiar there for a long time there spideys alter ego peter parker is known as pavitr prabhakar spidey gains his powers from a mysterious yogi rather than a radioactive spider when fighting crime he sports a traditional loincloth spidey also inspired one of the regions first transcreations in the japanese media company toei turned peter parker into a racing champion named yamashiro takuya who wears a bracelet that gives him the powers of a spider his alter ego "supaidah man" controls a giant transforming robot to battle an enemy named professor monster disney has had a hit in china with its "cuties" line of mickey mouse and friends featuring tiny eyes button noses and the almost not there mouths of japans hello kitty sometimes the cutie minnie even carries a cellphone disney came up with the design six years ago in japan and now its a top seller among preteens in china who didnt grow up with the original mickey adults like sarah chen a year old graduate student in shanghai like them too "they are so cute and sweet just like a little baby " says ms chen who first discovered the disney cuties online and eventually purchased a sweater with the modified mickey mouse on it most media companies acknowledge the need to localize their fare while theres still a global audience for "tom and jerry" reruns and hollywood blockbusters american imports dont top the tv ratings in most non english speaking markets transcreation nods to that need for local relevance "there are very few things that work everywhere " says orion ross a vice president of creative at time warners turner networks in asia "places with strong national identities like japan and india need adaptation and change " he says for some time tested characters change doesnt come easily disney tweaked mickey into "cutie" form but still insists that only western women can play cinderella and snow white at tokyo and hong kong disneylands a disney spokeswoman says "these performers bring the animated roles to life and are therefore cast to most closely resemble the onscreen characters its about remaining true to the original animated feature " the family of charles m schulz the creator of "peanuts" who died in forbids any changes to his comic strip "there is no adapting peanuts " says a spokeswoman for united media the new york company that distributes the feature to newspapers around the world sometimes though changes slip in under the radar the times of india printed the peanuts strip with the dog snoopy painted brown after the wall street journal asked about that a united media spokeswoman said it was a "coloring error" that would be corrected now snoopy is white in the indian newspaper as he is in the u s ratan barua senior cartoon colorist for the times in new delhi says coloring snoopy brown was his idea "i thought he should be brown " he says while he has complied with the distributors request to adhere to white he says the result is "not very good " characters occasionally thrive despite their foreignness when nickelodeon looked into bringing spongebob squarepants to japan market research said the show was bound to flop japanese viewers were believed to favor characters whose appearance exudes warmth and comfort a concept known in japanese as iyashi iyashi characters typically round with no mouth and small eyes rose to prominence in japan during the long running economic slump that began in the early s when people were anxious and uncertain about the future spongebob with his square body huge mouth buckteeth big bug eyes and somewhat annoying personality was the antithesis of iyashi but viewers didnt mind nearly two million households soon tuned into the show every day one thing that may have helped is that spongebob lives in an undersea world without humans and overt cultural references "there is very little about spongebob that is american " says cyma zarghami president of the nickelodeon mtv networks kids and family group when craig mccracken created the powerpuff girls show he deliberately gave it what he thought was a "japanese look " but when the show first aired in japan in it failed to attract a wide audience so cartoon network decided to reinvent the characters to boost its appeal in japan an idea mr mccracken welcomed in their transcreation blossom buttercup and bubbles got japanese names and the lives of typical japanese junior high school students since japanese kids like to dress up like their favorite characters the girls got more realistic outfits with miniskirts matching vests and hip hugging belts toei co the japanese animation house brought in to help rework the characters kept the original powerpuff premise of crime fighting girls with superhuman powers to appeal to a preference among japanese children for longer more dramatic plots it made the seven to minute shows to minutes long it also gave them a common japanese theme accepting people who are different "monsters can be anyone who is different from us if we change our attitude they can become our friends " says hiromi seki a producer at toei who helped create the show thats a particularly relevant message in japan where the pressures among children to conform are very intense in one episode an evil character threatens to bring about an eruption of mount fuji that would make tokyo unbearably hot and spark global climate change in another episode a heartbroken performer of traditional kabuki theater turns into a monster and wreaks havoc on his community "in japan girly love themes are a must " ms seki says when "demashita powerpuff girls z" was launched in japan a year ago the executives at cartoon network soon realized that the revamped plots and skimpier outfits not only attracted young girls they also broadened the audience to include animation obsessed adult men known in japan as otaku or geeks who were also fans of the original so the network came out with special consumer goods like bookmarks limited edition dvds and pop music targeted at viewers like hironobu kamata a year old manager of a copyright office in tokyo mr kamata wakes up every saturday morning to watch the powerpuff girls his favorite character is miyako goutokuji the blond girl known as bubbles in the u s "i love it all the characters are so cute " says mr kamata
