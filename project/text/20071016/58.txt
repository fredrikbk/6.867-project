fear and hope rise with chinas stocks market frenzy nurtures new investors and firms its like a bubble wuhan china china is in the throes of a stock market frenzy that looks increasingly unsustainable chinese stocks have nearly sextupled in value in just two years and set yet another record yesterday when the benchmark shanghai composite index catapulted above for the first time big unknowns loom over the market starting with whether china is in a bubble thats in danger of popping but there is strong evidence that even if the boom ends with a crash chinas investing frenzy will also leave behind much lasting good because it is helping build a modern market driven financial system from glitzy shanghai to gritty industrial centers like wuhan tens of millions of chinese have poured substantial savings into stocks as a result china suddenly has a stock market that is as powerful as its economy now the worlds third largest that is an astonishing turnaround for a system considered beyond repair three years ago the &# trillion value of stock listed on chinas shanghai and shenzhen exchanges at least equals the size of the countrys annual economic output a ratio historically seen in the u s this year chinas markets have had the worlds highest volume of shares traded and are on track to raise the most money of any exchanges through stock offerings the flood of investment is producing some potentially far reaching benefits for the first time since chinas economic overhauls began almost years ago money from the investing public instead of the communist party is fueling expansion of the corporate sector the boom is helping to create a class of chinese companies among the most valuable in the world and it is spawning a financial services industry that is even helping foreign firms such as prudential financial inc of newark n j yet china now faces a classic challenge how to reap the benefits of a boom while avoiding a crash that could stall its economic progress there is an increasing sense that the stock market is heading for trouble the shanghai composite index closed up monday at a year ago it was below and has more than doubled this year "its like a bubble but no one knows when it will pop " says stephen guo a year old shanghai computer programmer who last year started making more money trading stocks than in his day job now just two years after he entered the market mr guo is also managing the investments of his friends a risky strategy that promises to spread the pain if the market tanks the rush of investors into stocks is sowing fears about the kind of epic crash that followed historic bubbles in places such as the u s japan and taiwan a big question is whether a steep drop in stocks would wipe out the burgeoning investor class and what impact that would have on chinas economic transformation stock markets in china are dominated by as many as million individual investors who are responsible for about of the trading that is the reverse of western nations where big firms set the tone and once sentiment cools as it inevitably will some question whether chinas fundamental market improvements will endure "crises go with financial development " says richard sylla an economic historian at new york universitys stern school of business "the real question is whether they do lasting damage " faced with signs of bubbles throughout the economy in recent years chinas leaders including president hu jintao have repeatedly urged moderation such calls have done little to slow spending on factories real estate or now stocks many chinese investors say they are betting the government will do little to undercut shares at this weeks congress of top communist party officials and that policy makers want the market to remain strong through the beijing olympic games next august trading on the internet nearly every day before work mr guo studies corporate reports and watches technical trends before buying his main plays have been blue chip stocks when the shanghai composite index dropped in february mr guo pumped &# into the market only to see the index double since then the more mr guo has profited he admits the more comfortable he has become with taking bigger risks his decision this year to take on co investors could get him into trouble if share prices reverse some of them used money borrowed from their credit cards to purchase stocks "the friends trust me " he says as an investing culture takes hold in china many are adopting more sophisticated trading strategies but few have the experience to know when they have gone too far on a recent night in hangzhou about chinese paid &# apiece to see american investing guru jim rogers dispense advice in a market where few local analysts have a national following translated copies of his investment books have made mr rogers a legend among chinas new investors along with his former investment partner george soros and berkshire hathaway inc s warren buffett mr rogers counseled caution calling the market a "potential bubble" that could spoil the party if left unchecked "you have to be careful " he said one investor paid &# the next night to talk stocks in a private dinner with mr rogers history has repeatedly shown that bubbles can be dangerous yet often overlooked in the mess when bubbles pop are the real changes that initially drove the boom or resulted from it fundamental improvements that can outlive the crisis after the stock market crash helped plunge the u s into the great depression economist john maynard keynes chided those who said the downturn was a just outcome for excesses in prior years "while some part of the investment which was going on in the world at large was doubtless ill judged and unfruitful there can i think be no doubt that the world was enormously enriched " he wrote china today looks like the u s of the s to marc faber a well known money manager based in thailand he notes that just as chinese investors are confident about their economy the u s economy was surging on hopes about technological changes like the radio and about the rise of a consumer class "the stock market went ballistic because the prospects of the country were so favorable " says mr faber the great depression was americas worst ever economic setback and the dow jones industrial average didnt fully recover until the mid s yet the crash also prompted the creation of basic investor safeguards that strengthened the market and probably limited fallout from later tumbles in the s japan and taiwan had two of the hottest economies and markets anywhere in japans market even overtook americas for a time to become the worlds biggest according to thomson financial a potent brew of conditions combined to supercharge the stock market in japan and taiwan rising land values strong corporate profits and currencies low interest rates high savings rates and limited investment alternatives factors all seen in china today in the markets cracked taiwans market dropped in half a year japan entered a prolonged slump with the nikkei stock average bottoming out years later at just a fifth of its peak value japan would have been better off without the economic pain that accompanied the crash but the boom years that preceded the crash transformed japans economy into one of the worlds largest and most sophisticated and better policy making might have prevented the pain from being so prolonged more recently the u s s nasdaq composite index remains under water after the popping of the technology bubble in yet many believe the tech bubble of the s fueled innovation and the adoption of the internet and that its painful unwinding separated the strong from the weak history seems to offer no clear indication of when pricing has gotten out of hand chinese shares are expensive by almost any measure including a price to earnings ratio of times last years earnings on the shanghai market compared with for the standard &amp poors stock benchmark index today the comparable ratio on the s&amp p was when u s markets crashed in and just at the time of the plunge according to ativo research llc still the chicago based advisory firm says price to earnings ratios peaked at in japan in taiwan and on the nasdaq before those markets crashed suggesting china is getting closer to the precrash peaks seen elsewhere the market could go higher still as millions of new investors continue to sign up merrill lynch &amp co estimates only about of chinese financial assets are in securities far less than the u s s level chinas prodigious savers traditionally kept their money in the bank in august xu shaosong a pharmaceuticals salesman in wuhan plunked about a third of his bank savings or &# into the stock market the year old had never invested before but says that over the past year he got restless watching friends make money dressed in a peach shirt and khakis mr xu says he is concerned about the lofty level of stocks but he and his wife want to have a baby soon and he hopes to improve on the negligible return they earn on bank savings it is a basic financial decision millions have made risk some money in a market that has risen nearly every month since mid and rather than try to figure the market out on his own mr xu took a cautious route into equities a mutual fund one jointly managed by prudential "my knowledge and skills arent good enough to trade stock by myself " he says still the contributions of mr xu and others like him helped prudentials owned everbright pramerica fund management co raise times its target of &# billion in a single day recent history shows how chinas huge population of savers can quickly bring about deep economic change under communism few chinese owned their homes when they were first offered the chance a decade ago the property market was unsophisticated and legal protections were weak yet today china has an urban homeownership rate and massive construction real estate and decorating industries american homeownership by comparison has never topped according to the u s census bureau a similarly rapid shift is taking place in the stock markets which the government opened in as an "experiment " the shanghai and shenzhen exchanges were choked with restrictions and poorly regulated and trading came to be called "stir frying stocks " by the time a slump ensued in most chinese had soured on stock investing in beijing rebuilt its markets it halted new listings for a year beefed up trading systems and offered financial support to brokerage firms as they restructured the government also junked old communist tenets including a structure where two thirds of the stock market value was locked into a class of nontradable shares originally meant to guarantee government control the markets were essentially relaunched in and began offering investors a class of blue chip stocks for the first time the government encouraged a parade of big chinese companies to sell stock at home instead of simply going to international markets starting with famous names like bank of china ltd and air china ltd seven of chinas largest listed companies have gone public within about the past year thomson financial forecasts the shanghai stock exchange and its counterpart in shenzhen could lead the world in equity fund raising for a second year in a row in with initial public offerings that in less than two years have already totaled about &# billion already the stock market is fast replacing the chinese government as the main source of funds for its biggest companies including a banking sector that was until a few years ago drowning in bad loans to fix behemoth industrial &amp commercial bank of china ltd chinas government threw it a series of lifelines valued at tens of billions of dollars over the years culminating in early with a &# billion cash injection just over a year later investors on the booming shanghai exchange helped the bank raise &# billion of its world record &# billion initial public offering now among the worlds most valuable banks by stock market capitalization icbc has hit the acquisition trail buying banks in indonesia and macau and has plans for a new york branch giant companies in other sectors from shipping to insurance to steel have used cash raised in markets to buy competitors

september the company raised &# billion "we have a more perfect capital market today than three years ago " says fang xinghai director general of the governments office of financial services in shanghai "the interests of the various types of shareholders are aligned " one missing element foreign investors a quota currently limits overseas money managers to owning about of chinas market capitalization otherwise money in the market is from domestic sources still foreign firms like prudential are making inroads half of the roughly companies selling mutual funds to chinese individuals are ventures that are partly owned by foreign firms foreign banks like citigroup inc also have offerings so far this year mutual funds have raised about &# billion according to shanghais z ben advisors ltd that averages &# billion each which would rank the typical chinese fund among the top launches ever recorded in the u s by morningstar inc a big question is whether chinas companies can ultimately deliver the stellar earnings performance that is predicted by high stock prices says robert aliber a professor at the university of chicagos graduate school of business profits of listed companies grew in the first half of this year but that number offers cold comfort since some of total net income was from companies own investments in the booming stock market not from their operations according to shanghai wind information co the shanghai investor mr guo says his buy on dips strategy should continue to pay dividends at least into next years olympic games although he thinks prices are already high he says millions more investors will discover the market before the rally winds down if the market reverses he will share the pain with his friends he says "according to our agreement i have to bear some of the losses " he says "but so far i havent lost " ellen zhu in shanghai contributed to this article
