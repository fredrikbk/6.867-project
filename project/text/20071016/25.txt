call to brave for &# billion rescue banks seek investors for fund to shore up commercial paper the nations biggest banks are attempting to woo investors and other banks to a megafund that will buy troubled assets by promising not to purchase the riskiest securities and forcing sellers to pay a fee to put their assets in the fund many investors said they welcomed the plan by citigroup inc j p morgan chase &amp co and bank of america corp to set up the &# billion fund they expressed hopes that the plan announced as expected yesterday by the banks would help jump start the commercial paper market which provides financing for things including mortgages and big investment projects but has been struggling since late july the fund would issue short term notes to investors and use the proceeds to buy securities from specialized funds known as structured investment vehicles or sivs that are being forced to wind down their businesses in doing so the fund would help prevent the sivs asset sales from triggering a market meltdown there are some sivs with about &# billion in assets "theres a lot of details to be worked out but theyre talking the right language " says joseph benevento head of cash management at deutsche bank asset management to entice investors the fund will place hefty demands on participating sivs requiring them to help insure investors against losses and accept a discount on assets they sell to the fund the fund will also avoid all but the most highly rated assets signaling to investors that it wont be tainted by subprime mortgage problems the plan was designed by citigroup and ultimately backed by the treasury department where worried officials had been monitoring the turmoil in credit markets as treasury and the banks weighed their plans they heard other proposals or ideas from such bond market participants as securities firm lehman brothers holdings inc and germanys deutsche bank ag people familiar with the situation said treasury officials portrayed their role in helping rescue banks from big losses on mortgage securities as an appropriate short term response to concerns about tightening liquidity in the capital markets they also suggested regulatory changes might be needed to avoid future problems in his first public comments on the plan treasury secretary henry paulson said the huge bank affiliated funds that were kept off balance sheet and that owned assets backed by shaky mortgages and other securities suffered from a lack of transparency and that regulators may need to step in to avoid future problems "the regulators didnt have clear enough visibility with what was going on in terms of these off balance sheet sivs " mr paulson said to reporters after an event at the university of texas at austin in the short term treasury officials said the financial markets were in danger of a large scale dumping of assets by the banks which would have hurt capital markets and potentially spilled over to the broader economy to avoid that treasury stepped in to facilitate discussions among the banks for a private sector solution which culminated in the creation of a fund to buy siv assets some have criticized the treasury for essentially helping big banks avoid the financial pain associated with risky bets that didnt pan out the reaction in washington though was more muted democrats sought to use the treasurys willingness to get involved to bolster their demands that the bush administration do more to help homeowners who are also suffering from the subprime downturn citigroup j p morgan and bank of america yesterday sketched out the broad outlines of the fund called the master liquidity enhancement conduit or m lec the fund which could be operational by late december would serve as a buyer of last resort in troubled credit markets particularly the market for securities backed by mortgages and other assets so far most major wall street firms are hanging back among those that havent given a commitment are goldman sachs group inc morgan stanley ubs ag deutsche bank and credit suisse group according to people on wall street other firms whose initial responses couldnt be determined included merrill lynch &amp co lehman brothers and bear stearns cos citigroup which is the largest sponsor of sivs with seven such affiliates has been criticized on the grounds that its own sivs would benefit most from the plan bank of america too will benefit the charlotte n c banks mutual funds are big investors of commercial paper including debt sold by the sivs bank of america said its concern wasnt whether the commercial paper would be paid off but rather the unnecessary seizing up of the market according to people familiar with the plan though the price of admission for sivs will be high sivs will only be allowed to sell assets rated aa or better and likely will be unable to sell collateralized debt obligations pools of debt repackaged into slices with different levels of risk and return backed by subprime assets in addition the sivs will have to pay a fee to the super conduit and accept a discount in the price of the securities they are selling in return for that discount the sivs will receive notes in the "junior" layer in the conduit which will take the first hit if losses are incurred the restructuring of sivs also raises the specter that certain siv note holders may find themselves stuck with unexpected losses many fixed income managers are intrigued by the idea of investing in what some are already calling a "super siv" fund but some also say they are wary of the complexity of the proposed fund and although the banks have indicated they will avoid subprime loans "its so murky " says jeffrey gundlach chief investment officer for los angeles based asset management firm tcw group which recently started a &# billion distressed debt fund randall smith tom lauricella valerie bauerlein and alistair macdonald contributed to this article see related article
