academic inquisitors as if losing the presidency of harvard for hinting that there might be a biological explanation for the preponderance of men in academic science wasnt enough lawrence summers now appears to be persona non grata elsewhere too a few weeks ago the university of california davis rescinded an invitation for him to speak more than faculty members signed a petition protesting his appearance saying mr summers "has come to symbolize gender and racial prejudice in academia " davis ecology professor maureen stanton was "appalled and stunned that someone like summers would be invited to speak " ms stanton and her allies want pariah status for anyone who dares to suggest a biological basis for difference yet the scientific literature on why men and women enter different fields is legitimate robust complex and fascinating what is appalling is that leading academic institutions would try to shut down the discussion and get away with it almost last week the american enterprise institute brought together top researchers on sex differences ranging from the strongly feminist brandeis womens studies scholar rosalind barnett to aei scholar and co author of "the bell curve " charles murray the discussions were heated but civil no one got mad fled the room weeping or nearly fainted ms barnett opened by reminding the conference of the history of prejudice against women in the sciences though significant gains have been made she pointed out that there are still "invisible walls" that hold women back another speaker richard haier professor of psychology at the university of california irvine acknowledged the long history of prejudice then presented slides that must give pause to even the most fervent biology denier using the latest and most advanced mri brain imaging technology he demonstrated that male and female brains have strikingly distinct architectures and process information differently mr haier reminded us that "there is so much we do not know and so much yet to discover about brain biology and sex differences and perhaps even career choices " simon baron cohen a professor at cambridge university and one of the worlds leading experts on autism had an intriguing hypothesis autism is far more common in males than females those afflicted with the disorder including those with normal or high iq tend to be socially disconnected and clueless about the emotional states of others they often exhibit an obsessive fixation on objects and machines sound like anyone you know mr baron cohen suggests that autism may be the far end of the male norm the "extreme male brain " all systematizing and no empathizing he believes that men are on average wired to be better systematizers and women to be better empathizers he presented a wide range of correlations between the level of fetal testosterone and behaviors in both girls and boys from infancy into grade school to back up his belief harvard cognitive psychologist elizabeth spelke another speaker noted that mr baron cohens theory is not settled science she is right of course yet the current configuration of the workplace fits mr baron cohens theory women dominate in empathy centered fields such as early childhood education social work and psychology while men are over represented in the "systematizing" vocations such as car repair oil drilling and electrical engineering others debated the pros and cons of research on "unconscious bias" and the effects of stereotypes on test takers so it went no one present could doubt the importance of the debate or the significance of the evidence from both sides the audience was captivated as experts played with the politically incorrect notion that male and female brains may be markedly different unfortunately the deniers of differences between the sexes are on the march with powerful allies in the fall of the national academy of sciences released a recklessly one sided study now widely referred to as authoritative titled "beyond bias and barriers fulfilling the potential of women in academic science and engineering " according to the report differences in cognition between the sexes have no bearing on the dearth of women in academic math physics and engineering it is all due to bias case closed the report calls on congress to hold hearings on gender bias in the sciences and on federal agencies to "move immediately" emphasis in original to apply anti discrimination laws such as title ix to academic science but not english departments "the time for action is now " no it is not now is the time for scholars in our universities and in the national academy of sciences to defend and support principles of free and objective inquiry the chronically appalled must not have the last word ms sommers is a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute see related letters "letters to the editor attention men and women may be different" wsj oct
