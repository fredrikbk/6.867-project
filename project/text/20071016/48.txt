economics nobel goes to three americans three american researchers won the nobel prize in economics for theoretical work into ways to make interactions between buyers and sellers with private information more efficient their research has influenced the design of auctions for everything from treasury bonds to items on ebay the royal swedish academy of sciences awarded the nobel memorial prize in economic science to leonid hurwicz years old a retired professor at the university of minnesota who told reporters he thought his chances at the honor had faded eric s maskin of the institute for advanced study in princeton n j and roger b myerson of the university of chicago "todays award is for deep conceptual theory its not highly practical in itself but it builds the foundation for so much " said al roth a harvard university economist who has built on the trios work to construct systems that allocate donated kidneys among those who need transplants and match medical students to residency programs regarded as the father of the field known as "mechanism design theory " mr hurwicz tackled a problem that the field of economics didnt traditionally consider when markets dont allocate resources efficiently or at all what sort of allocation mechanisms can be created that will do so in textbooks adam smiths invisible hand matches buyers with sellers equally a million potato farmers will find a million potato eaters and will sell their goods for the maximum that buyers are willing to pay in the real world buyers and sellers cant find each other or one buyer tries to corner the market or the government grows the potatoes mechanism design theory addresses what happens when buyers and sellers keep private information about how they value a good or service mr hurwicz born in moscow began developing theories that show when markets arent capable of operating efficiently and to measure what type of mechanism would work best "leo hurwicz made the breakthrough that the key part of the problem is that people dont have incentives to share information" about the price at which they are willing to buy or sell said mr myerson who studied mr hurwiczs work as a harvard graduate student messrs myerson and maskin built on mr hurwiczs work by finding a way to mathematically represent certain types of allocation mechanisms that allows economists to easily compare different models for selling goods "it becomes a graduate student level problem " said mr myerson mechanism design theory is critical to building and to successfully bidding in auctions in the s the federal communications commission hired two stanford university experts in the field to consult on revamping its method of auctioning off radio spectrum "you wouldnt really say that the material has helped with the design of these things but its helped in the way of thinking through the issues " said paul klemperer an economist at the university of oxford who advised the british government on its sale of third generation wireless spectrum jeffrey lacker president of the federal reserve bank of richmond said mechanism design theory offers insight into what happened in financial markets this summer it "takes very seriously the informational constraints that people operate under " he said the way that investors responded during the crisis suggests that a shortage of information was a bigger problem for the market than a lack of liquidity that conclusion is "consistent with the lack of use weve seen in the discount window " the feds program for lending directly to banks "i supported the discount rate reduction and i think it was the right thing to do " mr lacker said however "if liquidity was the problem we would have seen more use of the discount window " "mechanism design formalizes ways of thinking about how a social planner manager or parent can set up rules so that all parties involved have the incentives to act in the way that the planner manager parent prefers " economist and author steven levitt said on his freakonomics blog the three winners will share &# million greg ip contributed to this article
