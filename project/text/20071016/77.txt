needed a coherent retirement policy your oct editorial "pensions and palm greasing" takes a local issue and generalizes it to the entire public pension industry it also takes a savings tool k plans and attempts to convert it into a meaningful long term pension plan the logic in both situations is flawed most public employees participate in well managed well governed well funded and closely regulated defined benefit pension plans these plans are governed by trustees charged with the fiduciary duty to oversee assets solely for the benefit of their membership conflicts of interest are clearly delineated and prohibited enforcement powers exist that can be invoked by fellow trustees by the membership by regulators and the public at large local shortcomings in new york state can be addressed by implementing best practices and best program designs exhibited by other public plans found through the u s the call to convert successful and effective traditional pensions to k style defined contribution plans so as to avoid overreaching by politicians is counterproductive and naive traditional pensions have proven themselves to be effective in providing financial security to persons no longer willing or able to work they work to attract and retain professionals providing needed public services public defined benefit plans provide retirement benefits at a cost lower than k plans and a greater positive impact on the local economy than defined contribution plans your proposal is naive as well there is no fool proof method of avoiding overreaching when hundreds of billions of dollars are to be accumulated and invested the abuses would most likely not be as readily apparent with a k plan but they would be there none the less could not politically directed payments arise from managers selected to manage defined contribution accounts or act as third party administrators america needs a coherent effective retirement policy that respects the work rendered by retirees and which allows for independence in their old age that policy if it is to be successful is predicated on personal savings like a k style program on a traditional employer program like the defined benefit plans offered in both the private and public sectors and the federal social security program unless you are independently wealthy this three pronged approach is the best chance for financial independence that to my mind is a worthy approach for a worthy goal louis w kosiba executive director illinois municipal retirement fund oak brook ill
