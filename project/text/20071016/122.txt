the morning brief housing worries haunt the fed online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here federal reserve chairman ben bernanke yesterday suggested economic uncertainty leaves the fed waiting for more data but that the prospect of greater fallout from the housing market still has policy makers spooked ahead of their next interest rate decision on halloween in a model of central banker understatement mr bernanke noted to the economic club of new york that "the past several months have been an eventful period for the u s economy " and he recounted the mortgage meltdown market panic and increase in fed anxiety about the economy that prompted a reversal of the feds risk balance toward growth worries and the resulting half percentage point reduction in the cost of borrowed money last month while members of the federal open market committee agreed sept that "significant spillovers from housing market trouble to household and business spending were not yet evident " the downside risks to both had clearly increased exacerbated by "somewhat downbeat consumer sentiment and slower growth in private sector employment " moreover fomc members "also reported somewhat greater caution in the outlooks of their business contacts" a key influence on fed action in his recent book ex chairman alan greenspan called the regional fed banks contacts with local bankers and executives a "window on the american economy " that was a darker description of business contact sentiment collected before aug and published in the feds last beige book report which suggests how quickly policy makers outlook was evolving and it indicates the beige book due out tomorrow could offer a key reading of what fomc members are hearing and mulling over now since the september meeting housing market conditions have continued to weaken and "the further contraction in housing is likely to be a significant drag on growth in the current quarter and through early next year " mr bernanke said its still too early to assess how much that will hurt consumer and business spending or how much they will be affected by tightening credit conditions he added so the fed will closely follow spending data and whether employment and labor income gains can boost consumer spending enough to offset how home price weakness is undercutting homeowner equity the key question for the fed as it ponders interest rates remains will the markets effects on consumers homes keep them from spending enough to keep the economy growing more mortgage and housing worry the fed isnt the only central bank worried about fallout from the housing bust the bank of england has been

housing markets the new york times reports that effort orchestrated by the treasury but funded by some of the biggest u s banks and led by citigroup is aimed at creating a huge fund that would buy troubled mortgage related assets from entities affiliated with the banks which would in turn unclog a relatively frozen market for the short term debt known as commercial paper mr paulson plans to defend the move by saying he has "no interest in bailing out lenders or property speculators " and strike a note akin to mr bernankes saying "we must recognize the very real harm to families affected by the housing downturn " the times reports many investors said they welcomed the fund plan led by citigroup expressing hope it will "jump start the commercial paper market which provides financing for things including mortgages and big investment projects but has been struggling since late july " the wall street journal reports the financial times notes that following the launch of the "super

qwest on the matter and in the responses they sent to congressional investigators the companies tried to counter the notion they had acted illegally with at&amp t saying its cooperation had been "in the public interest " the wall street journal adds verizon responded that when asked it doesnt even take into account the requests legality or necessity "because to do so would slow efforts to save lives in criminal investigations " the post says "verizon also disclosed that the fbi using administrative subpoenas sought information identifying not just a person making a call but all the people that customer called as well as the people those people called " the three telecom companies refused to provide details and said "they couldnt acknowledge any participation in intelligence programs because the bush administration has declared such information to be a state secret " the journal reports "qwest in particular issued a short letter declining to respond to questions and citing the administrations orders " the participation of the companies in the surveillance programs will play a key role at the congressional debate this week over whether to limit the governments domestic
