graham troupes leap forward martha graham dance company tour tucson ariz centennial hall tonight for additional dates and venues go to www marthagraham org new york at the midpoint of its recent hurriedly scheduled two week season at the joyce theater the martha graham dance company lately embroiled in a court fight concerning rights to grahams choreography and now under the artistic direction of former company dancer janet eilber held a reunion central to the gathering of dancers and other personnel connected to the past and current company which is just ending its th anniversary year was a program called "from the horses mouth " conceived and directed by tina croll and jamie cunningham modern dance veterans who started such verbal and movement recollections in this graham "edition" included individuals with little anecdotes to tell and little moments of movement to show audience members familiar and unfamiliar with the troupe and the now legendary graham who died in reacted with various degrees of amusement to the chatty proceedings nostalgia was in the air as was a sense of "i didnt know that " revelation though the pacing of the minute presentation grew slack at times one particular moment stood out for me in my nearly year acquaintance with the company dressed in the brick red homespun looking dress of the pioneering woman from grahams masterly "appalachian spring " and threading along a diagonal path in one of the programs danced interludes came the still lovely ms eilber unlike any number of sometimes overeager meandering participants the companys director made a riveting effect with her filament flickering calm her effortless unaffected foray betrayed a privacy and a reverie that took the dancer and her audience inside a graham moment where the feminine power of her canon floated free its still a little premature to conclude that the decidedly positive impact of ms eilbers direction will sustain the troupe and make grahams legacy live strongly in the st century but this run proved notably encouraging the pervasive calm indicated by the directors brief "horses mouth" appearance tended to resonate throughout the season technically the eight graham dances given during the two weeks were noticeably well rehearsed but even more important they revealed a dimension of freshness and confidence that had next to none of the desperation and overblown dimensions that often marked the troupes performing in the years prior to ms eilbers stewardship if during this run few of the roles made by graham for herself and thereby made indelibly vivid and usually fiercely powerful were given their full force neither were they hollow or shrill of tone happily both elizabeth auclair and jennifer depalo managed to make much of the onetime graham role of the authoritative woman leading the all female antiwar showcase now called "sketches from chronicle " so vital were both the renderings of the leading role and those of the ensemble of subsidiary women that this stirring trio of vignettes from might well be renamed "nuggets from chronicle" to note their inherent value as intense dance theater as more than one graham male dancer noted in "horses mouth " its long been stressed that grahams dance world belongs to its women with the men taking a lesser role and yet thanks to ms eilbers keen eye the company now has a singularly effective recruit among its already solid complement of men the newcomer david martinez promises to equal any of the stellar predecessors who made their name in this repertory so far handsome towering mr martinez has only one leading role as the male half of the dominant couple in white leading "diversion of angels " grahams paean to love in various physical and athletic guises supporting the statuesque katherine crockett looking like a south seas beauty with gardenias in her hair and a virginal white sarong like sheath wrapping her body mr martinez poses like some colossus of rhodes and bounds through his choreographic challenges like a carefree young bison forceful yes pushy no other newcomers also made their mark as half of the almost giddy couple in yellow in "diversion of angels " the daring and quicksilver yuko giannakis danced with fullness and appealing abandon as her deft partner the compact george smallwood made each of the daring catches built into his role seem an organic part of the dancing all the while keeping the physical surprise of grahams inventions thrillingly clear besides the loss of the beauteous and compelling fang yi sheu who recently left the company for other ventures after making a great impact in all of the graham created roles she had been given the only real cloud in the season was a misfire of a matinee called "teens program " im not sure how much specific marketing to young people was done but the theater was less than full and the presentation less than satisfying but this final saturday matinee couldnt undo the momentum of the seasons previous performances in which the seemingly unassuming ms eilber showed that true graham impact neednt be tough and exaggerated its the womanly side of grahams aesthetic that can get lost in a misguided rush to hammer home her theatrics ms eilber appears to know this to her very core and is finding a way to let it glow through her companys scrupulous performances mr greskovic writes about dance for the journal
