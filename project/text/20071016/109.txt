small investors face a new fund hazard sec rule meant to discourage market timing yields fees and lockouts for k savers the risks of rebalancing many buy and hold mutual fund investors are being hit with extra fees and trading restrictions because of a new rule meant to deter rapid trading of fund shares the securities and exchange commission rule which takes effect today requires brokerage firms retirement plan administrators and other intermediaries who hold fund shares on behalf of individual investors to share those individuals trading data with mutual fund companies upon request the rule is meant to help funds monitor short term trading and deter "market timers " who trade quickly in and out of funds for quick profits these investors activity can be costly to longer term investors because it can raise a funds transaction costs and trigger heftier tax bills for fund holders but some of the intermediary firms that have already started giving the trade data to fund firms in advance of todays deadline say the rule is having adverse effects on regular investors who arent market timers many fund firms have been quick to request trading data and a growing number of individuals making routine trades such as quarterly rebalancing of their k accounts are being slapped with redemption fees as high as or even blocked from trading certain funds these firms say the issue could affect millions of small investors who hold mutual funds in their brokerage and retirement accounts and have no intention of market timing in order to protect themselves they should take a closer look at their funds trading restrictions while redemption fees and trading restrictions arent new some investors have been able to avoid these penalties if they hold funds through an "omnibus" account such as a k plan which can make it tough for fund companies to detect whos trading and how often the new rule which was issued by the sec in early after the effects of widespread market timing became well known helps fund companies to peek inside these omnibus accounts and enforce their short term trading restrictions much of the impact so far has been seen in retirement plans where investors dont always control when and where their money is moved steven kaye an investment adviser in watchung n j works with one k plan that recently moved to a new recordkeeper the online k which this year began sharing individual participants trade data with fund companies and imposing the funds redemption fees on participants participants assets were automatically moved into new funds whose investment objectives are similar to those of the funds theyd held with the previous recordkeeper one year old participant in the plan had a portion of his account automatically switched into the artisan international fund but one week later he decided to adjust his allocation and moved more than &# from the artisan fund into a real estate fund the participant who has made only three other trades this year is hardly a market timer mr kaye says but his move cost him nearly &# because the artisan fund charges a redemption fee on shares held less than days the participant "felt the system was gamed against him and initially was very resentful " mr kaye says in some cases retirement plan participants making regular rebalancing trades a practice advocated by many financial advisers have been flagged by fund companies as potential abusive traders in plans provided by eplan services inc a k administrator and recordkeeper based in denver two participants making regular rebalancing trades were singled out by fund companies for potential trading abuses in the past days says mark gutrich eplans president and chief executive the firm spent hours researching their trades and calling the participants and ultimately convinced the fund companies that the trades werent abusive mr gutrich says fund companies seeking to curtail frequent trading may simply block active traders from their funds dailyaccess corp a k administrator and recordkeeper based in mobile ala started sharing individual trade data with fund companies about a year ago its participants have paid hundreds of redemption fees in recent months though most are relatively small early this year several participants who didnt have a history of frequent trading were blocked from investing in bank of america corp s columbia funds after they violated the firms trading restrictions retirement plan participants generally dont make a lot of trades but such trading activity is picking up for many investors as plans add "managed accounts " in which participants turn over management of their k to financial professionals and programs that automatically rebalance participants accounts on a regular basis often every quarter more than of plans now offer automatic rebalancing up from two years ago according to consulting firm hewitt associates such programs "may trigger some penalties and thats not what was intended because we do want participants to rebalance and were creating systems" to do that for them says fred barstein chief executive of kexchange inc a greenacres fla k service provider "were penalizing people for doing the right thing " investors dont have to make any trades at all to feel the impact of funds new scrutiny of omnibus account trades hotchkis &amp wiley mid cap value fund recently threatened to pull out of a physicians groups k plan because two of the participants were making rapid trades in and out of the fund says mr kaye the investment adviser after mr kaye sent the two rapid traders a letter saying that they may face trading restrictions or be allowed to trade only by written request rather than online or over the phone the participants agreed to stop the active trading he says investors can find information on a funds short term trading policies including redemption fees and potential trading blocks imposed on frequent traders in the prospectus such policies can vary widely from fund to fund even within a single fund firm the vanguard developed markets index fund for example charges a redemption fee on shares held less than two months while vanguard tax managed balanced vanguard tax managed capital appreciation and other vanguard tax managed funds charge a redemption fee on shares held less than five years more than of the largest fund groups charge redemption fees according to a recent survey by the coalition of mutual fund investors a shareholder advocacy group policies on blocking trades also vary widely from fund to fund capital research and management co s american funds including growth fund of america and europacific growth typically have a "purchase blocking policy" whereby investors who redeem shares worth &# or more cant invest in the fund within the next days other fund companies such as guinness atkinson asset management say they implement such trading blocks on a case by case basis some retirement plan providers and fund companies have exempted certain plan transactions including loans and hardship withdrawals from trading restrictions but such exceptions arent universal in k plans provided by merrill lynch &amp co for example regular automatic rebalancing doesnt trigger a redemption fee in plans provided by vanguard group however automatic rebalancing can trigger a redemption fee though hardship withdrawals arent subject to those fees investors should take a close look at their retirement plan literature to learn where trading restrictions apply and watch for any trading penalty warnings as they make transactions a number of large plan providers such as merrill warn investors when theyre about to make a trade that could trigger a redemption fee but smaller providers dont always offer such warnings some shareholder advocates and industry executives question the rules ability to deter market timers if a rapid trader can make on a quick trade "is the redemption fee going to deter me from wanting to profit from it " asks chad parks president and ceo of the online k based in san francisco and since funds have to request the individual trade data from intermediaries rather than receiving say a daily report on all shareholders trades they may miss much of the abusive trading activity occurring in omnibus accounts says niels holch executive director of the coalition of mutual fund investors another downside as retirement plan participants see more trading restrictions they may also pay higher plan fees some experts say in complying with the rule "a lot of money has been spent which is going to be charged to plan participants " says david wray president of the profit sharing k council of america the online k has already charged employers a one time fee to help cover the costs of complying with the rule and if fund companies continue to request trade data at the rate they have in recent months "we definitely have to increase our pricing " says eplan services mr gutrich market timing fallout regulatory changes are bringing more trading restrictions to many mutual fund investors heres whats happening a new rule helps funds enforce trading restrictions in k plans and brokerage accounts investors who violate a funds trading restrictions may pay extra fees or be blocked from investing in the fund certain transactions such as a k hardship withdrawal may be exempt from trading restrictions
