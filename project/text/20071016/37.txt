citigroup model is left shaken by credit crunch touted as a diverse financial colossus that could profit in good times and bad citigroup inc is reeling after two weeks of dreary news including a profit drop reported yesterday that show how unprepared the bank was for the recent bust in credit markets with businesses struggling from texas to tokyo the banking behemoths capital ratio or cushion against losses has dwindled to its lowest level in years citigroup has halted a program to buy back its own shares the stock fell yesterday citigroup is at the center of an industry plan to rescue a series of bank affiliated investment funds that invested in mortgage backed securities and other risky assets citigroup once boasted about its big presence in such funds but now is leading the charge to shore them up by creating a single big fund to buy up their assets the dismal news adds to pressure on chief executive charles prince who had declared "the year of no excuses " yesterday he said "this quarters performance was well below our expectations and frankly surprising " analysts and investors fear the bank is so weighed down that it wont be able to jump on new business opportunities that would put it at a big disadvantage to rivals such as j p morgan chase &amp co and bank of america corp theyre already swooping in for example to build market share in the mortgage industry "citigroup has less flexibility than some of their peers to buy back stock increase their dividend and pursue cash acquisitions " says michael mayo a banking analyst at deutsche bank who earlier this month began calling for mr princes departure the bank showed some progress earlier this year in cutting expenses a longtime concern of analysts but the advances were overwhelmed by the recent troubles messrs mayo and prince had a testy exchange on a conference call yesterday for investors in light of the disappointing results mr mayo asked "what are the repercussions at the level of the office of the chairman " mr prince responded that for most of citigroups businesses "i think any fair minded person would say the banks strategic plan is working " mr prince was pressed on whether the board has reaffirmed his job security but he declined to say citigroups main blow in the third quarter came from write downs connected to mortgage backed securities and loans to fund leveraged buyouts but it also suffered some unpleasant surprises elsewhere the bank put aside more reserves than expected to cover a september surge in late payments on consumer mortgages it said it expected these problems to continue there were some bright spots citigroups wealth management arm posted a increase in earnings and a jump in revenues the banks international consumer business is performing well and executives said they expect continued growth even then there was an exception in japan where the bank is being hurt by new limits on the interest rates that it can charge on consumer loans banks in japan are being flooded by customer claims for refunds on that interest it appears citigroups board is standing behind mr prince saudi prince alwaleed bin talal who is the banks biggest shareholder earlier this month expressed his support some investors expressed frustration about the companys lagging stock price and its decision to halt a stock buyback plan to free up capital for unexpected problems "youd like them to be aggressively buying back shares " said david katz chief investment officer with matrix advisors value fund the new york money management firm owns million shares of citigroup shares of citigroup have fallen about this year far outpacing declines of about for both j p morgan chase and bank of america while j p morgan and bank of america also face exposure to leveraged loans and other credit problems they have had relative success in areas that have troubled citigroup j p morgan has aggressively slashed costs and made big investments in technology under chief executive jamie dimon who was once a contender for citigroups top job bank of america has evolved in recent years into a national retail banking powerhouse giving it a big capital cushion in tough times todays citigroup is the product of former chief executive sanford weills "universal bank" strategy in the s mr weill cobbled together a broad array of financial businesses including primerica a brokerage firm that owned the smith barney brand and bond trading powerhouse salomon brothers mr weill eventually merged those businesses with retail banking giant citicorp to form citigroup the idea was that the bank could provide multiple services to the same clients while its massive balance sheet could help it weather market jolts like the recent credit crunch but the institution has proved unwieldy for both mr weill and mr prince to manage mr prince took the reins in as citigroup was caught up in costly litigation tied to its role in financing enron corp and worldcom inc a longtime citigroup lawyer and lieutenant to mr weill mr prince struggled to bring the bank into the good graces of regulators a scandal in japan resulted in citigroups private banking unit losing its license there and u s federal regulators in barred the company from making major acquisitions the freeze was later lifted the bank has lost a number of top executives including todd thomson the head of the banks wealth management unit mr thomson was forced out earlier this year after tension over his judgment and expenses including his use of the corporate jet last week thomas maheras who had been at the company for years and ran the markets and trading unit within its investment bank stepped down abruptly after a management shake up led to the departure of one of his deputies as part of the shake up vikram pandit a former morgan stanley executive who joined citigroup earlier this year took charge of a new group that includes the investment bank and alternative investments operations amid the upheaval recent profits have been largely flat and they took a tumble in the third quarter as net income fell from the year earlier period to &# billion revenue rose to &# billion from &# billion the bank took a &# billion hit as it recorded losses in its core trading business and was forced to set aside greater reserves to cover bad loans in its consumer business "this was a disappointing quarter even in the context of the dislocations in the subprime mortgage and credit markets " mr prince said the poor results helped drive one of citigroups key measures of financial strength to its lowest level in several years the banks so called tier ratio which reflects how much of a financial cushion a bank has to protect it from unexpected problems fell to of total assets down from a year earlier and below the banks targeted as of june bank of americas tier ratio was and j p morgans was federal regulators require a bank to have a tier ratio of a bank with a ratio of or higher is considered to be well capitalized
