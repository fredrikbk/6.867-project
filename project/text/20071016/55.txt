home &amp family best of the juggle excerpts from wsj coms work &amp family blog working parents ponder how to coordinate kids play as i was walking my daughter to her nursery classroom the other day i overheard other moms talking about their daughters regular play date i immediately wondered if my daughter hadnt been invited because i work and am not around to get to know the other moms play dates arent imperative i know it is only the first few weeks of school and there is plenty of time for friendships ahead however the situation raised the issue of how working parents coordinate social activities when their kids are little my husband usually does the pickup from school while everyone is perfectly friendly moms usually gravitate toward one another i figure well get to know people eventually perhaps ill even take the plunge and suggest a weekend get together with some of the other families the last thing i want though is to be perceived as the pushy mom who asks why her precious kid wasnt included in the activity du jour i even worried about raising the topic in this column readers say "just ask your kid who theyd like to play with and call the parent to arrange it if you wait around for someone to call you youll be waiting for a very long time " "i suggest you coordinate a moms night out at a local restaurant where everyone can really get to know each other this will go a long way toward establishing relationships with other moms " missing special moments for work by jamie heller have you ever missed something very special for work a version of that happened to me recently i had invited colleagues to my home for "baseball and brunch " my six year old is devoted to the sport and one of my co workers had been the captain of his college team my son couldnt have been more excited to meet him and play problem was on the morning of the event it became clear i would need to do work as guests finished off their french toast and headed to the park a colleague and i stayed back later that afternoon my son announced that hed hit a home run i dont feel resentment or anger the work was my responsibility the deadline was the deadline but i do feel sad i missed a memory moment for my son and time with my colleagues and their families readers say "working parents miss special moments all the time and guess what stay at home parents miss special moments too parents miss these things for many reasons job commitments inattention because another child needs our time fatigue or just because " "i put the extra special days in my work calendar as far in advance as possible i then start manipulating my work schedule a couple of weeks in advance turning things in early ill forgo sleep and do work early in the a m or late at night on those special days " how do working parents find time to entertain by sara schaefer munoz we recently received this email "i have no time and energy to entertain i have a hard enough time getting through the week its beyond me to have my house company ready and put together a presentable meal for having people over how do other working parents handle this " readers say "we will have an early dinner if friends with kids come over or have a later dinner if friends without kids come over we make our staple meals our favorites which are fast and easy to make and do whatever prep we can ahead of time " "i find i rarely find the energy to pull things together im going to blame it on the foodies theyve raised the bar so high that you feel like its gotta be a performance or something and everyone seems to have the gourmet kitchen and the spotless house to go with it once ive heaped all of these expectations on myself i just give up and put it off "
