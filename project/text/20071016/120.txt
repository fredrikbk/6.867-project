the middle seat from luxury to bare bones discount airlines specialize travelers choices multiply as carriers carve out niches meal orders on touch screens one new start up airline offers in flight music videos purple and pink mood lighting and flight attendants clad in chic all black outfits another rolls up staircases to planes instead of covered jet bridges charges for water and puts its flight attendants in t shirts advertising destinations together high brow virgin america inc and low brow skybus airlines inc show how the low cost airline industry is maturing in the u s once start up airlines all tried to fly a similar path just copy southwest airlines co with its short frequent flights open seating simple pricing and friendly staff but now being a southwest clone isnt enough like the retail industry discount airlines are getting more specialized trying to find niches that appeal to a certain type of customer not to all customers if southwest is the wal mart of the skies new competitors now try to be the dollar store or wholesale club undercutting wal mart others want to outdo wal mart by being higher quality like target or kohls bottom line its creating more choice for consumers "low cost or new business models can come in amazing different variations and forms " says airline consultant patrick murphy a former senior transportation department official "i think there will be lots of new variants we havent seen yet for domestic and international service " low cost airlines now carry more than of domestic traffic in the u s and mr murphy notes their growth rate has accelerated since more significantly low cost carriers compete with so called "legacy airlines" the big network carriers that have been around for decades on about of the domestic routes legacy carriers fly with so much discount airline capacity in the skies new entrants have to find a way to stand out either by offering fancy service at relatively cheap prices or bare bones service at ridiculously cheap prices "you either need to compete on price or compete on product you cant do both " says b ben baldanza chief executive of spirit airlines inc a year old low cost carrier that has recently recast itself as an "ultra low cost carrier" that charges for virtually everything including water air is offered for free in the cabin spirit sometimes jokes virgin america which flies mostly between california and new york plies the high end by offering fancy leather seats and a first class cabin at cheaper prices than incumbents like ual corp s united airlines and amr corp s american airlines like most airlines virgin america offers meals for sale in its coach cabin but you can order them on a touch screen computer at your seat the heavy entertainment offering is also a revenue generator for the airline virgin america launched by british entrepreneur sir richard branson offers some movie choices on demand on seat back screens at &# each the music videos are free as are some live television shows and music channels but premium shows like "heroes" and "the office" are sold at &# skybus has no entertainment system in the back of its seats it doesnt even put a pouch in the seat backs because they take time to clean and having no seat back pouch lets the airline squeeze seats closer together without taking up as much knee room skybus flight attendants roll carts down the aisle selling food along with perfume watches chocolates anything to get a little more revenue that allows the airline to offer seats on flights for &# a piece the evolution of spirit provides a clear illustration of the industry trend as the onetime nondescript discount carrier has remade itself into an ultracheap carrier with fares as low as a penny designed to get people on airplanes and then sell travelers additional goods and services once a traditional start up that flew older jets from detroit and cities in the northeast to vacation destinations spirit found itself in a no mans land of low cost carriers no better than the fifth or sixth largest discount airline in the u s so it decided a couple of years ago to try to become the biggest discount airline from the u s to latin america and the caribbean where american dominates and faces little low cost competition spirit still flies lots of people from new york detroit and other cities to florida but spirit now also flies as far south as lima peru it phased out its older md jets and now flies a young all airbus fleet with new owners moving in last year spirit also changed its approach to customer service to hold down costs it wants to be cheaper than other cheap airlines that means pinching seats closer together spirit has seats on its airbus as compared with in the same airplane at us airways group inc or seats in as at frontier airlines spirit charges extra for anything nicer or easier checking bags getting a bigger seat in the front of the plane even water on oct spirit stopped handing out free ice water to customers bottled water coffee soda muffins cookies and granola bars are available for &# beer wine and liquor &# checking one bag costs &# &# if you buy in advance online upgrading to what spirit calls a "big front seat" costs about &# but the extra fees turn off some travelers gale job was angry when spirit charged her and her husband &# to check four bags "checking bags is part of the service an airline should provide " she said vowing never to fly spirit again spirits average one way fare is about &# and it is collecting about &# per passenger in extra revenue mr baldanza says the airline believes it can push that a lot higher charging for things like jumping the check in line or expanding items for sale on board airplanes spirit is testing products such as aspirin newspapers magazines crossword books playing cards anything sold at a minimart "customers will shift airlines over &# or &# when buying a ticket but once they buy they are willing to spend " mr baldanza says the whole idea is something like a movie theater he says get people in then sell overpriced popcorn its not nickel and diming he says if it comes with a really cheap fare the airline also sells memberships to a "&# fare club " which costs &# a year you can join for an introductory &# spirit sends members email alerts about unadvertised cheap fares some &# some even cheaper spirit says it has offered seats for only a penny each way plus taxes and government fees to various destinations the program builds customer loyalty brings in an extra &# million a year in revenue and makes it harder for competitors to match spirits cheapest prices because they arent published publicly yesterday for example spirit launched a sale of &# seats each way between fort lauderdale fla and grand bahama on some off peak travel days in december and january the sale ends at midnight today some customers dont mind spirits gimmicks as long as the fare is cheap "the price was much lower than even jetblue " said jeff markovich of brooklyn n y who paid &# round trip for a recent flight from new yorks la guardia airport to fort lauderdale "i was a little shocked " he added "that they wouldnt give you a glass of water for free " mr baldanza knows that his airlines no frills policies will take some adjustment for customers "we realize were either trendsetters or jerks depending on your view of the world " he said
