pursuits books travels with trumps a bridge novice crosses the country learning about the game and its devotees the backwash squeeze &amp other improbable feats by edward mcpherson harpercollins pages &# the game of contract bridge is to poker as literary fiction is to chick lit the one is erudite charming intelligent and full of redeeming social purpose the other makes all the money poker is less demanding and less sociable than bridge it is easier to learn quicker to play and gives the illusion of hope to those who make up in disposable income what they lack in ability in poker you are not at the mercy of your partners stupidity or your opponents brilliance all that really matters are the odds understand the mathematics of poker and you can succeed at it but at bridge if you believe devotees of the game and i confess i am one to play bridge is to stand at the far golden edge of our civilization bridge is as subtle intelligent complex and challenging as card games get its complexity means that as with literature to appreciate good bridge you have to study a little you need know the essentials and then some and that takes time in "the backwash squeeze &amp other improbable feats " edward mcpherson describes how andrew robson the english international player kicks off a beginners class at his club in london with the most basic of basics "this is a pack of cards heres an ace a king a queen there are four suits and the person sitting opposite you thats your partner " its a long long way from there to the "backwash squeeze " an especially complex line of play that forces your opponent to give up a trick that he would otherwise have made fortunately for us as suggested by his books subtitle "a newcomers journey into the world of bridge" mr mcpherson is an intrepid traveler but first he must choose is he writing a book for those who already understand the game or for those who dont or both it is an invidious but necessary choice in the u s there are about million people who play bridge even those who have not mastered the odds at poker can work out that there are therefore roughly million who dont and yet it is reasonable to assume that members of the former group are more likely to buy a book about bridge they do not need to be told how the game works how then do you write for them without excluding the rest mr mcpherson avoids this particular squeeze by opting for a first person narrative come with me he says i will enter this strange and wonderful world on your behalf all you need do is "trust me for a while " which you may remember was the invitation the spider extended to the fly but mr mcpherson is no scheming predator he is a charming and literate companion and he approaches his task with becoming modesty for novices there is an introduction to the basics it explains that bridge has two parts the first is the auction in which the two pairs of partners compete to decide "the contract " or how many tricks they expect to win by using either a specified trump suit or no trump the second is the play in which one pair tries to make the contract they have agreed upon and the other pair tries to stop them mr mcpherson says that given his thin bridge experience he is ill qualified to write the introduction this is not strictly true it is as good a guide to the basics as i have read and makes the rest of the book intelligible for novices experienced players however are advised to skip the introduction and go straight to chapter one where they will find themselves in a familiar milieu the world of bridge mr mcpherson moves from the manhattan bridge club to tournament play in kansas city mo and gatlinburg tenn and to social bridge in gettysburg pa we spend time with the high rollers at the invitation only million dollar "cavendish" in las vegas and in the rubber bridge clubs of london throughout we meet a cast of the great and the good and the not so great and the definitely not so good of the bridge world it is entertaining stuff in kansas city for example mr mcpherson sneaks away from his familys christmas celebration to spend some time at a bridge tournament kansas city holds a special place in the heart of every bridge player because in when the game was in its infancy it was host to the most famous partnership meltdown in the history of bridge myrtle bennett shot dead her husband john after he had failed to make a contract in four spades the couple was playing at home with friends and had by all accounts drunk a little too much when tempers became frayed mr bennett struck his wife she fetched a gun and despite her husbands attempt to take refuge in the bathroom fired four shots at him two ended up in the wall but two came to rest in mr bennett mrs bennett was later acquitted of murder after a spectacular and widely reported trial mr mcphersons spirited recounting of this story leads him into other stories of bridge and marriage "im proud to be married to my third bridge player " says one woman "bridge has held my interest where some of the men havent " "the backwash squeeze &amp other improbable feats" has two drawbacks the first is that mr mcpherson mistakes his bridge journey as an excuse to indulge occasionally in travel writing as a result some sections of the book particularly the chapters on gatlinburg and las vegas feel padded with extraneous detail do we really need to know that the great smoky mountains national park has "twelve hundred campsites seven hundred miles of streams and eleven picnic grounds" second he too often errs on the side of caution by not explaining some of the more complex plays he witnesses at the cavendish invitational he confesses "i am sitting hairs away from some of the top minds in the game people whose every move is chronicled in newspapers magazines and online and once the round is over i will hardly remember a card they played " but those are the cards we would most like to hear about elmore leonard advises writers to leave out the parts that readers tend to skip by the same token you should put in the bits they really want to read it is frustrating to be told that zia mahmood and steve weinstein two renowned players shared a bridge joke but that it "sailed far over my head " better to tell us the joke or not to mention it at all many characters in the book express concern that the game is "dying " the membership of the american contract bridge league gets older every year not enough young people are coming into the game and yet it survives both in the u s and globally even in our brash celebrity sodden chick lit lite world there is a place for the card game version of literary fiction the official encyclopaedia of bridge lists more than books on the game "the backwash squeeze &amp other improbable feats" is one of the few that can be enjoyed by everyone if you dont play bridge you will learn why you should and if you do you will recognize yourself and think you know what were not as weird as i thought mr balfour is an author and award winning television producer his latest book "vulnerable in hearts a memoir of fathers sons and contract bridge" is published
