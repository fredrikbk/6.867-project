pursuits books five best vartan gregorian praises these biographies of american philanthropists  andrew carnegie by david nasaw penguin every time i think i know all there is to know about andrew carnegie some other fascinating aspect of this complex man is revealed until i read david nasaws deeply detailed biography of the rags to riches steel magnate who essentially invented modern day philanthropy i did not know for example that he supported the progressive income tax and favored substantial levies on inherited fortunes having famously declared "he who dies rich dies disgraced " carnegie proceeded to create more than organizations in the u s and abroad dedicated to advancing knowledge and education rewarding heroes creating pensions for teachers and promoting international peace and other noble goals this scottish immigrant who became a champion of american democracy gave away over of his fortune &# million or tens of billions in todays dollars and built more than libraries when he died in he did not die disgraced  henry clay frick by martha frick symington sanger abbeville the life of henry clay frick industrialist coke magnate and later andrew carnegies partner in the steel business is fascinatingly chronicled in this volume by his great granddaughter martha frick symington sanger in taking a decidedly psychological approach to her subject ms sanger may have explained a mystery that has perplexed fricks past biographers what motivated one of the most notorious of the turn of the century robber barons to begin collecting paintings and other artwork so assiduously according to ms sanger frick grieved his entire life over the death of a daughter in childhood and he found solace in art frick who died in bequeathed his new york mansion a &# million endowment and the best of an extraordinary collection to establish a public gallery with the goal of "encouraging and developing the study of the fine arts " today the institution is known as the frick collection he left only one sixth of his fortune to his family with the rest given to charitable institutions  mellon by david cannadine knopf british historian david cannadine admits that he embarked on the research for a biography of andrew mellon with some ill feeling about his subject he believed mellon to be "an unsympathetic person with unappealing politics " but after being given unfettered access to the financiers papers by the mellon family and foundation mr cannadine seems to have developed a rapt if not always admiring interest in what he terms the "big life" that mellon led a passionate love of art led mellon to amass a magnificent collection including of the hermitages greatest paintings apparently stalin needed the money to advance the soviet economy in mellon deeded the collection to the american people in what mr cannadine calls a philanthropic gift without "precedent or parallel" in the countrys history thus was born the national gallery of art at the time the gift was valued at &# million priceless today in terms of both worth and significance  morgan by jean strouse random house not only a banker but a force in the railroad and steamship industries j p morgan purchased andrew carnegies vast steel empire in he too embarked on an ambitious philanthropic campaign one that seemed at least in part to reflect the times as the th century waned there was a growing trend among wealthy americans to move from amassing private collections to endowing public institutions biographer jean strouse says that the cultured and generous man her study revealed was a surprise "i went into the research essentially looking for the robber baron of popular morgan mythology and eventually found someone very different " like mellon and frick morgan was a great collector of art he became one of the most important benefactors of the metropolitan museum of art and the american museum of natural history and he created the magnificent morgan library along the way it has been pointed out morgan also took the time to collect two wives three yachts four children six houses and assorted mistresses  titan by ron chernow random house ron chernow says that early in his research of the life of the taciturn john d rockefeller he worried that he "was confronting a sphinx " but thanks in part to unprecedented access to millions of documents at the rockefeller archive in sleepy hollow n y mr chernow makes the sphinx speak in this insightful work apparently rockefeller was convinced that after acquiring as much wealth as possible through standard oil he was morally compelled to use his fortune to improve the lot of humanity along with andrew carnegie he helped to define modern philanthropy as a strategic system aimed at finding solutions to long term problems all told rockefeller gave away somewhere around &# million the equivalent of many billions today his many benefactions included creating the rockefeller foundation in which now has assets of &# billion building rockefeller university in new york funding an atlanta college for black women that eventually became spelman college and adding incalculable support to the progress of medical science dr gregorian the president of the carnegie corporation of new york is the author of the autobiography "the road to home" simon &amp schuster and "islam a mosaic not a monolith"
