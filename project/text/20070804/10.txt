doing justice to rawlss legacy in america david lewis schaefers opinion piece on john rawls "justice and inequality " july reminded me of an epiphany i had in college in the late s then as now social justice and inequality were big topics on campus the conventional wisdom was that rawls was right that his nemesis robert nozick was wrong and that "justice as fairness" was the goal to be pursued i proudly carried my thick dog eared copy of rawlss "a theory of justice" under my arm then in an ethics class taught by a well known professor i was asked to write a paper on the lifeboat scenario a thought experiment involving an overcrowded lifeboat entering a storm where it is clear that not all will survive a dedicated rawlsian at the time i decided to apply his theories to the assigned situation but no matter how i construed them his theories kept leading me to the conclusion that the only "fair" result was that everyone in the lifeboat had to die even as a young liberal college student this struck me as an unacceptable result thereafter i spent less time lugging around rawlss volume and looked for a more practical philosophy bruce g paulsen new york kudos to prof schaefer for explicating rawlss economic political methodological moral and philosophical failings i heartily agree that rawlss contribution to american political philosophy boils down to an "outlook detrimental to freedom " we might addend the detriments that his perspective has made to the ideals upon which our nation was founded each of his recommendations entail either the rejection of an ideal or turning it into its opposite take "rights" for example these and particularly inalienable rights are based on the ideals of justice and equality whereby ones rights cannot detract from those of another thus your right to life liberty speech etc does not deprive me of my liberty but rather supports it yet rawlss concept of a "right" necessitates taking what belongs to you and giving it to me today in our politically oriented world taking from the rich and giving to the poor is considered just however our founding fathers recognized this as an instance of usurpation similarly group rights replace individual rights and negate the ideal of equality before the law as rawlss dictums are alive and growing in the body politic the instances of trashing our ideals are endless they are eroding the very fount of our republic and have become a cancer on our civilization allen weingarten ph d monroe township n j prof schaefer is mistaken when he says rawls "left his principles of justice at such an extreme level of generality that they pointed to no specific political conclusions certainly not the ones attributed to them by his followers " it is no accident that rawlss "general ideas" result in marxist policies thirty five years ago ayn rand accurately predicted the logical political consequences of rawlss ideas she had seen their implementation in bolder form under the soviets and recognized their rawlsian transformation getting the public to accept the redistributionism and leveling of marxism by cloaking them in new garb was rawlss aim if anyone wants to understand how we got to a present concept of "equality" that is far from the founders meaning rand will explain it to you such is the power of moral philosophy marsha familaro enright reason individualism freedom institute chicago
