safety "the worry is there will be a cramp in the financial system where nobody can borrow money " says todd clark director of stock trading at san francisco money management and brokerage firm nollenberger capital partners "if theres a true unwillingness to lend thats a self fulfilling prophecy as far as an economic downturn is concerned " boston based hedge fund firm sowood capital said it

mortgage lender stopped taking mortgage applications and laid off the bulk of its staff the stocks of wall street firms were hit and bear stearns held a call with investors friday to try to assuage their concerns amid turmoil in the mortgage market nervous investors and wall street firms continued to back away from many types of home loans a unit of ubs ag emailed a note to mortgage brokers friday saying it wouldnt accept any new loan applications that day "as a result of market volatility " credit suisse told correspondent lenders which originate loans for sale to bigger institutions that it had suspended until further notice all subprime and second lien home loans as well as some loans that give people minimal payment options in the early years novastar financial inc suspended approval and funding of loans offered through brokers "due to severe dislocation" in the market according to a note emailed to partners friday a ubs spokesman said "we fully expect to be accepting applications as usual on monday " credit suisse and novastar couldnt be reached for comment the trouble in subprime mortgages which many wall streeters had hoped would remain contained now is causing investors to reassess risk corporate bonds and other debt instruments have fallen pushing borrowing costs higher yields on high yield or "junk " bonds issued by companies with risky credit ratings have risen making it harder to finance acquisitions private equity takeover deals which often depend heavily on debt have slowed to a trickle in july there were corporate bond issues according to thomson financial the lowest monthly number since with corporate balance sheets in good shape the rise in bond yields and drop in bond issuance doesnt appear to have any economic basis says lou crandall chief economist at wrightson icap rather liquidity funds available for investing has dried up as investors have pulled in their reins "this is still a liquidity event " says mr crandall "but the longer it goes on the more potential it has to have broader repercussions " even though corporate bond yields have risen relative to comparable treasury notes mr crandall points out they are still fairly low on an absolute basis part of the problem is that companies worry that tapping the debt market during such a volatile period could be seen as a sign of desperation so instead they put off their offerings which also means they may put off the things they planned to do with the money many economists had hoped that increased corporate spending would help push the economy along in the latter half of the year august is a notoriously slow month for issuance says arthur tetyevsky chief u s credit strategist for hsbc so its doubtful much will happen this month companies highly dependent on short term financing could be especially at risk aircraft leasing companies such as genesis lease ltd and aircastle ltd for example have seen their stocks fall sharply over the past month

expects to see an "indirect impact" in september when business in general picks up if a few of the high quality deals can get good prices that may "unclog the pipeline " said mr tetyevsky a broader worry is that the economy has become increasingly dependent on financial markets to meet lending needs with lenders slicing and dicing everything from short term corporate loans to auto loans into securities that are then marketed to investors if investors get spooked then the ability of lenders to fund loans may be hampered investors seeking safety push up treasurys another dour summer friday
