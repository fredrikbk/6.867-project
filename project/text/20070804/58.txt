rudycare health care has re emerged as a chief domestic priority for the democrats but the question to date has been where are the republicans one answer came in new hampshire this week where rudy giuliani offered the outlines of his own health care plan and even mentioned the free market the republican presidential candidate got right at the crux of the issue the tax code the health care market is distorted because companies can deduct the costs of insurance but individuals cannot creating "third party" payer problems for the insured and pricing out everyone else mr giuliani suggests a tax deduction of &# for families that buy their own insurance and half that for individuals thus restoring tax parity for health dollars mr giulianis plan would also involve health savings accounts medical malpractice reform and nationalizing the insurance market by his count there are at least state regulations or mandates that increase costs and restrict access hes probably lowballing it the former new york mayors proposal is a marked improvement on former governor mitt romneys mandated coverage approach in massachusetts despite the bush administrations troubles advancing some version of the tax reform approach its an indication of the political appeal of consumer driven health care that the democrats immediately began attacking mr giuliani a spokesman for john edwards decried "tax cuts for millionaires " even though the tax changes mr giuliani suggests would be "universal " which is a principle democrats typically favor in health care coverage so far mr giuliani has only sketched his basic principles but were told a fuller portrait will emerge as his campaign progresses we hope so with democrats poised to offer proposals for more government control of health care the country needs republicans to join the debate see related letter "letters to the editor how to improve health care a pitch for rudycare " wsj aug
