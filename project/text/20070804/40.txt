pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink a cuban summer cooler when in the midst of the elian gonzalez fiasco fidel castro was looking to gin up some favorable press he lavished a banquet on nbcs andrea mitchell at his palace the festivities started with a cocktail hour during which the hard nosed reporter was served "potent mojitos" by the dictator whom she found to be ever so "courtly" and "paternal " no word on when jailed cuban journalists were last treated to the refreshing drink of rum lime juice mint sugar and soda wooing media types isnt the only mileage el maximo lider has gotten out of mojitos as joel millman reported in the wall street journal last december the cuban regime has profitably franchised some bars world wide using the name of a havana restaurant called la bodeguita del medio la bodeguita built its fame in the s with an aggressive celebrity campaign but the celebrity the joint is most associated with today is ernest hemingway who allegedly wrote out on a piece of butcher paper "my mojito in la bodeguita del medio my daiquiri in el floridita " there is no doubt that hemingway drank daiquiris at el floridita but plenty of doubt over whether papa ever stepped foot in la bodeguita let alone penned a paean to its signature drink beyond the question of whether hemingway indulged a preference for mojitos at la bodeguita is an even more fundamental question whether papa drank mojitos at all craig boreth author of "the hemingway cookbook " doubts it the novelist wasnt fond of sugar in his drinks mr boreth argues pointing to the unsweetened frozen lime and grapefruit daiquiris that were hemingways favorite the mojito by contrast is nothing if not sweet just about anyone who went to havana seeking an audience with hemingway over the years soon found himself at la floridita scaling the mountainous double daiquiris that the bar made for papa a e hotchner robert manning and kenneth tynan each joined him in a few nor were jaunts to la floridita reserved for visiting journalists in her memoir daughter in law valerie hemingway tells of the regular family outings to la floridita for double daiquiris but no mojitos "i do not have any evidence that hemingway ever drank that particular cocktail " says hemingway scholar matthew j bruccoli though the university of south carolina professor does allow that "it is a safe generalization that hemingway tried every cocktail ever mixed " if hemingway ever did have a mojito chances are he drank it at havanas sloppy joes prewar exotic drinks maven charles h baker jr includes the mojito in his classic "the gentlemans companion " he found the drink at sloppy joes a touristy bar about which "cubans and snobbish americanos can sneer all they please " baker maintained that though sloppy joes was neither hip nor elite the bar had "better and more varied cocktails suitable to our somewhat exacting taste than any other spot in cuba " when the new york times printed a mojito recipe in the reporter said the drink would be "familiar to habitues of havana especially those who have leaned on the long mahogany bar at sloppy joes " baker describes the mojito he finds there as a "bacardi collins" a tom collins made with rum well yes and no as the drink calls for lime juice rather than the collinss traditional lemon and it adds mint though at sloppy joes the mint was only a garnish not a muddled up component of the cocktail one detail of sloppy joes presentation is worth noting the bar decorated the drink with a long strip of lime peel spiraled down through the glass just like the lemon peel in a horses neck when p j orourke visited havana in he immediately binged on mojitos describing them as being "made by mixing too much sugar with too much rum in not enough soda water and adding crushed mint and lime juice it sounds disgusting " mr orourke writes "and believe me the next morning it is " rum expert wayne curtis wasnt much happier with his recent cuban mojito experience "theres a little secret behind the mojitos you get in havana bars they arent very good " he writes in last years book "and a bottle of rum " he found that mojitos at la bodeguita and other havana bars tasted "as if they had been manufactured in a centralized tall drink facility somewhere beneath the cobblestone streets of old havana then distributed via a rusting pipeline " mr curtis wasnt sure what the problem was but i have my own theory one that centers on la bodeguita del medios peculiar mojito recipe for their book "the worlds best bartenders guide " donald bain and joseph scott solicited a mojito recipe from bodeguita bartender jorge lorenzo viqueira lee who delivered a receipt heavy on the rum and strangely light on the lime juice the oddest part of the process is the very trick that the bartender claims is the secret to the perfect mojito "the magical touch of this cocktail " says mr lee "lies in crushing the tiny branches of mint so as to extract the juice from the stem " if you want to see what this will do for the drink just compare chewing on a piece of mint leaf a bright and happy taste with gnawing on the stalk a nasty experience that will haunt your mouth for days if you avoid crushing the stems of the mint the mojito is a delicious summer drink and one that requires no endorsement from hemingway to be enjoyed in earnest email me at eric felten wsj com
