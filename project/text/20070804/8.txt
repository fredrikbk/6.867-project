cross country smart growth helena ark a walking tour of this mississippi river towns past present and future could start at bubbas blues corner at the south end of cherry street a whisky bottles throw from the mighty river bubba sullivan has a little of everything in his shop including a healthy dose of helena blues history free of charge and old rpm records cents each keep walking past the broken bottles and dilapidated buildings until youre across from the old train depot turn into what looks like a strip mall store that might sell wicker chairs and scented candles or in this town second hand clothes and garage sale trinkets and then welcome to one of the best schools in arkansas maybe the south a school thats so good both candidates for governor last year democrat mike beebe and republican asa hutchinson couldnt utter a sentence on education without mentioning it it is the kipp delta college preparatory school kipp stands for knowledge is power program a brooklyn born system of charter schools nationwide it is filled with kids eager to be there even though the school meets almost all year long and every day but sunday scott shirey runs the place hes years old and a native of massachusetts he filtered through the kipp system and came out to phillips county one of the poorest in the country where he started delta college prep five years ago with students and the support of community leaders desperate for something anything to jumpstart their tired town all else had failed from government handouts to gambling across the river helenas kipp school is working in two ways first its educating the kids an important task for a school dont you think before kipp helenas kids were getting scores around the th percentile in language and th percentile in math on the stanford achievement test only a few years later those same kids are averaging around th and nd respectively last year kipps eighth graders scored in the st percentile in math and the th in language on the sat as fifth graders those same kids scored in the th percentile in both math and language kipp is also helping to revitalize this impoverished area the schools current downtown location was the first new construction in helena in years now that the school has grown to students in grades five through theres talk about expanding actually theres a lot more than talk just last week the national kipp charter school outfit in san francisco named luke vandewalle the principal of the new delta college prep high mr vandewalle an illinois native and graduate of purdue university in indiana is a former member of teach for america for the past three years hes been teaching math at mr shireys school and doing quite a job at last report of the delta college prep students scored proficient or better on arkansass end of course exam in algebra soon to be principal vandewalles high school opens later this month in a renovated train station but maybe not for long led by local investors at southern bancorporation and southern financial partners the community is out to raise &# million for a k delta college prep campus itll consume several blighted blocks of downtown now home to broken liquor bottles crumbling sidewalks and weeds not to mention the abandoned buildings and long abandoned businesses kipp has already secured the land through a grant from the walton family foundation now it has to raise the rest of the money in a state under a court order to fix its public schools there arent many examples of educational excellence but because kipp schools are charter schools they operate free of the bureaucratic baloney that chokes the creativity out of so many traditional public schools and their teachers and delta college prep is a different kind of charter school you notice it right off world map sized posters of students test scores decorate the hallways the way youd see a "go team " banner at a public high school "were comfortable discussing data " mr shirey told me "we aim for absolute transparency " which sharpens the attention of both students and teachers mr shirey notes proudly that hes run off three teachers this year but not many students even though homework runs about two hours a night after a long school day theres a dress code and detailed instructions about how to behave in class right down to when to raise your hand parents and students and teachers all have to sign a "commitment to excellence form" outlining life at delta college prep teachers tend to be young and not from around helena mr shireys staff has included recent graduates from cornell purdue notre dame new york university and spelman still delta preps wyvonne sisk a teacher for years won a &# kinder excellence in teaching award last year ms sisk had retired from teaching in nearby schools but was attracted back to work by this innovative charter school earlier this year the school received a grant from the delta regional authority a federal state partnership devoted to regional economic improvement dra money typically goes to water systems and rail spurs not schools but to quote pete johnson federal co chairman of the dra "as we travel the region were holding up the kipp school and helena as examples of what children can accomplish when you go outside the restraints of the public school system unless you change the educational system in weak counties youre not going to change the counties " for its next act kipp is expected to transform downtown helena technically helena west helena the towns recently consolidated and revitalize the city center while serving as an economic engine for an area with double digit unemployment thats been losing population for decades since phillips county has lost more than half its population down here the goal after graduating high school if you graduate high school is to get out a school transforming a community economically and maybe even emotionally it does sound kind of nutty unless youre here and walking the dilapidated landscape that could be the future home of the kipp campus unless you listen to mr shirey "those would be athletic fields " he says pointing at a vacant lot unless you see the kids at mr shirleys school wearing "there are no shortcuts" t shirts unless you check out those test scores then you think maybe anything is possible even in the delta mr webb is a columnist for the arkansas democrat gazette in little rock
