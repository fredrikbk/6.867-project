pursuits books childrens books the backward day by ruth krauss illustrated by marc simont the new york review pages &# for some reason young children get an absurd kick out of doing things backward or spelling words backward or otherwise behaving contrariwise for comic effect this can be charming but it can pretty quickly get tedious too as any parent will attest who has ever tried to get a straight answer out of a bunch of gleeful children chanting "its opposite day its opposite day " ruth krausss picture book "the backward day" just revived in elegant hardback as part of the new york reviews childrens collection speaks directly to this anarchic impulse in the brief tale a little boy wakes one morning and decides that it is "backward day " so he gets up and puts on his coat then his clothes with his underwear on the outside he puts on his shoes and over them his socks "then he turned his head backward as far as he could to see over his shoulder and he walked backward out of the room and backward down the stairs " the boy arrives at the breakfast table arranges himself backward at his fathers place with a napkin tucked into the back of his collar and waits and heres where readers age may get nervous will the boys parents scold him or will they play along down in turn come his father mother and baby sister "goodnight " the boy greets each of them theres a pause then "goodnight " each replies deadpan and sits down backward in the wrong chair marc simonts appealing drawings reflect not only the formality of the era father wears a suit and tie mother is in a skirt and heels but also the timeless sweetness of a family joke shared
