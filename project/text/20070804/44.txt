pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations spouse rules its gotten catty out there jeri thompson is a trophy wife as is cindy mccain michelle obama is too offhand and irreverent when speaking of her husband and judith giuliani is a puppy stapling princess even hillary clinton was a focus for wearing an outfit that suggested however faintly that underneath her clothing she may be naked and have breasts why these stories because its august and no one wants to think because the campaign is too long and reporters have to write about something because cable news has an insatiable need for guests and if you write a story cable producers can easily find tape for you get to go on olbermann or oreilly and seem to publicize your paper which will please your bosses with the added benefit of giving you personal face time which essentially asserts in the world of high level politics that you exist none of these stories have come from blogs but from pulitzer prize winners at major newspapers and veteran journalists at magazines for all their harrumphing about the crucial role they play in democracy and it is crucial and the seriousness of their professional intent and it is sometimes serious the mainstream media is full of the cattiest human beings in history with the exception of the vast political consulting advising class of washington i e the gargoyles with blackberrys in the back of the suv whose job is not only to help their guy but hurt the other guy their email gossip reminds me of johnny in the movie "airplane " when the frantic wife of a pilot rushes into the control tower johnny solicitously removes her coat and then reveals his actual interests "where did you get that dress " however it is also true the press is paying attention to prospective first ladies because in an age in which presidents are always in your face first ladies are often in your face it actually matters if people like them and it can hurt on the margins if they dont and these days wins are marginal the challenge for the spouses of modern candidates is that what is expected of women in general has changed this is reflected in the first ladys role and the role of the candidates spouse mamie eisenhower was a housewife bess truman so ordinary that she didnt want to live in washington preferring the more normal humans of missouri lady bird johnson lived for lyndon eleanor roosevelt was the exception a groundbreaker but jackie kennedy shivered at the thought of being compared to mrs roosevelt and said jack doesnt want to talk politics when he comes home first ladies were once more or less average and were expected to be now they are accomplished worldly and expected to be candidates for the first ladys job have to find a balance its delicate strong is good aggressive not a person who cares yes a person who pushes an agenda no some old rules apply as the transition from old style to new style continues americans would prefer a first lady who doesnt seem like she ever hungered for it they dont want someone who needs the job they want someone who puts up with it with grace this gets us to laura bush who seems from the beginning to have had no particular desire for the white house she always telegraphs that shed have been happy staying home smoking cigarettes and admiring her family first lady is an elevated title wed rather elevate someone whos making a sacrifice not someone whos grabbing a rung detached good nature goes far from the beginning of her public life mrs bush has operated as if she had an invisible shield around her her own invisible popemobile with thick plastic windows that kept her from getting the gunk on her she never let it touch her "your husband is the savior of mankind" shed smile pleasantly and not let it touch her "your husband is the spawn of satan" shed smile and not let it touch her this took profound discipline some wisdom and perhaps a natural detachment mrs bush should be studied she never attacked rarely defended and only carefully shared connected to this "they do not want your drama they do not want your mess " the presidency is a complicated job since we have to have presidents wed prefer they come with something like domestic peace they dont want unneeded temperament high jinks vanity or acting out if you cant be normal imitate normal just because its true doesnt mean we have to know it we do not want to hear all that much about your relationship we actually do not want you making out in the pages of harpers bazaar on so many issues the unspoken american attitude and not only on the romantic aspects of your life but on most of the private life of their leaders is get a room put your grievances vanity and temperament in it close the door we dont want to think youre a policy maven too deep in the game we dont want to think youre leading the inside movement to get rid of the veep or the spokesman at the same time we like to think and assume that you have views that you share its your job but we want you to know we elected him not you and that you know it this of course was mrs clintons problem she thought it was also about her she took on an extraconstitutional role in the white house ever since shes had to work to overcome the impression made in those days people respect you when it gets out that there are areas of your life that are off limits pierre salinger had to wait until mrs kennedy was out of town on vacation to get the kids in a picture mrs bush has made it clear that her girls deserve a private life the clintons protected chelsea at the same time never say "off limits " forget those words just tell the press guy no and in time everyone will get the message redirect the spotlight there is a famous tv journalist who whenever she is photographed with her husband going to something swell does not walk forward smiling in a beautiful dress instead she pauses and drapes an arm around him subtly redirecting the cameras toward him redirecting the camera is a form of love people like to see love and respect it when they see it is bill clinton an exception of course hes always been an exception thats his history hell never dodge the spotlight if his wife is elected he will speak at conferences and be ambassador to the world will he bring drama and mess yes he brings drama wherever he goes because wherever he goes there he is will he bring the particular drama everyone expects he is officially and forever the rogue if americans hire her as president they will do it knowing he is going to bring his billness with him
