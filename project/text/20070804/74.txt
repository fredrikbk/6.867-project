weekend journal taste the day the music died detroit "a roar went up in the city of detroit " says martha reeves recalling the late afternoon of july when she and the vandellas were getting ready to sing "jimmy mack" at the fox theatre though the song was already a national hit they hadnt yet performed it live in their hometown "i never heard a roar like that before and hope never to hear it again " it was the sound of a riot one that began years ago next week and would become one of the largest and costliest in the nations history the riots immediate spark had been a rough police raid on an illegal drinking and gambling establishment the deeper causes included decades of police abuse and discriminatory labor practices the burning and looting would wipe out most of the commercial streets in black neighborhoods and badly damage many of the residential areas over buildings caught fire people died over were injured and some were arrested businesses and houses were simply abandoned plunging the city into a four decade economic decline now a member of the city council representing downtown ms reeves believes detroit is at last coming back "weve got good development going " she says gesturing out the window of her office overlooking the detroit river "weve got strong economic development bringing in tourists our downtown is clean and safe " over the week that included independence day detroit was full of white suburban looking families attracted by the tigers game against cleveland in the pristine comerica stadium and happily spending money in the nearby hotels restaurants bars and casinos but things are still not the same the riots had propelled one of the greatest black economic engines the country had ever known motown records founded in to eventually depart for los angeles after receiving a taunting phone call that motown would burn to the ground by halloween founder berry gordy moved most operations to a secure office building close to downtown away from the riots he had called "a hurricane of rage " he didnt know it then but motowns great days were actually over gerald posner author of "motown music money sex and power " notes that the year before the riots was motowns best ever over of its releases hit the charts in an industry in which the most successful companies averaged only with more than performing groups nearly all black and nearly all drawn from local public schools motown had plowed an entirely new road to entrepreneurial success as historian suzanne street author of "motown and the cultural politics of detroit " argues motown was the first black owned company to create and produce the musical artistry of its own community and then successfully sell it across racial boundaries never again would black music be categorized as "sepia" or "ebony" to distinguish it from mainstream music smokey robinson and the miracles the temptations the four tops mary wells stevie wonder gladys knight and the pips and of course diana ross and the supremes were local kids who turned motown into "hitsville u s a " as the sign above motowns headquarters read whats more motown accomplished this by deliberately making the most of detroits black assets detroit had the nations first black owned and operated radio station wchb the broadside press one of the first black owned publishing houses the concept east theater one of the first black theater companies in the north and the first african american history museum as well as one of the first african american bookstores this abundance was due in part to so many black detroiters being comfortably middle class black workers were grossly discriminated against in the automobile industry but they still made far more money than in the rural south from which so many came and their salaries paid them enough to buy houses in fine old neighborhoods giving detroit the largest black homeownership rate in the country and detroit had excellent public schools that provided classical training in music and art notes gerald early author of "one nation under a groove motown and american culture " "motown came about because black urban life had reached a certain level of self sufficiency and entrepreneurial achievement " says mr early now a professor of modern letters at washington university in st louis "the achievement was based on excellent racially segregated schools that promoted the classics and churches where there was a lot of playing of mozart and handel " at her northeastern high school graduation in ms reeves sang a mozart alleluia much of detroits achievement was simply wiped out in the riots as ms street notes black record shops and bookstores were burned despite soul brother signs in the windows few small black businesses had insurance so they closed forever the middle class simply left and detroits institutional structures could not survive its departure however polished downtown looks today detroits neighborhoods are another story retail activity never returned even years later what should be commercial streets combine empty lots with detroits peculiar triumvirate of gas stations dollar stores and check cashing outlets plus "party" liquor stores on prime corners and so much vacant land is available that with official city support a group called urban farming has planted hundreds of acres in the former riot areas most of the public housing where so many motown stars grew up has been demolished the brewster towers where all four original supremes lived in what theyve described as clean safe housing had been among the first projects in the country built for african americans in her autobiography supreme mary wilson wrote that when her family took an apartment there in "i felt like i just moved into a park avenue skyscraper " but today brewster is considered unsalvageable most buildings have been closed leaving the grounds to be patrolled by drug dealers and pit bulls and indeed detroits crime remains at frightening levels with murders last year detroits homicide rate was per residents over five times the national average with car thefts it had a rate times the national average when asked about radical h rap browns contention that her famous song "dancing in the street" was meant to inspire rioters ms reeves retorts "marvin gaye wrote that song to quench riots not to incite them he didnt mean to instill anything but love " forty years later detroit has still not recovered from the riots or what historian peter benjaminson calls the spiritual blow of motowns defection where has the love gone ms vitullo martin is a senior fellow at the manhattan institute
