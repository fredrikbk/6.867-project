the secrets of the worlds richest man mexicos carlos slim makes his billions the old fashioned way monopolies mexico city carlos slim is mexicos mr monopoly its hard to spend a day in mexico and not put money in his pocket the year old tycoon controls more than companies he says hes "lost count" in telecommunications cigarettes construction mining bicycles soft drinks airlines hotels railways banking and printing in all his companies account for more than a third of the total value of mexicos leading stock market index while his fortune represents of the countrys annual economic output at his height john d rockefellers wealth was equal to of u s gross domestic product as one mexico city eatery jokes on its menu "this restaurant is the only place in mexico not owned by carlos slim " mr slims fortune has grown faster than any in the world during the past two years rising by more than &# billion to about &# billion currently while the market value of his stake in publicly traded companies could decline at any time at the moment he is probably wealthier than bill gates whom forbes magazine estimated at &# billion last march this would mark the first time that a person from the developing world held the top spot since forbes started tracking the wealthy outside the u s in the s "its not a competition " mr slim said in a recent interview fiddling with an unlit cuban cigar in a second story office decorated with th century mexican landscape paintings a relatively modest man who wears ties from his own stores the mogul says he doesnt feel any richer just because he is wealthier on paper how did a mexican son of lebanese immigrants rise to such heights by putting together monopolies much like john d rockefeller did when he developed a stranglehold on refining oil in the industrial era in the post industrial world mr slim has a stranglehold on mexicos telephones his telefonos de mexico sab and its cellphone affiliate telcel have of all fixed lines and of all cellphones as mr rockefeller did before him mr slim has accumulated so much power that he is considered untouchable in his native land a force as great as the state itself the portly mr slim is a study in contradiction he says he likes competition in business but blocks it at every turn he loves talking about technology but doesnt use a computer and prefers pen and paper he hosts everyone from bill clinton to author gabriel garcia marquez at his mexico city mansion but is provincial in many ways doesnt travel widely and proudly says he owns no homes outside of mexico in a country of soccer fans he likes baseball he roots for the sports richest team the new york yankees admirers say the hard charging mr slim an insomniac who stays up late reading history and has a fondness for reading about ghengis khan and his deceptive military strategies embodies mexicos potential to become a latin tiger his thrift in both his businesses and personal life is a model of restraint in a region where flamboyant latin american business tycoons build lavish corporate headquarters and fly to africa on hunting jaunts to critics however mr slims rise says a lot about mexicos deepest problems including the gap between rich and poor the latest u n rankings place mexico at out of nations measured in terms of equality during the past two years mr slim has made about &# million a day while a fifth of the country gets by on less than &# a day "its like the u s and the robber barons in the s only slim is rockefeller carnegie and j p morgan all rolled up into one person " says david martinez a mexican investor who lives in manhattan monopolies have long been a feature of mexicos economy but in the past politicians acted as a brake on big business to ensure that the business class didnt threaten their power but political control faded in the s with the privatization of much of the economy and the slow death of the institutional revolutionary party which held power for years until "it is surprising how big companies have captured the mexican state this is a risk to our democracy and is suffocating our economy " says eduardo perez motta the countrys antitrust chief as the face of the new elite mr slim presents an acute challenge for the countrys young president felipe calderon he must decide whether to try and rein in mr slim despite the moguls standing as the countrys largest private employer and taxpayer congress routinely kills legislation that threatens his interests and his firms account for a chunk of the nations advertising revenue making the media reluctant to criticize him during the past few months mr calderon has looked to cut a backdoor deal with mr slim in a series of face to face meetings the details of which have surfaced for the first time the president has tried to convince mr slim to accept greater competition according to people familiar with the talks the government holds an important card mr slim cant offer video on his network a big potential market without government approval but even some within mr calderons camp privately say the closed door talks play into mr slims hands by letting him circumvent the countrys regulators underscoring the weakness of mexicos democratic institutions unless mr calderon extracts big concessions from the mogul they say he may become too powerful to control for his part mr slim says that his companies are "in constant contact" with regulators but played down the notion of a secret negotiation a talkative man who is generally avuncular but who can easily lose his temper mr slim rejects the monopolist label "i like competition we need more competition " he says sipping a diet coke he stressed that many of his companies operate in competitive markets and pointed out that mexico accounts for only a third of sales at his cellphone company america movil sab which has clients from san francisco to sao paolo mr slims strategy has been consistent over his long career buy companies on the cheap whip them into shape and ruthlessly drive competitors out of business after mr slim got control of telmex in he quickly cornered the market for copper cables used by telmex for telephone wires he bought one of the two main suppliers and made sure telmex didnt buy any cable from the other big supplier eventually prompting the owners to sell the company to him his control of mexicos telephone system has slowed the nations development while telephones have long been standard in any american home only about of mexican homes have them only of mexicans have broadband access mexican consumers and businesses also pay above average prices for telephone calls according to the organization for cooperation and economic development mr slim agrees that many industries in mexico are dominated by big companies but he sees no harm as long as they offer good service and prices "if a beer in mexico costs peso and in the u s it costs pesos then i dont see the problem " he says despite countless measures over the years that show his companies charge high prices mr slim steadfastly rejects that notion during an interview he orders an aide to fetch his own telephone bills "see we charge &# per month for basic phone rental cheaper than the u s " he says pulling up a seat next to the reporter that may be so but additional fees in mexico make most phone bills more expensive than in the u s mr slims total phone bill at his own house was a whopping &# last month "i have a lot of maids and my sons make calls " he says mr slim says his success comes from spotting opportunity early something he learned in part from reading futurist writer alvin toffler who wrote the best seller "future shock" in the s and who sends the mogul manuscripts to review pulling a dog eared copy of mr tofflers last book "revolutionary wealth " mr slim leafs through it and shows off his comments in the margins "some of his numbers were out of date " he mutters mr toffler says he first met mr slim on a trip to mexico in mr slim approached him after a speech surrounded by his family and carrying one of mr tofflers books heavily underlined the two have been friends ever since "if you didnt know he was the richest guy in the world youd just think he was a likeable and intelligent guy " says mr toffler the fifth of six children mr slim was born wealthy his father julian slim made his fortune on a general store in downtown mexico city called "the orient star " his father died when mr slim was only early on mr slim showed an aptitude for numbers that would help his career he taught algebra at mexicos largest public university while finishing his thesis titled "applications of linear theory in civil engineering " his love of numbers also drew him to baseball a lifelong hobby "in baseball numbers talk " he once wrote even today he enjoys discussing baseball telling a reporter that slugger barry bonds should be remembered more for his walk ratio than his home runs after college mr slim and some friends became stockbrokers in the country"s fledgling market trading by day and playing dominoes by night the clique became known as "los casabolseros " or "the stock market boys " despite the success friends say mr slim less of a party boy and more private than the rest wanted to run companies rather than trade "he never liked money as much as the rest of us he just wanted to be a good businessman " says enrique trigueros one of the casabolseros mr slim soon got his chance after turning around a soft drink company and a printing firm in the late s and mid s he made his first big move in buying a big stake in mexicos second biggest tobacco company cigatam maker of marlboro cigarettes in mexico the company generated the cash mr slim needed to go on a buying spree a good time to buy came in a year that would shape mr slims destiny that year the collapsing price of oil threw mexico into a tailspin when departing president jose lopez portillo nationalized mexicos banks the traditional business elite feared the country was becoming socialist and ran for the exits companies were selling for as little as of their book value mr slim picked up dozens of leading firms for bargain basement prices a move that paid off when the economy recovered in the following years he bought mexicos largest insurer seguros de mexico for &# million today the company is worth at least &# billion "countries dont go broke " an unflappable mr slim told friends at the time indeed mr slim always says his inspiration to invest during the downturn came from his father who bought out his partner in their general store during the worst days of the mexican revolution a bet that made his father a fortune when the fighting ended mr slim still spots good values from to he amassed a stake in bankrupt carrier mci later selling it to verizon communications corp for &# billion "he has never overpaid for anything " says hector aguilar camin a historian and friend while the pair were on holiday in venice mr slim once haggled with a store owner for several hours to get a &# discount on a tie despite his abilities many here believe his biggest break was the rise to power in of carlos salinas a harvard educated technocrat bent on modernizing the country the two men had struck up a friendship in the mid s and mr salinas spoke of mr slim as the countrys brightest young businessman local wags dubbed the pair "carlos and charlies " after a popular local restaurant chain under mr salinas hundreds of state companies were sold including telmex in mr slim together with southwestern bell and france telecom won the bid over one of his closest friends roberto hernandez who got together with gte corp mr hernandez later suggested the auction was rigged something both mr slim and mr salinas have long denied regardless of whether there was favoritism in the sale of telmex the privatization process created a new class of super rich in mexico in the country had two billionaires on the forbes list by at the end of mr salinass six year term there were the richest of them all was mr slim in retrospect it is easy to see why messrs slim and hernandez considered telmex a prize worth losing their friendship although countries like brazil and the u s broke up state monopolies into a number of competing firms mexico sold its monopoly intact barring competition during the first six years and while countries like the u s initially barred local "baby bell" carriers from offering long distance and cellular service in their same area telmex got to do all three at once and across the entire country indeed it won the only nationwide cellular telephone concession while rivals had to settle for concessions that were limited to certain regions when competition was allowed in long distance foreign carriers were limited to a minority stake in the fixed line business mexico didnt even bother to set up a telephone regulator until three years after the sale dan crawford was one of those who took on mr slim and lost in the california native became chief operating officer of avantel a long distance company partly owned by mci and the bank of mr hernandez mr slims erstwhile friend avantel spent around &# billion building a new network but it soon ran into trouble trying to connect to telmexs network something it needed to complete calls to and from telmex clients telmex executives simply ignored phone calls or failed to turn up for meetings mr crawford recalls when telmex did connect the calls nearly a year later the price was so high that avantel paid cents of every dollar it made to mr slims company according to mr crawford when avantel took telmex to court for monopolistic practices telmex responded by asking a judge to issue an arrest warrant for avantels top lawyer in mexico luis mancera on trumped up charges mr crawford says mr slim confirms the story but says a telmex lawyer acted rashly and that the judicial proceeding was dropped mr mancera declined to comment "slim is very aggressive " says mr crawford who recently retired from mci avantel eventually defaulted on its debts in much of which were scooped up by mr slim and later sold for a profit avantel was sold recently to another mexican firm for &# million a fraction of what it invested in mexico for his part mr slim says avantel and others mistakenly focused on the long distance market which was in decline rather than wireless which was growing it hasnt been much easier taking on mr slim in the wireless market either in spains telefonica sa began selling handsets at a loss here to build market share but it soon realized that tens of thousands of phones were purchased but never used according to a case currently at mexicos antitrust agency telefonica says that telcel distributors bought the phones to keep them off the market in some cases swapping the phones existing chip with their own and reselling the handset when asked about this practice mr slim says "it could be that happens to all of us if you sell something for &# or &# that costs &# someones going to buy it " his spokesman and son in law arturo elias says the distributors acted without telcels knowledge attempts to regulate mr slims companies have largely failed over the years mexicos telephone regulator cofetel was so weak in the s that telmexs rivals dubbed it "cofetelmex " when the regulator did try to act mr slims lawyers blocked it in the countrys byzantine courts the telmex chief also had friends in high places vicente fox mexicos first opposition president when he won in tapped a former telmex employee pedro cerisola to be his minister of communications and transport during his tenure mr cerisola rarely moved against telmex say executives from rival telephone companies mr cerisola declined to comment using money from his telephone empire mr slim has expanded into latin american markets as well as new industries in mexico his cellphone company america movil has million customers and operates in more than a dozen latin american nations in mexico he has focused on industries that depend on government contracts his new construction company ideal sab is currently bidding to run some of mexicos biggest highways his new oil services company recently built the countrys biggest oil platform some of mexicos business leaders say in private that they feel mr slim has grown too greedy the death of his wife soumaya from kidney disease in left him without an anchor says mr trigueros mr slims friend from his stockbroker days "she was a special woman the kind who keeps a guy in line nowadays he only has business to think about " he says mr slims empire is so vast here now that doing business without him can be difficult two years ago hutchison port holdings and u s railroad union pacific teamed up to bid on a &# billion port and railway in baja california to compete with long beach port but mr slim felt the project had been arranged behind closed doors and was against the idea of the countrys biggest project going to foreigners he made his feelings known to the baja california governor and the project was stalled mr slim has since worked to put together a rival consortium which includes mexican rail company grupo mexico and u s railroad burlington northern he says his potential bid is a better option for the country because the railroad will run along mexicos north and help spur development union pacific and hutchison both declined to comment mr slim has recently given more money to philanthropy but he has often said his most important legacy is his family in a few years after heart surgery he put his sons and sons in law in charge of his businesses he also started a group called "fathers and sons" that invites latin american billionaires and their heirs for annual meetings where they sip fine wines and attend seminars like "how to run a family business " there is no obvious successor to the patriarchs empire that gives some mexican officials hope that one day the state can regulate his companies says one high ranking official "when slim dies we can finally regulate his kids "
