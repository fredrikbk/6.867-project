pursuits sports golf journal the worst people to play with from the chatterer to the endless practicer the golfers who can spoil a round maybe its just me but this summer i seem to have been paired with a lot more irritating golfers than usual the worst was the nonstop chatterer i got stuck with in a local competition last month some nonstop chatterers will happily talk about anything baseball the weather french cheeses they are only mildly irritating because you can always walk down the other side of the fairway and the content of their chatter doesnt get into your head this guy however felt compelled to narrate every shot by everyone in our threesome even if you hit from the far side of the next fairway over hed wait for you to return and then explain what you had done "looked like you caught that one a little thin " he couldnt have been a nicer guy i think he thought he was being helpful even sympathetic one time as he watched one of my tee shots drift left toward the out of bounds markers he said "get right get right " this may seem like a supportive thing to say but when its your ball in the air and you know its not drifting its hooking hard and is irreversibly bound to end up far far left of the white stakes for a certain stroke and distance penalty its difficult to perceive such a comment as being helpful or sympathetic in any way functionally its the same as if he had observed "wow your shot is headed left out of bounds way left " the response that immediately occurs is to wrap the club that hit the shot around the commentators neck much of what makes people annoying on the golf course is what makes people annoying anywhere bad manners self centeredness stupidity but usually the general atmosphere of fun around golf tempers the buzz killing effect of even the biggest jerks whom you usually only have to put up with once for four or five hours thats better than at the office where you sometimes have to tolerate nearby cubicle twits for years at a time still there are certain types of people and behaviors that can ruin even the most promising round a lot of them have to do with slow play i wrote a previous column sticking up for people who like to play at a deliberate pace enjoying the game while not being hounded by people whos only purpose seems to be to play as fast as humanly possible but there are limits my vote for the no most annoying golfer is the guy who never seems ready to hit when its his turn sometimes you spot him still in his cart regaling someone with a lame joke other times he may be in the general vicinity of his ball absent mindedly watching everyone else hit but he hasnt made any preparations for his own shot he reminds me of those little old ladies at the store who wait until all their groceries have been bagged before even thinking about digging for their change purse and counting out what they owe typically &# the second most annoying species of slow player is the pseudo pro subspecies a makes a dozen or more careful practice swings before stepping up to the ball and topping it subspecies b paces off exact distances tosses grass to test the breeze and hitches up his pants like arnold palmer before stepping up to the ball and topping it subspecies c does both often adding an elaborate over the ball waggle routine its not the bad golf per se that makes these players annoying its their obliviousness both to the insufficiency of their skills and the burning fuses of everyone around them bad golfers with great attitudes those who refuse to get discouraged no matter how many dreadful shots they hit are especially exasperating anyone who has ever watched a hacker chip back and forth across a green three times and then carefully line up his fourth attempt knows what i mean i also have trouble playing with happy go lucky golfers who dont buy into the illusion that anything much about golf matters they dont keep score wont wager and seem out there just to have a good time playing a round with one of these characters makes me feel like a fool for even bothering to line up a putt extremely annoying another bete noire of mine is complainers particularly those like sergio garcia after last months british open who whine that everybody else gets the good luck never them sometimes these grumblers simply fail to appreciate the difference between say a nine handicap and a handicap three or four times during a round with actuarial precision the formers drive will end up in the fairway or first cut while the latters will end up in the rough possibly not far away the latter will nearly always attribute this to bad luck at other times however the complaints can be more neurotic several years ago i played with a low handicapper who seriously maintained that a certain foot tree the one that had swatted down his drive on an early hole hadnt been there the week before the black cloud of his anger hovered over our group for the rest of the round the lesson i guess is that when it comes to annoyance the annoyee is often just as much the problem as the annoyer a character in one of p g wodehouses marvelous stories claimed to have been distracted before a poor shot by "the uproar of butterflies in an adjoining meadow " i doubt those butterflies were really very loud its all just a matter of coping email me at golfjournal wsj com
