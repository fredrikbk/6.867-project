samsung plant woes unlikely to hurt electronics industry seoul south korea a power malfunction that halted production at six of samsung electronics co s semiconductor factories hurt a budding recovery in the companys chip business but isnt likely to disrupt the broader electronics industry the company estimated the economic damage would come to about billion won or some &# million in the second quarter operating profit for samsungs chip business fell to about &# million its lowest quarterly result since but executives had forecast a strong recovery for the current quarter because of an increase in component prices from seasonal demand for electronics products a spark at a power transformer attached to a samsung factory in suburban seoul resulted in a shutdown at that plant and five others nearby friday afternoon samsung hoped to resume production at the factories saturday or sunday a spokeswoman said but late friday company officials couldnt set a precise time for restoration of production at the facilities the six affected factories account for about one third of samsungs daily output of chips valued at &# million and the company will lose production time in these in addition a large portion of the chips that were being produced in those plants are likely to be unusable samsung could face a disruption of several days because of the need to clean equipment containing chemicals whose temperatures fell below required levels after the power was cut off "the chemicals can stick to equipment if the temperature isnt maintained " said c w chung semiconductor analyst at lehman brothers in seoul any long term disruption would drive up prices for memory chips and interrupt the production of products that use samsung chips but analysts said that was unlikely to happen since the samsung plants werent hurt by fire or damaged structurally five of the affected lines produced memory chips for personal computers and nand memory chips for digital music players digital cameras and other devices the sixth line produced logic chips which handle more advanced tasks for electronic devices samsung is the worlds leading maker of pc memory and nand memory chips but a relatively small producer of logic chips samsung operates factories in the neighboring cities of giheung and hwaseong about miles south of seoul this site is the densest collection of chip plants in the world and also includes a research complex and a training center samsung also has two chip factories in austin texas samsungs korean factories are far more concentrated than those of other major chip producers such as intel corp and texas instruments inc which spread their factories over many locations that bring efficiencies but also means samsung is more susceptible to incidents that affect a single area
