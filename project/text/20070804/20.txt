hot topic bridges to somewhere the cause of wednesdays bridge collapse in minneapolis isnt yet known but that hasnt stopped the tragedy from reigniting the debate over the condition of u s "infrastructure " which has to be the ugliest word in the english language its even uglier when congress and the building lobby use it as an excuse to spend more without rethinking their own contributions to the problem nobody denies that our roads and bridges are feeling the stress of age more drivers and heavier truckloads its possible that the i w bridge collapse over the mississippi was the result of such stress specifically from the bridges underwater supports having eroded according to the reason foundation a font of information and good sense on transportation issues nearly u s highway bridges were deficient in thats nearly one in four across america minnesota notably was fifth best among the states with only of its bridges deemed deficient rhode islands highway crossings were in the worst shape with reported to be deficient when a state racks up that kind of performance its politicians are a lot worse than "deficient " according to reason states had a bridge deficiency rate of or higher this doesnt mean theyre about to collapse but it does signal the need for repair and eventual replacement see www reason org the hair trigger political impulse from states and capitol hill alike is that this means the feds need to spend more money but its hardly the case that taxpayers have been stingy in the five year highway cost &# billion by it was up to &# billion and in a republican congress agreed to spend &# billion and would have spent far more had president bush not threatened a veto what matters as much as the amount however is the pattern of such spending and you will not be surprised to learn that along with greater highway spending came more congressional earmarks what the members giveth they also taketh for themselves in the highway bill there were all of earmarks a decade later there were and by the earmarks had multiplied to or nearly of total spending alaska alone received earmarks in the highway bill worth &# million to put a sharp point on the matter of spending priorities the &# million in emergency appropriations now flying through congress for minnesota is slightly more than half the amount appropriated to alaska for the "bridge to nowhere" and "don youngs way " two of the more infamous earmarks from the bill a main problem with these earmarks is that they often supersede the more urgent repair and replacement needs identified by state and local officials earmarked funds in past highway bills would go unspent because the vanity projects were unwanted and typically require some state matching funds a full five years after the transportation bill for example no less than of its earmarked money was still unspent because states had more urgent priorities for their share of the spending by of the &# billion in earmarks from the highway bill had gone unspent we cant report the same numbers for the and highway bills because the federal transportation department stopped disclosing the figures lest it embarrass members of congress some new thinking is in order as steve malanga argues nearby privatized road and bridge projects can be good for drivers and taxpayers alike congress also needs to return power to the states to set priorities twenty five years ago with the interstate highway system nearly complete ronald reagan proposed just that let the feds maintain the interstates and return the rest of the gas tax revenue to the states to use as they saw fit states can make politically motivated mistakes too but more local spending less cynically allocated combined with private investment is far more likely than current habits to replace bridges before they collapse
