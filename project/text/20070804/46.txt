pursuits leisure &amp arts sightings shakespeare the relevant actors and directors keep reminding us that the bards works never grow old new york what do you get out of seeing king lear or macbeth over and over again in different versions " a friend asked me recently it was a perfectly serious question one id never thought to ask myself perhaps because the answer seemed obvious only it isnt it happens that ive reviewed five different productions of "lear" since becoming the journals drama critic in one was great one very good one dullish one bad and one excruciatingly awful and all were completely different the actors shakespeare project of boston that was the great one performed "lear" on a bare bones set that looked as though it had been blown into the theater by a hurricane chicagos goodman theatre that was the awful one turned it into a hyper politicized parable of late capitalism whose opening scene was set in a mens room in between these extremes were a mesopotamian "lear " a th century "lear " and an uncategorizably silly "lear" set in what looked like the stairwell of a modern art museum the only thing these five productions had in common was that the same words were spoken by the actors yet each of them even the awful one was so brusquely immediate in its impact that it might have come straight off the front page of todays tabloids recall if you will what happens in "king lear" a half senile patriarch signs away his property to a pair of greed crazed daughters who throw him out of the house as soon as the ink dries on the deeds of trust stunned he loses his mind shortly followed by his life wasnt katie couric telling you about that just the other day so heres my question if a play like "lear" lends itself to such diverse and contemporary approaches why is its author so widely derided in certain progressive minded circles as a dead white european male who has nothing of interest to say about the way we live now i was moved to ask this question by reading roger scrutons new book "culture counts faith and feeling in a world besieged" encounter &# its a ringing defense of western culture penned by a philosopher who believes that the combined challenges of multiculturalism and radical islam have caused western intellectuals to suffer a severe identity crisis in it mr scruton observes that many educators in america and england are "angry at the traditional works of our culture seeing them as mere survivals of patriarchal aristocratic bourgeois or theocratic attitudes that no longer have a claim on us " to this cry of rage he offers the following retort "only a very shallow reading of chaucer or shakespeare would see those writers as endorsing the societies in which they lived or would overlook the far more important fact that their works hold mankind to the light of moral judgment and examine with all the love and all the pity that it calls for the frailty of human nature it is precisely the aspiration towards universal truth towards a gods eye perspective on the human condition that is the hallmark of western culture " i quote mr scruton at length because i couldnt say it better myself moreover his unapologetic apologia for the bard struck me all the more forcibly now that i see dozens of shakespeare performances all over the country each season it never fails to astonish me when shakespeares plays are dismissed as irrelevant insufficiently cutting edge even horror of horrors conservative to see as much shakespeare as i do is to realize that there has never been an artist who was more relevant in the sense that his work lends itself to a multiplicity of up to the minute treatments some to be sure are ridiculous while others distort the plays they purport to illuminate to use a play like "henry v" as a stick with which to beat the bush administration as mark wing davey did in his crudely reductive shakespeare in the park production is to misunderstand the purpose of great art still the fact that such distortions are possible is itself a perverse tribute to shakespeares protean genius more often than not im amazed by how actors and directors keep on thinking of imaginative new ways to remind the rest of us that his plays like all the true classics of western art are permanently contemporary this doesnt mean they have to be done with a straight face of course last week i reviewed the hudson valley shakespeare festivals production of "as you like it " which was staged in the style of a low budget western me i loved it but would it have passed muster with roger scruton perhaps not i suspect though that even mr scruton would agree that part of shakespeares genius lies in the miraculous fact that his plays can be turned on their heads by irreverent performers yet remain ever and always themselves and ever and always relevant even with six shooters mr teachout the journals drama critic writes "sightings" every other saturday and blogs about the arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com
