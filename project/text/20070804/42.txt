pursuits food &amp drink wine notes in the years we have been writing our tastings column which appears on fridays we have received thousands of questions about wine from readers in this column we answer some questions that touch on common themes we have edited the questions for space if you have a question drop us a note at wine wsj com be sure to include your full name city and state finding work in the wine business i recently graduated from pacific university outside of portland ore at commencement the speaker talked about following our passions even if it means working interning free to get there so in oregon where would a recent college graduate find a respected winery to perhaps work intern for matt leady forest grove ore we are often asked about jobs in the wine industry because were in the journalism business and not the wine business were not the best source of information on this wed suggest schmoozing with a local wine merchant winemaker and wine distributor in addition thanks to the internet looking for jobs in the wine industry and elsewhere has gotten easier heres one place to start go to wineinstitute org and search on "jobs " which will give you a nationwide roundup of various wine job web sites you could also check out the job boards for the local colleges and universities with a viticulture program such as www chemeketa edu aboutus locations eola ijobs html beware many who work in the industry say its much sexier from the outside looking in its a tough business and the beauty of whats in the bottle obscures the hard unpleasant work that goes into it we applaud people who follow their passion its why we became journalists and wed give you the same advice wed give someone looking for any job do your research know what a winery produces and what its proudest of before you contact it and read books the new best seller "the house of mondavi the rise and fall of an american wine dynasty " by wall street journal writer julia flynn siler would be one good place to start a surprise from an aged riesling i was rooting around my wine cellar and found a bottle i had long forgotten about it was a fetzer vineyards echo ridge johannisberg riesling i dont imagine that it cost very much i thought it might be just so so after six years but imagine my surprise when i opened it it had matured to a deep yellow full bodied truly wonderful wine that reminded me of some of the expensive good german spatlese rieslings i have tasted over the years are rieslings supposed to mature so well armando favazza columbia mo there is something magical about a wine that is well aged by accident and is thus a complete surprise many wine lovers we know including us have had that experience our sense is that most people dont age whites and this is a shame because some and good riesling is an example gain depth and complexity as they age more broadly wed urge anyone who enjoys wine to lose some wines in the back of the closet you just might be surprised especially with inexpensive wines like that fetzer there is little downside and a lot of upside potential many years ago we laid down some inexpensive california reds from louis martini a long time later they were a treat tasting so much more expensive than what we paid for them do by the glass drinkers miss out when were out to dinner my wife and i tend to order wines by the glass rather than by the bottle except on special occasions where well pick a special bottle i like to experiment and my wife prefers the familiar we tend to frequent restaurants that put a lot of attention into their wine so there are typically good and freshly opened options for each of us there is also far less risk of springing for an entire bottle that turns out to be disappointing im wondering though if you think were missing something by not ordering bottles will miner denver were with you when we are at a restaurant that has a good by the glass list and where were sure the wines are just opened or carefully preserved after opening we enjoy ordering by the glass with the added caveat that the by the glass price isnt outrageous we can experiment with more wines that way sometimes we each order a different chardonnay so we can taste them against each other and we can also pair each course more carefully this is one way weve always tried new wines especially some that are only available at restaurants wed also urge you to check out the half bottle list more fine wine is being packaged in half bottles and more fine restaurants offer them the only downside many very good or very unusual wines are not offered by the glass so they have to be ordered by the bottle at a restaurant in washington d c recently for instance we ordered a bottle of viognier from uruguay we would have preferred to order a glass because we knew it was chancy but we understand why the restaurant didnt offer it by the glass because really we cant imagine there is overwhelming demand for a glass of uruguayan viognier it was an interesting experience but for now well stick with uruguays tannat melanie grayce west contributed to this column
