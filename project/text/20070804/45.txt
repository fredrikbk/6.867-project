pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece entranced by a cabbage a jadeite sculpture of a bok choy achieves cult status anatomy of a classic taipei there are many grievances between mainland china and what it likes to call the "renegade province" of taiwan but in the art world there is only one the national palace museum standing on a hilltop in the center of the capital city the museum houses hundreds of thousands of exquisite art objects from chinas imperial courts brought here by chiang kai shek when he fled the communists in the most famous masterpiece in this contentious place however isnt an elaborate scroll a landscape painting or a heavy piece of jewelry rather its a little bok choy cabbage made of jadeite hardly larger than a human hand the jadeite cabbage is a perfect carving made out of an imperfect cracked stone sculpted by an anonymous artist it measures only inches long by inches wide by inches deep the museums presentation displays the piece to its greatest effect at the center of a large darkened room glistening in a glass case the cabbages dark green leaves furl around a katydid and a locust and the stalk pales into a translucent white two pale green bugs rest lightly on its leaves this simple cabbage is a masterpiece first because it stands apart from a long tradition of idealized perfection in jade carving a jade masterwork is typically flawless cut from a stone without cracks or variations in color the piece of jadeite from which the cabbage is carved however is not only fraught with cracks but also boasts cloudy opaque patches which are visible in the white part of the cabbages stalk its also a relatively young work jadeite was introduced to china only at the end of the th century during the reign of the qianlong emperor earlier jade was made from the nephrite variety which is similar to but slightly less vividly colored than jadeite the physical realization of the cabbage was also no mean feat jade is among the hardest stones in the world to work it the cabbages creator had to painstakingly grind away using the sand of even harder rocks like rubies or garnets theres none of the chiseling associated with carving marble for example that makes the two bugs with their reaching antennae and their long spindly legs that stand unsupported especially remarkable achievements the cabbage boasts more than just artistic aesthetic value however its journey to the national palace museum also traces the history of the fall of imperial china its last known owner imperial consort jin fei probably received the cabbage as a dowry present on her wedding to emperor guangxu in the cabbage was likely meant as an allegory of female virtue its dazzling white stalk symbolizing purity the deep green leaves fertility and abundance and the two bugs children consort jin was expected as were the emperors other two wives to produce heirs to the imperial throne the masterwork didnt bring luck however not only did consort jin bear no children neither of the emperors other wives did either she also lived through the dark last days of the qing dynasty as the imperial court disintegrated and warlord factions feuded over beijing her younger sister zhen fei also an imperial concubine is believed to have been killed on the orders of empress dowager cixi consort jin passed away in shortly before the imperial family was completely expelled from the forbidden city at that time beijing was ruled by a warlord faction and all of the objects inside the forbidden city were placed under the control of a committee in charge of qing dynasty affairs which oversaw the transformation of beijings forbidden city into a public museum the museum opened in but its lifespan was short the kuomintang captured beijing in and then japan invaded china in as the imperial armys soldiers neared beijing the museum curators packed the forbidden city collection into about crates the kuomintang army moved them first to beijing then to shanghai then to nanjing later the collection was split among various cities farther inland after japan was defeated china descended into civil war between the kuomintang and the communist peoples liberation army beaten back into southern china the kuomintang selected about crates worth of the most valuable imperial artifacts and shipped them to taiwan in those artworks formed the core of taiwans national palace museum which was opened in in a building just outside taipei built specifically to house the objects the jade cabbage has always had a special place in the hearts of museum visitors but it was not until recently that curators bowed to the crowds wishes and displayed it in a larger viewing space there under the bright lights the artists genius is in full flower rather than let the stones flaws be a deterrent the artist worked them masterfully into his design using cracks in the jade as leaf edges the jades "cloudy" patches where the white stone is less translucent mimics the way that frost can change the texture of a vegetable after freezing explains chang li tuan the curator of the collection the sculptor also incorporated the natural variations in the color of the stone which ranges from a translucent white to a rich green into the design achieving a remarkable realism as one gazes at the cabbage it is easy to forget its troubled history while the cabbages highly polished surfaces and lifelike coloration entrance a throng of japanese tourists a museum guide sighs as she explains that she knows everyone will ask visitors about the jade cabbage after their trip here it can be hard to understand why some objects like the mona lisa attain cult status while others are forgotten but the jade cabbage frenzy seems unlikely to fade anytime soon ms hook is an editorial writer at the wall
