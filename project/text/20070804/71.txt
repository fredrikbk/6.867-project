the week ahead our take on coming events politics for labor democratic debate is about issues and survival by kris maher on tuesday democratic candidates will square off at the yard line on chicagos soldier field in another debate this time hosted by the venerable afl cio organizers say the labor federations presidential candidates forum will have less of a union flavor than in the past and questions will focus on a broader set of issues that impact all workers in part that is because the event where contenders get to make their pitch for the union vote and a coveted afl cio endorsement will be bigger than in the past and broadcast live on television and satellite radio four years ago it aired on c span and drew about union members in the current amped up climate the federation got msnbc and xm satellite radio holdings to carry the debate live with keith olbermann to moderate interest from union members ballooned forcing the event outdoors more than union members and their families will attend according to the afl cio which represents million workers the afl cio touts the event as a way to make its presidential endorsement process more democratic by creating a forum for union members to directly hear from candidates at a difficult time unions are in dire straits and desperately hoping for a democratic win in "what theyre looking at is their basic survival " says gary chaison a professor of industrial relations at clark university in massachusetts "much of their agenda begs to be vetoed by a republican president " yet labor leaders are energized because unions are widely seen as helping democrats win a majority in both the senate and the house of representatives last fall and they couldnt have hoped for a stronger and more labor friendly set of candidates all of the democrats on stage tuesday have already said they endorse labors pet programs like legislation to make it easier to organize workers which elicited a veto promise from president bush earlier this year the debate will center on labors broader agenda with questions on trade policy growing economic inequality manufacturing job loss health care and retirement security and health and safety issues for workers despite declining ranks unions have a voter turnout machine that still wields considerable power the afl cio spent more than &# million in voter outreach efforts in and mobilized millions of union voters and it is expected to exceed that this time around on wednesday afl cio leaders will meet to decide whether to move ahead with a process that could lead to an endorsement this fall unions arguably play an even bigger role in the democratic primary season when union organizers can turn out a big percentage of primary voters in states like iowa and new hampshire while john edwards and hillary clinton are widely viewed as labors favorite candidates there is little chance of an early endorsement say labor experts the afl cio is far more likely to throw its weight behind the candidate who emerges as a clear front runner in the primaries "theyre going to have to come in late " says mr chaison "the key thing isnt who they like but whos going to win " mexico in baja california candidate with dark side rises by david luhnow the next governor of baja california the mexican state that borders the u s state of california could be a self proclaimed billionaire who has been accused of everything from money laundering to trading in endangered animals he has a private zoo wears an alligator skin vest and has a weakness for a homemade brew made with scorpions and the sexual organs of lions jorge hank rhon isnt your everyday candidate yet most polls give the year old former mayor of tijuana and father of children a slight advantage in sundays gubernatorial election over opponent jose guadalupe osuna of president felipe calderons national action party the fact that mr hank from the former ruling institutional revolutionary party or pri is polling so well shows how jaded mexicans are with their young democracy ever since the pri lost power in after ruling for seven decades the country has been paralyzed by bickering politicians of all stripes not a single major initiative has passed through a divided congress and mexico has fallen behind economic rivals like china last year the countrys national election almost descended into farce when the loser leftist andres manuel lopez obrador refused to recognize the result he still calls himself the "legitimate president " voters in baja california are willing to look past the cloud that hangs over mr hank because they say he has what many other politicians here lack competence surveys show voters there see mr hank as a person who can fix potholes create jobs and even clean up street violence the scion of mexicos most famous machine politician carlos hank gonzalez nicknamed "the professor " mr hank has his fathers instincts for machine politics thanks to his political connections for instance he won concessions throughout the country to run off license gambling parlors called "caliente " or "hot " that empire has spun off about &# billion mr hank says his personal bodyguard and an employee of his tijuana racetrack were convicted in the murder of hector felix a columnist for a local investigative weekly who wrote often about the illegal drug trade mr hank says his bodyguard was innocent for years after the crime the newspaper put out a weekly ad asking mr hank why mr felix was killed last week another mexican newspaper released recordings from federal prosecutors that purportedly show that members of the tijuana police department under mr hank had worked for the arellano felix drug cartel keeping drug dealers informed about movements of federal agents mr hank says he knows about the recordings but that the voices on them couldnt be identified mr hank himself has never been charged with a serious crime he was briefly arrested at the mexico city airport in for allegedly trying to smuggle ivory carvings and ocelot furs but was never convicted u s customs seized a white tiger cub from mr hank in law milbergs case for kickbacks by nathan koppel when class action law firm milberg weiss llp was indicted last year on charges of paying kickbacks to clients schadenfreude spread through corporations that had long been targets of its suits recently though some class action experts have been asking are payments to clients really so bad this theme may get an airing monday at a hearing in los angeles where the defendants are expected to argue among other things that no one was harmed by their alleged behavior the hearing concerns the defendants requests to dismiss the charges they face a high bar as dismissals of criminal charges are rare but the case has fueled a broader discussion about class actions and whether side payments to clients could play a positive role in the legal system a class action lawsuit is brought on behalf of many unnamed parties supposedly harmed by a defendants actions though all plaintiffs are treated equally the law requires an individual or institution to serve as lead plaintiff charged with oversight of the case and the plaintiffs lawyers in may milberg and two of its then top partners were indicted for allegedly sharing legal fees with clients to induce them to serve as plaintiffs in scores of class actions and other shareholder suits one former partner has pleaded guilty the government claims that after the firm received fees from settled cases it secretly paid millions of dollars to individuals who served as lead plaintiff the defendants deny paying kickbacks but they also argue in effect what if we did the firm achieved phenomenal results in its cases they say even if payments were made they assert they came out of milbergs fees not class members pockets the judge himself asked prosecutors last year "whats the loss " the government counters that the kickbacks created conflicts that led to class members being defrauded class settlements prosecutors argue yield a single pot of money the more diverted to lawyers the less for the pool of plaintiffs instead of fighting for the largest class recovery the government argues milbergs go to plaintiffs would have an interest in boosting legal fees further prosecutors say the defendants deceived judges by failing to disclose the kickbacks a soon to be published law review article by professors larry ribstein and bruce kobayashi posits that the sort of fee sharing alleged in the milberg case could if legalized actually increase the payoff to all class members without the chance of earning a special incentive bonus beyond the expenses and nominal amounts that courts are permitted to approve the argument goes a plaintiff may not have the incentive to file a case and undertake the role of lead plaintiff the result some meritorious class actions would never be filed and class members would thus recover zero "are kickbacks so bad im not so sure " says richard nagareda a professor at vanderbilt university law school "one would have to make the argument that the class is harmed because of this and thats a tough argument to make " there appears to be no broad movement to formally authorize the sharing of legal fees and thats just as well according to some class action experts who believe vigilant independent lead plaintiffs help ensure that lawyers handle cases properly and dont pay themselves too much says geoffrey miller a professor at new york university school of law "the concern is that a lead plaintiff wont be a vigorous monitor of the lawyer if the plaintiff shares the lawyers fees "
