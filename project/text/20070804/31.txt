poison me elmo first they came for our pets next they came for our teeth and then the tires on our sport utility vehicles now its our children that at least is the alarmist view of u s toymaker mattels unprecedented recall of a reported million toys from china but before anyone in washington latches onto this as an excuse for more protectionist legislation pause to consider what actually happened the recall covers individual toys of types that were intended for the u s market plus another bound for other parts of the world including canada and europe all of the toys in question featured lead paint no small defect in a product meant for children the toys were manufactured on contract by a chinese supplier between april and july of this year the defective toys are certainly worrisome but there are several encouraging elements to this latest made in china scandal while unsafe products are still slipping through the cracks the private sector is increasingly attacking the problem most notably mattel has taken the lead in identifying and recalling the toys after a retailer first brought the possible problem to the companys attention in early july mattel reportedly stopped production at the factory while it investigated those tests culminated in the voluntary recall this marks a departure from the case of the allegedly faulty tires sold by a new jersey distributor which suspected there were safety problems but delayed initiating a recall "we realize that parents trust us with what is most precious to them their children " mattel ceo robert eckert said in a statement without casting aspersions on mr eckerts humanitarian spirit which is surely genuine wed note that mattel has no choice but to think that way or face the markets wrath which is what we have really learned about chinese product safety from this latest recall some american companies doing business in china have been slow to wake up to the challenge and responsibility of managing quality control there theyre waking up now as they realize their brand reputations depend on it and theyre becoming much better at managing supply chains consider the relative ease with which mattel was apparently able to identify the source of the defective toys it took chinese authorities up to two weeks to identify the factories responsible for the tainted pet food ingredient that caused such a stir in march the north american companies had bought the ingredient through a trading company mattel in contrast had a longstanding relationship with the factory responsible in this case that didnt avert corner cutting on the suppliers part but it did make the problem easier to trace and correct unsafe products are a fact of life the u s has created its own share of food and product safety scares over the years from e coli tainted spinach to faulty bridgestone firestone tires even the best inspection regime whether government or private will miss serious problems from time to time but at the end of the day the private market stands a better chance of protecting consumers than an army of government inspectors ever will see related letter "letters to the editor be not afraid the market will win converts in china" wsj august
