the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources activism nonviolent protests work some of the time can authoritarian power be shamed reformed or dislodged through nonviolent protest in many cases it can says the economist which profiles two u s based groups whose mission is to aid the work of nonviolent campaigners but despite the efforts of democratic activists world wide sometimes mass gatherings by courageous crowds have little effect on tyrants one thing is certain says the economist opposition movements around the world are able as never before to swap ideas with citizens of repressive regimes that is partly because of the ease of digital communication protesters also are getting a helping hand from washington d c nonprofit organizations such as freedom house and the international center on nonviolent conflict freedom house monitors and lends support to democratic movements the center on nonviolent conflict seeks to promote peaceful democratic reforms through publications and educational programs in some respects the nonviolent doctrine promoted by these organizations is at the peak of its influence democratic activists point to the successful "orange" revolution in ukraine and the uprising against serbias slobodan milosevic in but as these movements draw support from u s groups such as freedom house and icnc leaders in authoritarian countries are having an easier time denouncing human rights activism as american meddling that message tends to resonate especially well in places such as venezuela and iran where the u s government is held in low esteem still supporters of nonviolent action maintain that any regime no matter how brutal or opposed to current u s policies can be weakened through peaceful measures that view contends the economist doesnt quite hold up while nonviolent protests succeeded in former soviet republics ukraine and georgia similar efforts in belarus and azerbaijan fizzled quickly despite

administration in may invoked a world trade organization treaty provision that allows a country to modify any commitment to grant access to its markets the provision mandates that the country imposing restrictions has to compensate countries affected by the change in this case antigua wants the u s to pay &# billion a year to cover lost gambling revenue seven other wto members also might seek compensation in the case but the bigger problem says ms woellert is that by invoking the measure the u s potentially has legitimized its use by other nations which might seek to essentially buy their way out of free trade commitments "the last thing we want is for china or india or russia to feel like they can withdraw some concession on intellectual property or aircraft " says gary c hufbauer a fellow at the nonprofit peterson institute for international economics in washington meanwhile smaller nations might be more inclined to ask the wto to allow them to ignore copyright protections in software and entertainment the u s for now is standing firm in its opposition to internet gambling bolstered by a rare bipartisan consensus in congress it has banned the use of credit cards to place bets online saying it is too easy for criminals and terrorists to use web gambling to launder money still with the u s and antigua in formal arbitration it is still possible a settlement will be reached that would diminish the threat of a broader trade dispute ms woellert says businessweek aug culture why modern austen fans obsess over her love life jane austens description of courtship rituals so dominate popular culture that fans of the novelist cant bear to think of her as the spinster she was in real life says literature professor deidre lynch that is why dr lynch says books and films like the newly released "becoming jane " a fantasy about the authors romantic life fill a need austen wrote about relationships between men and women in a way that still resonates with readers today but austen never married and historians are divided over whether she had any serious romantic attachments still many people gauge their own romantic lives against austens that makes them want to
