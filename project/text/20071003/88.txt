pensions and palm greasing what do you call &# billion in pension fund cash that is subject to the investment whim of ambitious politicians if you answered "an opportunity for corruption " perhaps youre a cynic or a priest or maybe you simply live in new york if its the latter you may be following the news about new york states public employee pension system former comptroller alan hevesi is alleged to have directed payments to his political consultant hank morris for arranging investment opportunities for the &# billion fund the fees currently under investigation by the state attorney general and the albany county district attorney run to the millions of dollars but new yorks public pensioners are in a sense fortunate their funds performance in recent years has been good and at least on paper the fund has enough money to cover its obligations to current and future retirees despite any political palm greasing thats more than can be said for neighboring new jersey which doesnt have a sole trustee like new york but has managed to short change its pension fund for years with shortfalls now into the billions of dollars or san diego whose pension board similarly engaged in creative accounting until the curtain was lifted and the fund found itself underfunded by at least this is not to minimize the seriousness of politically directed payments in new york while mr hevesi denies any wrongdoing hes the fellow who lost his job last year after it was discovered hed used a state employee to shuttle his wife around town in connecticut where the public pension fund also has a sole trustee responsible for directing investment a former trustee was recently sent to prison for a kickback scheme not unlike mr hevesis alleged actions human frailty aside the larger lesson here is that the entire public pension model is suspect the political reaction in new york has been to debate whether a pension "board " as most states have would be more or less accountable than a sole trustee but its far from obvious that a board is less prone to political manipulation or self dealing than a single trustee witness the problems in new jersey san diego and elsewhere the root problem lies in political control of tens or hundreds of billions of dollars of public retirement money leaving it alone requires an unnatural act of political self abnegation long before the payments to mr morris came to light mr hevesi had come under fire for offering up the state pension fund as a client in class action suits related to the worldcom fraud the lawyers in those cases happened to be generous donors to new york democrats at the same time the pension fund was a shareholder in some of the banks that mr hevesi sued in other words large publicly managed pension funds create all manner of opportunities for political mischief regardless of their management structure before he was run out of town mr hevesi was just another ambitious new york pol looking to grab headlines and wait for the chance to run for governor or the senate a few states have already moved in a different direction toward k style defined contribution plans for public employees these plans increasingly dominate in the private work force and for good reasons they limit employers liabilities but they also promote job mobility because they are portable and allow workers to control their own retirement savings michigan and florida have shown that such a system for public employees is possible a handful of other states have at least some form of defined contribution plan for public employees if our political class really wants to stop palm greasing and other political meddling in public pension funds they should give the money to the people whove earned it and get out of the pension management business see related letter "letters to the editor needed a coherent retirement policy" wsj oct
