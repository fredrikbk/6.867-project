the cheap revolution poor steve jobs first he apologizes for dropping the price of the iphone from &# to &# after just weeks on the market and offers apple customers a &# rebate now hes being slapped with a &# million lawsuit from a new york woman who says apple violated price discrimination laws when her fancy new phone was suddenly worth &# less whats going on here did mr jobs gouge early technology adopters just for a couple extra billion bucks i dont think so after a long streak of successes mr jobs and apple whose stock is up more than fold since have collided with two forces stronger than they are one is the cheap revolution the other is the global economy together they forced apple to drop the price of the iphone and offend its geeky customer base some background the cheap revolution is a first order effect of moores law if you dont know moores law by now you should probably hang it up but in case the coffee is slow to stir you this morning here is the short version fairchild semiconductor cofounder and later intel cofounder gordon moore formulated his famous law in six years after fairchild had invented the silicon chip mr moore saw that the number of transistors that could be shrunk and baked into a silicon chip of constant size was doubling every year or so caltech professor carver mead dubbed this exponential trend of transistor density "moores law" and soon everyone agreed that months was the predicted interval of doubling for years if you said moores law people presumed you were describing a future of ever more powerful computers the personal computers of including the apple ii and the ibm pc were punks by todays standards they could run only rudimentary spreadsheets and word processing software but soon the dark green screens and white type were replaced by graphics during the mid s first in the apple macintosh and later in pcs running successive versions of microsoft windows this was a terrific advance but software could only evolve at the pace of moores law moores law delivered by the early s the exponential gains had evolved to the point where microprocessors now ran fast enough in pcs and workstations to topple an entire industry in this case all the minicomputer companies along bostons fabled route down they went digital equipment corporation wang data general all victims of a new and more powerful force by the early s moores law had crammed enough zip into pcs so as to turn them into multimedia machines our pc became a base station for news photos songs and movies as well as manipulator of words and numbers but along the way another even bigger trend was in the works if not seen as clearly call it the flipside of moores law if the frontside said chips and therefore computers would get twice as fast every months "at the same price point " the backside said prices would drop every months "at the same performance point " i am thumbing this column on research in motions blackberry its a model almost ancient now my blackberry is powered by an intel megahertz microprocessor for which rim pays intel about &# per chip in volume keep that price and performance in mind fifteen years ago at the dawn of the web age intels hot seller was the pentium family of microprocessors in the pentiums ran at about megahertz just like the intel chip in my blackberry the difference being that the intel chip cost about &# in volume thats the cheap revolution at work the flipside of moores law the second order effect is hyper charged global capitalism bestsellers have been written on the rapid rise of china india southeastern asia eastern europe and so on of course many factors from supply side tax policies to open trade have contributed to the global boom but cheap technology is at the center of it first and foremost thats because the ticket to entry into the global economy today is not a computer costing &# running on a &# chip rather it is a web enabled phone costing &# running on a &# chip think about it if the average educated chinese or czech citizen had to pay &# to enter the grid of the global economy theyd still be sending faxes these are the twin forces blowing in apples face when it priced its revolutionary iphone at &# cool as the iphone is im buying one this weekend the price could not be sustained in the world of the cheap revolution where moores law drives the cost down and buyers in china and india will set the price apple need not apologize for cutting prices it had to and as for that nutty lawsuit in new york the court should delete it post haste mr karlgaard is the publisher of forbes
