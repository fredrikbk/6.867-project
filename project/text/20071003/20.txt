business bookshelf how to end a bottleneck to cork or not to cork by george m taber scribner pages &# if you order a bottle of wine at a high end restaurant these days the sommelier might just come over to your table a fine vintage in hand and twist off a metal cap as if he were opening a bottle of pepsi whether this tableside performance so banal compared with the artful choreography of the corkscrew is a sign of the cultural apocalypse is hard to say but a business revolution does seem to be under way winemakers around the world are rebelling against the cork on the shelves of wine shops everywhere you can find bottles sealed with screw caps and with cork shaped plastic stoppers and its not just the cheap stuff that bottle of wine with a screw cap could cost you &# &# or even &# from the days when thomas jeffersons cellar was filled with bottles of lafite to the near present it was cork and only cork that sealed wine bottles from the invading effects of the surrounding air as recently as the late s you would be hard pressed to find a corkless bottle of serious wine anywhere in the world no more the cork has nearly disappeared from australias domestically produced and broadly exported wines in california screw caps are no longer reserved for jug wines the &# a bottle plumpjack reserve cabernet is a twist off even france the country most reluctant to abandon a corky tradition is flirting with alternatives earlier this year maison jean claude boisset became the first to do away with corks on a grand cru red burgundy sealing half its &# a bottle chambertin with screw caps so whats going on technology plays a part but taste and competition do as well too many bad corks have been ruining too much perfectly good wine for a couple of hundred years winemakers and wine drinkers understood that the wine in a small percentage of bottles as much as to would suffer from the contamination of bad corks and sometimes bad barrels the culprit was a chemical called tricholoanisole or tca it caused wine to become "corked" that is to smell like a moldy pile of damp cardboard the tca problem apparently originating at the early stages of cork harvesting seemed to get worse over the past few decades but the cork industry dominated by a handful of big companies in spain and portugal refused even to acknowledge the problem let alone do anything about it the cork makers were in for a rude awakening "to corks critics the failure rate is both outrageous and unacceptable " writes george taber in "to cork or not to cork " "they repeatedly argue that if or of toyota cars or ibm computers failed those companies would be out of business " so over the past decade winemakers have taken matters into their own hands exploring alternatives that include lately glass caps there is more at stake here than the wages of sommeliers according to mr taber the revenue of the companies that manufacture the stopping apparatus for a bottle of wine those who seek yes "closure" is about &# billion a year cork still dominates but it is losing ground in new zealand the revolution is nearly complete in nearly all its wines were closed with corks today have screw caps such rapid change has provoked a debate within the wine business in randall grahm of bonny doon winery in california held an elaborate "funeral for the cork" in manhattan complete with pallbearers a hearse and a "heartfelt wake for the old stinker" at grand central terminal the eulogy was given by british wine critic jancis robinson who pronounced "the great big supertanker ss screwcap has set sail and there will be no turning back " maybe but screw caps and synthetic corks may cause problems of their own they may do such a good job sealing the bottle that they kill the wine one of the first to explore this problem was paul white a journalist and wine expert in new zealand who has been on a crusade against the screw cap revolution mr white argues that cork is essential to wines aging process because it lets trace amounts of oxygen into the bottle a perfectly sealed wine bottle with a screw cap can over time suffer from something called "reduction" causing it to smell like sulfur infused rotten eggs the idea that a small amount of oxygen is essential to the aging of wine may not be universally accepted but it is not new as louis pasteur put it more than years ago "it is oxygen that makes the wine " mr whites criticism of screw caps has made him something of a pariah in new zealand where the wine industry is so heavily invested in them faced with market pressures for the first time the big cork producers are finally taking steps to tighten their quality control and seek out the cork that causes tca and the world wildlife fund in a case of free market environmentalism has jumped to the defense of corks since their use in wine bottles is the surest way of protecting the old cork forests in spain and portugal cork is harvested by slicing the bark off cork trees the trees survive living on for more than a century if the market for cork dries up strip malls may stand where cork forests now do in "to cork or not to cork " mr taber does an able job of telling the story of the cork industrys early history its rise to global monopoly status and the recent search for alternatives on the central question to cork or not to cork he takes a pass the science he believes is inconclusive screw caps and plastic corks seem to work fine for wines especially white wines that are drunk soon after they are bottled but it is too early to tell if they will work for wines that should stay in the cellar for years but the debate is about more than the science of wine aging as mr taber writes "in the entire world only a few sounds bring joy to all but the most jaded one is the purring kitten another is the thwack of a well pitched baseball hitting a perfectly swung bat and a third is the pop of a cork being pulled from a bottle of wine " for a lot of people the wine experience is as much about ritual and beauty as it is about the actual taste of wine to avoid the pepsi effect a wine lover might say put a cork in it mr karl is senior national
