wal mart era wanes amid big shifts in retail rivals find strategies to defeat low prices world has changed the wal mart era the retailers time of overwhelming business and social influence in america is drawing to a close using a combination of low prices and relentless expansion wal mart stores inc emerged from rural arkansas in the s to reshape the worlds largest economy its co founder sam walton taught americans to demand ever lower prices and instructed businesses on running a lean company his company helped boost americas overall productivity lowered the inflation rate and strengthened the buying power for millions of people over time it also accelerated the drive to manufacture products in asia drove countless small shops out of business and sped the decline of main street those changes are permanent today though wal marts influence over the retail universe is slipping in fact the industrys titan is scrambling to keep up with swifter rivals that are redefining the business all around it it can still disrupt prices as it did last year by cutting some generic prescriptions to &# but success is no longer guaranteed rival retailers lured americans away from wal marts low price promise by offering greater convenience more selection higher quality or better service amid the countrys growing affluence wal mart has struggled to overhaul its down market politically incorrect image while other discounters pitched themselves as more upscale and more palatable alternatives the internet has changed shoppers preferences and eroded the commanding influence wal mart had over its suppliers as a result american shoppers are increasingly looking for qualities that wal mart has trouble providing "for the first time in a long time quality has a chance to gain on price " says lee peterson a vice president at dublin ohio based brand consulting firm wd partners inc now the big name brands that fueled wal marts climb to the top are forging exclusive distribution deals with other retailers or working to reduce their reliance on its stores pepsico inc which favored mass market campaigns a decade ago recently skipped wal mart when launching a new energy drink in favor of whole foods market inc consumer products giant procter &amp gamble co gets of its revenue from wal mart down three percentage points from wal marts effort to expand internationally has had mixed success in affluent markets last year it exited south korea and germany after failing to adapt to local tastes and achieve economies of scale in japan the companys low price high volume approach has struggled in a country where low prices often equate to low quality wal mart remains an enormous force in retailing of course its world wide sales are almost three times those of frances carrefour sa the worlds second largest publicly traded retailer wal marts u s revenue is times that of discount store rival target corp and four times that of second largest u s food retailer kroger co its clothing and shoe sales last year alone exceeded the total revenues of macys inc parent of macys and bloomingdales department stores the companys unquenchable thirst for scale has been the secret to its market changing power "what we are is a supercenter with one stop shopping " said wal marts vice chairman john menzer at an investors conference last month the company expects each year to build another to of the square foot supercenters that are its hallmark and convert smaller discount stores to the bigger format over the next five years "we would love to wave a magic wand and make every one of our discount stores a supercenter " he says but that very focus on scale is now a weakness for the world has changed on wal mart the big box retailing formula that drove wal marts success is making it difficult for the retailer to evolve consumers are demanding more freshness and choice which means that foods and new clothing designs must appear on shelves more frequently they are also demanding more personalized service making such changes is difficult for wal marts supercenters which ascended to the top of retailing by superior efficiency uniformity and scale "all retailers have a formula they grow as far and as fast as they can with that formula " says love goel a former fingerhut cos executive and now chairman and ceo of growth ventures group a minnetonka minn based private equity firm that invests in retail businesses wal mart has outgrown its supercenter recipe but efforts to win growth from more affluent consumers have fallen flat he says "they have hit the wall " wal mart declined to make an executive available for an interview and declined to respond to written questions citing an upcoming meeting with wall street analysts business history is littered with companies that grew to enormous size and used their girth to re arrange the world to fit their strengths think international business machines corp in the mainframe business general motors corp in autos or microsoft corp in personal computers for a time their success bred an ecosystem that sustained their status in the s independent software companies piggybacked on ibms mainframes resulting in greater demand for mainframe computers such orchestration can produce solid growth for decades but it can also produce corporate blinders over time ibms grip on the corporate data center left it unable to anticipate the decentralizing effects of personal computing gms knack at brand creation and frequent model changes left it vulnerable to the incremental quality approach of japanese auto makers microsoft was so busy cramming features into its windows operating software that it lagged others in the shift to the internet each remains among the top in its industry yet each has relinquished the role of industry definer ibm to intel corp gm to toyota motor corp microsoft to google inc wal marts great insight was perfecting the so called "value loop" in retailing at its most basic the system works like this lower prices generate healthy sales gains and profits some of those profits went into further price cuts generating more sales the lower the price the more consumers flocked to wal mart but the value loop is beginning to unravel for years through wal marts sales gains at stores open at least a year averaged so far this year its comparable store sales a measure of market share is up just the pricing gap between wal mart and rivals has narrowed and more customers are now choosing convenience over wading through a supercenter that compares with comparable store gains of at target which markets itself as a trend setting discounter and at membership club rival costco wholesale corp which peddles &# bordeaux wines and &# cartier watches while wal mart has been portrayed as a ruthless employer costco has been praised for providing some of the best employee benefits in retail wal marts shares trade about where they were at the start of the decade when the company produced less than half its current revenue shares closed yesterday up cents at &# and down from the stocks year earlier price earlier this year wal mart took the extraordinary step of ratcheting down its u s expansion plans because its new stores were stealing too much revenue from existing ones that wasnt a concern in the s and s when wal mart was regularly flattening competitors in some ways wal marts loss of clout is a reflection of a more fragmented world retailing is a mirror to how we live and work big box stores thrived by selling highly recognizable national brands which themselves were fed by two phenomena the growth of mass media and freeways which encouraged large stores in remote areas stores and brands together achieved scale efficiencies that allowed them to overwhelm local chain stores and regional brands but the internet is transforming the retail definition of scale the once stunning compilation of items found in a wal mart supercenter doesnt seem so vast alongside the millions of products available on the internet at the same time the cost of creating and sustaining a national brand is rising because of media fragmentation niche brands created by internet word of mouth are winning shelf space and sapping profits required to fund big brands advertising manufacturers such as apple inc and phillips van heusen corp lacking the retail distribution or presentation they crave are opening their own stores one result is that retail giants hold less sway over their customers and over their suppliers and across the landscape numerous rivals are using a form of competitive jujitsu to keep the bentonville behemoth off balance grocery store chains such as kroger are resurging on sales of prepared or semicooked meals which people can grab on their way home cincinnati based kroger projects sales at stores open at least a year will climb between and this year on top of a increase last year thomas kim a financial analyst for a st louis scrap metal firm describes his family as frugal shoppers who check prices on the internet but he and his wife most often shop in local retailers "its the convenience factor " says mr kim his family avoids supercenters describing them as too large and too crowded when wal mart pushed heavily into consumer electronics earlier this decade many industry observers expected it to flatten electronics chains but five years ago best buy co began aggressively marketing installation and other services alongside flat panel tvs and pcs last year best buys total sales rose wal mart which has struggled to sell big ticket hdtvs has only recently begun selling installation services at a few stores using an outside supplier it doesnt break out consumer electronics sales but analysts estimate sales last year rose to &# billion melissa morris says best buy won her loyalty by gladly accepting a notebook pc return and having trained sales clerks "i go to a store that specializes or has associates there that know about it " she says the erie pa sales executive refuses to go to wal mart citing its crowded aisles and hurried atmosphere best buy and specialty retailer petsmart inc which touts pet grooming and kennel stays put hard to copy services at the forefront of their pitch says howard n jackson president of retail advisers hsa consulting inc knoxville tenn "they realize the best way to win a fight is to make sure you dont get in one " he says wal mart has long sold prescription drugs setting up its pharmacy business in but national drug chains cvs caremark corp and walgreen co reacted by redefining their role and selling basic health services such as school physicals diagnostic tests and flu treatment alongside drugstore wares cvs and walgreen each acquired in store clinic operations redefining the pharmacy business as basic health care centers same store sales at cvs and walgreen are running about double that of wal mart this year wal mart has begun offering leases to clinic operators then theres the host of new entrants in apparel smaller retailers with niche market appeal like hennes &amp mauritz abs h&amp m inditex groups zara and los angeles based forever inc are growing by offering consumers rapid style changes outside the u s britain based tesco plc is challenging wal mart by cultivating the tesco brand across five different formats including convenience stores and urban stores as well as supercenters this fall tesco will open its first u s outlets stores that will offer fresh and prepared foods and staples as wal marts influence erodes so does its allure to manufacturers burt p flickinger iii managing director of retail consulting firm strategy resource group says wal mart now takes a back seat to regional grocery and national drug chains when it comes to striking deals he says some manufacturers now sell their wares faster at other retailers "four of the top consumer products companies say they can move merchandise faster with walgreen and cvs " says mr flickinger who came up with the estimate from his talks with consumer products firms such retailers have been rewarded with lower costs and better sales gains the change is apparent at pepsico wal mart is pepsicos largest customer world wide accounting for &# billion in sales of drinks and snack foods but earlier this year pepsico opted to launch fuelosophy a new energy drink at whole foods a high end supermarket chain "we thought that was the best place to introduce and test it " says pepsico spokesman david dececco whole foods customers "health and wellness" profile better match that of likely fuelosophy buyers than wal marts he says he declined to name which other retailers were considered for the rollout wal marts loss of influence can also be seen in logistics in wal marts decision to embrace bar code scanners in its distribution centers and stores helped quash the use of a less efficient technology then used at sears roebuck &amp co and other retailers in the retailer brashly jumped onto the next big logistics technology called radio frequency identification and mandated big suppliers begin slapping rfid tags on products shipped to its warehouses wal mart installed tag readers at warehouses and stores hoping to further automate warehouses and lower inventory costs wal mart quietly dropped the mandate earlier this year and refocused its development after suppliers complained of the high costs and lack of a return on their investment in the new technology while the company says its pushing ahead wal mart says it realigned efforts to focus on areas where the technology offered the most promise such as assuring vendors promotional displays are properly deployed in its stores wal mart wasnt able to demand big suppliers continue investing in a technology that was raising their operating costs says ken rohleder president of rohleder group a louisville ky supply chain consulting firm "there was a time when they could have dictated anything " he says
