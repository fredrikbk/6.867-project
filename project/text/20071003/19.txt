blackwater furor may alter way u s contractors in iraq do business the congressional probe of blackwater usa the private contractor being investigated for a sept shooting incident in which iraqis were killed is fueling a push for significant changes in the way u s contractors operate in iraq the changes being considered by iraqi politicians include stripping u s contractors and their employees in iraq of their current immunity to iraqi law in the u s legislation may soon make all american battlefield contractors subject to u s criminal law the contractors argue that such changes especially the loss of their immunity could make it more dangerous for them to do their jobs but critics in washington as well as iraqi politicians incensed by the blackwater shootings have clamored to curb the contractors autonomy on monday the federal bureau of investigation opened an investigation into the shootings yesterday blackwater founder erik prince made a rare public appearance before the house committee on oversight and government reform to defend his company from lawmakers who accuse it of behaving too aggressively in providing security services in iraq he came in for harsh criticism from democrats for among other things charging the government &# billion mr prince countered congressional accusations that his company and its workers havent been held sufficiently accountable in iraq and afghanistan saying blackwater exercises tight control over its staff "if there is any sort of discipline problem whether its bad attitude a dirty weapon riding someones bike thats not his we fire them we hold ourselves internally accountable " mr prince told the committee "we fire them we can fine them but we cant do anything else " the hearing was prompted by blackwaters track record particularly the sept incident in which blackwater personnel coming to the aid of a convoy of american diplomats in iraq were alleged to have fired on iraqi civilians iraqi officials and witnesses say blackwater opened fire without provocation blackwater says its guards reacted to an ambush and returned "defensive fire " a subsequent congressional probe documented shooting incidents since involving blackwater personnel working for the state department in iraq few of them however involved allegations of wrongdoing and some merely involved the firing of warning shots blackwater is among the biggest of the about contractors now operating in iraq in jobs ranging from procuring supplies to running reconstruction projects its employees there are mainly involved in providing security services for state department staffers such as escorting diplomats and visiting u s officials on trips in baghdad and elsewhere in the country the company whose line up of sophisticated equipment gives it an advantage over other security firms in iraq uses its own helicopters to keep watch over convoys blackwater started out as a military and law enforcement training company and that continues to be a big part of its business the company is also involved in the design of armored vehicles and is developing unmanned aircraft that can be used for surveillance blackwaters parent company the prince group includes presidential airways which has a defense department transportation contract and other firms that specialize in intelligence and analysis as a private company blackwater isnt required to publicly disclose financial information yesterday while the blackwater political drama played out on capitol hill the private security industry girded for the prospect of tougher scrutiny and stricter ground rules security firms hired by the u s to protect diplomats and reconstruction projects in iraq currently operate under a protective order that exempts them from legal oversight by iraqi authorities now in the wake of the blackwater incident the iraqi government has threatened to revoke that exemption today the house is expected to vote on a bill from rep david price d n c that would extend the jurisdiction of u s criminal law to all contractors in a war zone where american forces are operating the bill would also give the fbi a central role in prosecuting them for any misdeeds contractors say any moves to rein in or eliminate private security forces in iraq could make it much more difficult for any type of business to work there because of the increased cost and risk of protecting workers armed guards are part of the fabric of almost every facet of business in iraq whether rebuilding schools or maintaining infrastructure in january the state department reported that security costs in iraq were often to of the total budget for big reconstruction projects some security contractors say they believe that tempers have cooled noticeably in iraq since just after the sept shootings and that iraqi officials appear to have backed off their threats to change the legal structure under which foreign security companies operate in their country "there is clearly a desire by many in the iraqi government to lower the volume about this whole issue as the u s and iraq try to work out an understanding " says lawrence peter who directs an association of some security firms doing business in iraq the state department and pentagon have dispatched several teams to iraq not only to investigate the blackwater incident but also to talk with the iraqi government about ways to change the legal status of security contractors working for the u s those contractors have de facto immunity from iraqi law under a provision known as cpa order which was issued when the u s turned over sovereignty to the new iraqi government in june industry and u s government officials say that the two sides may now negotiate a new legal regimen that would more closely resemble the status of forces agreements that u s troops operate under in places like japan and germany those agreements are designed to cover any legal consequences of the presence of u s forces ranging from property damage to individual crimes any similar arrangement in iraq would have to fill the legal vacuum under which u s contractors in iraq fall neither under u s nor iraqi criminal law the current furor over blackwater comes as more security companies are beginning to work under contracts issued by the iraqi government those contractors are subject to iraqi law mr peter of the private security company association of iraq estimates that as many as two thirds of the security companies now in iraq are working primarily for the iraqi government some security companies say that they fear that the blackwater case could unfairly tarnish the industry despite the fact that blackwaters comparatively high profile work with the state department differs markedly from work that other security firms such as britains aegis defense services ltd are doing for the defense department the u s army corps of engineers relies on aegis not only to supply security for its many reconstruction projects but also to furnish hundreds of on the ground civilian specialists who monitor reconstruction work across the country aegis renewed its two year &# million defense department contract last month the most significant legal difference between defense department contractors and their state department counterparts is that the former operate under the uniform code of military justice which has long applied to u s military personnel overseas but was recently amended to apply to civilians under pentagon authority state department contractors have no similar legal structure one state department official with knowledge of the current talks in baghdad said that the administration "does intend to address the legal authorities under which these companies operate there is just no real clarity of what happens if certain things go wrong there " the official added however that it was too early to say what form those modifications might take if iraqi law changes so that foreign security contractors can be tried in iraqi courts the effects will be felt beyond the security industry if their legal footing changes risk managers for companies doing business in iraq would be forced to make hard decisions about whether they trust the iraqi judicial system raising the possibility that fewer of them would be willing to accept the risk "people will have to work with it very carefully and hopefully be able to have insurance underwriters and logistics and security companies willing to take the risk in a hostile environment " said jack holly director of reconstruction logistics gulf region division for the army corps of engineers mr holly has been involved in moving &# billion to &# billion worth of supplies for the iraqi government during the past years he said companies such as those in the oil industry that have been kept at bay by the danger in iraq will eventually return but they will need protection so will nongovernmental organizations eager to get to work in iraq given the expected reduction of american troops in iraq these groups will "have to come up with some creative methods dependent upon using private security companies " made up of either westerners or iraqi citizens he said because of the fbi investigation lawmakers didnt ask mr prince and state department officials speaking at the house hearing yesterday to delve into the sept shootings questions about the companys work in iraq continued throughout the morning with many democratic lawmakers homing in on a incident involving a blackwater contractor who shot an iraqi guarding the countrys vice president mr prince said that police in the international zone arrested the man and that the company referred the matter to the u s justice department no charges have been filed in the u s against the ex employee who left iraq with the companys help after the shooting "we as a private company cannot detain him " said mr prince the committees report detailed incidents when blackwaters guards fired on iraqi vehicles but didnt stop to see the effect of their shots mr prince said that stopping wasnt possible because there would be more shooting if they did return "its not about what you do well its a question of when things go wrong where is the accountability " said rep elijah cummings a maryland democrat during his testimony blackwaters mr prince came under fire from democrats for charging the government almost &# billion for its services since "the question for this hearing is whether outsourcing to blackwater is a good deal to the american taxpayer whether its a good deal for the military and whether its serving our national interest in iraq " said committee chairman henry waxman d calif mr prince countered by highlighting some of the risks that contractors assume such as the loss of personnel helicopters and other equipment this year alone he said blackwater has had three helicopters shot down in iraq "and when they go down that comes out of our hide " mr prince said he said blackwater bills its guards to the u s government at &# a day not the &# cited by the committee its profits are at about he said he also suggested that the governments cost estimates for what it costs to keep military personnel in iraq were also misleadingly low because they dont take into account the cost of training and equipping them "that sergeant doesnt show up naked and untrained " mr prince said timothy farnam contributed to this article
