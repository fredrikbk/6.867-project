coated mechanical paper rather than coated freesheet said john maine vice president of world graphic papers for risi coated mechanical paper is cheaper and of lower quality and contrast than coated freesheet according to risi china shipped short tons of coated freesheet and short tons of coated mechanical paper to the u s in the first six months of but in the first half of coated freesheet imports dropped to tons while coated mechanical imports increased to tons "the tariff has clearly had an impact to some degree but it has not been as large as originally anticipated " mr maine said figures from u s customs through july paint an even starker picture said paul leclair chief economist for the montreal based pulp and paper products council in all of china shipped tons of coated mechanical paper to the u s compared with tons of coated freesheet through july china already has shipped up to tons of coated mechanical while coated freesheet shipments were down mr leclair said the
