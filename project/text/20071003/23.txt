buyers of sallie mae propose new terms the buyers of slm corp moved to seize the advantage in their standoff with the board of the student lender offering a reduced buyout price with the chance of further payouts in coming years under the terms of the offer for the company more commonly known as sallie mae the group led by j c flowers &amp co which includes j p morgan chase &amp co and bank of america corp said it sought to cut its offer to &# a share in cash it also offered warrants that it said could be worth as much as &# a share in five years the groups original offer which slm accepted this spring was for &# a share in cash slm shares early yesterday surged above &# after flowers unveiled the revised proposal but subsequently settled back down to &# up on the day the latest proposal appears just the first step in what stands to be a long and tortuous negotiation wall street is closely watching what happens to this deal as it could set precedents for the remaining pipeline of leveraged buyouts that still await funding related article on page c a person close to slm insisted that the buyout group has no right to change terms of what had been a roughly &# billion deal this person added that the company was willing to meet with the buyers to discuss options but it appears for now that the sellers are willing to play hardball figuring that j christopher flowers head of the flowers firm doesnt want to risk incurring the &# million reverse termination fee that flowers and the banks would have to pay in the event of the deal breaking "wed prefer to sit down with them and sort out our troubles in a businesslike fashion " said a person close to the flowers group "its obvious that logic would suggest we work something out its quite obvious that the value of sallie mae has declined " the group has claimed the combination of weaker credit markets and a new federal law slashing government subsidies to student lenders like slm would hurt the companys business and justified a lower price tag it argues that slms business has suffered a "material adverse event " which would be grounds for the buyers to walk away from the transaction without paying the &# million breakup fee among the key questions for slm shareholders is the likely value of the warrants whose value would hinge on slms performance over the next five years wall street traders estimated yesterday that the total value of the cash and warrants is below &# a share the flowers group said the warrants would be worth about &# a share in if slm performs up to its own expectations and could pay out &# a share if the company beats its forecasts at the same time though the buyout group said in a document sent yesterday to the slm board that student lending legislation signed into law last week by president bush could cut slms profits by in and in those projections are considerably less rosy than the companys and if they are accurate they could substantially erode the warrants value the flowers group apparently is hoping that the warrants will highlight what the group believes are slms implausible expectations about the companys prospects in the wake of the new student lending law "if slm will stand by their numbers theyll realize theyre getting a very good deal " said the person close to flowers group slms camp has insisted that while the new student lending law will hurt its business it will exact a fairly modest toll that doesnt rise to the level of a material adverse event the question of whether an mae has occurred is important in determining each sides leverage in negotiations if an mae has taken place the buyout group can pressure slm to renegotiate the deal absent an mae however the &# million breakup fee could be a significant deterrent to flowers abandoning the deal since unlike bank of america and j p morgan the buyout shop lacks a massive balance sheet to absorb the fee
