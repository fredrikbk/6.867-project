russian roulette on iran last week the united states turned to the united nations in an attempt to increase pressure on iran the u s wanted to expand sanctions against the budding nuclear power neither china nor russia would go along and faced with the prospect of one or the other vetoing sanctions at the u n security council u s secretary of state condoleezza rice punted she put off further action against iran until at least november its hard to see how much will change in a month russian foreign minister sergei lavrov is firm in his opposition to sanctions "interference by way of new sanctions would mean undermining" the international atomic energy agency iaea as it puts pressure on iran he said this is a charade the statement came three days after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that based on his talks with iaea director mohamed elbaradei he considered the nuclear file closed not only could iran continue enriching uranium regardless of u n security council resolutions the iranian president said but tehran could also export its enriched uranium and nuclear know how to other muslim countries yet the bush administration continues to seek agreement with russia with ms rices undersecretary nicholas burns talking about washingtons desire for "compromise" with moscow british foreign minister david milbrand is no better he puts unity above all else "the most important thing is that the unanimity of the international community " the debate over iran then reflects two much larger debates whether foreign policy should be unilateral or multilateral and whether it should be based on "realism" or on principle unilateralism of course has become a dirty word since the invasion of iraq but international venality expressed in french and russian business deals with saddam hussein had undercut sanctions against iraq that left mr bush with little choice other than to stick with a failing multilateralist policy or to act unilaterally now were seeing that in the case of iran "realism" and multilateralism may be mutually exclusive in the effort to curtail proliferation or put another way multilateralism empowers moscow and moscow isnt inclined to make a multilateral sanctions regime effective for russian president vladimir putin realism is a zero sum game that maximizes russian power at u s expense the u s can seek russian cooperation but for russian realists inaction looks like the best option a nuclear capable iran is inimical to russian interests but mr putin may have seen in mr bushs soul a commitment to deny tehran nuclear capability at any cost so why not profit both financially and strategically russia and china have made billions as enablers to irans military ambitions less than a month after the terror attacks moscow signed a &# billion arms deal with tehran the iranian government has paid russias state owned atomstroiexport more than &# billion to construct the bushehr nuclear plant a cia issued report credited russian chinese and north korean experts for irans ballistic missile advances alexander denisov deputy director of the russian federal service for military and technical cooperation said bluntly in "first of all we have to count in our national interests in syria we have a huge market over of soviet made arms the same is true about iran " late last year russias state run rosoboronexport shipped a &# million air defense and missile system to iran last month the head of irans atomic energy organization said his government had won a russian commitment to complete the bushehr reactor prior to a visit by mr putin to tehran later this month while a nuclear iran would threaten u s national security and shred the international non proliferation regime a u s military strike on iran would be costly iranians may find mr ahmadinejad odious but they may respond to a strike by rallying around the flag the iranian revolutionary guard is also capable of striking anywhere from baghdad to buenos aires and is able to set lebanon and even northern israel aflame on sept the islamic revolutionary guard corps claimed the ability to monitor all movement in the strait of hormuz and persian gulf the threat is clear any conflict with iran could drive oil over &# a barrel this would likely hurt the u s economy but it would also accelerate russias return to a dominant position in the world russian realists relish such a scenario the kremlin has converted its multibillion dollar oil windfall into power and influence mr putin has increased defense procurement by more than over the past two years russia has developed a new class of nuclear submarines and a new generation of nuclear missiles moscow leverages money into military strength already russia uses european aversion to conflict to its advantage the same european leaders upon whose good faith ms rice pegs u s national security have been willing to demote the czech republic and poland to second class status within nato to assuage the kremlin during the george h w bush administration ms rice was the point woman for soviet affairs on the national security council she distinguished herself for poor instincts with her opposition to ukrainian independence among other issues what ms rice believes conciliatory mr putin sees as weakness she may confuse realism with idealism mr putin the former kgb apparatchik will not realism may prevail but not washingtons realism the defiant mr ahmadinejad offers the white house a stark choice live with a nuclear iran or take action to stop it winning russian approval is a chimera delaying an inevitable decision mr rubin editor of the middle east quarterly is a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute
