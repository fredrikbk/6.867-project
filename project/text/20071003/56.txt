heaps of trouble renting a car becomes a headache industry cuts costs by using vehicles longer adding fees its like rent a wreck michael klatt misses the days when rental cars were shiny and new in june he rented a ford taurus in fort lauderdale fla that had loose steering and stained seats "i was literally touching it to see if it was wet " he says the car which had miles on it also had brakes that were a little wonky he had to push down hard on the pedal to make them work "before you didnt get a car with to miles " the new hill n c resident and longtime hertz customer says "you can tell they ride rough they have a shimmy going down the road the seats have stains on them its like rent a wreck " paula rivera a hertz spokeswoman says the companys fleet age typically to months and to miles hasnt changed and that its cars are maintained in accordance with manufacturer guidelines but while customers and car rental companies debate whether the quality of rental cars is sliding the rental companies are indeed implementing stingier policies as they look to cut costs vanguard car rental which operates national car rental and alamo rent a car says that there are about more miles on its vehicles on average fleet wide now compared with a year ago hertz is being less generous with its loyalty program and after hours drop offs and some customers say rental car companies are being more nitpicky about where they refuel with some renters being slapped with fuel fees if they fill up more than a few miles from the airport rental car companies have been pinched because auto makers desperate to get their own finances under control are curtailing the practice of selling less profitable "program" cars to fleets program cars are vehicles that rental companies buy at a reduced cost then resell at prearranged prices through auction lots usually after around nine months the auto makers used that avenue to rid themselves of excess production so rental companies are now filling their fleets with a larger share of "risk" cars cars they ultimately have to sell themselves possibly at a loss companies say that consumers shouldnt notice a difference in their rental cars even if they have more mileage vanguard which enterprise rent a car co recently bought says the additional miles on its cars is nothing dramatic also the cars are maintained by manufacturer certified mechanics and generally disposed of before they reach miles industry observers agree "the cars are maintained fairly well " says chris brown managing editor of the trade publication auto rental news higher gasoline prices may also be spurring some companies to be a bit more stringent about refueling before jason smith returned his rental car at chicagos ohare international airport in august he filled up at a gas station miles away it never occurred to him he might be charged for having less than a full tank but the needle had nudged just below "f " the attendant at the national car rental site charged him for an eighth of a tank mr smith says which works out to nearly &# "i showed them the receipt but they were like sorry youll have to take that up with corporate " he says national stands by that decision "were not giving away gasoline " says charles pulley a spokesman for vanguard its clear that rental companies have to be careful about gas because gas prices are high and profit margins on rentals are slim the typical margin on a &# rental is around &# which is not much more than the price of a gallon of gas companies need to be stingy industry experts say "this is an area where profits can literally leak out of the fuel tank " says neil abrams president of abrams consulting group inc a car rental consultancy dollar thrifty automotive group inc says its policy is that renters need to fill up within miles of the return location and be prepared to show their receipt if they dont they can be charged for refueling which generally includes a per gallon charge and a service fee enterprise hertz and avis budget group inc say they do not mandate where renters refuel vanguard says so as well but steve clark who rented a car from alamo in orlando in april says he was told by the rental agent that he had to refuel within a three mile radius of the return site mr pulley the vanguard spokesman says thats not the policy of either the company or the individual rental location "there obviously was some misunderstanding " he says consumers who pre pay for their gas with the rental company usually have to pay about a quarter more than the typical price at the pump but those who waive that option can be charged &# to &# a gallon if the company says the tank isnt full enough the problem with having to refuel so near the return site consumers say is that some gas stations use their proximity to rental car drop off areas as an excuse to gouge customers "that does go on " says geoff sundstrom a spokesman for aaa the automobile association mr smith the national renter says thats why he filled up miles away from ohare in orlando the suncoast energy gas station near orlando international airport was charging &# for regular unleaded as of yesterday well above the citys average which is &# according to aaa the station also doesnt have a large sign displaying its prices which can lead customers to start pumping before realizing the price bob barnes the station manager explains that the price is posted on the pump as required that it costs more to operate a station by the airport because of high property taxes and that the price is actually a deal for rushed rental car returners "if youre in a real hurry and you just drop it off at the rental car return its going to cost you &# a gallon to do it " he says some new car rental policies are hitting the companies most loyal customers hertz has become a bit less generous with its loyalty program and has added some new fees the company which ford motor co sold two years ago to a group of investors the carlyle group clayton dubilier &amp rice and merrill lynch global private equity recently announced that in many cases the cost of redemptions in its # awards program will rise starting march the cost of a non peak free rental day certificate for example will increase to points from generally members get one point per dollar spent in addition hertz in february instituted new charges for after hours returns hertz customers who return their car after the rental location has closed now incur charges until the location reopens the company says it made that change because of an increased number of disputes over both vehicle damage and the exact time when cars are returned despite the nickel and diming industry observers say car rentals are still a decent deal compared with the rest of the travel industry the rental companies have hardly engendered the disgust that the airlines did this summer with their record delays and though the cost of a rental is rising the increase isnt greater than that of other travel industries mr abrams says that rates are up between and for the year as of monday a midsize car booked a week in advance for one day cost &# according to the abrams travel data rate index up from the same time last year meanwhile the average daily rate at a hotel in the u s in august rose to &# according to smith travel research the industry would like to raise rates further but competition is preventing them from doing so says michael j kane of vrcg inc a car rental consulting firm
