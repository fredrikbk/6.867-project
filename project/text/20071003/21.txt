business world wising up on health care four years ago john kerry raised himself in our estimation by a simple act of analysis he said that covering the uninsured and controlling costs were two very different problems and fixing the former might well make the latter worse we perhaps give him more credit than he deserves in restating his point but like the lost arts of our antediluvian forefathers his insight in any case failed to become part of the hard won intellectual heritage of the democratic party hillary et al continue down the easier poll tested path of insisting that "universal coverage" is a solution to all that ails the u s health care system thats one reason americans today arent getting their understanding of the health care policy challenge from politicians or even the media theyre getting it from their employers who are introducing copays health savings accounts and other consumer activation measures with an explanation that employees can understand you must have some financial skin in the game if we are to get our moneys worth from our spending on health care which brings us to this years source of faint desperate hope for health care leadership if you turn your head a certain angle and squint last weeks deal between gm and the uaw could open the door for a bold experiment in correcting the misincentives of our insurance system the big threes dealings with their employees over the decades have been a hothouse for cultivating the perversities that flow from excessive reliance on third party payment and first dollar coverage now that the uaw is collecting a &# billion lump sum from gm and taking on responsibility for retiree health care the union has a big stake in changing the incentives of the system to make sure the money lasts the operative concept is "coinsurance rate" which a rational uaw should want to enlarge more spending should pass through the beneficiarys pocket less from a distant bureaucratic check cutter note this doesnt mean "cutting" benefits it means giving each uaw retiree a cash account to spend on health care plus incentives to use the money wisely say by letting him or her roll over unused amounts and keep a share of what isnt spent here the uaw might sit down with whole foods ceo john mackey his company trimmed health care spending by in the first year after shifting to such a coverage plan that savings also happens roughly to match what economic studies estimate for the economy as a whole if the national "coinsurance" rate were corrected for the tax bias in favor of insured spending remember the &# billion that gm says is the present value of its health care liability that figure is based on todays level of spending and the historic growth rate reduce the level of spending and or slow the rate of growth and the economics of the plan shift managed well the &# billion could even become a source of net new wealth for uaw retirees ok that such intellectual daring might be found in the cubicles of solidarity house seems unlikely one reported condition of last weeks deal was gms agreement to help in lobbying for national health care how good a steward of health care dollars could the uaw intend to be if its already looking for a bailout under the agreement too gm is on the hook for future contributions if the existing funds prove insufficient hardly an incentive to conserve those funds all this already sounds like a replay of the caterpillar health care trust albeit with bigger numbers containing just &# million that trust was set up by the uaw to pay the additional premium so employees could continue to receive more gold plated coverage than caterpillars own premium cap would permit result the money ran out in six years and now the union is suing caterpillar but lets revert to pollyanna mode assume the uaw now controlling real assets discovers the wisdom of giving gm retirees real incentives to economize on health care to preserve and grow the wealth of their new veba or voluntary employee benefit association if gm and the uaw can do it why cant washington transfer its lump sum liability for medicare and social security to beneficiaries or does this sound too much like george bushs ownership society then call it something else say personal account socialism at some point the distinction between public and private becomes theological a liability exists whether its funded by taxes or savings and theres nobody but us to make good on the ious we write to ourselves the big difference the one that matters is incentives even a national health insurance pooling scheme designed by hillary clinton would be smart to use private accounts to give consumers incentives to make sure were getting bang for our health care buck we know where hillary stands she told denny hastert that americans cant be trusted to make their own spending decisions in the fine print of her latest plan is a resurrection of s "global budget " in which washington would dictate an absolute level of medical spending for the whole society the uaw has shown recent signs of wanting to live in the real world having the imagination and courage to turn its health care trust into a genuine source of wealth for retired members would be a demonstration project the political class could benefit from too mr jenkins edits "political diary " the editorial pages daily email newsletter
