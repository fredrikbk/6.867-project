a kid on the home front goes to war circa dorothy rabinowitz proved to me what was wrong with ken burnss televison special on world war ii "televison the perilous fight " leisure &amp arts sept mr burns was born too late to comprehend the feelings of those of us who lived back then he prefers to find fault with america in while sitting in the living room by myself listening to a kids program i heard a radio announcer describing pearl harbor next day at school our class listened to a radio and heard fdr declare war both i and my husband had older relatives in the armed forces none of them died in battle but they experienced battle and its aftershocks my navy husband would have been part of the invasion of japan in but the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki prevented the invasion and the projected huge loss of american lives we in america accepted the atomic bomb horrible as it was as the price of peace meantime on the home front we had "victory gardens " and we practiced running into shelters during imagined "air raids " in school and in public arenas and even in movie theaters there were patriotic songs we would always "rise to " we also gathered tin foil and took it to collection sites to help in the war effort for metal little things but they meant a lot to us after the war a whole generation of young women got to go to college because their brothers were eligible for the gi bill many things mr burns wants to lay at americas doorstep were admittedly handled badly such as the japanese internments but whats new about that whats important is that americans as always did what they could to make amends afterward the point is our cause was just and war is always hell maryal stone dale chicago
