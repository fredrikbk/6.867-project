green chemistry technique gains corporate converts the best way for industrial manufacturers to deal with frequently toxic chemical waste is to avoid producing it thats the idea behind a new process with the potential to enable some types of complex molecules present in such things as certain drugs and perfumes to be formed without generating byproducts that might otherwise flow into wastewater or drift up smokestacks the technique was developed by university of texas scientist michael j krische with backing from government grants and various pharmaceutical industry players the process triggers bonds between carbon atoms using a twist on what is known as catalytic hydrogenation a standard chemical reaction in industrial settings typically deployed to bond carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms carbon carbon bonds constitute the backbones of complex molecules but most reactions that generate them cast off byproducts conversely hydrogenation reactions result in molecules that incorporate all atoms in the starting materials meaning none are cast off as waste mr krische said his technique retains the benefits of standard hydrogenation reactions but generates the carbon carbon bonds needed to build larger more complex molecules "you get carbon carbon bond formations in completely byproduct free transformations " mr krische said the work which has received funding from merck &amp co eli lilly &amp co and johnson &amp johnson is in the advanced research stage and it recently won a prestigious "green chemistry" award from the environmental protection agency green chemistry encompasses myriad processes aimed at conserving resources or stemming the release of toxic materials the concept has been around for more than a decade but it has been winning an increasing number of corporate converts in recent years high energy prices public concerns about global warming and the potential for green techniques to cut costs associated with waste cleanup or regulations have sparked the interest businesses spend more than &# billion annually complying with environmental rules according to federal estimates to be sure "theres not any one technology that is going to reduce all your waste " said ralph p volante vice president and global head of process research at merck mr volante said merck has many initiatives under way in the broad area of green chemistry with recent successes including januvia a new diabetes drug which is being produced using a chemical process designed to lower water consumption and dissolved byproducts still he said mr krisches research has the potential to be particularly useful because carbon carbon bond formation is an essential tool of organic chemistry "its going to provide the basis for application i think on multiple products not just for us " he said mr volante thinks the technique could be scaled up for various industrial uses in five to years although he believes it is too early to speculate on how merck might deploy it paul anastas a pioneer in green chemistry and director of yale universitys center for green chemistry &amp green engineering also called mr krisches work intriguing he noted that numerous green techniques previously adopted by corporations such as processes to eliminate arsenic or lead from certain products have been playing a significant role in stemming hazardous waste production in the u s toxic chemical waste tracked by the epa totaled an estimated billion pounds in the most recent figures available compared with billion pounds in
