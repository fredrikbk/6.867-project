our romantic view of computers as pals is now over see ad social realism on television usually doesnt involve commercials but some of the most realistic seconds on tv these days are in ads that happen to involve computers and that show how far we have come in understanding them its not a flattering picture so the commercials werent made by a computer company they are by comcast which as a cable company doesnt need to worry about making computers look good so it was able to notice that people in the real world dont use computers the way people in commercials do in most computer commercials the machines are like the army allowing us to be all that we can be in comcasts world theyre no better than an addictive bad habit in one spot a young man sits on the couch pretending to be interested in a telephone conversation with his girlfriend while in fact hes surfing the web for sports scores in another commercial a computer owner this time a something male sits in his living room so absorbed with the notebook and phone and tv in front of him that he is oblivious to the cries of his elderly father a few feet away there are other spots in the series but the themes are the same showing gadget owners with glazed eyes and alienated from everyone around them no one looks remotely happy visitors from mars would marvel at these remarkable machines that had managed to enslave the earth and keep its inhabitants immobile asocial and mute it should be noted that the spots are meant to be and are extremely funny "we dont sell computers we sell the internet " said marvin o davis comcasts senior vice president of marketing "we tried to capture in an authentic manner how people were using our service and came up with the observation that this multitasking is happening once we cracked that the floodgates opened " to appreciate how far we have come in our regard for computers consider an apple computer commercial from years ago that can be found on youtube that is unless apple has since invoked copyright to have it removed it was selling the companys short lived lisa a &# version of the mac its a glorious sunday morning a hip young executive a youthful kevin costner is bicycling into the office dog in tow in the background we hear chirping birds and windham hill piano music everything is gorgeous even the buildings empty lobby he gets to his desk where his apple sits he couldnt be happier he even smiles when he has to tell his significant other on the phone that he wont be home until tomorrow in this relationship the other woman is a computer the announcer has one of those deep voices that gets under your skin and tells us "the way some businesspeople spend their time has very little to do with the clock " the commercial aims to tell us how we can escape the life of a to drone get a computer and we too can spend sundays in the office getting ahead of the dimwits not enlightened enough to have one of their own no one would try such a pitch today when computers give us the privilege of never being away from the office at all another way to follow evolving social attitudes about computers is through the "concept videos" made by computer companies analogous to detroits concept cars these videos are designed to show a companys visionary idea about what computers might be one day without obliging it to actually build them the best place to look at these videos is at paleofuture paleo future blogspot com which allows an amazing look back at visions of the future starting back in the s the exhibit is curated with great wit by year old matt novak of minneapolis most of these retrofutures are full of optimistic technology like what youd see at a worlds fair or disneylands world of tomorrow computer company concept videos tend to be set in the immediate future a happy time of well dressed people who spend their days either running small businesses or preparing sales reports paleofuture has two videos from the early s one from sun microsystems and the other from at&amp t telling us about life in these videos avoid the silliness of similar efforts from the s such as the movie from philco ford showing moms in pushing a button to make dinner still they manage to blur easy engineering problems with very hard ones which results in their being off by miles in some of their predictions in most of these videos for example the computer understands casual spoken english well enough to be able to act as an ever alert concierge dialing up business associates on the phone and yanking reports on demand from its memory then cheerfully saying something back to their owner after finishing a task mr novak says that since then the computer industry seems to have gotten smarter about how dumb computers can be and what theyre really good for "computers of the future were to be artificial humans " he says "at some point we realized that we didnt care to talk with machines we wanted to communicate with humans more efficiently " email me at lee gomes wsj com
