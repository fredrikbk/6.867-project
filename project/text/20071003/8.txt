a helping hand a friendly smile new york subway machines now sell tokens so clerks struggle with job of being nice to commuters new york when subway tokens were brass the clerks who sold them were faceless mumblers behind bars and later scowling mumblers behind bulletproof glass chitchat wasnt in the job description then out went the tokens and in came machines that sold plastic tickets all of a sudden subway token clerks were being ejected from their unsociable bubbles with instructions to kibitz one recent consequence for a businessman passing through a turnstile was that carmine dargenio approached him from behind and adjusted the accidentally upturned collar of his pinstriped suit "you get a rapport " said mr dargenio who is years old and lives alone in staten island he stood on duty at the rector street entrance to the r train in lower manhattan hammered together boards and a puddle blocked one stairwell in the old token booth where he is permitted to rest for minutes an hour a note taped to the wall by a previous occupant read "there are rats in the booth they are in the ceiling " "that particular gent " mr dargenio said recalling his collar adjustment "i dont know his name i know he has grandchildren they live in atlanta of course new yorkers are " just then a train came thundering into the station and drowned him out over the past two years the metropolitan transportation authority and its subway subdivision new york city transit have closed down token booths nearly a quarter of the total in a system that sells five million rides a day the booths are still there but now they are called "kiosks " and now unseated token clerks like mr dargenio have become "roving station agents " a less than voluntary corps of subterranean official greeters except the subway isnt disney world by turns its a hot cold lonely mobbed mass transit museum of begging mugging and flooding emergencies are numerous and diversions continuous the maps are indecipherable the loudspeakers incomprehensible straphangers get mad and they take it out on the face in the glass booth a cornell university survey of station workers found that while on duty had put up with verbal or physical threats from customers but for the roving clerks customer service on the subway isnt bulletproof anymore their defense now is personal attitude modification "when youre inside the booth nobody can get to you hit you spit on you " says adriana carney a rover at wall street on the lexington avenue line "whatever problem they have theyll go away eventually now that im outside people say youre so nice i tell them you havent seen the other side of me " in when the mta announced that some booths were on their way out the plan was to sack the clerks the transport workers union went to court and forced public hearings the public turned out to be so scared of being alone in unstaffed stations that the mta backed off with computers in charge it looked at first as if the cast out clerks would just stand around smiling it hasnt worked out that way the mtas computers have foul tempers too one evening rush hour at th street on the seventh avenue line commuters crushed up to a ticket machine while azoy sarkar in a maroon rovers vest bobbed in back shouting "need help " a woman stood staring at the display a &# bill in hand and a finger poised to buy a &# ticket mr sarkar cut into the scrum stayed her arm and pointed to a note in the screens corner "maximum change &# " thats one surprise among others the "no bills" notice halfway through a &# purchase the nine step process for adding &# to a senior pass the cash eating mechanical jam resolved only with a receipt by mailing in a form and waiting for a refund now that they no longer make change rovers supply tech support and psychiatry after the woman came up with a &# bill for her &# ride mr sarkar personally escorted her to the turnstile and delivered her to the uptown local over the next hour he rescued a dozen more riders trapped in ticket machine limbo he told them all "on behalf of new york city transit i apologize " throughout it as buskers drummed "incidents" halted train service twice and thousands of commuters stormed past him into penn station and beyond mr sarkar answered questions a hundred of them which way to the port authority to chelsea piers to the empire state building even "i need to catch a train in one minute and i need you to tell me which way to go " "met moma macy i know everything " said mr sarkar hes an immigrant from bangladesh and a former taxi driver delighted to be on the public payroll rovers can make more than &# a year plus benefits "if you love this job " mr sarkar said "its easy if you dont love this job its very very hard " tony sneakers doesnt love this job thats his old schoolyard name hed rather not use his real one at he has worked eight years inside the booth now his rovers assignment has left him in a deserted station in deep brooklyn late on a saturday night felonies reported on the subway have lately declined to a year from in but when they happen its often at times and places like this "tonight i had a kid pull down his pants in front of me " tony said "one of these days " from the darkened street above came a mans voice shouting "i want beer " tony said "they get drunk and they want to travel im not supposed to let them in they curse throw garbage i move away quick enough " four people came in asking directions to long island city in queens "take the q to prospect park for the s to franklin for the a to hoyt schermerhorn for the g " said tony in dont bother me tones "read the map its all there " as the four retreated to a map taped to the wall tony said "the job is mindless i miss my brain " sometimes rovers go missing altogether signs on empty booths say the rovers are in the station when theyre nowhere to be seen many small exits have also been made over into fully automated entrances leaving riders to do battle alone with ticket machines and tall turnstiles fondly known as "iron maidens " but the mta says it has no plans to buck the new norm as ticket booths vanish in paris washington london and new york the carmine dargenios of the world are the last clerks standing between commuter and computer "this job here is what you make it " mr dargenio said at his rector street stop with years seniority he rates a post not too busy not too lonely where he can fill some gaps in service while subway big shots fret over floods fare hikes and communications flubs as trains enter the station mr dargenio checks his watch and notes the time its the only way to gauge when the next train might roll in just as one did a woman digging in her purse couldnt find her ticket mr dargenio hit a button and let her in another woman struggled with a big cardboard box he opened a gate and let her in too "how was your weekend " he asked and she said "so so " after helping a belgian family catch a brooklyn train he actually picked up a suitcase mr dargenio took a chocolate cake break at a luncheonette on the street "inside the booth you cant give them that personal touch " he was saying as a young couple sat down at a far table "how you doing " he called "remember me " they didnt seem to "it does make me feel good " mr dargenio went on "i think maybe ive changed a little myself " he looked up and brightened as a woman in a waitress uniform walked in "i know you " he said she glared at him "you know me " "sure i do " said mr dargenio "from the subway " corrections &amp
