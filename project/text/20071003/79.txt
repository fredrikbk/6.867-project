margin for error how stocks could be hit by falling profits corporate profits are in danger even if we dont get a recession investors are anxiously awaiting third quarter earnings worried that a slowing economy may have damaged company profits but even if the economy keeps humming along things could get rough for stock market investors the problem corporate profits have been growing far faster than the economy that cant go on forever and that means you may want to tweak your strategy rising share its reasonable to expect share prices to climb as the economy grows after all an expanding economy should drive up corporate profits and that in turn ought to propel share prices higher but in fact over the past years the economy has grown an average of a year and the shares in the standard &amp poors index have soared an annual tack on dividends and you get an annual total return for the s&amp p of according to morningstars ibbotson associates why have stock prices handily outpaced economic growth maybe the most commonly cited reason is the stock markets rising price earnings multiple today the s&amp p is at times reported earnings versus less than eight times earnings in early one worry this rise in p es could go into reverse handing big losses to stock market investors there is however another reason for the stock markets dazzling performance one that might seem more comforting while corporate profits were sluggish through the s they have skyrocketed since then climbing at a blistering a year since impressed the problem is corporate profits have raced ahead of the economy which grew just a year over that stretch result in corporate profits claimed of national income versus in and just in these figures were calculated by washingtons center on budget and policy priorities using commerce department data the last time corporate profits claimed such a large share of the economys rewards was in falling behind this trend with profits taking an ever larger share of the economy "cant go on forever " notes new york economic consultant peter bernstein author of "capital ideas evolving " "its impossible for that to be sustained because if it was all income would be profits " mr bernstein notes that the s&amp p companies now get of their earnings from abroad and he speculates that the corporate profit bonanza has been partly driven by foreign growth but its pretty clear the surge in earnings has also come at the expense of employees while corporate profits have been snagging a larger share of national income the portion going to wages and salaries has shrunk declining from in to in perhaps thats the reason the economy has been booming but many americans feel today like theyre falling behind "this creates a real risk " reckons robert arnott chairman of research affiliates in pasadena calif "were in the red zone where the risk of political backlash is significant and where the risk of mean reversion among earnings is significant " playing defense this doesnt mean were in for some sort of market calamity just as the s&amp p is unlikely to retreat to eight times earnings so corporate profits probably wont fall back to s of national income but earnings cant go on claiming an ever larger share of the economy that suggests corporate profit growth will likely slow from the recent dizzying pace and thus stocks could face lower returns in the years ahead its hard to know how all this will play out and your portfolio should reflect the uncertainty allocate or of your stock market money to foreign shares consider stashing a little more than usual in bonds and cash investments also keep both investment costs and your portfolios tax bill low by making the most of retirement accounts and favoring low expense index funds that way you will keep more of whatever the market delivers maybe most important rein in your expectations dont bank on earning the stock markets a year long term historical average and to compensate boost your savings rate to or even of your pretax income
