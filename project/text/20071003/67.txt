lab toxin mishaps rise missing shipments accidents top in u s since associated press washington u s laboratories handling the worlds deadliest germs and toxins have experienced more than accidents and missing shipments since and the number is increasing as more labs do the work no deaths have been reported as a result of the incidents and the mishaps never put the public at risk regulators said but the documented cases reflect poorly on procedures and oversight at high security labs some of which work with organisms and poisons that can cause illnesses with no cure in some cases labs have failed to report accidents as required by law the mishaps include workers being bitten or scratched by infected animals skin cuts needle sticks and more according to a review by the associated press of confidential reports submitted to federal regulators they describe accidents involving anthrax bird flu virus monkey pox and plague causing bacteria at labs in states more than two dozen incidents were still under investigation the number of accidents has risen steadily through august the most recent period covered in the reports obtained by the ap labs reported accidents and lost shipments this year nearly double the number reported during all of at the same time the number of labs approved by the government to handle the deadliest substances has nearly doubled to since and are of the highest security level labs are routinely inspected by federal regulators just once every three years but accidents trigger interim inspections in a new report by congressional investigators the government accountability office said little is known about labs that arent federally funded or dont work with any of dangerous substances the government monitors most closely "no single federal agency has the mission to track the overall number of these labs in the united states " said the gao report expected to be released this week "consequently no agency is responsible for determining the risks associated with the proliferation of these labs " the house energy and commerce investigations subcommittee plans hearings on the issue tomorrow the lab incidents have sparked bipartisan concern "it may be only a matter of time before our nation has a public health incident with potentially catastrophic results " said rep bart stupak d mich the panels chairman the subcommittees senior republican ed whitfield of kentucky said "currently there is a hodgepodge system of federal oversight regulating the laboratories responsible for researching the deadliest germs and diseases i expect to probe witnesses about how to improve oversight of these laboratories in a post world " lab accidents have affected other countries too the united kingdoms health and safety agency concluded there was a "strong probability" a leaking pipe at a u k lab manufacturing vaccines for foot and mouth disease was the source of an outbreak of the illness in livestock earlier this year britain was forced to suspend exports of livestock meat and milk products and destroy livestock the disease doesnt infect humans accidents arent the only concern while medical experts consider it unlikely that a lab employee will become sick and infect others these labs have strict rules to prevent anyone from stealing organisms or toxins and using them for bioterrorism the reports were so sensitive the bush administration refused to release them under the freedom of information act citing an antibioterrorism law aimed at preventing terrorists from locating stockpiles of poisons and learning who handles them among the previously undisclosed accidents in rockville md ferret no inoculated with bird flu virus bit a technician at bioqual inc on the thumb in july the worker was placed on home quarantine for five days and directed to wear a mask to protect others an oklahoma state university lab in stillwater in december couldnt account for a dead mouse inoculated with bacteria that causes joint pain weakness lymph node swelling and pneumonia the rodent one of to be incinerated was never found but the lab said an employee "must have forgotten to remove the dead mouse from the cage" before the cage was sterilized in albuquerque n m an employee at the lovelace respiratory research institute was bitten on the hand by an infected monkey in september the animal was ill from an infection of bacteria that causes plague "when the gloves were removed the skin appeared to be broken in two or three places " the report said the worker was referred to a doctor but nothing more was disclosed in fort collins colo a worker at a federal centers for disease control and prevention facility found in january three broken vials of russian spring summer encephalitis virus wearing only a laboratory coat and gloves he used tweezers to remove broken glass and moved the materials to a special container the virus a potential bio warfare agent could cause brain inflammation and is supposed to be handled in a lab requiring pressure suits that resemble space suits the report didnt say whether the worker became ill other reports describe leaks of contaminated waste dropped containers with cultures of bacteria and viruses and defective seals on airtight containers some recount missing or lost shipments including plague bacteria that was supposed to be delivered to the armed forces institute of pathology in the wayward plague shipment was discovered eventually in belgium and incinerated safely the reports must be submitted to regulators whenever a lab suffers a theft loss or release of any of substances known as "select agents" a government list of germs and toxins that represent the horror stories of the worlds worst medical tragedies for humans and animals a senior cdc official richard besser said his agency is committed to ensuring that u s labs are safe and that all such incidents are disclosed to the government he said he was unaware of any risk to the public resulting from infections among workers at the high security labs but he acknowledged that regulators are worried about accidents that could go unreported "if youre asking if its possible for someone to not report an infection and have it missed that clearly is a concern that we have " dr besser said
