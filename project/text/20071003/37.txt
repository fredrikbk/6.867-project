cutting your tax bill as stocks soar many investors who face hefty levies on capital gains are harvesting their losses to minimize the pain with stock prices surging many investors are realizing big gains when they sell off some of their holdings but they should focus on their losers and not just their triumphs investment advisers say that many already are offloading the losers in their portfolios as they try to minimize their capital gains tax bill and that many plan to do even more tax related selling in coming weeks some investors say theyre lightening their holdings not only for tax reasons but also because of fears that the stock markets rally may be short lived amid such concerns as mortgage defaults a sinking dollar and a possible recession whatever the case financial advisers say more people should consider the virtues of whats called "tax loss harvesting " among investors who recently have been selling is linda schafer who lives in the triad area of north carolina "in my long term portfolio i do look for stocks that have losses and take the losses and offset them against the gains ive got in others " she says in recent months she has sold some stocks she was looking to get out of anyway including u s steel corp and wyeth tax advisers agree that its important never to make any investment move solely for tax reasons but if you are thinking of selling some of your losers anyway this could be a good time to pull the trigger ms schafer has been putting more of her money into cash as a defensive move with stock prices up strongly she is starting to get concerned "some of these stocks are so extended " she says yesterday the dow jones industrial average fell points to so far this year the dow industrials are up after a gain last year giving millions of investors large amounts of capital gains the basic concept of tax loss selling sounds fairly simple but the rules can get complex in a hurry for starters you can use realized capital losses to offset capital gains in your stocks bonds and mutual funds and theres no dollar limit suppose you sold stock earlier this year for a &# gain now you sell other stocks and take a &# loss that soaks up all your gains thus enabling you to avoid paying capital gains tax you may even be able to use losses to offset some of your ordinary income suppose your losses are even larger than your gains or you dont have any gains in that case you can use as much as &# of those net losses each year or as much as &# if youre married but filing separate returns to offset wages interest and other ordinary income excess amounts can be carried over into future years this "net loss" rule is especially significant since wages and other ordinary income typically are subject to much higher federal income tax rates than capital gains the top federal income tax rate on salary interest and other regular income is by contrast the top rate on long term capital gains on stocks bonds and most other securities typically is only "long term" typically refers to investments that youve owned for more than a year "short term" refers to a year or less investors who do decide to sell losers should be careful not to violate what are known as the "wash sale" rules which can be devilishly complex in general a wash sale occurs when you sell a security at a loss and within days you buy exactly the same thing or something "substantially identical " that means days before or after the sale if you violate the rules you cant deduct your loss instead youre supposed to add the loss that wasnt allowed to the cost of the new securities the result is your "cost basis" in the new securities the figure which you use to calculate future gains or losses what does "substantially identical" mean unfortunately it isnt clear for example its clear you cant sell general electric co stock at a loss buy back the same stock the following day and deduct your loss but what would happen if you sell ge at a loss today and buy it back minutes later for your ira does that violate the wash sale rule tax lawyers say its unclear many however advise against it just to be safe and because it probably doesnt pass the smell test investors who sell a security at a loss can avoid running afoul of the wash sale rules simply by buying back a different security jim pflugrath of the woodlands texas sold shares in wisdomtree international smallcap dividend exchange traded fund which holds small cap international stocks to capture a short term loss on the same day he bought a different etf with a similar investing focus "my asset allocation remains the same yet im able to benefit from this tax loss harvesting " says mr pflugrath who hopes to use the short term loss to offset some of his ordinary income "the government is paying part of my loss " capital losses may be especially valuable when used to offset gains from art antiques and other collectibles which are subject to higher tax rates for example one new york couple made a handsome profit this year by selling a wine collection they had accumulated over many years says nadine gordon lee president of prosper advisors llc in armonk n y to help cut their tax bill they sold some securities at a loss during july and august and expect to do even more selling soon ms lee says the couple is especially eager to "harvest" losses this year because long term capital gains on wine collections and other so called collectibles typically are taxed at a top federal rate of before you rush to harvest your losses however be sure to check with an accountant or lawyer who understands the intricacies this issue can get complex when investors have combinations of short term gains and losses and long term gains and losses for details see irs publication clif purkiser of honolulu says he will probably sell some of his regional bank stocks such as first horizon national corp at a short term loss later this year to offset capital gains and some of his ordinary income he plans to replace first horizon with other bank stocks such as bank of america corp the year old retiree says hes "ruthless" about cleaning out any short term losers by the end of each year and typically waits until after thanksgiving to do any harvesting since he has a clearer picture of his taxes be aware though that waiting until late in the year to harvest losses can be a costly mistake says bob gordon president of twenty first securities corp in new york "we think theres much more opportunity available if you loss harvest all year " he says consider taking your losses "early and often " says duncan w richardson executive vice president and chief equity investment officer of eaton vance corp "early tax loss harvesting helps investors lower the tax bite preserve capital and control their emotions three essentials to successful long term investment " dont put off taking action until november or december each year because the markets may be buffeted around that time by "emotional selling" as many other procrastinators rush for the same exit mr richardson says "its human nature to delay admitting a mistake as long as possible " procrastinators face an important deadline soon earlier this year millions of people received six month filing extensions from the irs that gives them until monday oct to file their federal income tax

sharply this year investors can save on capital gains taxes by selling losing holdings use capital losses to offset capital gains on stocks and funds with no dollar limit offset as much as &# of net
