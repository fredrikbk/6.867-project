turner sports takes swing at new baseball coverage president of unit hopes regular season excitement continues in the playoffs turner sports had just hours to prepare for this afternoons broadcast of major league baseballs first playoff game the colorado rockies taking on the philadelphia phillies in philadelphia after a late night national league wild card tiebreaker monday between the rockies and the san diego padres that game was just the latest twist in an unusually dramatic baseball season despite the rush to set up todays broadcast the cliffhanger season was good news for turner sports which is airing postseason major league baseball games for the first time as part of a seven year tv rights deal starting today turner sports will exclusively air divisional series playoff games in both the american league and the national league it will also exclusively air the national league championship series while fox airs the american league championship series under the deal turner and fox will then alternate championship series games next season turners tbs channel will also air national games on sunday afternoons "its a nice way to start off so people can get accustomed to the network and get to know where postseason baseball is going to be for the next couple weeks " says david levy who holds the dual titles of president of turner entertainment ad sales and president of turner sports both are units of turner broadcasting system a division of time warner turner is hoping the drama in which many teams remained in contention until late in the season will continue into the postseason boosting viewership from last year when world series viewership fell from the previous year it wont hurt that this years playoffs feature a roster of teams from big markets including boston new york los angeles philadelphia and chicago to boost awareness of the games tbs has launched a web site called "tbs hot corner " the site this postseason will feature actress alyssa milano and a team of commentators and analysts including cal ripken jr tony gwynn and others turner is paying more than &# million each year for the baseball rights according to people familiar with the matter its part of a broader move by turner to increase the proportion of original programming on both tbs and its sister channel tnt after years of a diet heavy on movies like "pretty woman" and "air force one " below mr levy talks about airing mlb postseason games for the first time and how turner is trying to compete with the broadcast networks with more original programming wsj why do a deal with mlb when ratings for baseball have generally been declining mr levy heres a great thing about sports in general all sports goes in cycles we had looked at baseball as an opportunity because we thought it was going to be an up cycle a lot has to do with the pennant races that you just saw over the last couple of weeks and the histories of some of the greatest records of all time that were eclipsed hank aarons home run tom glavine reaching his th win sammy sosa home runs theres just been a tremendous amount of record breaking opportunities this year we look at it as an opportunity in an up cycle second at turner we go after top tier sports properties wsj turner sports is airing the playoff games for the first time what are you doing to promote the new deal mr levy we have a high profile video with bon jovi a minute piece thats been in almost movie theaters across the country we have outdoor media in the top baseball markets we have ads on radio over the air tv spot cable and newspapers and magazines i would say its equal spending to our other top tier sports wsj tnt and tbs are known for running ads during programming can we expect to see the same during playoff games mr levy we dont want to take away from the programming itself but there will be pop ups and other things to promote our programming one of the things that attracted us is this is going to be high rated programming and its a great way to promote other turner programming wsj tnt and tbs have invested in more original programming lately youve got hit shows like "the closer " critics favorites like "saving grace" but also disappointments like "heartland " which was canceled how have advertisers responded to original programming and whats the payoff considering how expensive original programming is mr levy its a very expensive venture you are seeing us invest heavily in original programming and it is our quest to go from of original programming and acquired content to original including sports and acquired advertisers are looking for more and more opportunities to incorporate their messages not just on commercials but throughout the programming lineup with product integration and branded entertainment original programming is becoming a necessity to fulfill those needs wsj with some commercial ratings data out what are some of the things youve learned so far and what changes do you see coming to the industry mr levy were also looking at the length of the pod commercial break how many pods meaning how many commercial breaks do we put in a show years ago the advertising agency was defined by how good their creative was then over time it was how good were their buying habits i believe itll now flip back to the agency being defined once again by their creative because of how the creative is viewed and rated wsj you have a drama called "truth in advertising" in development what are the marketing opportunities mr levy think about what the content of that show is its about an advertising agency you can just imagine the opportunities if they took a brand and went through the entire process of how that brand was launched what the creative side was what the copywriting was and all the fun and antics around it that particular show has numerous opportunities for product placement and branded entertainment and writing into the script itself we are in early conversations because the pilot is being produced as we speak
