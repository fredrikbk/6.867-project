soviet modernist architecture is rediscovered at moma the lost vanguard museum of modern art through oct if the mission and meaning of the museum of modern art are still being debated as it settles into its coolly capacious new home and moves cautiously into the st century the recently appointed philip johnson chief curator of architecture and design barry bergdoll has no trouble relating its past to its present or envisioning the future mr bergdoll a distinguished architectural historian and professor of art history at columbia university brings a scholars perspective to the architecture department for the requisite edginess he has appointed a curator of contemporary architecture andres lepik former chief curator of th and st century architecture at the kunstbibliothek of the staatliche museum in berlin known for his new and unconventional subjects and installations mr bergdolls first show " years of architecture at moma selections from the permanent collection of architectural drawings and models " was a celebration and a reassessment of those first years beginning with the landmark show "modern architecture international exhibition " and the influential book that went with it "the international style architecture since " by philip johnson and henry russell hitchcock after which nothing was ever the same installed in the departments third floor galleries last spring mr bergdolls presentation will return after oct when the present exhibition on early russian modernism completes its run in those years the radical modernism the museum championed has become an accepted part of contemporary life and the shocking new architecture is now the lingua franca of todays built world but architecture has remained a hard sell much slower to enter mainstream taste than the other arts and until recently and with a few notable exceptions the department has promoted the same narrowly defined modernism it originally endorsed with his inaugural choices signaling a more inclusive approach mr bergdoll has put a revisionist spin on the departments course since that epochal initial offering the museum has also been doing a bit of spinning of its own with a series of pre and post move exhibitions and installations that have a similar objective of presenting its treasures in a less dated narrative an effort to which there has been a mixed critical response but if moma chose to display everything upside down it would do nothing to diminish the fact that it is the possessor of the greatest modernist art collection of the th century and people would continue to flock to see it and above all if observation serves to sit in the garden that rarest of midtown pleasures at &# a head mr bergdolls revisionism seems to be on more solid ground than the controversial rehangings in a recent conversation he outlined a program that starts with what he calls "other modernisms " citing expressionism and similar departures from standard modernist practice that simply didnt fit a preferred set of restrictive architectural guidelines and were written out by moma because it sincerely believed that historical or decorative trends had been permanently transcended never to return movements considered marginal and talents too far out of the loop were excluded by the single minded focus on a rigidly reductive international style as the departments emphasis shifted from polemics to collecting a growing archive of drawings led to a belated recognition of the importance of offbeat unbuilt and theoretical work "the visionary" is the second theme mr bergdoll plans to explore for its revelations of the development of ideas and directions in design since the drawings themselves have achieved the status of works of art a third part of his program places particular emphasis on "the art of architectural drawing " a fourth subject scheduled for more attention is urbanism something in which hitchcock and johnson had absolutely no interest frankly preferring the aesthetic and intellectual excitement of defining a new style the new agenda will highlight the presentation of material that not only enriches the story of modernism but changes it dramatically the first of these shows "the lost vanguard soviet modernist architecture " currently on view is a display of achingly beautiful and disturbingly evocative photographs that reveal a chapter in the history of early modernism that hitchcock and johnson had no way of knowing about or including in their carefully constructed scenario after decades of suppression and denial by the soviet union that they even existed of these lost and forgotten buildings have been rediscovered and documented by the photographer richard pare he has traveled across the former soviet union from moscow and st petersburg to kiev kharkov baku and sochi along the black sea making nine trips over years in search of his subject a handsome book published by monacelli accompanies the show it turns out that russian modernism is not paper architecture all theoretical projects and bold colorful constructivist abstractions with a few iconic buildings as we in the west have been taught this body of work was executed in slightly more than one decade of concentrated construction when experimental modernism was officially encouraged before shortages of money and material and a brutal totalitarian dictatorship shut down the program and adopted an overblown classical style there were giant dams and power stations factories government and newspaper offices workers clubs and resorts theaters department stores communal housing with kitchens gymnasiums laundries and child care even garages and bus stops all conceived in the spirit of a new style for a new social order mr pare has produced an unforgettable set of images charged with a poignant sense of loss these abandoned structures with their fading paint peeling walls and shattered rooms still suggest the illusory belief in a perfect world that inspired a gifted group of architects to design for a utopian future the future failed but what time and deterioration have never totally effaced what survives even in their desolate trashed and weedy settings are the daring departures from convention the evidence of bold forms bright colors and crisp clean shapes and the innovations that stretched existing ideas and technology even some of the sense of excitement that infused the undertaking it was all about idealism ambition and hope more than architects are represented and many are textbook names like golosov ginzburg melnikov popov and the vesnin brothers lecorbusiers legendary contribution to the revolution his centrosoyuz of is here and mr pare has also discovered a previously unknown building by the german modernist erich mendelsohn the red banner textile factory of the inertia and neglect that created the shabby surreal soviet landscape is all that has saved this hidden legacy some buildings are still in use the red banner textile factory fills occasional orders a moscow bakery of the sweep of its curving steel counters and still functioning machinery a marvel of engineering efficiency continues to bake bread hours a day moisei ginzburgs narkomfin communal house of an experimental complex of interlocking apartments is falling apart around its remaining elderly inhabitants try to forget mr pares view of a few pathetic mismatched possessions and tattered treasures against flaking blue walls the table set with a single place an assortment of small necessities and a few defeated flowers or the contrast of desolate rooms and halls with photographs from contemporary architectural journals also on display showing them newly built and filled with people and activity konstantin melnikovs extraordinary house designed for his family from to with the fees from his commissions he continued to build well into the s survives but it is threatened by voracious moscow development i was fortunate enough to visit melnikov in a sanatorium just outside of moscow after a clanking trolley ride through a cheerless soviet limbo long after he had left the house a few years before he died an old white haired man in blue striped pajamas came out to greet me and we sat on a shabby wooden bench under a lilac tree and talked about the past his eyes lit up as he described how he would go down to party headquarters with rolls of blueprints under his arm and how enthusiastically they would be received and then he spoke sadly and it seemed still somewhat uncomprehendingly of his enormous disillusionment when he and his plans were no longer welcome when no official would see him after the s he never built again this show reawakens some of the pleasure the sense of wonder and discovery of learning something new of momas exciting early days with the perspective of time and loss it offers a deeper lesson of the endurance of art against odds and how dreams die ms huxtable is the
