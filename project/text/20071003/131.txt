we must extinguish the fire of radical islam in regard to frederick w kagans sept editorial page commentary "why were winning now in iraq" mr kagans message that security for the iraqi people is a prerequisite for defeating al qaeda is correct its also necessary for defeating the sadrists other "extremists terrorists" and laying the foundation for political compromise on key issues like oil revenue sharing at the federal level the idea that politics will lead to defeating terrorists without security coming first has it exactly backward despite the mantra of the left that iraq is a failure and is separate and apart from the war on radical islam success in iraq is essential to turning the tide against the radical world wide jihadist movement which seeks to force its will on the rest of islam and ultimately the rest of the world the fact that most of the democratic party cannot acknowledge this disqualifies those democrats running for president from effectively operating as commander in chief in world war ii there was a national consensus regarding the need to defeat the evil of nazism many democrats have not recognized the need to defeat the similar evil of a radical islam that will stop at nothing to impose its will on the world we must stay in iraq for as long as it takes with the forces necessary to achieve victory instead lets talk about "strategic redeployment" of our troops out of europe and asia if it means we can solidify our presence in the middle east and put out the fire of radical islam no one wants to "occupy" the middle east indefinitely but occupy we must until the jihadists understand that we will not allow defeat only then will they give up the anti war leftists have served only to prolong the war by giving the evil ones hope that they can outlast us i believe that if the democrats win the presidency hope will be renewed for the terrorists john l sorg mccordsville ind mr kagan notes that al qaeda "was able to replace them faster than we could kill them " his choice of "replace" rather than say "recruit " is a fundamental point the strategic significance of which is missed an issue that is crucial to our long term success that is not addressed in mr kagans conclusions while we are not fighting an enemy with borders an arguable point we are nevertheless fighting a war within borders borders that we have clearly been unable to secure had we been able to secure iraqs borders early in the conflict the picture there today would be vastly different the issue of border security goes well beyond that of our own borders until and unless we secure the borders in iraq we will continue to fight surrogate wars against iran and syria in iraq and in afghanistan bryan eckert naperville ill
