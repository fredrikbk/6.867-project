strong earnings the stock price has tripled over the past year gaining even lately as global markets have wobbled on fears over the credit crunch in the u s demand from china a strong presence in the nickel market and probable price increases for iron ore should help earnings in experts say the stock is priced similar to that of its rivals but buying into another commodity market with an acquisition could boost it thats because bigger diversified miners command higher multiples "i think there is still good long term value based on the outlook for the world economy " noted george hoguet emerging market portfolio co manager at state street global advisors in boston the company manages about &# billion in emerging market stocks and owns cvrd the stock has had a strong run already its american depositary receipts retreated slightly in new york yesterday to &# in p m new york stock exchange composite trading but a year ago they were in the vicinity of &# its locally traded shares on the sao paulo stock exchange have mirrored this performance "over the past few years the valuation of the company has been appreciating rapidly " said wagner pinheiro de oliveira president of brazilian state oil company workers pension fund petros which has a stake in cvrd a key driver of the share price surge has been a flurry of upgraded forecasts for iron ore prices driven by heated chinese demand that has created a super cycle in commodity prices chinese steelmakers which are cvrds biggest customers and the worlds largest consumers of iron ore have boosted steel output this year fueling a rise in chinese iron ore imports and a jump in spot market prices for iron ore in the last six weeks alone until then analysts had expected prices to rise at best now theyre banking on to cvrd declined to comment about its outlook for iron ore prices negotiations on iron ore contracts are expected to begin shortly chinese officials have already complained that mining majors rio tinto plc and bhp billiton ltd were pushing for a price increase for iron ore next year "i think its important everyone realizes that contract prices will likely rise for the rest of the decade " said analyst paul cliff of london based nomura international plc mr cliff said next years price increase is already priced into cvrd shares indeed cvrds stock price is pretty evenly priced with peers trading at more than times earnings according to factset research anglo australian mining giant rio tinto trades around times forward earnings and bhp billiton at times cvrd is also the worlds second largest nickel producer and that nickel exposure amid a volatile base metals market could pay off handsomely "cvrd has two of the most attractive commodity exposures and growth profiles in the industry " mr cliff said "we think its a growth stock sustainable for the next five to years " cvrd bought its way into the nickel market acquiring canadian nickel miner inco for &# billion last year high nickel prices this year have helped cvrds earnings "if current expectations for iron ore are closer to the actual outcome nickel exposure can take over as one of the key drivers for outperformance in the short term " mr cliff said nickel prices which reached &# per pound on the spot market in august are unlikely to return to the record highs seen in may mr cliff said however the recent lows appear to have set a floor for nickel prices as an expected deficit in the nickel market isnt yet reflected in prices and consumers will start restocking in "nickel exposure is one of the more attractive exposures in commodities " mr cliff said for cvrd to cement its place among the big miners and solidify that high stock valuation some experts think it needs to diversify further and get exposure to at least one more major commodity market "in the mining sector the larger diversified companies trade at higher multiples " mr cliff said "right now they only have two commodities to truly be diversified and take the re rating story further cvrd needs one more commodity " cvrd chief executive roger agnelli has said that the company is always on the lookout for deals and that acquisitions are a question of opportunity industry insiders say the company was edged out by rio tinto in a bid for canadian aluminum giant alcan although cvrd has never confirmed it made an offer meanwhile recent talk of cvrd and bhp teaming up to buy rio tinto has petered out on questions about cost and regulatory issues cvrd already has exposure to the aluminum market while also expanding coal production with a &# million deal for australian coal miner amci holdings it also has sped development of the massive moatize coal deposit in the african nation of mozambique the inco deal sapped cvrds reserves it had little trouble refinancing the &# billion bridge loan it used to fund the purchase but it had about &# billion cash at the end of the first half down from &# billion at the end of the third quarter before the inco deal closed future bids might have to be leveraged buyouts a dicey proposition given credit market turmoil and may cost cvrd its hard fought investment grade status from credit rating companies besides mining assets are pricey these days however the commodity price cycle highs do leave cvrd able to generate the cash to pay off its debts analysts expect cvrd to generate revenue of &# billion in up from &# billion in "the balance sheet is strong enough to support a reasonably large acquisition over the next months " mr cliff said
