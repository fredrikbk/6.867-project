politics &amp economics iowas campus kingmaker to energize student voters who ya gonna call iowa city iowa a hand written thank you from bill clinton and a private lunch with sen joe biden are becoming normal fare for college junior atul nakhasi "theyre sucking up to me " the year old pre med student said with a chuckle "and i dont mind it " the ambitious energetic president of the university of iowa democrats has cleverly plotted to turn his once moribund organization into a sought after player in the iowa caucuses where the first delegates in the presidential campaign will be chosen today mr nakhasi will be on the stage when barack obama speaks to the campus while the spotlight is on the candidates mr nakhasis tale is one of how peripheral players around the country are seizing on the sprawling race for the white house to advance their causes "he knows every single organizer of the campaigns " marveled mark bowers president of hawkeyes for john edwards "and they all obviously want him to support that candidate " bringing out the youth vote many campaigns say is like planning a party get five popular people involved and a hundred people show up mr nakhasi with his leadership position and inexhaustible energy plays that role under university rules all political groups that want to campaign on the student campus must be sponsored by student groups in past elections candidate specific groups handled that responsibility when mr obama planned an earth day rally on campus in april the campaign got sponsorship from the students for barack obama club thousands of people attended the event according to the obama campaign and the university democrats had nothing to do with it "we were really disappointed " mr nakhasi said they were not surprised though the club had fractured over whom to endorse for the election the howard dean supporters decamped after the club picked john kerry and membership dwindled at the homecoming parade on the predominantly liberal campus the university republicans had a bigger float than the democrats when mr nakhasi was elected to his post this march eight students showed up to vote mr nakhasi who unsuccessfully ran twice for student body president is a year younger than most of his fellow juniors and a year ahead of them in credits he could graduate in may this summer he turned his energies to reviving the club mr nakhasi created an executive board for the leaders of the candidate support groups he gave them titles and positions and established the university democrats as the umbrella organization to which all the other groups report "who wouldnt want a position on an executive board " he said with a laugh the university democrats would also take a prominent role in all candidate visits mr nakhasi recruited representatives by claiming the other groups were already on board even those that didnt like one another the groups that support hillary clinton mr obama and mr edwards all joined when mr nakhasi told them the others had committed "we played them against each other and it worked out wonderfully " he said sophomore cody eliff co president of students for hillary and a member of the umbrella board said mr nakhasi has been "very very helpful to the campaigns " saying things like "were here for you guys if you need any help " mr nakhasi an indian american from waterloo iowa got the first sign his plan was working in late june when mrs clintons campaign asked him to sponsor a visit he immersed himself in event planning and in giving his organizations support sought concessions in return including a meeting with the clintons on july after finishing a summer school genetics test mr nakhasi sprinted across campus to introduce mrs clinton at a rally a friend related how he gave her an awkward onstage hug since then mr nakhasi has facilitated visits by delaware sen biden and new mexico gov bill richardson according to representatives of the candidates at the university democrats first meeting this school year more than a hundred people attended mr nakhasi has nearly doubled the size of the clubs email list from last year to more than now he uses it to advertise events of all sizes "he tells everyone about every event we have " said holly savage a regional field director for the biden campaign "its very helpful " staff from the top six democratic campaigns are throwing supplies volunteers and free tickets to big events at mr nakhasi who said he has sought to give fair treatment to each camp when representatives of the six campaigns with iowa organizations came to the first university democrats meeting of the year in early september mr nakhasi alphabetized the speaking order for the campaign presentations at that meeting where more than students showed up mr nakhasi announced his most ambitious event to date a discourse at the university with the top six democratic contenders set for nov mr nakhasi says he will give each of the candidates minutes to speak including minutes for q&amp a from students he also wants to include a lightning round letting students fire quick questions "maybe ill ask hillary what the state bird of iowa is " mr nakhasi joked as for mr nakhasis endorsement he has a favorite candidate he says but he pledges that neither he nor the club will name one
