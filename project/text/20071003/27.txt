canadian pacific bets on energy like its u s rivals railroad focuses more on coal and ethanol for years canadian pacific railway ltd has hauled its traditional trainloads of potash grain and shipping containers but these days the calgary alberta railroad company is at the forefront of a multibillion dollar industry investment trend north americas fast growing energy plays from midwestern ethanol to wyoming coal to canadas oil sands supplying tracks and trains to these far flung places could fatten the bottom line at canadian pacific and at other railroads as u s energy consumption grows still the strategies of the companies face threats ranging from antiglobal warming efforts to the high cost of tapping new sources of energy canadian pacific the sixth largest railroad in north america by revenue laid out plans in may to put new tracks into albertas oil sands processing area where vast reserves of a tar like substance are tapped to make synthetic crude last month it said it will pay &# billion to buy dakota minnesota &amp eastern railroad corp a regional line based in sioux falls s d that ships grain to ethanol producers then ships ethanol back to markets in the last years dm&amp e has secured u s government approvals to build tracks into the huge coal fields of wyomings powder river basin canadian pacific said it will undertake a comprehensive study in the next few years to determine whether to go ahead with the project other railroads have been doing much the same thing union pacific corp and burlington northern santa fe corp the two largest north american railroads by revenue already serve the powder river basin and are boosting capacity to haul increasing amounts of coal from it bnsf for example spent &# million in for additional track locomotives and cars for carrying coal double what it invested in the energy play has inherent risks squeezing energy from oil sands is complex energy intensive messy and expensive the boom in corn ethanol has depended on political support and government subsidies that may not be there in the future and coal fired power plants are under attack by environmentalists who blame carbon emissions from burning coal for contributing to global warming lately some of the many coal fired plants now on the drawing board have been canceled some energy experts also question railroads timing "certainly they are investing at the top of the energy cycle which would expose them to significant risks in the event of a major downturn " says alex gorbansky managing director of frontier strategy group a washington based research firm a canadian pacific spokesman said the moves mark the railroads effort to seek out opportunity in general not a targeted move toward energy he said fred green who took over as canadian pacifics chief executive in may was unwilling to comment until the dm&amp e transaction closes which could come as soon as this week canadian pacifics plan to combine the railroads will then face review by the u s surface transportation board a process that could take as long as a year generally the railroads say their energy investment strategies are conservative and keep long term trends in mind for example railroad officials say they are confident that coals abundance and relatively low cost compared with other energy sources such as natural gas will keep it in demand new technologies may overcome some of coals environmental drawbacks and rising rail rates for coal shipments are making it more feasible for railroads to boost capacity "coal is going to play a major role in electric generation for years to come " said jack koraleski executive vice president of marketing and sales at union pacific based in omaha neb major railroads will generate more than &# billion in revenue hauling coal in according to donald broughton an analyst at a g edwards in st louis coal is of total revenue of canadian pacific compared with at burlington northern santa fe and at union pacific the two big eastern u s railroads csx corp and norfolk southern corp receive about of their revenue from coal the biggest moves lately are coming from canadian pacific where mr green is trying to make his mark as an expansion minded leader in addition to expanding in energy related traffic the company lately is building new yards to handle containers and automobiles "canadian pacific has been the least aggressive of the major north american railroads but this dm&amp e transaction changes that " said henry posner iii chairman of railroad development corp a closely held railroad investment and management company in pittsburgh canadian pacific lately is showing strong financial performance fueled by growth in bulk commodities and shipping containers said tom wadewitz an analyst at j p morgan chase &amp co net income in rose to million canadian dollars us&# million or c&# a share from c&# million or c&# a share in revenue rose to c&# billion the companys expansion plans include penetrating the oil sands processing region northeast of edmonton alberta the area is home to the majority of downstream upgrading and processing facilities for the oil sands canadian pacific is already moving construction materials such as pipe and steel to the area to build the facilities which process bitumen from oil sands into various fuels as well as byproducts such as sulfur some of which will eventually move by rail acquiring the dm&amp e will give canadian pacific an expanded presence in ethanol kevin schieffer president and ceo of dm&amp e said ethanol shipments on the railroad have surged to more than carloads last year from carloads in "ethanol is by far and away our fastest growing commodity right now " he said building the line into the powder river basin faces big hurdles and would take years canadian pacific will want to line up contract commitments from the utility industry before going ahead mr schieffer said the project could put canadian pacific on a collision course with bnsf and union pacific which now have a lock on coal shipments from the basin and could oppose canadian pacifics entry bnsf and union pacific declined to comment skeptics worry about the acquisitions price and the potential costs of upgrading the dm&amp e and then extending it miles into the powder river basin about miles of the dm&amp e in south dakota is built on wet shifting clay for example restricting trains to miles an hour some analysts think the cost of the powder river basin project could top &# billion including contingency payments to dm&amp es current owners but mr schieffer said its too early to know "there is everything from the chevy to the cadillac version " he said
