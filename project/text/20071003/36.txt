common sense time to cash in on oil without selling shares smartmoney is it time to cash in on oil stocks wait a minute wasnt that the same question i was asking just a few months ago it is and even though i sold some calls on a few energy positions to raise some cash i didnt sell any shares with oil now regularly topping &# a barrel im glad i didnt back then oil had just crossed the &# threshold under my old system of buying lower and selling higher i bought energy shares when oil was at &# and sold them at &# but this system has been in flux because of rapidly changing conditions in the energy markets in the old days i used to buy energy shares when gasoline was &# at the pump and sell when it hit &# that system had the virtue of constant visibility and simplicity and worked for years how quaint it seems now back in july i had the foresight to shift my trading range to &# to &# in large part thats because the falling dollar was pushing up oil prices even without any big shifts in the supply demand equation since oil is priced in dollars the federal reserves decision to cut interest rates has dealt the dollar a further blow not to mention fueling inflation fears thats a double boost for oil which as a commodity is also a good inflation hedge no wonder oil is hitting new records in nominal if not inflation adjusted returns so is it time to shift my trading range upward again to the &# to &# range i dont think so while consistency may be the hobgoblin of little minds theres no point to having a trading discipline if you throw it out every time you hit a threshold so i plan to again raise some cash on my energy positions a good way to do that without selling them is to sell some out of the money calls as i did last summer a call is an option to buy a security at a specific price so far that has been a profitable exercise although oil prices are up since july oil stocks havent kept pace gasoline refiners especially have been lagging so the valero energy calls i sold expired worthless in september meaning i kept the shares and the cash i received when i sold the calls the jury is still out on the suncor energy calls i sold with a strike price of which dont expire until december suncor seemed well on its way to reaching the &# a share level crossing it intraday on sept until the alberta government stepped in and threatened to levy more taxes on the canadian oil sands project which is the heart of suncors business the stock has been trading in the &# s since but even shares of big integrated producers like exxon mobil chevron and conocophillips havent kept pace with the rise in oil prices thanks to all the recent market volatility options are fetching bigger premiums than ever which makes it a good time to sell some calls when i checked this week the exxon mobil s expiring in april were going for &# the chevron s expiring in march were &# and the conocophillips s expiring in may were &# if the shares are called at those prices on those expiration dates that represents annualized rates of return of and respectively from their current trading prices if the shares dont reach the strike prices youll keep the premium and the shares and be in a position to sell more calls when prices rally again i call that a good trade james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see smartmoney com commonsense
