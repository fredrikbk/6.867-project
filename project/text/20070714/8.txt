encore a special report do it yourself pensions new products are helping people turn part of their k s into a steady paycheck in retirement heres how they work and what to watch for its one of the biggest financial challenges people face upon entering retirement how do you tap your nest egg to create a regular paycheck for life the financial services industry is rushing to provide some answers a number of companies are introducing products that for the first time allow workers to invest in annuities through their k s the heart of many americans retirement savings a k for the most part is easy to understand and set up but it doesnt offer a simple mechanism for creating a steady income in retirement annuities by contrast have long offered a way to generate a paycheck in later life but tend to be complicated expensive and a general pain in the neck to shop for the new products in theory offer the best of both worlds though currently offered at only a few dozen companies the k option gives employees the ability to direct a portion of their k investment each month toward purchasing an annuity doing so can be cheaper than buying an annuity on the retail market say through an insurance agent or financial planner the reason for all this activity is simple at a time when increasing numbers of companies are doing away with traditional defined benefit plans many people nearing retirement still long for a pension that cant run out at the same time some would be retirees recognize that the traditional strategy when leaving the office rolling over a k into an individual retire ment account and trying to manage a nest egg on ones own is often a recipe for trouble chad lown a year old technical support manager signed up for a k annuity when paychex inc an employee benefits administrator in rochester n y started offering the option in may "i love the idea of having guaranteed income for life and knowing that worst case scenario youre getting a paycheck when you retire " he says "my father worked for kodak and hes always had that pension it takes away a lot of the stress knowing youre going to have this money " many financial planners recommend putting as much as of your total nest egg in an annuity or enough to pay basic living costs such as utility bills with a fixed annuity inside your k you might consider investing the same percentage that you previously put into bonds and other fixed income products since fixed annuities use the same types of investments for all their apparent benefits though the new products arent a panacea while purchase fees are lower than for annuities purchased at retail the annual expenses can be double those of other k investments an annuity within a k could be awkward to manage if you job hop and the products guarantees of a paycheck down the road are only as sound as the finances of the insurance companies providing them though state funds generally provide limited coverage when insurers become insolvent still retirement plan managers and benefits consultants say growing numbers of workers will have access to such products in the next few years and should begin learning about their options "ten years from now every k plan in the country will have a product like this in its lineup " predicts thomas witt the retirement fund manager for h e butt grocery co in san antonio who says he is "kicking the tires" of several new products that provide a monthly check in retirement heres a look at the opportunities and the drawbacks of k annuity investing a guarantee but at what price insurers sell two main types of annuities fixed and variable fixed annuities are either immediate which means a lump sum payment is made up front in return for set payments over a specified period or for life or they are deferred meaning they are purchased either with a single payment or with installments invested over time before the payments start fixed annuities offered in k s generally are deferred with your money mainly invested in bonds and other fixed income securities variable annuities also either immediate or deferred are typically invested in a portfolio with a sizeable chunk of equities meaning their value and income payment level can vary based on those investments performance taxes for deferred annuities including those in k s generally are not owed until the payments are made those payments generally are taxed at ordinary income rates although both fixed and variable annuities are available in k s so far most employers offer only one or the other so its important to know the relative advantages or disadvantages of both fixed with fixed annuities inside k s interest rates and your age at the time you invest affect the size of your eventual payments investing early increases the payout because your money is invested longer higher interest rates at the time of the investment also boost payouts because the insurer earns higher returns and those returns are reflected in lower annuity purchase rates purchasing fixed annuities inside your k can hold some advantages by taking advantage of dollar cost averaging "if you retire when interest rates are low then the cost of buying an annuity at retail is high but if you buy a little bit each year in a k you average out the risk " says robyn credico national director of watson wyatt worldwides defined contribution consulting practice in arlington va for example a year old man who bought a &# immediate fixed annuity from metlife inc new york in june would get &# a month for life but if he or she had invested &# a year for the past decade in metlifes personal pension builder available in more than two dozen k plans so far that are managed by merrill lynch &amp co inc the retiree would get monthly payments of &# this is theoretical personal pension builder wasnt available until and employees in participating plans are just now learning about it in another example lets say youre years old and starting this month you begin contributing &# a month to hartford financial group inc s lifetime income fixed annuity the program sells shares that guarantee &# a month in income starting at age at age after contributing &# you would have about shares which would yield a monthly paycheck for life of &# if you had contributed &# a month the monthly payment at age would be about &# contributing &# a month while working would yield &# a month at inflation is an issue as well it could decimate the spending power of the monthly retirement income you paid so much to guarantee that &# a month youve amassed with metlifes product for example would be worth roughly &# a decade from now assuming an annual inflation rate some products are adding inflation protection features but they can reduce the initial monthly income provided by as much as variable like fixed annuities variable annuities in k plans typically guarantee a specific retirement income but variable annuities hold out the additional promise of an occasional increase in payments which could help you keep up with inflation that said these products can be even tougher to understand the features generally work like this your variable annuity is invested in a portfolio of stocks and bonds chosen either by the insurer or yourself at some point each year typically your birthday the insurer gauges your portfolios market value if it has grown the insurer bumps up your payment if it has fallen the insurer can lower the payment but not beneath the initially guaranteed minimum for instance with genworth financial inc s clearcourse variable annuity a year old worker who invested &# in theoretically and retired at the end of would have received payouts totaling &# in the first year of retirement the lowest payout if the portfolio had been flat or tanked could have been &# a year these guarantees come at a price clearcourse charges of assets each year plus investment management costs prudential financial inc s prudential incomeflex product works much the same way but it gives you a choice of five proprietary mutual funds ranging from conservative to aggressive in which to invest and the newest variable annuity for k s lincoln national corp s ilife advantage markets itself as offering upside potential and the ability to make cash withdrawals but theres also a downside your guaranteed income could drop to of your initial minimum if your investments do badly the retail route even if your employer adds an annuity to your k dont ignore the offerings in the retail market few products within the financial services industry are changing faster and for the better than annuities insurers have created dozens in the past few years and the competition means there are viable alternatives you can find on your own some insurers for example are working on annuities that could be used to pay for long term care says mike degeorge general counsel for nava inc a variable annuity trade group here are things to consider when comparing a retail annuity with one offered in your k cost an annuity purchased within a k can cost half as much in fees as an annuity you buy on your own since there are no insurance agent commissions involved plus there are no surrender charges penalties that retail products often slap on investors who want out early some retail annuities can outperform those within k plans but you have to be willing to do the work to find them and it can be very tough to comparison shop for annuities because the returns quoted by the vendors are calculated after fees which vary from company to company its best to find an independent certified financial planner who doesnt work on a commission basis to help you shop mark cortazzo a certified financial planner in parsippany n j has found annuities for his clients with higher guaranteed payments than those provided by some k products along with more investment options that could provide a better shot at getting the guaranteed income bumped up but he and his staff spend about hours a year culling through products to get those results he says flexibility on the plus side its easier to move contributions out of annuities and into mutual funds inside your k than it would be with annuities you hold on your own you simply give your plan custodian a new allocation for your investments but if you ditch your k annuity for a different type of investment you will have wasted the money paid in add on fees contributing to an annuity within your k "only makes sense if you plan to hold onto it and use it as protection " says moshe milevsky an associate professor of finance at york university in toronto who has studied the products "this is not just another exchange traded fund to trade in and out of " job security if you expect to change jobs a k annuity could be a hassle mainly because there might not be an equivalent option in a different employers k plan you have the right to leave a balance worth at least &# in your former employers defined contribution plan and many employers let you leave your assets in the plan in retirement says david wray president of the profit sharing k council of america in chicago but you should find out specifically what could become of your annuity if you have saved less than &# your investment could be converted to cash and rolled into an individual retirement account he says shopping your rollover if it all seems too complicated you could simply wait until you retire and then buy a fixed immediate annuity with a chunk of your ira rollover in the meantime your k plan may have added a way to help you do that too large employers including international business machines corp are signing up for services that make comparison shopping for annuities easier for retirees minneapolis based hueler cos has developed a web based service income solutions incomesolutions com which retrieves quotes for fixed immediate annuities the companys president kelli hustad hueler says the service scores discounts of to off retail prices and provides apple to apple comparisons in october fidelity investments launched a similar service for participants in the k plans it administers though its employer clients have to opt into it similar services are popping up for individual retirees as well including longevityalliance com the web site of longevity alliance of washington d c which was launched in by a former aarp executive in part to offer annuity counseling and comparison shopping you also can hire a financial adviser specifically to help you shift investments into immediate annuities during retirement for example massmutual financial group of springfield mass has created a retirement management account through which you set a target income and then gradually convert the accounts assets from mutual funds into a fixed immediate annuity with the goal of keeping pace with inflation still theres one potential drawback to the wait and see approach if life expectancies continue to rise annuity payments which would then have to be stretched across longer lifetimes would be reduced "you dont want to wait to buy an annuity until merck discovers the drug that keeps us alive five more years " dr milevsky says ms greene is a staff reporter in the wall street journals atlanta bureau she can be reached at encore wsj com
