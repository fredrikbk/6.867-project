oh wow man why lay a heavy trip on all the s dudes ted nugents recent diatribe condemning the vices of what he called the "summer of drugs" editorial page july is nothing more than the bitter ranting of a deeply regretful soul who now knows he missed out on the magic and meaning of a profound social revolution the underpinnings of which he neither understood at the time nor today instead of admitting he just didnt get it he harps on the surface consequences of taking drugs nothing new here he says he remembers the s in "vivid ugly detail " how very sad for him for most of the rest of us who came of age in the s it was a time of great beauty creativity magic and hope and we remain proud to have been a member of this generation poor mr nugent he was lost then and hes lost now gerri corrado boston the hippie movement harbored its fair share of excess but its central message peace and love is as enduring as it is revolutionary it is always easy to attack the movement for its nonchalant use of drugs but that criticism is beside the point the hippie generation demonstrated that the nations young people would refuse to stand by indifferently while their government waged a needless deadly war and misled the public and that is an achievement everyone including mr nugent should be willing to commemorate peter w fulham amherst n y the great irony of course is that without copious amounts of drugs and alcohol who would really want to listen to ted nugents music after all william h anderson jr riverside ill cass elliot ellen cohen did not die from the use of drugs she died in london during a concert tour in her cause of death was heart failure secondary to chronic cardiomegaly a routine post mortem drug screen was performed and was negative thomas volkema manhattan i appreciate mr nugents moral authority i get concerned when our youth look up to former drug users as heroes who preach what not to do to me a true hero is someone who never used in spite of the environment and pressure timothy kempf ph d eagle idaho why give a mediocre rock musician a forum to dispense his clear hatred of "dirty stinky hippies" the headline should have read "i loathe hippies and liberals and even beat some up once " what did this commentary really offer in the way of understanding about american history besides offering a long string of insults directed at an entire generation the piece is nearly incomprehensible mr nugent for example believes that rampant drug use during the s was and is responsible for all manner of social ills today including big government and taxes huh although he recognizes the contributions of the civil rights movement he simplistically sees the excesses of the s as nothing more than "stinky hippies" ruining the country today years later he still sees "braindead liberal deniers" undermining american society i suggest mr nugent focus on his music and leave the social commentary to those with a more level headed understanding of american history john mcneilly weston fla as an "ex hippie" from new york in quotes because one is never truly an ex hippie i found the piece lacking in any understanding of what the hippie era was all about most hippies i know in the late s were studying ways to achieve peace advocating for civil rights resisting the vietnam war learning to be more open and communicative and reaching out with compassion to others in need these same hippies are now in the arts education healing and helping professions connie sanderson westminster vt mr nugent is absolutely right on though there are probably a lot of us who would agree it was surprising to read such a succinct harshly truthful judgment of that period in a number of societal measures we certainly have not even started to recover from the effects of the s geoffrey g white pebble beach calif with utter fascination and horror i read ted nugents hypocritical screed in which the former amboy duke provides an insiders view of the summer of love on one hand and with the other trashes the excesses of the same culture that he was indeed a proponent of having crossed the mid century mark myself i also look back on those times with an acknowledgment of wasted talent hendrix joplin morrison et al and the lifting of a veil that did its part in destabilizing our societal structure but for mr nugent to hubristically rail at the very culture that placed him at its head propelled him to stardom and enabled his current voice no matter what political tone it has is not only pathetic and full of self deception but undermines any moral authority this type of attack might help him achieve by contrast frank zappa one of the eras most prolific creative and musically influential lights was like mr nugent a non drug taking hard driving full fledged rock god but mr zappa until his death had the grace and tact not to bite the head off the hand that fed him and left this world the legacy of not only his music but of his humanity and political action lauded by both the czech government of vaclav havel and zubin mehta as well as the "stoned stinky hippies" mr nugent despises he was an advocate of change by getting out the vote and his later concerts always included a pitch to register and participate his much viewed debate against the hysterical tipper gore itrons during the "parents advisory label" controversy of the s was a lesson in confident and calm public debate that won the respect of his political adversaries conversely mr nugents hypocritical slobbering "ive been in the woods too long with rednecks" tone makes his bilious argument just another noxious and disingenuous pitch for his new album to be released this summer robin robinson westwood n j see related letter "letters to the editor diverse opinions dude
