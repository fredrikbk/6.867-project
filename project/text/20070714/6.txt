cross country richardsons santa fe line santa fe n m bill richardson has done a lot of things since becoming governor more than four years ago including cut taxes but what he hasnt done is earn his stripes as a "fiscal conservative " that may surprise those who follow the democrats presidential campaign but there is more to mr richardsons fiscal record than tax cuts hes also a profligate spender who is laying groundwork that will make it harder to keep taxes in check and the budget in balance in the coming years mr richardson isnt a spending hawk hes more like a roadrunner new mexicos state bird darting across the landscape trying to stay ahead of the anvil that is inevitably coming consider the states general fund that portion of the budget over which the governor and the legislature have the most control this year it hit &# billion up &# billion since mr richardson took office in the governor asked for and received an increase in spending this year the biggest jump in memory outstripping inflation and population growth in the state and where is this money going one of mr richardsons priorities has been the state childrens health insurance program schip which is run under federal guidelines but administered and partly funded by the state bill clinton launched schip a decade ago and it has been used by democrats to expand federally controlled health care ever since this year mr richardson wanted schip to cover children of parents who make up to of the federal poverty line up from about that was too much for the legislature but mr richardson did succeed at getting the childrens program to cover more adults previously only the states poorest adult residents were eligible now adults earning two times the federal poverty rate can receive health benefits through the program his record of expanding government run health care on the state level is a pretty good indicator of what he would do as president mr richardson also likes trains one of his pet projects is the rail runner a commuter train that connects the northern and southern suburbs of albuquerque and has been beset with financial problems although its full length has yet to be completed an anticipated &# million in federal financing for the project has fallen through so state residents will have to foot the entire bill to complete the project miles of track will need to be run through the desert to santa fe at a total cost of about &# million not a small sum in this state this for a train that will take an hour and minutes to complete a trip that takes just one hour by car usually commuter rail is built to take automobiles off of the roads during rush hour but santa fe is a city with just residents and some people wonder how many cars can this train really replace while there are isolated pockets of congestion the problem in new mexico isnt too many cars but too few overpasses and too many stoplights mr richardsons secretary of transportation rhonda faught admits that the rail runner will need as much as &# million a year in ongoing subsidies meanwhile ridership lags behind other commuter rail systems the rail runner averages about riders a day the virginia railway express which ferries commuters in the suburbs of washington and which cost much less to build due to the use of existing track has about riders a day that puts the governor in a tough spot he now needs funding from the democratically controlled legislature for a project that residents are already showing that theyre reluctant to climb aboard but pushing the project may not be a bad political decision on mr richardsons part a few years ago he took a political pounding when it was revealed that he was chauffeured about the state in gas guzzling automobiles he now sports around the state in an alternative fuel suv something environmentalists and corn farmers in iowa love commuter rail is his eco friendly suv on a grander scale mr richardson won re election last year in a landslide and hes been able to get away with his spending spree while cutting income tax rates for top earners to and capital gains tax rates to both down from in large part hes managed this feat because the state is awash in energy tax revenue partly because hes raised gasoline taxes but mostly because new mexico is an energy producing state its a funny phenomenon but one that all oil and gas rich states experience when prices at the gas pump squeeze drivers the state brings in tax revenue by the truckload this year the state took in &# billion in oil and natural gas tax revenue thats up dramatically from four years ago when the state took in some &# million but if energy prices fall so too will tax revenue and the party is over indeed even in a booming economy the state treasury could find itself coming up short not good for a politician concerned with an image for fiscal conservatism but mr richardson hopes soon to be on to something else hes actually been on the move for well more than a decade in he left congress to become president clintons secretary of energy a few years later he was off to the united nations as u s ambassador as governor anticipating a lot of foreign service work he hired a part time staffer to give him pointers on international etiquette he also finagled with sanction from the bush administration two meetings with north korean officials one of which took place in santa fe he seems to enjoy being a go between for the secretive stalinist regime and the current administration its this foreign policy experience that he now hopes will propel him into the white house while a richardson presidency would likely be to the right of a clinton obama or edwards administration on fiscal matters labeling the governor of new mexico a "fiscal conservative" is a bit of a stretch mr gessing is president of the rio grande foundation see related letter "letters to the editor less pain with the train" wsj july
