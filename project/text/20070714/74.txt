the weekend interview with laura bush diplomat the white house the first ladys record is or nearly always is better than the presidents because she doesnt have every difficult issue " laura bush is in her east wing office discussing the role a first lady should play shes wearing a dark suit with white stitch trim and sitting on a couch facing shelves stacked with childrens books she has just hinted at the frustration that must come as her husband president george w bush is attacked in the media "because i do know him its easier for me to discount the terrible things that i read and see " mrs bush says she also understands the political facts of life she adds "because weve been in politics for almost our entire married life and because i saw somebody else i loved in this job my father in law " mrs bush has done what few others in the administration have managed to do over the past six years shes remained very popular with the american people she draws crowds at events her approval ratings have been consistently high hitting at one point the highest ever for a first lady with her natural grace and wit she has been described as "the most popular republican in the country " in our conversation mrs bush laments that "its too bad" that politics can be so barbarous because that can discourage good people from running for office then she adds with a laugh "although i will say that it hasnt discouraged a whole lot of people who are running for president " mrs bush is now increasingly in the spotlight and spending her political capital on the presidents foreign policy initiatives outside the middle east she has made solo foreign trips as first lady nine of them after mr bushs second inaugural address outlining his freedom agenda shes also visited afghanistan promoting womens rights since the u s liberated that nation from the taliban in mrs bush has also taken a lead in speaking out for the release of aung san suu kyi a democracy advocate and nobel peace prize winner in burma who won elections in but who has been kept under house arrest by a military junta mrs bush has made burma a priority in part because the military junta has a budding relationship with another repressive asian regime north korea the first lady doesnt hesitate to criticize china for trade that is keeping the burmese regime in business "china does have a huge amount of influence over burma " she says "they share a border for one thing but also they use the natural resources out of burma " and in the end "they prop up a government that a failed state really is what theyre propping up just like in the sudan " mrs bush adds that "right now after cooperating with china in the six party talks with north korea and with the chinese olympics coming up i think this is a really good time for activists and advocates for burma and the sudan and other countries to put pressure on china " if this doesnt sound like the literacy advocate many americans have come to know in mrs bush its also not the kind of first lady she expected to be coming into office in "i couldnt have forecast that wed have terrorism that there would be such an international focus for me i think i really expected and to be perfectly frank so did the president that this would be a domestically focused presidency " mrs bush has just returned from a tour of four african countries last month there she highlighted programs president bush launched in with a surprise call in the state of the union address to spend &# billion fighting hiv he now wants to spend &# billion over the next five years fighting the disease since the state department estimates more than mother to child hiv infections have been prevented and more than a million people are taking anti retroviral drugs thanks to president bush the first lady is optimistic about the prospects for further progress "something definitely can be done about these diseases " she says "i mean they literally could be eradicated with change of behavior aids too if people if everyone knew their status and protected their partner then in a generation you could not have it but obviously thats very difficult as we know from our own numbers " in listening to mrs bush talk about the details of the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar and malaria initiative i wondered if combating disease is one area where she influenced him but she seems to anticipate the question "i dont really know exactly how it all started " she volunteers "that the pepfar and the presidents malaria initiative and those initiatives became initiatives that i worked on so much they were really his ideas he was the one before the state of the union who said im going to make this proposal that we focus on hiv in africa and other countries the hardest hit countries which include haiti and vietnam as well but then the others are sub saharan africa "and whats really happened is that he announced those things he got the congress to pass those things and fund them and then i got to be the one to get to go visit them and see them because he just frankly hasnt had the time to do that because he is focused so much on other issues obviously the war in iraq " mrs bush nudges the conversation along toward a point she wants to make fighting disease in poor countries also pays other tangible benefits including expanding economic growth and liberating women sometimes this happens with the smallest of projects like providing clean drinking water to a school "especially the economic part of it the girls who are kept out of school because they are the ones looking for water or have to walk however far to the water well and bring it back and so they arent in school and thats one of the reasons the clean water the playpumps merry go round water pumps that we inaugurated in zambia are very important and theyre in a schoolyard so that if girls dont have to search for water for their families theyre more likely to be educated " if reporters pay close attention to what she says and follow up on it they are likely to find that mrs bush is willing to take controversial stands on her recent flight to africa she told journalists traveling with her that the u s needs to be "efficient and effective" with foreign aid money no one on the plane asked what she meant for one thing she supports using the most effective defense ever developed against malaria an insecticide called ddt which has been vilified by environmentalists even though it was essential to eradicating the disease in the u s decades ago "we went overboard in the united states used it in huge applications big agricultural applications i mean people remember running after the ddt trucks where they would just drive up and down in the summer to spray for mosquitoes " she said "and that is not what this spraying is this is spraying inside just against the walls of a house so that if a mosquito flies into the walls then they die from the insecticide " has her africa diplomacy been effective a recent pew global attitudes survey which interviewed hundreds of people in sub saharan countries indicates that it might be the u s is extremely popular in that part of the world more than of the people in every country surveyed except tanzania have a positive impression of the u s in the ivory coast of the people have favorable views of america in deciding how to handle the role of first lady mrs bush says she has looked for guidance to other women who have held the job "lady bird johnson for instance who is one of my favorites " she also cites jacqueline kennedy "everyone i think my age remembers jackie kennedy and her when president kennedy was assassinated her grace i think everyone whos my age remembers that associates that with her mostly her bravery and her courage and the tragedy of it " she adds "and then of course i have a mother in law who was first lady " mrs bush thinks that has been "a huge advantage for me and for george really because when george was governor i had the role model of barbara bush as first lady i saw how you can really have a life which people dont believe that you really can and how you have a normal family life in the white house and we certainly did when we came to visit them and weve been able to have that ourselves agents dont stand around in our living room " as for hillary clinton mrs bush wont comment on any of the candidates running for president other than to say "im for the republican whoever that is i will be campaigning for the republican " will she follow in the footsteps of her predecessor as first lady and run for office herself the idea forces her to laugh "no no " so what role does she think a first lady should play in asking the question i thought mrs bush might give the safe answer that she should support the president but mrs bush opted for a slightly more surprising response "whatever first ladies are interested in " mr miniter is assistant editor of opinionjournal com
