how hot investments burn the little guy mortgage bets trip up main street investors and a group of nuns big investors arent the only ones getting burned by mortgage investments some brokerage firms who put their customers in risky mortgage investments now have small investors fighting to get their money back that includes customers of irvine calif brokerage firm brookstreet securities corp which shut down last month after the value of some of its mortgage securities fell sharply it also includes the sisters of st joseph of carondelet in california the nuns thought they were making safe investments when they parked some of their money with los angeles based wedbush morgan securities instead they allege in documents in an arbitration complaint filed against wedbush they ended up with risky investments in mortgage backed securities tied to mobile home loans and lost nearly &# million these are among several broker fraud cases involving risky investments in mortgage securities that have been popping up in the past few years according to complaints filed with the national association of securities dealers or nasd ed wedbush president of the firm that handled the nuns investments said in an interview that the losses in this and other cases came on the riskier portions of mortgage investments and were the result of "clients being very aggressive and wanting high yields " they should have understood he said that "high yield is high risk " bad investments in securities tied to risky mortgages have shaken up some large hedge funds in the past few months most notably two bear stearns cos hedge funds which had big investments in mortgages known as subprime loans little guys even nuns can get hurt too many of the investments in these cases dont involve the subprime mortgages that are wall streets main headache today but they do point to the growing complexity of mortgage securities coming out of investment banks and the care individual investors must take to understand them when approached by brokers with promises of super returns married with little risk in a complaint filed with the nasd the sisters of st joseph of carondelet allege wedbush misled them about the value and risks of investments it made for them starting in these investments were called collateralized mortgage obligations a kind of mortgage backed security in which mortgages are bundled together and then sliced by investment banks into pieces that bear different levels of risk "theres some scary stuff out there " says philip m aidikoff a beverly hills attorney who represents the sisters and other small investors who say theyve lost money on similar products the case will be heard in august by an nasd arbitrator in california wedbush a midsized brokerage and investment bank has been hit with more than complaints over cmo products in the past few years in one case an arbitrator awarded more than &# million to the narramore christian foundation a nonprofit mental health organization in arcadia calif in another case the firm was ordered to pay roughly &# million in damages and attorney fees to individual investors wedbush has blamed the problems on a single broker who has since the left the firm an argument that has been rejected by arbitrators in those two cases doyle bouse was one individual who shared in an arbitration award against wedbush "i did not want any risk with my money at all because this is the money im retired on " said the year old retired insurance broker who lives in placentia calif wedbush assured him the cmos it put him in "were very safe and well secured " he said in when his monthly statements began showing losses the firm told him not to worry because the money would show up again in later statements he said ultimately the cmo bets cost him and his wife "a big big chunk" of their retirement savings roughly &# but he won it back thanks to the arbitrators ruling investors "have to be careful about even having bonds purchased for them " mr bouse says "they have to ask a few questions and know what theyre doing " scott silver a coral springs fla attorney said his firm has filed complaints to the nasd on behalf of three palm beach county investors who claim brookstreet brokers assured them the cmo products it placed them in were safe investments that would protect their principal and offer a consistent return these included instruments known as "inverse floater" cmos which are hard to price assets whose values can move sharply based on changes in interest rates and how quickly mortgage borrowers repay their loans in the nasd said these "are only for sophisticated investors with a high risk profile " the complaints also allege brookstreet used borrowed money to boost the size of its investments in hopes of earning higher returns one investor mitchell thal a retired grocer said in his complaint that he lost at least &# after the firm put his money into cmo products brookstreet officials and the firms attorney

a phoenix based securities brokerage samco financial services she wanted to protect the home where she and her year old daughter lived instead ms waisome then decided to invest the money giving &# to samco she was a "novice investor" and told the firm she didnt want to put her money into anything risky according to the complaint unbeknownst to her her complaint alleges the firm did just that using money borrowed in her name called a margin loan the broker bought &# in inverse floater cmos her complaint says the securities were actually worth less than &# when she bought them meaning her &# investment had been wiped out the moment she wrote the check to the brokerage ms waisomes attorney said she wouldnt comment the complaint accuses samco of fraud and says ms waisome had no idea the firm was buying securities for her on margin or risking her money on "esoteric investments " an attorney for samco said the firm couldnt comment the firm gave up its brokerage license near the end of
