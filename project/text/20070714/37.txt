major texas pension makes a big push into hedge funds pension funds traditionally among the stodgiest investors around are starting to dabble in hedge funds real estate and other "alternative" investments once considered too dicey now a major fund in texas is about to place a much bigger bet the teacher retirement system of texas is planning to shift about one third of its &# billion in assets to alternative investments its one of the largest ever pension fund wagers on investments like these manning the controls is t britton harris iv the new chief investment officer at the texas teachers fund and briefly the former chief executive officer at bridgewater associates the connecticut based hedge fund group with about &# billion under management mr harriss strategy aims to boost returns by a modest annually though that would earn his fund an additional &# billion a year "well be able to produce these higher returns with the same level of risk " mr harris years old says alternative assets like these he points out usually dont move in lockstep with stocks and bonds helping to diversify a portfolio "investment in alternative assets has not hurt returns at other pension funds " he says "they have helped returns " his critics however are wary the recent meltdown by two bear stearns hedge funds that invested in subprime mortgages was the most recent reminder of the potential risks involved and less than a year ago the hedge fund amaranth advisors squandered an unknown amount of pension fund money while losing &# billion on natural gas bets that went wrong pension funds nationwide are buzzing about this texas sized overhaul and will be watching to see if the gambit by the nations seventh largest public fund pays off the result could shake up the &# trillion pension fund industry by helping to accelerate the trend toward hedge funds and other alternative assets or on the other hand by stigmatizing these investments if mr harriss fund does poorly "were going to see more of these shifts to hedge funds and other alternatives " says monica butler head of u s consulting for russell investment group which advises pension funds "but most funds dont want to be among the first to do it " pension funds have invested limited amounts in real estate and private equity for at least two decades more recently as liabilities have ballooned and begun to exceed assets at many pension funds the more aggressive have looked to hedge funds in hopes of closing that gap so while the austin based pension fund isnt the first to dabble in these investments its shift is radical currently the fund ranks among the more conservative in these investments it has only about of assets in hedge funds private equity and real estate combined less than half the level of the average pension fund during the next couple of months mr harris says he will begin a two to three year process that will raise that amount to around some skeptics have thrown roadblocks in his way the texas state legislature recently passed a law capping the amount of money that texas teachers can place with hedge funds at of total assets just half of what mr harris had targeted that curtailed his plans a bit forcing him to roll back his investment plans in hedge funds texas pension review board chairman frederick "shad" rowe applauds these limits arguing texas teachers is moving too much money too quickly into hedge funds "it might be more prudent for them to go a little slower " he says pension funds have been burned by hedge fund blowups before the san diego county employees retirement association is suing amaranth for &# million alleging that the collapsed hedge fund failed among other things to properly guard against risk the international trade union confederation the worlds biggest union with million members in more than countries recently claimed that private equity funds which often invest in companies then lay off workers as part of a restructuring process shouldnt be rewarded with pension fund money others say the nature of private equity where investments may take five years or more until a restructured company is sold and gains are realized is ill suited for pension funds with more regular liabilities none of these reactions seem to surprise mr harris who has been involved in the pension world for more than two decades "i havent found anyone in the business who doesnt like alternative assets as a long term strategy " he says "all the concerns are with implementation " mr harris was born in bryan texas the son of a mobil oil executive who moved the family overseas to ankara turkey when mr harris was a child he returned to the lone star state to get a degree in finance from texas a&amp m where he now teaches a course "titans of investing " about legendary money managers like berkshire hathaways warren buffet and john neff of vanguard his own financial career began in the mid s as an analyst with the texas utilities pension fund he was part of a team that helped triple the funds assets to &# billion in he began running the stock investing division for gte a phone company that would later merge with nynex and eventually become verizon as head of the verizon &# billion pension fund he acquired a taste for alternative investments putting of the funds assets into them after that success bridgewater which managed money for verizon hired away mr harris to be ceo but this merger of two heavyweights wasnt destined to last despite mr harriss enthusiasm for alternative investments bridgewaters nonhierarchical management style where theres considerable arguing to come up with the right answer didnt appeal to mr harris "after six months of reflection britt decided it wasnt for him " says bridgewater chief ray dalio adding that the parting was amicable mr harris agrees "i do not think that they needed to change what had been a winning formula for years " in his current job mr harris believes that many of his pension fund peers are eager to follow his pension funds footsteps but if he isnt able to boost the funds returns "then others wont follow us " he says "and ill go somewhere else " corrections &amp amplifications t britton harris iv of the teacher retirement system of texas estimates that investing in alternative investments can boost the funds annual returns by one
