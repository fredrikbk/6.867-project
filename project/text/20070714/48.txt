pursuits lamb of god social philosopher the political teachings of jesus by tod lindberg harpercollins pages &# one would imagine that two millennia would provide ample occasion for exhaustive study of jesus of nazareth and yet somehow every generation seems to find some new way to think about him our own age is no exception for more than a century now believers and skeptics alike have tried to strip theology from biography to rediscover the man jesus who lived before the faith christianity at its best this modern approach to jesus combines nuanced interpretation with thought provoking argument at its worst it pretends to discern say what jesus might consider the optimal rate of taxation or how he might direct american policy in the middle east happily tod lindbergs "the political teachings of jesus" belongs among the smart sophisticated writings on the topic mr lindberg does not study jesus political teachings with an eye toward public policy or partisan advantage his interest in fact inclines to social philosophy he treats jesus as a profound thinker a man with great insight into the enduring question of how we may best live together mr lindberg deliberately presents jesus political teachings without any reference to his religious ones this strategy may at first seem misguided after all jesus regarded right conduct as a form of obedience to god but mr lindberg believes that jesus teachings deserve our attention whether or not they have the force of divine law they offer he says a "coherent account of how to live in the world " more important they propose a "revolution in the idea of freedom " a revolution that gradually came to shape the mind set that continues to define modern politics and social relations the revolutionary idea finds its most powerful expression in the golden rule do unto others as you would have them do unto you the familiarity and brevity of the golden rule sometimes obscure its radical implications unlike the ten commandments or various secular codes it does not list a series of prohibited acts instead it provides a way to think about how to behave toward ones fellow man the golden rule is implicitly egalitarian if we are obliged to treat others as we wish to be treated we must regard them as basically like ourselves and equally deserving of fair dealing all politics thus proceed from the assumption of the dignity of all persons within this social framework there is no greater transgression than abusing ones power over someone else by this standard social and political relations are more than a zero sum game wherein one persons gain comes at anothers loss the golden rule proposes that to the contrary by identifying ourselves with one another we arrive at moral virtue and mutual betterment we become as mr lindberg writes "a community of goodwill " to be sure the golden rule was not without precedent similar formulations can be found among other places in the mahabharata the ancient indian epic and confuciuss analects the rule in each of these texts though is stated negatively in essence do not do unto others what one would not like done to oneself jesus positive wording mr lindberg says allows for a greater "range of possibility for mutually beneficial interaction " jesus does not merely forbid injustice he proposes a principle applicable to our every act and constrained only by the limits of our imagination mr lindberg considers the golden rule the ethical core of jesus social teaching but he is well aware of the teachings other aspects he carefully explores a number of other scriptural passages particularly the parables and the beatitudes in the parable of the prodigal son for instance the obedient elder brother nurtures a grievance against his father after his father celebrates with the killing of a fatted calf the profligate younger brothers return the elder brothers grievance is born of envy and it poisons any inclination to treat his brother as himself the political lesson mr lindberg concludes is the danger of resentment since resentment erodes the possibility of the community of goodwill no community has ever fully realized the ideal of perfect goodwill of course the closest approximation of it to date is found in modern democracy this is not to suggest that jesus explicitly endorses democracy rather as mr lindberg explains democracy rests on a principle of equality in freedom that is consistent with the political philosophy of jesus i tend to think unlike mr lindberg that modern democracy owes less to a sense of mutual obligation and more to the notion of individual rights and i am somewhat reluctant to separate the moral and theological teachings of jesus but these are minor reservations they detract little from my appreciation of mr lindbergs achievement "the political teachings of jesus" is a welcome and eloquent reminder that much yet remains to be said about the man from nazareth mr levenick is a writer in alexandria va
