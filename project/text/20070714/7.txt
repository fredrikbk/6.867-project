encore a special report ask encore tackling questions on social security and personal gains i have a something unmarried sister who has been living with a great guy after years together they have decided to formalize their relationship with a wedding at the same time they are just starting to examine their prospects for retirement my question has to do with their social security payouts are they better off not to formalize their union and thereby collect social security on their individual accounts robert l brown chicago in most situations marrying wouldnt reduce a persons social security retirement benefit but might increase it thats because married individuals get the higher of two benefits the one they are entitled to based on their own work record or one based on the spouses work record also later in life upon the death of one of the spouses the survivor might be entitled to a survivor benefit that is larger than his or her earned retirement benefit that said there are a few situations involving people who remarry after a spouses death or a divorce in which marriage could negatively affect someones social security benefit consider a widow in her late s whose late husband had a high income at age she could begin collecting a sizable social security survivor benefit based on his earnings if she were to remarry now she wouldnt get that survivor benefit which might exceed the retirement benefit she would qualify for on her own work record or the new spouses one option in that particular situation would be to delay the marriage widows and widowers who remarry after reaching age "can still get the social security benefit based on the previous marriage " says donna clements manager of social security information services for mercer human resource consulting a widow or widower who remarries before age but then divorces would once again be eligible for a survivor benefit based on the earlier marriage she notes the long term capital gains tax rate for for taxpayers in the lower two brackets is going to be my question is will they add the capital gain to your ordinary income to determine your tax bracket for example a retired person has ordinary income from social security and a pension that amounts to &# he could take a long term gain of &# in will the &# be tax free since his ordinary income of &# is in the lower brackets or will the &# be added to the &# to push him into a higher bracket so that he will not qualify for the rate ron aimone long beach calif taxpayers who are in the or brackets in may have an opportunity to sell some securities at a gain without owing any federal tax but they definitely cant shelter &# in gains from uncle sam "you only pay if the long term capital gain itself falls within the two lower tax brackets " says john battaglia a director with the private client adviser group of deloitte tax llp in new york the portion of the gain that pushes your income into the tax bracket or higher will be taxed at the usual rate say a single individual has taxable income not gross income of &# before any capital gains theres not much of a chance to book gains without tax because the tax bracket extends only up to &# of taxable income thats this years figure next years could be slightly higher but if a married couple had &# of taxable income they could book more than &# in long term gains tax free before hitting the top of the bracket which is &# this year mr battaglia suggests that people looking to take advantage of this provision wait until late when they should have a clear idea of their income and tax bracket for the year a careful analysis is critical for retirees because increasing your total income could have the undesirable effect of making a larger portion of your social security benefit taxable in doing a projection of your taxes also keep an eye out for the alternative minimum tax if both a wage earner and a spouse wait until age to begin primary and spousal social security benefits respectively why cant the spouse get of the wage earners age benefits the rule now please correct me if i am wrong is that the spouse cant get more than of the wage earners "full retirement age" benefits age for us ernest lieberman new york its a mistake to delay collecting social security past ones full retirement age if you are collecting as a spouse rather than a breadwinner thats because as you note the benefit payable to a spouse is generally half of the wage earners benefit at the workers full retirement age and theres no provision under law for that spousal benefit to increase if you wait past full retirement age to collect in contrast workers get "delayed retirement credits" if they wait to collect for those born in or later benefits increase for each year past full retirement age at the workers death the delayed retirement credit also increases the benefit to a widow or widower
