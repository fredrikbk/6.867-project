pursuits food &amp drink summer on a bun from lobster rolls to clams a critic scours shore and city for beach food sag harbor n y of all the ideal visions of food in paradise that city bound foodies dream about between meals a lobster roll at the beach may be the purest icon of delicious food rooted to a time and place the time is now midsummer the classic place to eat one is a shack on the sand where bronzed waitpersons bring you a bun crammed full of lobster and mayonnaise and the premiere location the veritable terroir for this primal dream come true lies somewhere on the north atlantic coast on cape cod or for a new yorker like me on the east end of long island in that enclave of wealth called the hamptons i am as besotted by the lobster roll fantasy as anyone else actually i indulge it all year round in lower manhattan where two and recently a third clever restaurants bring the shore to the city but we hadnt wolfed down a lobster roll in the hamptons since the area got discovered by hollywood biggies and other glitterati who jostled for position to consume porcini crusted fluke at posh nick &amp tonis in east hampton so to find out the current state of beach food at our local watering hole we drove the miles out here we found that the lobster roll was as fresh and iconic as ever while here in this former whaling port star manhattan chef scott conant has cooked up an adroit terroir friendly menu mixing italian classics fish from local waters and modern ideas at the seasons big new hit tutto di giorno the platonic lobster roll is a perfect balance between the utterly plain and the sinfully luxurious lobster is never cheap and during this summers mysterious scarcity costs over &# a pound at the cheapest chinatown sources in new york with shell in a roll you get the pure meat hopefully just out of the pot and roughly chopped so you can still tell its from a lobster it should be served not on a china plate but in a hot dog bun so you can eat it with your hands the sauce hellmanns from the bottle maybe with some chopped celery real mayonnaise would be a major mistake how do i know all this because i have eaten lobster rolls since the korean war in dozens of lobster roll meccas from machias maine to crane beach in ipswich mass these are places that dont look like much but that define the dish not that they are self conscious specialists lobster shacks are also clam shacks serving crisp fried clam strips also in buns in the hamptons our first stop was among the rose hips lining highway between amagansett and montauk to sample an unreconstructed lobster roll after consuming tuned up simulacra of the dish in urban restaurants that pander to customers nostalgia for olde timey beach food we tried out two old hampton standbys the open air clam bar competes with lunch down the road which has a roof and a somewhat more ambitious menu peace reigned in both places the parking was easy in all respects this was a far cry from the sro crowds at pearl oyster bar the faux shack that rebecca charles opened in greenwich village in rancor soon curdled the chowder ms charless partner in food and life mary redding split off to open marys fish camp a knockoff of a knockoff a few blocks away then this spring a longtime chef from pearl opened a not dissimilar place not far away ms charless lawsuit is pending what these classy knockoffs dont have is water on the horizon and a beach you can walk to without an intervening ride on the subway and that is what the clam bar on the montauk highway can claim with a superior smile i will also stipulate that the lobster roll at clam bar is lavishly filled with perfectly cooked anatomically recognizable pieces of lobster or go to lunch where the lobster roll is also dandy if not quite so lobster forward for me these places set the standard for a classic dish i find it easy to overlook the lack of a toasted pepperidge farm bun of the sort ms charles offers in the village when confronted with the clam bars uncontaminatedly basic presentation context may not be everything but it certainly changes your perception of what works in a specific eating situation this goes for fine dining too when mr conant opens his next manhattan restaurant i will expect to find the sort of savant neo italian mixtures of refined ingredients like cuttlefish pasta and stewed snails that feel right in a top urban setting in sag harbor mr conant has masterminded a deft and imaginative simple country menu the pasta is handmade in house theres local fish and a fritto misto that fries up local seafood in a style that will remind the sophisticated traveler of a lunch by the water in santa margherita in ligure or portofino i particularly liked the summery soups maybe the desserts were the best ricotta cheese with truffled honey was a knockout symphony of basic natural products the peasanty olive oil cake surprised the palate with its strong blast of fresh thyme reminding you again of the brilliance that can be achieved with simple means artfully deployed so far mr conant has resisted any temptation to italianize the lobster roll with a wedding in turkey this summer and a raft of new projects for the fall a lawsuit from turf and surf conscious ms charles is a headache he doesnt need email me at eatingout wsj com
