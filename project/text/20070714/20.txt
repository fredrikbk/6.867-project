health health matters gardening is tough on your body heres how to stay safe every summer about this time new york sports medicine specialist vijay vad starts to see a jump in back pain and other injuries related to overuse bad form and a lack of cross training but its not tennis players runners or golfers who are seeking treatment for their aching bodies in this case the injured athletes are gardeners while most people dont consider gardening a sport health experts say they should gardening can be surprisingly aerobic ask anyone who has mowed an overgrown lawn or hoed a patch of land for a flower bed gardening involves stretching high to clip overgrown bushes and bending low to pull weeds while gym rats are pumping iron gardeners are pushing wheelbarrows and lugging pound bags of soil and forget a quick minute walk or workout most gardeners spend hours digging weeding clipping and planting without taking a break pushing a lawnmower for an hour burns about calories roughly the same as an hourlong doubles tennis match the problem doctors say is that most gardeners dont view a day in the yard as a workout people who would otherwise stretch before tennis or train for a road race put little thought into their gardening fitness yet gardeners often get injured for the same reasons other athletes do poor form taxes muscles and puts too much pressure on joints overuse strains muscles and improper equipment can exacerbate problems gardening can exact a painful toll on an aging body estimates on gardening injuries vary but doctors say anywhere from a third to half of all summer recreational injuries may be related to gardening back pain and knee injuries are common gardening can also lead to carpal tunnel syndrome tennis elbow and other repetitive stress injuries caused by overuse yet gardening can be surprisingly effective exercise when done properly not only does it burn calories but it also counts as weight bearing exercise that is good for the bones researchers from the university of arkansas fayetteville found that women age and older who actively worked in their yards showed higher bone density readings than those who performed other types of exercise such as swimming aerobics dancing and jogging other research shows gardening and spending time outdoors may reduce stress and anxiety so how do you do it right with gardening form is extremely important doctors say gardeners often kneel or squat putting extra pressure on their knees to spare their knees they might stand and bend over for long stretches to weed dig and plant straining their back and spine and putting pressure on sensitive spinal disks and bending over to pick up plants and bags of soil takes an added toll on the back the key doctors say is to approach gardening as you would any other workout stretch your muscles focusing on your legs and lower back cross training is important too keep changing position and activity dont spend hours weeding a flower bed after minutes of weeding stand up stretch and switch to another activity like pruning bushes or mowing the lawn just as with a gym workout develop a "circuit" of training where you move from station to station exercising different parts of your body "cross training is an important part of sports conditioning to prevent injuries and the same applies to gardening " says dr vad "you should do a little shrub work a little weeding and then work on higher plants you dont want to be in one position for too long " the right equipment can help as well gardening benches can take pressure off your knees move the bench around so you dont have to twist or lean to reach a weed or plant long handled tools can also ease the strain on your back although you still may need to get down in the dirt eventually using a hoe shovel or bulb planter with a longer handle allows you to do a lot of the work from a standing position so you spend less time bent over the goal whether youre planting or hauling bags of mulch is to keep your spine as straight as possible some stores offer ergonomic tools with fatter handles and other design changes that claim to lower the risk of aches and pains due to gardening but the specially designed tools dont always help a study in the american journal of occupational therapy compared a regular trowel with an ergonomic version the ergonomic trowel was twice as heavy and had a longer handle researchers asked women between the ages of and to use the trowels to scoop dirt into a flower pot while wearing devices that measure wrist movement the researchers found that the womens wrists moved the same way whether they were holding an ergonomic trowel or a regular one the study suggested that the ergonomic trowel may have caused more ulnar deviation of the wrists which can lead to a repetitive strain injury the key experts say is to use equipment thats comfortable if you start developing pains ask yourself if a lighter tool or one with a fatter or longer handle might take the pressure off but once you change equipment you still need to limit your time in any one gardening activity because the main risk is overuse of a muscle or joint california physician gail dubinskys "yoga for gardeners" video includes six yoga sessions focusing on postures for gardeners and the book "gardeners yoga bend and stretch dig and grow" outlines yoga stretches that can help gardeners both prepare for and recover from a day in the dirt and if gardening continues to cause too many aches and pains you dont have to give it up entirely one solution is to switch to container gardening using big pots and window boxes that eliminate much of the bend and strain of gardening but still give you the pleasure of making things grow ms parker
