pursuits happy blogiversary its been years since the blog was born love them or hate them theyve roiled presidential campaigns and given everyman a global soapbox twelve commentators including tom wolfe newt gingrich the secs christopher cox and actress turned blogger mia farrow on what blogs mean to them notwithstanding the words of tom wolfe who puts an elegant boot below into the corpus of bloggers there are many more people today who would read blogs than disparage them the consumption of blogs is often avid and occasionally obsessive but more commonly it is utterly natural as if turning to them were no stranger than dare one say this here picking ones way through the mornings newspapers the daily reading of virtually everyone under and a fair few folk over that age now includes a blog or two and this reflects as much the quality of todays bloggers as it does a techno psychological revolution among readers of news and opinion we are approaching a decade since the first blogger regarded by many to be jorn barger began his business of hunting and gathering links to items that tickled his fancy to which he appended some of his own commentary on dec on his site robot wisdom mr barger wrote "i decided to start my own webpage logging the best stuff i find as i surf on a daily basis " and the oxford english dictionary regards this as the primordial root of the word "weblog " the dating of the th anniversary of blogs and the ascription of primacy to the first blogger are imperfect exercises others such as david winer who blogged with scripting news and cameron barrett who started camworld were alongside the polemical mr barger in the advance guard and before them there were "proto blogs " embryonic indications of the online profusion that was to follow but by widespread consensus is a reasonable point at which to mark the emergence of the blog as a distinct life form once a neologism outlandish to some weblog has come to be abbreviated to blog a brusque and jaunty word that no one now would think to look up in a dictionary that said the spell check on microsoft word has yet to awaken to the concept of the blog type in "blogging " for instance and you will promptly earn a disapproving underscore in red with the suggestion that "bogging " "clogging " "flogging" or "slogging" unappetizing alternatives all might in truth be the word you seek in the decade since their conception blogs once a smorgasbord of links have evolved into vehicles for a fuller more forceful and opinionated prose not all of it has been lovely to behold or even edifying inevitably there has been bombast verbosity and exposure to the public eye of thoughts that ideally should have remained locked inside fevered heads the impact of blogs on public discourse has included i contend the emergence of a form of "oral blogging " noticeable at seminars and the like where people who might once have asked brisk questions are now empowered by the blog form to hold forth at length with little attempt at self editing the other change in the blog has of course been its mainstreaming blogging was once the province of the nerd without a life nwal which when pronounced aloud sounds remarkably and appropriately like know all today while members of that tribe still abound there are others who blog not because it is their only window on the world but because blogging offers the opportunity of direct and immediate communion with those who would respond to their ideas call it intellectual "skin contact " jack bogle the founder of vanguard blogs his is the bogle eblog so called because the second word is an anagram of his surname and unlike many ceos he blogs without the aid of a ghostblogger gary becker nobel laureate in economics blogs peter stothard editor of the times literary supplement of london blogs mia farrow the cinema actress who also writes below blogs as do politicians and activists of every stripe some blogs are profitable businesses and it is no surprise that the traditional media have bought into the action including this newspaper featured here then are a dozen brief meditations on what the blog has come to mean and on the role blogs play in the usual tussles of any civilized society the appropriate question about blogs years into their first appearance is not whether they are a form of exhibitionism or journalism or theater it is instead this and i pose it with a courteous apology to tom wolfe what would we do without blogs coming from a print culture where the rule was check check source source i was chilled in the early days of the blogosphere by the easy dissemination of lies did you know that was the work of the mossad how else can you explain that the jews were tipped off to stay away that morning gibberish of course but widely believed in the muslim world in indonesia tom friedman reported only of the population could get on the web but these spread rumor as fact "they say he got it from the internet they think its the bible " in this case the revealed "truth" was a blog by one sy adeeb writing from alexandria va under the logo of information times with an address at the national press building in washington which had no trace of him when i tracked him down he told me he got it from al manar the hezbollah station in beirut once upon a time adeeb would be sending out smudged mimeographed sheets that would never see the light of day now as bloggers on the web adeeb and others like him have a megaphone to the world with this spurious authenticity of electronic delivery tony blair says there are million blogs presumably british intelligence has been counting whats lamentable is that mainstream media in a desperate race to be hip will often now quote an unsourced blog story as a source so nobody can really calculate the ripple effect of blogging that said theres a lot thats great about the blogosphere some blogs have become the best check on monopoly mainstream journalism and they provide a surprisingly frequent source of initiative reporting as an example the only hope of staying sane in the lockstep stereotyped reporting of the presidential campaign was to look up eric alterman on msnbc com and the daily howler hilariously documenting the false narrative into which every story about al gore was fitted without a good search engine google of course along with blogdigger feedster and a handful of others it would be impossible to intelligently sample the vast landscape of the blogosphere with that basic tool its at least possible to get a feel for the range of opinions on a given topic its a bit like reading the verbatims from an opinion poll you get someones genuine opinion and it most certainly is not statistically valid blogs can contribute a great deal in the world of finance which turns on information the newer the better as investors strive to make sense of the ever higher mountains of data that were buried under the services of bloggers whom we can imagine sitting at home in their pajamas trolling the internet for us free of charge are likely to be an increasingly consequential addition to the investors tool kit to be sure the blogosphere is subject to all of the same risks as the internet itself many blogs are loaded with vanity posts half truths rumors and even intentional distortions others have spotty quality the securities and exchange commissions office of internet enforcement has discovered several fraudsters operating blogs on the web theres no question however that among the ranks of legitimate bloggers the corporate world is well represented although some executives have undoubtedly hired professionals to blog in their stead and of course youll have seemingly unlimited choices when it comes to selecting your favorite web based market analyst not surprisingly when it comes to the new financial reporting language of xbrl and interactive data blogs such as blog hitachixbrl com are a far more likely place to find the latest scoop than say your local library when in september i posted on one executives blog search for "jonathan schwartz" + "christopher cox" and you can find it it immediately became clear how quickly news can spread the exchange drove home the point that in carrying out the secs mission web based disclosure will be of growing importance on his blog mr schwartz chief executive of sun microsystems challenged the commission to clarify that the use of blogs like his could be consistent with our regulations requiring public companies to share news with the public at the same time they give it to market professionals as a result of that exchange the sec is moving forward on that initiative aided by thoughtful commentary from outside our own cathedral some of it found on blogs do bloggers portend more lasting ramifications for the securities world but of course shareholders are on the move and technology has given them a cheaper and more effective means to communicate from improved price discovery to better corporate governance investors markets managements and boards will never be the same favorite blogs mr cox prefers not to specify any favorite blog because "the way that some sec followers hang on every agency pronouncement will lead someone to decide that monitoring the blog is both a new compliance burden and a guide to the hidden meanings of agency thinking " when my daughter came to me crying because the school newspaper refused to print one of her articles i said why not start your own paper unfiltered publishing was once the exclusive domain of media moguls but today who needs rupert murdoch blogging has become a publishing equalizer that was scarcely dreamed of years ago its free you dont need editors or publishers you dont even need to be able to write well last year i followed my own advice i started www miafarrow org i am my own toughest critic and i cant say the acceptance rate for my pieces is vastly improved but the only person i have to convince that an article is worth publishing is the editor in chief me when a piece is posted the entire staff is elated it is through this experience that ive come to appreciate the purity and power of blogging i have appeared in more than movies written a book and given countless interviews on tv radio and in print yet none of this has allowed me to spotlight issues important to me as completely as my blog i have blogged from some far flung locations such as the ravaged borders between darfur and eastern chad and even in the most isolated regions i knew that i was not alone i had brought with me readers a day and they stuck with me every step of the way via satellite phone i sent messages from the outskirts of the newly attacked town of paoua in remote northwestern central african republic i found myself in the middle of a humanitarian catastrophe hundreds of people had fled into the bush they were eating leaves and drinking swamp water no one was there to protect them "drums and gunfire are the music of the night " i blogged neither the reader nor i could know what would happen next that immediacy and urgency was transmitted to my family and friends back home along with thousands of members of the larger human family in the world of politics and political journalism blogs have evolved differently on the right and the left the seeds of this evolution were sown by two proto blogs that played key roles in the clinton impeachment on jan the drudge report sent an email billed as a blockbuster report "at the last minute at p m on saturday evening newsweek magazine killed a story that was destined to shake official washington to its foundation a white house intern carried on a sexual affair with the president of the united states " drudges borrowed scoop forced the story into the open and within three days president clinton issued the first of many denials his subsequent testimony under oath that he had not had a fling with monica lewinsky led to his impeachment for perjury and obstruction of justice had drudge not acted after the mainstream media hesitated there is no way of knowing if the story would ever have seen the light of day that september after it became clear that mr clinton had lied about his relationship with ms lewinsky a pair of liberal technology entrepreneurs began a project called "censure and move on " an online petition calling on congress to abandon impeachment "immediately censure president clinton and move on to pressing issues facing the country " the web site moveon org later became a hub for liberal political activism opposing the iraq war and other bush administration policies broadly speaking conservative bloggers have followed the drudge model acting as a check on the liberal tendencies of the mainstream media or "msm " conservative bloggers proudest moments have come when they have debunked false and biased msm reporting especially cbss fraudulent expose on president bushs national guard service in and reuters doctored photos from lebanon in the liberal blogosphere meanwhile is a hotbed of edgy activism some might say extremism it pushed forward the valerie plame kerfuffle and gave support to candidates such as ned lamont jon tester and jim webb just as conservative talk radio helped along the republican victory in liberal blogs had their moment of triumph in the midterm elections years later conservatives see blogs as the answer to dan rather who is liberal but not overtly so liberals see them as the answer to rush limbaugh who is open about his opinions and his desire to influence public opinion in both cases they answer an unmet need in the political media marketplace during the s railing at the tv set was the isometric sport of the silent majority progressive political junkies watched in isolation as the washington post prominently printed one whitewater story after another as if they originated on tablets of stone rather than the fax machines of arkansas political operatives many people felt like they were the only ones who scratched their heads in wonder that it all made no sense recoiling in horror as a slick pr operation rapidly escalated from the realm of lazy spoon fed journalism to the constitutional mockery of the clinton impeachment that isolation ended with the advent of the progressive blogosphere which acts as a virtual water cooler for those who not only want to rail at the tv set they want the tv set to listen probably nothing better contrasts the pre and postblogospheric worlds than the whitewater and cia leak stories in one the endless repetition of meaningless gibberish was allowed to take root and become conventional wisdom in the other despite the constant reiteration of abject fantasies like "no underlying crime was committed " the public seemed to realize that its not okay to perjure yourself in front of a grand jury and obstruct justice on behalf of your boss special counsel patrick fitzgerald was allowed to try his case in court before gop spinmeisters could try it in the press and a recent gallup poll shows that of the country thinks bush shouldve left scooter alone to do his time that message wasnt carried by the beltway brahmins of the msm the media elite who transcend party loyalties and embrace libby as one of their own they collectively bristled at the thought that scooter and no doubt themselves should be subject to the verdict of some "ignorant jury" as ann coulter likes to call them no that message was carried by bloggers and their readers the thousands of people who collectively pored over the storys coverage serving as institutional memory and holding media outlets to account when the politics of access journalism threaten to obscure the truth at a time when government is in desperate need of oversight and the fourth estate has become uncomfortably close with those they are tasked with covering the progressive blogosphere is a place where erstwhile howard beales coalesce to fill the gap they come together to challenge the virulent rovian notion that no law is so sacred no tenet of national security so vital it cant be flouted in the pursuit of political gain scooter and other hermetically sealed beltway denizens may think hes a hero but the rest of the country realizes hes nothing better than a garden variety crook it aint perfect but its progress military blogs offer readers a front row seat into the camaraderie pride and challenges of those in uniform no one can better represent the experiences of a soldier than soldiers themselves and "milbloggers" deployed to the frontlines of the war on terror offer first hand insights into their service and sacrifice why does this matter because milbloggers uniquely reveal the human face of our forces from a young trooper patrolling baghdad neighborhoods to a doctor saving lives at a combat support hospital first hand accounts are an important way to communicate the creativity commitment and the lighter moments of those who are placing their lives on the line in the past decade new technologies from satellite phones to internet technology have changed the relationship between information and warfare the militarys former inclination to control information has been replaced by an appreciation of the risks but more importantly the opportunities of cyberspace one example is when soldiers of their own initiative create and maintain personal blogs about their day to day experiences since blogs have the potential to reach a global audience we have established clear guidance to ensure that blogging does not violate operational security individual privacy military policy or propriety our troops are fast learners so while we have had a few breaches there have been many more positive experiences shared by no means do all military blogs paint a positive picture nor should they each posting represents an individuals musings at a particular point in time we are waging a historic fight against a ruthless enemy it is also a campaign that historians will be able to learn more broadly about from anecdotes and insights in todays military blogs favorite blogs "around here folks like to read small wars journal http smallwarsjournal com index php blackfive http www blackfive net and the mudville gazette http www mudvillegazette com " home depot redefined an industry by catering to customers who preferred to fix their homes themselves rather than rely on professional repairmen dell computer revolutionized the computing industry by allowing customers to design their own computers instead of purchasing the prepackaged recommended configurations it may not seem obvious but blogging is part of this same social trend think of blogging as a diy movement in our always intertwined media and political culture blurring the lines between professional producers news organizations and politicians and amateur consumers citizens creating what alvin toffler called "prosumers " characterized by their desire to play an active role in creating the products they consume and by their distrust of professionals who claim to know whats best in politics supporters of a candidate or party are increasingly dissatisfied with simply putting up yard signs or making scripted phone calls they want those in power to listen and respond to them as well they also dont trust professional politicians to do what is right without constant supervision in many ways these are the characteristics of any insurgent political movement but blogging is enabling particularly rapid mobilization and organization weve already seen the effects on the democratic party web sites such as daily kos and moveon org which i find fascinating as models of online activism have made it quite clear that their aim goes beyond stopping president bush theyre also targeting leaders in their own party viewed as unresponsive to the grassroots sen joe liebermans primary loss is the most visible example if republicans remain out of step with their base for too long expect a similar insurgency on the right similarly in news it used to be that the only way to respond to an article or editorial was to write a letter to the editor now anyone can be a publisher bloggers can critique fact check or applaud journalists on their own platform as well as offer their own analysis of world events the term msm is a derogatory term in the blogosphere signifying distrust of the news professional to succeed in this new environment news and political organizations will need to offer products that are both highly responsive and easily customized balancing this pressure with the need for news organizations to remain objective and politicians to act in accordance with their leadership responsibilities in a representative democracy will be a significant challenge when i was a kid there were three broadcast tv channels that everybody was subscribed to a couple of local papers and a handful of local radio stations with significant range for all these broadcasters a community of interest was defined as all the households this broadcast is reaching so there was no real concept of targeted content or communities of interest if you happened to be interested in venture capital and were a college student living in detroit there was no way for you to participate an important term in any community of interest around venture capital unless you moved to silicon valley or paid a ridiculous sum of money to subscribe to an obscure newsletter on the publishing side the barriers to entry were replete with all manner of government regulation massive capital requirements and steep learning curves creating a natural status difference between publishers and subscribers the publishers had massive status the subscribers little or none the internet destroyed most of the barriers to publication the cost of being a publisher dropped to almost zero with two interesting immediate results anybody can publish and more importantly you can publish whatever you want with the cost of publication at almost zero the cost of subscribing to almost any community of interest also dropped to zero anybody can publish and anybody can subscribe and publishers and subscribers are now two sides to the same coin any subscriber can actively participate in any community of interest by becoming a publisher in that community everything is challenged and no media provider is immune from open public questioning this is true across the spectrum of publishers a vc blog written by an expert in silicon valley with years experience is subject to counterpoints from the student in detroit whos similarly passionate about this community of interest the challenge of course is that in a media democracy it is incumbent on all of us to determine how we make decisions about authenticity and authority in media since these traits are no longer an implicit if sometimes unwarranted artifact of publication one by one marshall mcluhans wackiest seeming predictions come true forty years ago he said that modern communications technology would turn the young into tribal primitives who pay attention not to objective "news" reports but only to what the drums say i e rumors and there you have blogs the universe of blogs is a universe of rumors and the tribe likes it that way blogs are an advance guard to the rear for example only a primitive would believe a word of wikipedia which though not strictly a blog shares the characteristics of the genre the entry under my name says that in "major news media" broadcast reports of my death and that i telephoned larry king and said "i aint dead yet give me a little more time and no doubt it will become true " oddly this news supposedly broadcast never reached my ears in any form whatsoever prior to the wikipedia entry and i wouldnt have a clue as to how to telephone larry king i wouldnt have called him in any case i would have called my internist i dont so much mind wikipedias recording of news that nobody ever disseminated in the first place as i do the lame comment attributed to me i wouldnt say "i aint" even if i were singing a country music song in fact i have posted a &# reward for anyone who can write a song containing the verb forms "am not " "doesnt " or "isnt" that makes the billboard top twenty favorite blogs mr wolfe "weary of narcissistic shrieks and baseless information " says he no longer reads blogs lian yue started his blog in the spring of a free lance columnist lian lives in xiamen one of chinas most wealthy cities on the southeast coast his liberal style social commentary and humorous writing quickly won him thousands of readers starting this march lian posted a series of articles warning the people in his hometown that a paraxylene px chemical factory being built in his city could have a disastrous environmental impact he called on residents to speak out against the construction "dont be afraid " lian wrote on his blog on march "please just talk to your friends family and colleagues about this event they might still be in the dark " lian is one of million and growing active bloggers in china while most posts are personal an increasing number of bloggers writing about public affairs have become opinion leaders in their local communities despite the governments "great firewall" to filter out "undesirable information " and the tens of thousands of personnel hired to police the internet the sheer number of bloggers writing about public affairs is having a transformative impact on chinese politics xiamen authorities have vigorously deleted anti px factory messages on any servers within their governing territory however word still got out to local residents via email im and sms on mobile phones one of lian yues articles on this topic was published in a newspaper in a neighboring province and spread "like wildfire" throughout the blogosphere by the end of may sms messages and cellphone photos of protesting slogans such as "boycott px protect xiamen" were sent out to millions of xiamen residents on june and against the local authorities warning several thousand citizens spontaneously showed up "to walk" in front of the city government with anti px message boards participants reported the protest live with their cellphones which directly transmitted photos and text to their blogs the government was forced to announce a "re evaluation" of the factory construction in china blogs enable millions of citizens to express their opinions with reduced political risk simply because of the sheer number of like minded opinions online facing these independent voices the old ideological machine starts to crumble within society bloggers like lian yue are seen as more credible voices than propaganda officials the chinese blogosphere is a dynamically contested terrain what will the long term implications be i think the writing is already on the great firewall iraq occupation global warming abuse of power pick up a blog i read blogs every day for all sorts of reasons but i turn to blogs especially when i want to hear alternative viewpoints for example information on a particular medical treatment from the viewpoint of patients receiving it rather than doctors administering it reports from the battlefield seen through the eyes of soldiers rather than politicians thoughts on a particular technology from the standpoint of engineers rather than executives consider the iraq occupation or colonization corporate media provide saturation coverage but often manage to leave all the most interesting bits for bloggers such as what our government is actually trying to accomplish by occupying iraq blog zmag org ttt what iraqis think about the occupation so far afamilyinbaghdad blogspot com iraqblogcount blogspot com how our soldiers feel about it cbftw blogspot com and how taxes being appropriated for it are being doled out www huffingtonpost com on global warming and reducing our reliance on oil imports stories in corporate media tend to reinforce the status quo dwell on political impracticalities of making changes or focus on pork barrel nonsolutions like ethanol turn instead to quality blogs on the subject like cleantechblog com or amory lovinss blog at green yahoo com and you quickly learn that excellent solutions are at hand but are being mostly ignored because they arent popular with certain large corporations and their representatives in washington with millions of private citizens now blogging there is a diverse and not easily censorable chorus to sound alarms something the corporate media often will not do in fact i think our "citizen journalists" in the blogosphere protect us against abuse of power to a far greater degree than the much ballyhooed "citizen militia" afforded by gun ownership without the daily carnage of accidental and impulse shootings i dont know why anyone reads blogs " the editor in chief of a large magazine once said to me "its like listening to the crazy guy on the subway rant " i had generated a substantial part of my income in the previous three years from professional blogging and wasnt inclined to bash blogs categorically but i conceded that in some cases she was right there are countless blogs that are filled with inarticulate vituperative screeds that appear to have been published by people whose mental facilities are not fully intact ill even confess to having written a few posts that undoubtedly fit that description that said a blog is just a format for content its a way of presenting information in a linear fashion in reverse chronological order ultimately the blog is only as good as the information presented of the various blogs ive written or produced the ones that worked best the ones that had the biggest and most loyal readerships always had a few consistent qualities they were topically focused often in niche areas they published regularly and frequently typically during office hours and several times a day they published content that was original or difficult to find from breaking news to proprietary photographs to obscure links that readers are unlikely to find on their own they were usually well written which has its own intrinsic appeal for anyone who prefers to enjoy what theyre reading and lastly they engaged their readership by soliciting feedback and responding to it in the form of asking for tips allowing comments or otherwise demonstrating some level of interest in their audiences preferences most blogs are personal diaries and dont fit those criteria even in part but the success of the various blogs that do choose to follow the aforementioned formula indicates that its possible to create commercially viable media products for niche audiences even more important for traditional media blogs are an inexpensive way to test new editorial concepts with an engaged audience whose behavior and preferences are more directly measurable than in any other medium this alone should be of interest to any pragmatic editor email us at pursuits wsj com
