redefining journalism there is encouraging news on the first amendment front members of the house and senate have introduced identical versions of the "free flow of information act of " and the full house judiciary committee held its first hearing on the bill just a few weeks back this legislation would enact a statutory "shield law" protecting journalists from having to divulge certain information such as the identity of a source or materials collected during newsgathering thirty three states and the district of columbia have enacted statutory shield laws protecting at least some journalists the most recent was washington state earlier this year additional states have recognized limited privileges for reporters in rulings of their courts yet congress has never enacted a federal version of the law despite the introduction of more than different bills proposing some measure of special protection for journalists over the past years while state shield laws are important they do not apply in federal court when federal law is at issue this means no shield laws apply in federal criminal cases or in civil cases brought under any federal law because most significant cases proceed in federal court based on federal law the absence of a federal shield statute leaves an enormous gap in protection for journalists congresss most recent consideration of a federal shield law began in late and early prompted by the treatment of several reporters by patrick fitzgerald during the plame affair both the house and senate introduced shield legislation and the senate judiciary committee held hearings on the issue but the measures stalled in both houses prior to the election and their future in the th congress appeared uncertain some of the challenges facing earlier legislation stemmed from disagreement about who should be covered many media organizations and others have favored a narrow law apparently believing that a federal shield statute could garner sufficient support only if it applied to a limited group of people the bills circulating in the senate during the past several years thus defined a "journalist" as a person who "for financial gain or livelihood" is engaged in newsgathering or news reporting "as a salaried employee of or independent contractor for" one of several specific types of media organizations or another "professional medium or agency " to qualify as a journalist the organization must have the "processing and researching of news or information intended for dissemination to the public" as one of its "regular functions " this constricted conception of who qualifies as a journalist is employed in many state shield laws the free flow of information act of however adopts a dramatically broader view of journalism and journalists the bills safeguards apply to anyone engaged in "journalism " which is defined as "the gathering preparing collecting photographing recording writing editing reporting or publishing of news or information that concerns local national or international events or other matters of public interest for dissemination to the public " the sponsors of this legislation have appropriately resisted calls to regard journalism as something carried out only by employees of established news organizations the "freedom of the press" conferred by the first amendment belongs to all of us yet the century that preceded the emergence of the web appears to have hardened an artificial distinction between professional journalists and everyone else after an extended detour during which the means of mass communication effectively rested in the hands of the few technological developments with the web at its foundation are unwinding that process and democratizing communications as a whole and journalism in particular today it is apparent that people operating outside of traditional media organizations including many bloggers individually and collectively play a significant role in breaking analyzing and distributing news this seems certain to continue as more and more people take to the web in an effort to share information and ideas shield laws are just one of many circumstances in which the government bestows privileges on those deemed "journalists" unavailable to others others include admission to war zones crime scenes and other areas off limits to the public special access to official records and the benefits of quasi official status at many government buildings such as the white house the supreme court and on capitol hill as journalism returns to its status as an activity rather than a profession we need to rethink the nature of journalism in the internet age and consider carefully how nontraditional journalists should be treated relative to those who work for established media organizations it remains to be seen how the free flow of information act of will fare in congress but thankfully the sponsors of this bill have embraced a view of journalism as an endeavor that can be undertaken by any of us mr gant is an attorney and the author of the just published "were all journalists now" free press see related letter "letters to the editor a credibility
