in europe god is not dead christian groups are growing faith is more public is supply side economics the explanation late last year a swedish hotel guest named stefan jansson grew upset when he found a bible in his room he fired off an email to the hotel chain saying the presence of the christian scriptures was "boring and stupefying " this spring the scandic chain scandinavias biggest ordered the new testaments removed in a country where barely of the population goes to church each week the affair seemed just another step in christian europes long march toward secularism then something odd happened a national furor erupted a conservative bishop announced a boycott a leftist radical who became a devout christian and talk show host denounced the biblical purge in newspaper columns and on television a young evangelical christian organized an electronic letter writing campaign asking scandic why are you removing bibles but not pay porn on your tvs scandic which had started keeping its bibles behind the front desk put the new testament back in guest rooms "sweden is not as secular as we thought " says christer sturmark head of swedens humanist association a noisy assembly of nonbelievers to which the bible protesting hotel guest belongs after decades of secularization religion in europe has slowed its slide toward what had seemed inevitable oblivion there are even nascent signs of a modest comeback most church pews are still empty but belief in heaven hell and concepts such as the soul has risen in parts of europe especially among the young according to surveys religion once a dead issue now figures prominently in public discourse gods tentative return to europe has scholars and theologians debating a hot question why part of the reason pretty much everyone agrees is an influx of devout immigrants christian and muslim newcomers have revived questions relating to faith that europe thought it had banished with the th century enlightenment at the same time anxiety over immigration globalization and cutbacks to social welfare systems has eroded peoples contentment in the here and now prodding some to seek firmer ground in the spiritual some scholars and christian activists however are pushing a more controversial explanation the laws of economics as centuries old churches long favored by the state lose their monopoly grip europes highly regulated market for religion is opening up to leaner more aggressive religious "firms " the result they say is a supply side stimulus to faith "monopoly churches get lazy " says eva hamberg a professor at lund universitys centre for theology and religious studies and co author of academic articles that based on swedish data suggest a correlation between an increase in religious competition and a rise in church going europeans are deserting established churches she says "but this does not mean they are not religious " upstarts are now plugging new spiritual services across europe from u s influenced evangelical churches to a christian sect that uses a hallucinogenic herbal brew as a stand in for sacramental wine niklas piensoho chief preacher at stockholms biggest pentecostal church says even sometimes oddball quasi religious fads "tell me you can sell spirituality " his own career suggests that a free market in faith is taking root he was poached by the pentecostals late last year after he boosted church attendance for a rival protestant congregation most scholars used to believe that modernization would extinguish religion in the long run but that view always had trouble explaining why america a nation in the vanguard of modernity is so religious the god is finished thesis came under more strain in the s and s after iran a rapidly modernizing muslim nation exploded with fundamentalist fervor and other fast advancing countries in latin america and asia showed scant sign of ditching religion now even europe the heartland of secularization is raising questions about whether god really is dead the enemy of faith say the supply siders is not modernity but state regulated markets that shield big established churches from competition in america where church and state stand apart more than of the population worships at least once a month in europe where the state has often supported but also controlled the church with money and favors the rate in many countries is or less "the state undermined the church from within " says stefan sward a leader of swedens small but growing evangelical movement consider the scene on a recent sunday at stockholms hedvig eleonara church a parish of the church of sweden a lutheran institution that until was an official organ of the swedish state fewer than people nearly all elderly gathered in pews beneath a magnificent th century dome seven were church employees the church seats over hedvig eleonara has three full time salaried priests and gets over &# million each year though a state levy annika sandstrom head of its governing board says she doesnt believe in god and took the post "on the one condition that no one expects me to go each sunday " the church scrapped sunday school last fall because only five children attended just a few blocks away passion church an eight month old evangelical outfit fizzed with fervor nearly young swedes rocked to a high decibel band "its like adrenaline running through my blood " they sang in english "were talking about jesus jesus jesus " passion set up by andreas nielsen a year old swede who found god in florida gets no money from the state it holds its service in a small low ceilinged hall rented from stockholms casino theatre a drama company church says mr nielson should be "the most kick ass place in the world " jesus was "king of the party " the message has lured some unlikely converts including a heavily tattooed self described former mobster "ive gone soft " says daniel webb the son of an english father and swedish mother who spent five years in jail for illegal arms possession and assault he was baptized like most swedes in the church of sweden but never prayed he went to church for the funerals of fellow hoods but scoffed at christian sympathy for the meek mr webb first went to passion church three months ago with a female friend expecting to be bored he got hooked "an ocean of anger has calmed " he says his ex wife he says "thinks im ridiculous " he says hes turned his back on crime europes upstart churches arent yet attracting anywhere near enough customers to offset a post world war ii decline but they are shaking up and in some places reviving the market for religion argues rodney stark a pioneer of religious supply side theory at baylor university in texas mr stark first developed the notion of a "religious market" in the s as a way to explain americas persistent faith it posits that people are naturally religious but that their religiosity varies depending on the vigor of what he calls religious suppliers "wherever churches are a little more energetic and competitive youve got more people going to church " he says the notion that adam smiths invisible hand reaches into the spiritual realm has many detractors steve bruce a professor of sociology at aberdeen university in scotland says market theory "works for cars and soap powder but it does not work for religion " christianity in europe he says has reached the point of no return like a dying language doomed because too few people transmit its vocabulary to their children the church of sweden is also skeptical of the supply side view "we dont sell a product " says archbishop anders wejryd with congregations he says his church must cater to a spectrum of views he says the church of swedens more dynamic parishes some of which mimic evangelicals methods are thriving predictions that christianity is doomed in europe date back centuries writing in the early s thomas woolton an englishman estimated it would die out by a century later frances auguste comte proclaimed the end of mankinds "theological stage " karl marx and friedrich engels viewed religion as a symptom of capitalist ills that would be cured by socialism more recently the demise of christianity in europe has led to warnings that the continent risks becoming "eurabia " a land dominated by islam conservative u s preachers and politicians curse european nonbelief and trumpet the religious values of americas pilgrim fathers but mr stark the supply side theorist says americas religiosity is relatively recent in he says around of americans belonged to churches that is about the same as the current proportion of the population in belgium france germany and the u k that worships at least once a month according to s european union funded european social survey in the u s the american revolution ended ecclesiastical hegemony in the colonies that had an established church and unleashed a raucous tide of religious competition as methodists baptists shakers and other churches proliferated church going rose reaching around in the early part of the th century he says europe never developed such a religious bazaar the church of sweden the church of england the catholic church in italy and france state funded churches in germany and others lost their de facto "monopoly" status to other denominations over a century ago but they retained their ties to the state and economic privileges grace davie professor of sociology at britains exeter university compares them to "public utilities" institutions that people look to for basic services such as weddings and funerals but that dont demand day to day involvement the church of sweden for example has a near monopoly on death its broad property holdings gathered since the th century include most of swedens graveyards the state still pays it to oversee funerals even those involving muslim rites around of swedens nine million people are nominally members of the "state church" though few ever worship and around are avowed atheists says jonas bromander of the churchs research unit swedens evangelical churches by contrast have only members but they worship regularly and are growing slowly in number tension between the church of sweden and would be competitors goes back to the early th century when early evangelicals were banished into exile so called free churches were later permitted but they remained in the shadow of the state coddled church of sweden after world war ii the church of sweden followed the leftward direction of swedish political life the ecclesiastical department the ministry that supervised the church was headed for years by a prominent atheist liberal theology triumphed church attendance plummeted in the early s ulf ekman a church of sweden priest set up livets ord or the word of life an american style congregation in uppsala his strict bible based message and charismatic preaching style attracted a flood of worshippers and also controversy the church of sweden stripped mr ekman of his status as a preacher the media denounced him as a cult leader bankrolled by america the government investigated today his church has around active members a big impetus to the return of faith is fear of the future says elisabeth sandlund editor of swedens main christian newspaper dagen in sweden and across europe old moorings are coming loose as cradle to grave welfare systems buckle "people want something solid to hold on to " says ms sandlund while working as a financial journalist she started sneaking off to church and in eventually told her husband she believed in god "he was not happy " she says whether competition for believers actually boosts belief stirs bitter academic discussion measuring religiosity is difficult and each side cites different statistics the latest data from a major research project that tracks churchgoing and belief in concepts such as god and soul the european values survey were compiled between and they show a decline in faith in the s followed by a leveling off and for some indicators a slight bump in the s to try to refute the supply siders aberdeen universitys mr bruce points to poland and ireland highly religious countries each dominated by a catholic "monopoly church " mr stark and those in his camp counter that market mechanisms in poland and ireland were trumped by the churchs role as a vehicle for nationalism more revealing they say is americas boisterous religious market and its high levels of religiosity one factor now spurring religious competition in europe is the availability of state money that traditionally flowed almost entirely to established churches it still does but the process is more open in italy the state used to pay the salaries of catholic priests but in it began letting taxpayers choose which religious groups get financial support the proceeds of a new "religious tax" of are now divided according to taxpayer preference among the catholic church four non catholic churches the jewish community and a state religious and humanitarian fund the result is an annual beauty contest ahead of a june income tax deadline as churches try to lure taxpayer money with advertising campaigns catholics get the lions share of nearly &# billion in the last year for which figures are available but according to a study by italian lawyer massimo introvigne and mr stark the system "reminds italians every year that there is a religious economy " sweden has also overhauled church financing in the government gave up formal control of the church of sweden with great fanfare it replaced what had been a church "tax" with an annual "fee " still collected by tax authorities levied on church of sweden members for the first time taxpayers were told what they owed in cash instead of being given just a percentage figure which is typically under of household income church of sweden membership dropped abruptly and the church launched a publicity drive pitching religion membership stabilized though church going continued to decline still the established church last year received around &# billion in membership fees via state tax collectors the church also brings in some &# million in funeral and graveyard administration taxes a government run commission provides money to registered religious groups outside the church of sweden but these funds totaled only &# million last year passion church and other such ventures rely mostly on voluntary donations by their worshippers this says kjell axel johansson an evangelical priest keeps upstarts more in tune with their flock he recently set up a new church that unable to afford a permanent home rents a bar for a few hours "god doesnt care about packaging " he says hotel chain scandic meanwhile has reversed course before christians mobilized it planned to keep a few copies of the new testament at the front desk along with the quran and hebrew bible with the hotel under new ownership since april bibles are back in rooms the swedish arm of gideons a bible distribution group recently gave the chain new testaments in swedish and english
