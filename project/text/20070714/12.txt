essay back on the cutting edge going green can be a surprising remedy for some of the ills of later life it took a hybrid to yank me at the advanced age of back into the car culture after my teen years when my head could be turned by any boy with a sports car or a cool hot rod i came to regard cars as necessary evils and about as exciting as toothbrushes but going green has brought unexpected delights well beyond virtuous gas mileage almost miles per gallon in town our prius is a computer on wheels so high tech that it requires a daunting page manual my husband and i are studying its innards on a need to know basis and plan to tackle the supplementary manual for the navigation system before our first road trip after our clunky noisy fume belching suv our clean nearly silent prius feels like the future this it turns out is not a small thing its a genuine hoot to suddenly be back in the vanguard ive begun to realize that one of the pitfalls of growing older is the natural tendency to resist change to sneer at the newfangled in the to world for example my paycheck depended on adapting to the ever changing menu of hardware and software that management served up not to mention a revolving cast of youthful supervisors once i left the office behind however it took almost no time before i began to feel swamped and befuddled by the dizzying onrush of technological change im hardly a luddite i email and google with the best of them and am even irritated by reactionaries who refuse to use a computer nonetheless i can feel myself sliding into dangerous techno illiteracy and that i fear is the path to marginalization and dependency the symptoms are everywhere fliers for best buy and circuit city no longer make sense to me just what does a "wireless g router" do i need assistance at kinkos to use the copiers i couldnt download music to an ipod if my life depended on it and if something were to happen to my husband id have to hire a technician to teach me how to operate our dvd player he is also my in house computer geek patiently restoring documents ive erased and bringing my balky printer to heel in a world of blackberrys and plasma tvs i feel like a traveler in a strange land badly in need of a guide and a translator but in at least one respect my new vehicle im back on the cutting edge not that its been easy at the showroom the saleswoman talked so fast while demonstrating the priuss various touch screens and accessories its xm satellite radio its ipod jacks and bluetooth wireless capability that she left us feeling like doddering fossils head spinning i wondered are we qualified to operate this machine with a little practice however we quickly became reliant on features like the keyless entry and ignition i have only one question how did we live so long perpetually fumbling for car keys now i approach the car laden with shopping bags and it magically unlocks itself thanks to a "smart" electronic sensor stashed in purse or pocket to start the car i simply press a button this one design modification has been as good as ibuprofen for my arthritic hands the sticky ignition on the suv often required a painful two handed maneuver to turn the key admittedly the dashboard monitor on our new car that tracks fuel consumption is a distraction something like a biofeedback machine it gives a running readout that shows how your driving habits affect gas mileage the graph on the touch screen shoots up to or mpg whenever the electric motor kicks in sometimes this can feel like too much information this week for example the average gas mileage has been slipping instead of climbing as before what am i doing wrong is it because we turned on the air conditioner or was it the heavy sack of birdseed we lugged in the trunk fretting over gyrations on the graph make it hard to keep your eyes on the road it wasnt until we left the prius at home during a brief florida vacation that i knew we had completely bonded lost in rush hour traffic near the miami airport we tried in vain to operate our rental cars fan air conditioner and headlights with only inscrutable graphic icons to guide us the little snowflake on the dashboard dial should we push it to cool things off or was the air conditioning controlled by the red and blue swoosh lines on another dial it was a perfect storm of the unfamiliar strange roads worthless directions construction detours and a missing manual coping with the new and unexpected had again reduced us to incompetents and amid the stress sharp words were exchanged by the time we arrived home our new car felt like a comfortable old shoe by contrast its easy to understand why so many older folks retreat to petrified routines and cranky nostalgia trips about the good old days and while i see no need to become a crackberry addict or a text messager at my age neither do i want to become an ossified fuddy duddy now and then selectively im trying to flex my rusty neural synapses by mastering something new and ahead of the curve buying a hybrid fit the bill on a number of levels tackling its digital intricacies was a challenging brain teaser to be sure more important choosing to go green has been a surprising remedy for one of the curses of growing older feeling sidelined in the slow lane for stick in the muds sure theres the smug satisfaction of having a hedge against soaring prices at the pump but thats the least of it instead of merely stewing about climate change and foreign oil dependency its bracing to have taken action of course by itself our new car wont make a degree of difference in global warming but theres undeniable pleasure in burning only a third of the gasoline we needed to fuel our mpg suv using a calculator on the environmental protection agencys web site i learned were single handedly cutting our carbon dioxide emissions by almost pounds a year the equivalent of taking one passenger car off the road to me thats powerful and downright patriotic trying to reduce our carbon footprint has become a kind of retirement hobby one that happens to mesh nicely with our more frugal fixed income standard of living for example im trying to patronize local greenmarkets instead of buying produce trucked across the continent we collect rainwater for gardening and are recycling junk mail and scrap paper as well as cans and newspapers next i plan to start emulating a friend who when invited to dinner brings the hostess a package of compact fluorescent light bulbs instead of a bottle of wine ms graham is a writer in
