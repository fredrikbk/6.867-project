lifestyles mad for muscle cars one mans search for the vehicle that helped define his youth my brother gary is having a midlife crisis it probably isnt evident to anyone else but his wife and me he is still his usual cheerful self exercising eating right and getting as much sleep as his job allows so how do maria and i know he is in the throes of a crisis he wants to buy a muscle car i dont mean a powerful bmw or a new lexus i mean a s vintage dodge charger or an early s plymouth duster clearly he is insane doesnt he know these were among the cars sloppily engineered and assembled overpowered unsafe and inefficient that opened the door to the great wave of japanese cars that now threatens the very existence of ford motor co general motors corp and daimlerchrysler ags chrysler unit garys answer after reminding me about the small fortune ive poured into my foot sailboat is measured he acknowledges that such vehicles arent the best of investments mostly because the market today is overhyped and he is well aware that there is a world of difference between the muscle cars of yesteryear and todays best of class cars still gary and lots of aging baby boomers who got their first drivers licenses when the beatles were making music are eager to buy they have amassed some disposable income they want to recapture a vestige of their youth and the automobiles themselves are available if expensive so faced with steep prices and perhaps having little or no mechanical know how how do aging speedsters get back in the fast lane of muscle car ownership based on my brothers experience it takes research fortitude and an understanding spouse it is generally accepted that the late john z delorean pioneered the muscle car concept in by stuffing an oversized engine into the lowly pontiac tempest ushering in the gto the light and lively gto was an immediate sales hit for general motors and put pressure on other auto makers to make performance affordable and fun new muscle cars sold for around &# to &# making them accessible to a generation spoiled by gasoline prices of less than &# a gallon the love affair faded in the early s with the advent of higher gasoline prices and higher insurance premiums today the best of class muscle cars can fetch astounding prices a plymouth barracuda in pristine condition and loaded with a cubic inch "hemi" engine might bring a half million dollars at auction you can join the crowd first by setting parameters for your search based on the make model and year of the car you want and what you can afford you can always restore a less than perfect model or have someone do it though you need to take into account how much you are willing to spend after a purchase remember routine components are going to break on these oldsters if you have any hope of making your muscle car an "investment " look for original equipment which enhances resale but be sure to investigate any cars and parts advertised as original there are several services that track automobile vehicle identification numbers and that can give you a fairly thorough history of any specific car carfax at carfax com gets good reviews from automotive enthusiasts gary has some specific requirements for a muscle car one is that it must be a chrysler product our father had a desk job but he was one of the last of the shade tree mechanics and a longtime chrysler fan i can remember his dinnertime lectures explaining the superiority of chryslers torqueflite automatic transmissions the power and economy of the cubic inch engine and the handling achieved through torsion bar suspension whatever another necessity for gary is a fastback roof the long sloping style that was all the rage in the late s as the domestic auto makers looked for ways to streamline their entries in stock car racing that pretty much narrowed his choices to cars like the and dodge chargers garys own mechanical aptitude is nonexistent but he has learned about the prices and pitfalls of owning a muscle car from magazines like hemmings motor news long the bible of old car aficionados hemmings has since branched out into other automotive titles and garys current favorite is muscle machines he has spent countless saturdays at local and regional automobile and hot rod shows always visiting the shows "car corral" where for sale machines lurk there also are dozens of sites online that compare prices if you have enough money you can hire people to locate a muscle car that meets your exact wants and tastes but in garys price range &# to &# and given his willingness to buy a car in less than perfect condition that didnt make sense gary found two cars on the internet that looked interesting both dodge chargers and both located in north carolina both were offered by classic car dealers he recently made the road trip to take a look the first one was a black charger with a cubic inch engine and dual exhausts he liked the engine and the test drive went fairly well but the cars black paint was flawed with a surface that resembled an orange peel grainy and scaly the sure sign of a repaint job done by an amateur on the cheap the second charger was white advertised as all original and backed up with original documentation it had low mileage the engine and was ready to drive fix one dent in the side and give it a new paint job and this could be a prize also featured at the charlotte dealership was a plymouth duster newly outfitted with a cubic inch engine not original flawless paint and nice redone upholstery while at the outer limits of garys budget the car immediately became a candidate and reminded him to stay flexible about models worth considering he didnt make a purchase on that trip but it was a good learning experience im sure he is closer now to finding something he likes than he was before and what does he plan to do with the car of his dreams once he finds it restore it to pristine condition and enter it in competitive shows hardly his future plans call for weekend jaunts to the beach some upgrades as the budget permits and just enjoying the trip down memory lane me im going sailing mr sease a former reporter and editor of the wall street journal is a free lance writer living in vero beach fla he can be reached at encore wsj com
