of manners this soldier statesman became the spokesman for ideal courtly life and behavior he not only set the tone for the literature of the high renaissance but also became the complete man luomo universale that rare arbiter of taste and achievement who actually lived up to his own ideal of a courtier italians referred to "the courtier" as il libro doro though the gold was wrought slowly the book was begun in written mainly from to edited and polished over more than a decade and published in in venice by there had been editions immensely influential "the courtier" made an important contribution to what is sometimes called the revival of learning in the renaissance the books influence on behavior was felt at courts throughout europe the earliest translation in was into spanish two translations into french followed in and by it had appeared in five languages a significant translation occurred in when sir thomas hoby turned "the courtier" into a compelling english language work that every educated elizabethan read particularly influenced by it were shakespeare donne and ben jonson clearly the book traveled in the words of the renaissance historian lauro martines it swiftly became "a social breviary for gentlemen outside italy " "the courtier" was written as a conversation it purports to give an account of a series of after dinner discussions held in the drawing room of the ducal palace of urbino in march where the question of what constitutes a perfect courtier was debated the dialogue is set in a connecting narrative with men and four ladies scholars churchmen and aristocrats taking part as well as the perfect courtier his ideal counterpart the court lady was also being defined the discussion over four evenings forms the subject matter of "the courtier"s four books the evenings show the competent hand of elisabetta gonzaga the blue stocking duchess of urbino who managed this elegant and most refined of the italian courts the first evenings discussion quoting castiglione was "to fashion in words a perfect courtier setting forth all the conditions and particular qualities requisite for a man deserving of this name everyone being allowed to contradict anything thought to be inappropriate " among the topics of the second evening were outdoor games music the place of wit in conversation chess dignity and self control the qualities required for the perfect court lady and the subject of love filled the third evenings conversation the final evenings discussion is in effect a summary statement on the purpose of a courtier excellence in a courtier is not a sufficient end in itself but rather a means of enabling him to fulfill his primary purpose "to win the favor and confidence of his prince as to be able always to speak the truth with no fear or danger of giving offense " at the center of "the courtier" was the humanist philosophy a broad based collection of high minded values embodying entire fields of knowledge from poetry and geography to natural science castiglione drew on all this for his courtiers pursuit of eloquence his shying away from specialization his gentle aloofness and nonchalance sprezzatura is the italian word for this special attitude this careless elegance though it is all of the parts that make up the renaissance gentleman in modeling a perfect courtier castiglione imagines a courtly world tilted toward perfection this was a powerful current in th century italy an upper class urge to create alternative worlds imaginary and better than the world around them the son of an ancient noble but poor family castiglione was related through his mother to the ruling gonzaga family of mantua thanks to those connections he was privately tutored in latin and greek guided in the classics and the studies of humanism in he was given permission to seek advancement and greater career opportunities at the court of urbino one of the most civilized places in europe and a perfect setting for castigliones courtier "the courtier" is more than a description of the ideal renaissance gentleman a vivid and elegant picture of court life of the time and a polished treatise on etiquette social problems and intellectual accomplishments it has a timeless quality and enduring influence in a recent review of gore vidals memoir "point to point navigation " inigo thomas quotes a paragraph on well mannered personal relationships from vidals novel "julian " concluding "thats a passage that might come straight from the pages of the courtier " castigliones life from beginning to end was in pursuit of the ideal and peopled with leading names of the time his portrait which hangs in the louvre was painted by raphael a native of urbino his tomb was designed by the architect painter guilio romano with epitaph composed by the literary light and future cardinal pietro bembo castiglione wrote little during his life but what little he wrote which includes sonnets and essays is of rare merit castigliones letters are of particular interest for political literary and historical studies revealing not only the writers personality but describing the famous people castiglione met and his diplomatic activity but it was the world wide popularity of his book on ideal behavior that made castiglione famous more famous even than the duke of urbino himself his diplomatic career shuttled him from mantua to urbino from spain to rome and back to mantua for his efforts in the italian wars he received the title of count he marriage to ippolita torelli a descendant of a noble family sadly lasted but four years her death occurred while he served as ambassador in rome inscribed on her tomb were his words "to ippolita torelli who was no less fair than chaste this tomb is
