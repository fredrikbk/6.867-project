health medical tools looking for health information online try these new web sites few tools online are more popular and more frustrating than those that offer information about health and medicine a full of online users turn to their computers to research health issues according to research from jupiterkagan inc s jupiterresearch among online users age and older said they relied more on the internet for health information than they did a year earlier but a quarter of consumers who look for health information online say they are overwhelmed by the information they find according to a survey last august from the pew internet and american life project in washington with that in mind a handful of start ups in recent months have introduced search engines dedicated to health topics some big players are getting involved as well microsoft corp earlier this year bought one of the start ups medstory inc of foster city calif we looked at a half dozen of the newest sites at the same time we asked for some opinions from health professionals about the best ways to research health topics online most people searching for health information online use general interest search engines like google or yahoo or health portals such as the popular webmd webmd com and msn health &amp fitness health msn com or the new revolution health revolutionhealth com portals generally include search functions but are more like online guidebooks in that they gather and categorize content they think will interest users health news ratings for doctors or hospitals guides to chronic conditions or content that the portals themselves create for example several of the new search sites may contain one or more of these features common to portals but all focus first and foremost on search because of that focus in many cases they give users access to a broader swath of information than portals no one health search site will be best for everyone deciding which if any of the new online options will work for you depends in large part on your personal preferences concerning the way the sites are laid out their navigation features and the information they provide for instance medstory com was quick to find complete information about procedures for diagnosing celiac disease a chronic inflammatory disorder of the small intestine that some sites failed to find but we didnt like it that medstorys results for a "sore throat" search started with a wikipedia article rather than a more authoritative source and while we didnt have much use for many of the information filters based on age ethnicity etc at healia inc s healia com we liked how this was one of the few engines that returned a link for the celiac sprue association a key american organization for those with the disease "it is very hard to find the one path or search engine to get the perfect results " says monique levy a senior analyst at jupiterresearch in new york "use several experiment " also keep in mind that these sites are evolving all the time so the setup you encountered or the search results you got last week might be different a month from now for instance a later "sore throat" search on medstory produced very different results it might pay to check in on the various sites occasionally to see if they have changed a central challenge for these sites and their users is locating reliable information you can of course do the sifting yourself professional sources such as the journal of the american medical association are likely to be more reliable in health matters than general interest publications says benjamin kligler associate professor of medicine at new yorks albert einstein college of medicine but if you dont want to second guess your search results you can also stick to sites that search only select health sources such as mammahealth com owned by mamma com inc or that categorize search results based on their origin healthline networks inc s healthline com and taumed inc s taumed com for example segregate results keeping licensed content from medical publishers apart from search results culled from generally available web content healthline and healia also list quality ratings for some of their results dr kligler also recommends keeping an eye out for medical sites with commercial sponsors "if a site is clearly sponsored by a pharmaceutical company you have to realize that this is one perspective" that you may want to balance with other perspectives he says we ran a variety of searches on six sites aside from some of the different approaches weve already outlined one key difference among the sites lies in how they return search results overall we found the search results at mammahealth for example most resembled what you get at a general interest search engine only they were labeled by categories such as definition causes news and so forth this saved us a lot of time we might otherwise have spent clicking on unhelpful results the other sites use many of the same headings to categorize search results but generally offer more options for exploration enter "arthritis" in the health search engine at kosmix corp s kosmix com for example and youll see nine topics such as potential risks drugs and herbs and supplements to explore under an explore connections heading more results are categorized under other headings including basic reading and blogs at medstory a "hip replacement" search returned a standard list of results but with the option to call up more precise results by clicking through categories such as conditions procedures clinical studies complementary medicine and more each with multiple subcategories beneath them there are also icons to direct you to results in news articles clinical trials or research articles healia has a similar approach in that it returns a traditional list of search results but lets you refine some searches by clicking on a variety of tabs toward the top of the screen labeled prevention causes risks symptoms diagnosis tests and treatment healthline also offers a healthmap with each set of search results which lays out a variety of different avenues of exploration the healthmap for menieres disease a condition characterized by recurrent vertigo hearing loss and other symptoms for example has clickable boxes for symptoms causes diagnosis and other topics taumed meanwhile offers a variety of additional search terms related to menieres such as inner ear tinnitus and vertigo taumed also has a helpful feature for searching within your results for additional terms for example after searching for information on menopause you could ask for only the menopause results that include information about hot flashes for us the key with all the sites is experimentation many features werent self evident revealing themselves only as we clicked around the site at that point we found ourselves impressed with the extensive features and functions we discovered as dr kligler notes "patients have found things on the web that have been tremendously helpful to them that i would never have found " ms borzo writes about business and technology from california she can be reached at encore wsj
