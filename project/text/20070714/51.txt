pursuits leisure &amp arts and the band plays on contrary to the rumors symphony orchestras have a bright future nashville tenn music stopped symphony shuttered " in the past decade headlines announcing the demise of a symphony were an unfortunate feature of our cultural landscape were past tense because if the upbeat mood of the delegates to the nashville meeting of the league of american orchestras at the end of last month is to be trusted those days are fading of course there are significant problems in the past organizations such as the chicago and boston symphonies had generally funded themselves according to a formula of of the annual budget from ticket sales and hall rental from annual contributions and from recording income but these percentages have changed although there are exceptions philanthropies are increasingly directing their gifts away from support for the arts and to environmental and world health concerns similarly state and local governments are finding it difficult to support the arts as their aging populations demand more generous slices of the tax pie for health and social services because the tests mandated by no child left behind have no musical content many school districts are shrinking what little music instruction they once offered resulting in a growing population of young adults who though passionate about music find the classical realm terra incognita and the academy increasingly views orchestras and the core repertory for which they were developed as irrelevant in an age of multiculturalism ticket and cd sales mirror this change in taste income from ticket sales for regular season classical concerts now peaks at with some ensembles percentage being substantially lower and orchestras income from new recordings has disappeared in all areas of music cd sales fell during the first quarter of alone and its estimated that one billion pieces of music are traded illegally every month while relatively few of these trades or sales are works like stravinskys "threni " the loss of income is genuine and unites symphony directors with the pop managers in their belief that cds are not income generators but instead marketing tools for profit making tours and t shirt sales when asked when the nashville symphony might see a return on its critically acclaimed recording of the ives second symphony with naxos alan valentine the symphonys ceo said "never " but mr valentines "never" was mischievous and here lies the basis of the delegates optimism he was sitting two blocks from one of the countrys most successful new auditoriums in a city that in kiplinger ranked as the countrys no "smart" destination partly because of its naxos recording orchestra orchestras and the music they play are important part of american civic pride when last year the duluth superior symphony needed a million dollar acoustic shell for its performing hall a quarter of the funds were given by a local hospital the hospital leadership told andrew berryhill the orchestras executive director that the presence of a vibrant symphony in duluth mich was necessary for the hospital to attract quality physicians to its staff when cvs caremark was looking for a city in which to relocate its headquarters the orchestra and the depth of the arts culture it exemplified played a prominent role in the companys decision to settle in nashville but civic boosterism itself isnt enough to sustain an orchestra the delegates were told that the findings of a two year study in st paul minn and pittsburgh suggests that orchestras institutional health lies in the adoption of a new business model music managers typically think that their job is to present the highest level of musical performances possible and pay for them by selling seats and catching grants it isnt sell all the seats to all your performances market through every site on the web and corral every foundation executive you can and your orchestra will still face a deficit music executives real business is developing communities of patrons and educating their children this is hardly news from machauts dinner with charles v of france in to klaus heymanns founding of the naxos label the culture of classical music has been funded through the generosity of informed patrons the "new" business model simply recognizes this ancient reality but the business of creating an informed patron begins in the first grade here the san francisco symphony serves as the industrys benchmark for years it has underwritten a program that yearly takes musicians into the classrooms of san francisco students in grades one through five this year the program is being expanded to provide middle and high school students with instruments they can borrow in the "keeping score" tv series the sfos music director michael tilson thomas and members of the symphony discuss and perform major works of the western canon programs on works by beethoven copland and stravinsky nine are projected have already been carried on most pbs affiliates and the school districts in california arizona and oklahoma are integrating elements of the programs into their basic curricula have a year old listen to the opening chords of the "eroica " give him a clarinet when hes and by the time hes chances are hes a subscriber looking for ways he can become a patron because all that music changed his life jesse rosen the leagues executive vice president and managing director said that there were a lot of reasons to be optimistic about the future of americas symphonic music the works premiered by league orchestras last season alone could hardly have been presented by an institution that wasnt robust lets hope hes right silenced music and shuttered orchestras cant change anybodys life mr linton is a composer and teaches at middle tennessee state university
