pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink bartenders head to head ever wonder where all those elegant new drinks people order in cocktail lounges come from " the question was asked in by charles chop at the time the head of the california chapter of the u s bartenders guild its a good question and one that i am often asked these days the prime source of new cocktails seems to be the liquor companies themselves but mr chop had another answer in mind he was eager to credit the annual cocktail contest sponsored by his union "a shake of this just enough of that eighty of the nations finest professional bartenders going at each other head to head " there is a long tradition of cocktail contests at home and abroad one of the first held in in paris was called the "grand prix du cocktail " and included such contestants as racy fauvist painter kees van dongen and the wildly prolific playwright and filmmaker sacha guitry a few years later at the end of prohibition californias del monte hotel held its own cocktail competition with entries from celebrities including actresses carole lombard and marlene dietrich and author sinclair lewis but since those days most drink meets have been the province of professionals as with the contest held to select an official quaff for this years tales of the cocktail an annual festival that opens in new orleans this wednesday the winner was stacey smith a bartender at gw fins restaurant in the crescent city her entry the starfish cooler features such trendy ingredients as limoncello and pomegranate liqueur along with some iced tea and champagne on the rocks its not bad at all if a bit sweet for my tastes a problem i solved by adding a little more champagne to the mix two of the longest running cocktail competitions are those held by the united kingdom bartenders guild and the international bartenders association going through decades of winning entries in the i b a competition is like digging through an archaeological site stratum by stratum revealing the evolution of cocktail styles in the champion drink was made by an italian barman giuseppe neri named the conca doro the cocktails ingredients were standard golden age fare gin cherry brandy triple sec and maraschino liqueur its drinkable but just barely the next year a finn succeeded with bacardi cointreau and port two years later a german bartender took the trophy with bacardi cointreau and grapefruit juice none seems to have found repeat business come the s and s new fashions in drink pushed to the fore with a preponderance of cocktails using banana liqueur amaretto pineapple juice and ugh blue curacao in the last decade the international bartenders association judges seemed to have succumbed to morbid sugar cravings for example the victor was the infelicitously named strawberry night belgian bartender sergio pezzoli added passion fruit liqueur green apple liqueur passion fruit juice and strawberry juice to vanilla vodka and somehow still failed to produce a drink of sufficient sweetness thus the recipe calls for the addition of sugar syrup and a shot of insulin for good measure to find a drink that actually entered the basic cocktail canon by way of winning a contest one has to go back to one of the first major cocktail competitions ever held the event took place in london in september of and in the early heats it appeared a pink concoction made of gin an egg yolk and cherry juice would coast to victory but late in the game the berkeley hotels tom buttery surged with a drink called the golden dawn a cocktail that is rightly considered a classic butterys drink called for gin calvados french apple brandy apricot flavored brandy orange juice and grenadine try ordering it and see what you get over the years recipes for the golden dawn have made a mess of butterys invention in his mid century bar book "the mixers manual " the usually reliable patrick gavin duffy forgets the calvados and the grenadine david emburys "the fine art of mixing drinks " offers three variations one with lime juice and gin but no calvados one with calvados and lemon juice but no gin and a third with rum of all things from the start the proper recipe of the golden dawn was a matter of confusion a wire service reporting on butterys triumph in the contest said that the drink was made of equal parts of the four main ingredients with just a dash of grenadine the new york times however described the golden dawn as having two parts each of gin and calvados to one part each apricot brandy and orange juice with a dash of grenadine so which is right the united kingdom bartenders guild endorses the equal proportion method but i prefer the drink described by the times emphasizing the gin and the calvados makes for a drier and decidedly more sophisticated drink of course customers are the final arbiters in what if any new drink is to catch on which is why the british contest traditionally relied on the judgment of two men and two women drawn from the thirsty masses in "paul of grosvenor house" as one of the past presidents of the guild was professionally known proclaimed "its quite proper that the judges should be from the public rather than fellow bartenders " his reasoning was as sound as it was straightforward "after all its the customers not we who buy the drinks besides " he admitted "many of us prefer beer "
