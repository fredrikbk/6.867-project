the decline of detroit collective bargaining in motown begins next friday when ford and chrysler sit down with the uaw gm talks begin the following monday meanwhile the news from the market is ominous for both sides junes recorded sales show that detroits once "big three" automakers collectively accounted for barely half the u s total market a new low their share of the market seems likely to sink below half in july sickly gm a sickly chrysler about to welcome new proprietors and a very sickly ford find themselves facing a two front struggle on the one hand there is the traditionally unsympathetic uaw and on the other a formerly sympathetic u s congress is suddenly more concerned with energy and environmental issues than with their particular well being one issue looming in the background today has roots in the s at that time lee iacocca who had already led a remarkable back from the near dead revival at chrysler was watching his companys fortunes once again slowly slip downhill while formulating a second miracle turnaround he attributed many of chryslers immediate problems not merely to competition from japanese automakers but to unfair competition because these rivals were producing their cars in then low cost japan mr iacocca became the principal advocate of what he called "the flat playing field " "let them build them where they sell them " he demanded well now several of the japanese auto makers are and ironically in their dealings with the uaw the detroit three will turn mr iacoccas formula on its head give us serious relief from oppressive unflat playing field costs or we will have to move production for the american market away from the u s no one will actually say "china " but it will be present in all minds instead we will hear yet again about retiree benefits and worker health care coverage negotiated over the years that have accumulated into an asserted cost disadvantage of approximately &# per vehicle produced the detroit three calculate that their total u s labor expense per hour including &# worth of benefits to their battalions of retirees is around &# while hourly labor expense at the now numerous foreign owned u s plants demanded by lee iacocca is &# lower it is true enough that the japanese european and lately the korean automakers who have scattered their new factories across the lower midwest and the southland do not have many retirees to support yet there is so far no evidence that the asserted &# a unit advantage in cost is being used by japanese automakers in predatory pricing in fact the sticker prices of their vehicles are generally somewhat higher than comparable detroit models and beyond the sticker prices the various discount incentives of the domestics currently average around &# per vehicle toyotas average incentive is less than half that amount and hondas is zero in other words the domestic automakers net prices are considerably lower but they still continue losing market share frustration over this recently led gms north america chief mark laneve to urge each of his dealers starting at saturn to buy a honda accord and a toyota camry so they could show prospective customers that their own offerings were fully comparable and certainly less expensive the ability of the leading japanese automakers to extract higher prices does enhance their financial resources and these resources have in turn helped underwrite their relatively short model cycles entry into previously unexplored segments like fullsize pick up trucks and the initial losses of introducing novel products like the toyota prius hybrid even with all of this however its instructive to take a look back to chryslers last full year as a freestanding enterprise carrying all of the same sorts of legacy cost burdens complained of today and with the lowest labor productivity in its industry the company still recorded a healthy net profit on sales down from an even headier the prior year gm in hit and ford not at all shabby and over the entire previous decade which included a three year patch of market softness in the early s total annual return to shareholders ranged from at gm to at chrysler so what has really gone wrong over the last decade annual u s demand for cars and light trucks has grown modestly but what has shrunk is the ability of the detroit three especially gm and ford to attract customers each of them will be selling nearly a million fewer vehicles this year than in most of the financial crunch they face comes from lower unit sales trying to support an increasing population of retirees many added through cost reduction workforce cutbacks plus additional benefits yielded to the uaw in the intervening bargaining sessions so how under these circumstances can the detroit three generate the resources they need for fostering what they hope will be turnaround products they can cut the dividend payout to shareholders an initiative gm and ford finally undertook last year they can enter collective bargaining by invoking the image of armageddon as they are now doing and they can sell off some of the family silver which they are also doing at gm this has included directv control of the companys finance arm and spinoff of its partsmaking albatross delphi ford has undertaken extensive mortgaging of its real estate has dumped aston martin and is seeking an acceptable price for jaguar and land rover ultimately it will probably be forced to unload even volvo a major overhanging question though is whether the detroit three can obtain some form of governmentally brokered relief from their retiree obligations currently they arent explicitly asking for it but they arent exactly not asking either not quite asking usually comes in the form of elaborately staged washington events in which the ceos show off their latest future tech prototypes reiterate their dedication to alternative power systems praise clean air and have heart to hearts with the president so far this president has applauded the prototypes wished them well but has not yet been afflicted with the weepies about legacy cost burdens even if the uaw were to offer substantial concessions they are unlikely to provide more than mild short term therapy success in the auto business means bringing products to the showrooms that are hits with buyers and hitmaking is a seemingly lost art in detroit since lee iacoccas last burst of chrysler winners in the mid s meanwhile the newly democratic senate has passed an omnibus energy bill that would require the average fuel economy of new cars and light trucks to improve from the current miles per gallon to mpg by an auto industry trade association has already launched a scare mongering advertising campaign warning motorists that if the mandate passes people might not be able to find the vehicles they want to buy hometown heroes like sen carl levin and rep john dingle have employed all the tools at their considerable command to apply the brakes but it seems probable that the house will ultimately follow the senates lead but a mpg mandate will surely not shoehorn motorists unwillingly into tiny clown cars like mercedess european money loser the smart nor is it likely to affect occupant safety or even performance it will involve broader availability of hybrids already well underway and application of incremental technologies like turbocharging continuously variable transmissions and variable valve lift engines it will also oblige the automakers to sell americans on high tech high performance high efficiency and very durable diesel engines engines which by the way they already sell in europe and which attract as much as of car buyers in venues like france with &# a gallon gasoline prices the overriding challenge though for the detroit three remains neither their cost burden nor congressional fuel economy activism rather it is overcoming their continued inability to win in the marketplace a decade ago before any of the recent red ink began to flow the stewards of these giant enterprises had ample resources to compete events have proven that they didnt use them very effectively in with all of the same cost burdens now bemoaned chrysler for one made itself the worlds most profitable automaker generating rates of profitability roughly the same as toyota does today
