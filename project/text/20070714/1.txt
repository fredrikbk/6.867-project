splitting up some spouses are going their separate ways when traveling in retirement jody verrengia wanted to travel to exotic destinations after her husband tom retired from his job as an airline pilot years ago but when he told her that he didnt want to take trips involving airports and flying ms verrengia age decided to go overseas anyway without him ms verrengia who lives in miami joined the womens travel club a women only tour operator in bloomfield n j in april she went to morocco her first trip with the group "im young healthy and able to afford to get out there " she says "there are lots of places i want to go so i said im doing this " retirement almost by definition is a time when wives and husbands finally get the chance to travel more the assumption of course is that couples will take trips together in some cases though spouses are going their separate ways as one person says no to travel and the other goes off to roam the world in most cases travel experts say the one whos roaming is the wife women "are standing up and saying its my turn " says marybeth bond a san francisco based expert on the womens travel market just how many retired spouses are traveling solo isnt known generally tour operators say they dont ask whether their solo customers are married and "typically they dont tell me " says debra asbury president of women traveling together a women only travel company based in edgewater md "all we ask is age so we can pair people up to share rooms " still of women customers surveyed by women traveling together in almost two thirds reported leaving behind husbands or boyfriends within the previous year to join an all women tour on average these women say they toured once a year with their husbands and two or more times annually with groups of women ms asbury estimates that about one fourth of her customers are married women in their s and s traveling singly their husbands were either business road warriors and dont like taking long trips involving airplanes or the couples have different travel interests she adds "the wife may want to do a garden tour but her husband could care less about gardens so he says go and have a good time " ms asbury says the change has helped create a niche within the travel industry the number of women only tour companies in the u s offering more than five trips annually now numbers more than up from seven in according to ms bond in san francisco additionally more than tour companies in the u s market women only trips with their other offerings she says wives of course can find friends to join them on mixed tours but many prefer to go solo with women only groups for starters they have the freedom to choose when and where they want to go there also is no need to find companions who want to visit the same places and are available to travel at the same time trip participants get a built in group of potential future travel partners ms bond says phyllis stoller managing director of the womens travel club in new jersey says she formed the club in because her husband wasnt interested in traveling to unusual places and she couldnt find friends to go with her her favorite destinations are the middle east india and southeast asia where she enjoys exploring craft markets and bazaars ms stoller says the club now has "thousands" of members growing just in the past two years for older women arranging travel is very much an "immediate thing " she says "they dont want to wait for friends they want to go when they want to go " most women on her tours are between and years old ms stoller says with children gone and mortgages paid many older wives have discretionary income for travel which is another reason why catering to the older womens travel market makes good business sense "money doesnt seem to be an obstacle " says ms asbury in maryland about of her clients have gone on four or more trips with her company she says of course men have long taken trips without their wives usually for specific purposes to fish hunt golf or participate in other sports activities ms bond says by contrast women like to travel to discover more than two thirds of participants in adventure travel trips are women she says "the typical adventure traveler is not a year old male " she says "its a year old female who wears a size dress " indeed men and womens preferences when it comes to travel seem to diverge with age some experts say women for instance appear more willing to tolerate travel hardships says ms stoller this year her company is offering tours to chinas tibetan plateau peru kenya and the baltic countries among other destinations retired men she notes generally like comfort and tend to enjoy returning to the same place each year tour operators also point to an unusual camaraderie that exists among women who take trips together not having to be responsible for family members allows them to be more carefree than usual says ms bond "we travel more with women now because we get so much out of it " she says "we get support we laugh a lot and we arent responsible for anyone else " ms bond says her husband an attorney takes one vacation trip with her annually and it tends to be "pretty scripted and upscale " she says "nothing can go wrong " but when she travels with women "we are free and wacky its one big pajama party " for their part husbands left behind often dont seem to mind elsie lorber a former educational consultant in lafayette n j has been taking overseas trips without her husband charles for more than years she usually takes at least one trip annually to europe with women friends from high school or her daughters "he likes to stay home " says ms lorber of her husband "he can go to burger king pizza hut and all the other places i dont let him go " for his part mr lorber a former school principal says hes happy shes doing something she loves "its ok with me " he says of her trips "she just loves to travel and i dont " jackie scott always dreamed of seeing the world but her husband maurice said he didnt want to travel after their retirement in she says he doesnt mind staying home with the dog while she visits foreign countries without him "i said i was going " she says "and he said that was ok with him " since then ms scott has seen most of the world her husband bowls several times weekly and takes care of the house while shes away and she says is always glad to see her when she returns to their home in boise idaho "i thought im not going to stay home just because he doesnt like it " she says "im adventurous and its nice to be doing something on my own " indeed on the couples th wedding anniversary she took a cruise with her daughter rhonda a travel agent "weve been married years and after that long its just another day " says ms scott of course wives arent the only ones traveling without spouses after retirement some husbands travel alone as well after retiring from a financial manager post at graybar electric co in gerald spillman now bought a motorcycle a good friend had also retired and bought a bike so they began taking trips together without their wives that friend has since died but mr spillman who lives in redwood city colo now goes on about seven or eight motorcycling trips annually with other friends last year he rode motorcycles in laos thailand china the french alps mexico and u s destinations with biker friends or on organized tours "i like seeing the world " he says "i stay home for a month and i get bored " meanwhile his wife enjoys being home and gardening or remodeling the house and doesnt mind his sojourns mr spillman says but his solo travels come with a catch for every one or two bike trips he takes he must take his wife on a cruise the upside mr spillman says is that absence does make the heart fonder "when you have been married years " he says "you tend to appreciate each other more after you have been apart " ms capell is a writer in idaho
