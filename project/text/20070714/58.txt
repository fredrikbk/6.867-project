gradually washing away the sandy filament of land hugging texass curving coastline and making the island even more vulnerable to natures wrath galveston of course is known for the deadliest natural disaster in u s history the hurricane that killed more than here youd think all this would scare people away especially after the devastation wrought in new orleans by hurricane katrina but galveston is booming some locals say all the attention katrina focused on the gulf coast actually helped raise awareness of galveston as a vacation destination in the past few years anyone searching for beach

home and resort markets in the country theres &# billion in new commercial and residential construction under way on the island investors retirees and vacationers see building on galveston as a simple economic gamble they figure they have good odds of getting plenty of value out of their beach homes before a hurricane washes them away galveston got into my blood when i was growing up along the gulf coast in the late s and s my family spent summers at our vacation home on galveston bay further inland from the gulf but from time to time my parents would pile all the kids into the ford station wagon fishing poles bristling out the open windows and wed drive down to the galveston surf for a weekend of fishing and camping in the wide open coastal wilderness when i came here as a kid civilization dropped off at the west end of the mile long sea wall there the paved seawall boulevard that ran atop the concrete rampart terminated in a steep ramp that would let you drive down to the beach my parents would put down the tailgate and we older kids would ride back there dragging sticks in the sand as we bumped along slowly down the beach searching for a place to camp now that old ramp at the end of the sea wall is a stark reminder of how much the island is shrinking instead of diving down to the beach the ramp dives straight into the waves that have encroached far inland throughout its history galveston has been a striking testament to human persistence and ingenuity and the power of denial the island has a stomach churning history of boom and bust its rise as a major southern port city was cut short by the hurricane protected by a new foot sea wall galveston boomed again as the sin city of the gulf until texas rangers shut down its illegal gambling trade in the late s after that eclipsed by the port of houston galveston limped through the remainder of the th century struggling to pay the bills this century has seen galvestons fortunes rise again the island is beloved in texas as part of the states colorful past and also for its diverse appeal tourists flock to the historic districts and miles of public beaches while fishermen and birders hang out along the jetties bayous and surf out of town investors have revitalized the east end of the island protected by the sea wall where the original city and docks were built now it is a vibrant tourist spot packed with restaurants and shops against a backdrop of cruise ships and barnacle covered fishing boats lined up along the docks in nearby historic neighborhoods new residents are resurrecting victorian architecture the galveston port now hosts one of the nations top five cruise markets the island also has new attractions including a schlitterbahn waterpark and an expanded moody gardens several new high end resorts have opened in the past few years including pointe west a complex of vacation homes trails lagoons and a beach club on the western tip of the island on the opposite end palisade palms a pair of story beachfront condominium towers is under construction the latest growth spurt is a welcome renaissance but controversial among longtime residents especially among bois local jargon for those born on the island some blue collar workers now cant afford to live on the island because of rising rents and property taxes the latest battle concerns a proposed acre west end development that would create almost new homes along with two hotels and a marina the west end of the island has changed the most the land of "the stilt people " according to victor lang a retired washington lobbyist who performs a one man show on galveston history theres no sea wall on the western two thirds of the island so buildings must be raised high on wooden piers or stilts to protect them from rising water theres still lots of vacant land but its rapidly filling in that worries the naturalists who see the pristine coastal prairies wetlands and bird habitats disappearing beneath the new construction opponents also wonder how much more the environmentally sensitive island can stand before it gets washed away exhibit a is a study by university of texas geologist james gibeaut who was recently commissioned by the city to map out the areas most vulnerable to erosion storm surges and rising sea levels barrier islands like galveston are natures way of protecting sensitive coastlines from erosion they build up over thousands of years and then erode shift and sometimes disappear over subsequent centuries when mr gibeaut looks at galveston he sees an island in transition "its getting skinnier " he says the land is two feet lower than it was years ago and erosion has been eating away at the unprotected west end but that doesnt seem to be deterring people i understand
