the week ahead our take on coming events politics mccain can look to reagan for hope as campaign reels by jackie calmes sen john mccain stumps on saturday in new hampshire the first primary state then he heads home to arizona to ponder his gutted and indebted campaign and how to escape from the burial that pundits and partisans increasingly are preparing for him history does give the onetime republican presidential front runner some hope it has seen lazarus acts before with ronald reagan mr mccains idol now in the presidential pantheon it is little remembered how low he fell en route to the white house in the campaign charlie black who now advises mr mccain recalls joining mr reagans campaign manager and spokesman at the california headquarters to fire people two days after christmas in the campaign was "dead broke " he recalls it got worse mr reagan lost the first contest the iowa caucuses to george h w bush as he headed to the next and perhaps last battleground in new hampshire his advance men got to the andover n h hotel ahead of him one lanny wiles recalls the hotel manager telling them "im double locking the door because we havent been paid " mr wiles wrote a personal check for &# while his partner put &# on his american express card mr reagan none the wiser slept there that night he then won the primary sacked his top campaign advisers and went on to the presidency the reagan example has parallels for mr mccains own situation this past week broke and falling in the polls he engineered the resignations of campaign manager terry nelson and chief strategist john weaver just a week after theyd fired people to bring spending in line with the campaigns anemic fund raising it remains to be seen whether the reagan history can repeat itself for mr mccain but for mr mccain dogged by his identification with the unpopular iraq war and immigration issues much of the optimism that once marked his and mr reagans style is gone republicans say democratic strategist james carville says he is convinced that "mccain aint going to make it to iowa " mr carville helped bill clinton survive a political death watch in a "double whammy" of stories about the democratic candidate having avoided the vietnam draft and allegations of an affair with gennifer flowers hit just as the new hampshire primary was approaching mr clintons poll numbers in the state tanked but mr carville and former clinton adviser rahm emanuel now a chicago congressman recall that on the weekend after the worst week mr clinton had a hugely successful fund raiser in new york that sent a crucial signal the men said that political investors still saw mr clinton as a viable stock the clinton campaign bought television ads all over new hampshire to offset the bad publicity after a strong second place finish the candidate dubbed himself the "comeback kid " as for mr mccain adviser mr black says "look at it as mccain starting over fred thompson is just starting now if he can do that why cant mccain start over " pharmaceuticals j&amp js earnings to reflect extent of safety concerns by avery johnson johnson &amp johnson usually the first major drug company to report quarterly earnings is watched closely as a broad bellwether for the health of the health care industry when it reports earnings tuesday though johnson &amp johnson will more specifically suggest how deeply sales of two huge product classes anemia medicines and drug coated stents are being hit by safety questions the company based in new brunswick n j is rare in that it plays in both arenas the conglomerate sells procrit a &# billion antianemia drug and cypher a &# billion drug coated stent because of that j&amp j is proving to be a testing ground for how increased pressure on the food and drug administration over safety will affect the bottom line the agency has convened high profile panels to discuss both anemia medicines and stents and the big question is how much numbers will skid as a result the concerns come as legislation moves forward to strengthen drug monitoring safety concerns have risen that the drug class to which procrit belongs could increase the risk of heart disease and cancer progression at some doses as such procrit could be a wild card for j&amp j in march the fda slapped its strictest warning on drugs such as procrit two months later an fda panel called for more limited use of the drugs and the centers for medicare and medicaid services proposed curtailed coverage next week should bring the first full glimpse of how the drugs bottom line

tube era contract negotiation swings into gear monday as the writers guild of america sits down at the bargaining table with representatives of the big content creating media companies in encino calif it is the opening salvo in what is promising to be a long painful and possibly disruptive stretch of labor negotiations between the major entertainment conglomerates and hollywoods three big creative guilds the big issue how to compensate writers actors and other entertainment talent for the use of their work in digital forms the outcome could be messy if terms arent reached by the end of october when the writers could strike and throw the hollywood entertainment machine into disarray how things go with the wga and the major studios is seen as a bellwether for negotiations next year with the director and screen actors guilds both of which see their contracts expire next june "the next year will undoubtedly be stressful " leslie moonves president and chief executive officer of cbs corp said at a news briefing friday attended by several senior media company executives "none of us wants a strike " in the past few months the rhetoric between the wga and the studios has heated up ahead of the coming weeks bargaining session indeed this contract negotiation is being billed as a watershed by both sides largely because of the myriad new digital ways that content like movies and television shows are being delivered to consumers currently compensation in new media areas is a patchwork with the companies saying they need flexibility to experiment as new business models emerge the guilds generally want a bigger clearly defined piece of the revenue generated from hollywoods new media opportunities the media companies have proposed to the wga a three to four year "comprehensive study" of the entire media landscape and how revenue and profits can be generated and distributed going forward the proposal includes a plan to examine and likely rewrite long established practices including the residual structure that determines how writers get paid over the life span of their work "operating under terms conditions and business models formed years ago is an outmoded way to look at things " said barry meyer chairman and ceo of warner bros entertainment a unit of time warner inc "we dont want to saddle a new industry with an extension of old fashioned concepts " under the studios proposal the findings of the multiyear study would be implemented in the next contract session three years from now fridays media briefing and comments by messrs moonves and meyer met with a quick rebuttal from the wga "the companies have made hundreds of deals in the new media arena over the past year which proves that they do have viable business models " john bowman chairman of the wgas negotiating committee said "we dont need a study " j nicholas counter president of the alliance of motion picture and television producers which represents the studios says he is "pessimistic" about the coming wga negotiations and says they will "be the most complicated negotiations in years " industry executives have widely acknowledged they are beginning to stockpile scripts and move up production deadlines ahead of the halloween contract expiration and a possible writers strike
