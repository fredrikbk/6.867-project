hot topic chinese fake out to hear the drumbeat in washington youd think trade barriers are the only way to protect americans from tainted chinese products but the good news is that individual companies and the chinese government are getting a lesson in free market branding and quality control that will do more to promote safer products than trade barriers ever will since the melamine laced pet food scandal hit in march american consumers have witnessed one chinese safety problem after another there have been lead tainted toys antifreeze tainted counterfeit tubes of toothpaste antibiotic tainted fish salmonella tainted snack foods and tread separating tires and thats nothing compared to what chinese consumers have faced last month brought exposure of fake blood proteins and fungus tainted baby diapers this month came word of explosion prone counterfeit mobile phone batteries all of which has politicians calling for new trade restrictions in response to concerns about fish safety the food and drug administration recently required testing of all fish imports from china a regulatory burden so onerous it amounts to a ban senator chuck schumer d n y of punitive tariff fame has called for creation of an "import czar" to "focus on the rising tide of chinese goods coming in to the u s " other members of congress are taking the opportunity to refight the battle over chinas world trade organization accession this is protectionism masquerading as safety and it misses the incentives that already exist in the u s marketplace for companies to better police their own product lines for quality take litigation too many american companies have assumed they cant be held liable because they only import chinese goods manufactured by someone else but all bets are off as soon as injured children or sick adults start appearing before juries at least lawsuits stemming from the pet food case have already been filed while the distributor of the faulty tires is facing a suit in pennsylvania in cases of genuine product deception the u s tort system can be a useful policeman importers are also becoming vulnerable on store shelves consultants who work with u s companies sourcing in china predict a flight to quality as safety fears mount brand protection will become more important than ever witness colgates extensive efforts to warn consumers about tainted toothpaste bearing counterfeit colgate labels brand protection is a bigger concern for smaller companies than for huge multinationals like tylenol and pepsi that have weathered safety scares in the past smaller companies may get only one chance with consumers then for publicly traded companies theres the stock market executives will increasingly see their willingness to invest in china based quality control reflected in their stock price expect investors to start demanding steeper discounts if companies fail to reduce litigation risks given such strong incentives its surprising that so many companies have ignored them for so long american companies have not always realized how expensive chinese manufactured goods can turn out to be once the cost of low quality is included naivete is as much to blame as greed western companies sometimes fail to understand how chinese manufacturers do business especially the way many factories outsource some work that has been outsourced to them several supply chain and quality control consultants report an uptick in business over the past few years especially among u s and european small and medium sized enterprises government does have a role to play in the u s the fda has been working to disseminate information about dangerous products so consumers and importers alike can protect themselves the consumer product safety commission has been working as usual to facilitate product recalls the situation is more complex in china although smart officials in beijing understand the need for reform endemic corruption and geography make enforcement difficult the government is planning a new tracking system for food to improve quality surveillance and a more transparent drug approval process is in the works at the state food and drug administration chinas fda to keep unsafe medicines from reaching the market corruption has been a particular problem in medicines and this week china executed the former head of the agency zheng xiaoyu after his conviction for bribery that will concentrate a few minds but the lack of a consistent rule of law and enforcement is chinas biggest problem the least productive response is u s protectionism which will lead to higher prices and less competition other countries will respond by also using quality as an excuse for trade barriers the way they already have against u s beef after a rare case of "mad cow" disease the best education for crooked chinese capitalists is likely to be the harsh judgment of american business partners and consumers
