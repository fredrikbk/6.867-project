pursuits golf journal can you take my nine iron in just a bit custom clubs get more elaborate with radar computers how they measure up the pro shop at my local driving range just got a phased array doppler radar system you know the type the military uses in its antimissile defense installations only this one has been tweaked here and there to follow outgoing golf balls not incoming scuds the &# system called trackman and until recently available only to the tour pros was a big investment for the little shop but golfers have been booking time on it days in advance at &# an hour to help them get custom fit for the perfect clubs to the uninitiated this may seem like overkill and for many players beginners and high handicappers with inconsistent swings it would be but for better players looking to squeeze an extra or yards out of their drives and willing to pay up to &# more for a custom built driver matching their swing to just the right combination of high performance shaft and club head theres no such thing as overkill not to mention that the trackman is extremely cool to play around with ten years ago getting fit for golf clubs might have meant measuring the distance between your fingertips and the ground and answering a few questions about how far you hit your irons the pro would then point to one or two drivers or sets of irons on the shelf that ought to work fine and out the door youd go as excited as a kid on christmas morning today the smorgasbord of club features available to consumers is bewildering there are irons that look like fairway woods shafts that "flex" at different points to alter shot trajectory and drivers with moveable weights some manufacturers now offer dozens of options in driver shafts alone as a result club fitting has become increasingly complicated see accompanying chart detailing the different options the latest wrinkles such as the trackman and multiday fittings at luxury resorts with the best in the business that can cost &# might lead many to wonder how much of this is simply hype the short answer is that the better a player you are the more you will benefit from club fitting but anybody in the market for new clubs these days ought to consider a basic fitting at the very least it will help you navigate the maze of products available and often adds nothing to your costs most pro shops and retail outlets employ trained fitters who will look at your swing run a few simple tests sometimes using an indoor swing analysis device and make recommendations they may charge a fee for this service typically about &# but will usually apply it as credit towards any clubs you purchase as a result obviously theres potential self interest on the fitting pros part he or she might try to steer you toward unnecessarily expensive choices so buyer beware but for most midhandicappers and above a fitting shouldnt cause you to buy more costly clubs than you otherwise would only to get clubs that are better suited to your particular swing the shafts should be neither too stiff which would cost you distance nor too whippy which would cost you control the club head of the driver should be ordered with a loft or tilt of the club face to maximize distance and with the right weighting and other properties to compensate for your swing flaws for most higher handicappers that means fighting a slice the irons can be bent a few degrees flatter or more upright in the pro shop sometimes for an extra fee to help you hit straighter shots none of these customized features will turn a hacker into a pro but at the margins they can definitely can make some bad shots less bad and some good shots even better "my estimation is that if your average handicapper had the perfect set of clubs he or she could reduce his handicap by three or four strokes at least without changing a thing about his swing " says tom wishon who has written two well regarded books on clubfitting mr wishon makes components for craftsmen who build clubs for their customers from scratch like tailors make bespoke suits which is one increasingly popular option in clubfitting he says that golfers who wait to be fitted for clubs until their swings improve are misinformed "even if you work diligently with a teacher to improve your swing it would take a long time a couple of years at least for those changes to fundamentally affect the fitting of your clubs " he says for better players who swing more consistently and therefore can take more advantage of nuances in their clubs elaborate fitting options may be worthwhile the biggest bang for the buck comes with drivers when i spent an hour on the trackman last week at the tappan golf center just north of new york city the first thing the fitter william cho noticed about my current driver was that it imparted way too much backspin to the ball this produced drives that climbed too high and didnt roll much after hitting the ground the radar sent the tracking data from each of my shots to a tethered laptop computer which almost instantly rendered beautiful three dimensional representations of my ball flight superimposed on distance grids these mr cho replayed rotated and studied then he had me hit balls with several other drivers until he liked what he saw on his screen within half an hour he had identified a club that took my backspin rate down to from revolutions per minute and dramatically improved several other numbers as well including my launch angle my descent angle and the amount of roll most importantly the new club was consistently giving me to extra yards per shot mr cho said that for customers who arrive with especially ill fitting drivers distance increases of yards or more are not uncommon the only reason i didnt buy the club on the spot was the price tag &# including the mitsubishi rayon diamana whiteboard shaft which by itself sells for &# but i havent ruled out the purchase im thinking what with global warming maybe my daughter doesnt actually need snow boots this winter email me at golfjournal wsj com
