ask dow jones q is there a statute of limitation on a refund due you from the irs r w b cochecton n y a yes and im glad you asked because it appears many procrastinators dont understand the basic rules thus they may miss out on collecting valuable refunds the short answer is you generally dont have an unlimited amount of time to claim a refund no matter how strong a case you may think you have if you think youre due a refund but havent filed a return for the year at issue you generally must file your return "within three years from the date the return was due including extensions to get that refund " the internal revenue service says as with so many other tax issues there can be exceptions see publication chapter one which is available on the irs web site irs gov irs studies have indicated widespread ignorance or misunderstanding of these rules for example i reported a year ago that the irs said it was holding more than &# billion in unclaimed refunds for about million people who hadnt bothered to file returns for to collect those people typically had to file their returns by mid april of q last year around this time you mentioned a tax bill that was pending regarding artists being able to take a deduction for donating their work to charity did this law pass if so what are the parameters d l jonestown texas a no the bill youre asking about didnt become law and i havent heard of any attempts lately to revive it that bill generally would have allowed many artists and authors to donate their own works to qualified charities and deduct the fair market value of their works rather than just the cost of their materials free help the irs says more than free tax preparation sites will be open around the nation this year as it "expands its partnerships" with nonprofit groups and community organizations that help low income and elderly taxpayers for example the irs volunteer income tax assistance program offers free tax help to people earning less than &# the tax counseling for the elderly program offers help to taxpayers who are age and older good news for procrastinators taxpayers will have until april this year to file their federal income tax returns and pay any taxes due this year april falls on a sunday and monday is emancipation day a legal holiday in washington d c "this means the entire country has an april deadline " the irs says the april deadline applies to federal individual income tax returns whether filed electronically or on paper it also applies to requests for an automatic six month filing extension as well as tax year balance due payments and it applies to tax year contributions to a traditional or roth ira tom hermans "tax report" appears wednesdays in the wall street journal send questions on finances investments or taxes to askdowjones sunday wsj com and include your name address and a daytime telephone number questions may be edited we regret that we cannot answer every letter
