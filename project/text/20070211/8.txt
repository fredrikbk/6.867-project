marketwatch is your portfolio ready for a slump this stock market has been a lonely bull stocks usually arent so generous for so long the dow jones industrial average has gone without a decline for seven months the longest stretch since and its been about four years since either the dow or the standard &amp poors stock index suffered a correction which is only the second time thats happened according to ned davis research this latest unbroken bull run makes some strategists uneasy "people arent expecting any kind of shock " says brian gendreau investment strategist at ing investment management but high levels of borrowing and low trading volatility make stocks more vulnerable he adds so when some unexpected bad news rattles the stock market as it inevitably will "youre going to get a pretty large market reaction " yet even novice investors know the market is a give and take world stocks can be volatile but when prepared for a market downturn its easier to weather without so much of the stomach churning panic the best defense financial advisers say is to establish a diversified allocation based on your own investment goals and stick to it such as by rebalancing your portfolio annually it may be painful to cut back on stocks when theyve been rallying but it will keep you on the right road and if you dont want to sell stocks adding new money to unrelated assets such as bonds or real estate can achieve the same risk adjusting goal "a well diversified portfolio allows an investor to hold to their discipline " says kevin gahagan a principal at mosaic financial partners in san francisco broadly invested portfolios tend to lose less in a stock market downturn and will recover faster he adds its easy however to get optimistic about holdings that may not be diversified well enough after a very strong performance in the late s index funds tracking the s&amp p looked to some as if they would provide all the diversity needed until the bear market erased nearly of the s&amp ps value that alone should be enough to keep people from concentrating portfolios in just a few areas but several years of steady gains without major market swings can give the impression that stocks are "safe" and invite complacency "people remember the peak pain of the decline but more recently things have been getting better so that counters it " says meir statman a finance professor at californias santa clara university who studies investor behavior "the last three years have been a very good run maybe its time to take a little off the table " says michael kuziw of investment manager lenox advisors in new york that firm as a rule realigns client portfolios to their original target exposures to stocks and other asset types among stocks the firm now favors shares of larger u s and international companies and has trimmed exposure to midsize u s stocks and emerging markets "well never be afraid to take some gains and reallocate to either underperforming or more conservative asset classes " mr kuziw says before the pressure of falling prices arrives is also the time to take a close look at favorites its easy to become attached to winning stocks and sometimes even harder to say goodbye if they turn south but a stock doesnt know you own it and doesnt care if you win or lose mr gahagan recalls a client who came to the firm with a large amount of his net worth tied up in highly appreciated shares of communications equipment provider nortel networks the financial adviser says that despite warnings about concentrating in a single stock the investor found it difficult to part with his shares even as the price fell sharply anchoring yourself to a stock can be a fast trip to the bottom "our advice to clients is to reposition " mr gahagan says stocks "dont always get back to even " unsure whether to hold a stock or unload it ask yourself what mr gahagan does of clients suppose the value of your shares has grown to &# well done but if you were given &# today would you put it all into this stock most often he observes the answer is no "what that says is i would take a more diversified approach " mr gahagan notes and when that inevitable retreat occurs what do you do then perhaps the biggest mistake that investors make especially those with longer time frames is not committing to buy stocks at newly reduced prices says kacy gott a principal at financial adviser kochis fitz in san francisco "an to correction should be viewed as a sale on stocks we are confident that stocks will be higher years from now investors are just getting a short term opportunity to buy in at a lower price " jonathan burton writes for marketwatch www marketwatch com email forum sunday wsj com
