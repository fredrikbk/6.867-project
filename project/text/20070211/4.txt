getting going some tricks to soften the pain of saving money if you want to get rich try making yourself feel poor my check register says my checking account balance is perilously close to zero yet in truth there is &# or &# in the account sound weird it is but lets face it if we were all completely rational we wouldnt have any problems managing money and we certainly wouldnt have a negative savings rate in the u s my oddball accounting started roughly a decade ago with a letter from a reader he told me that whenever he wrote a check he would round up the amount he deducted from his check register to the nearest dollar his thinking a secret stash would slowly grow inside his bank account further padding his wealth at first blush this might seem utterly moronic but given that most of us struggle to save enough it made entire sense to me and i have been doing it ever since in managing money we make all kinds of behavioral mistakes we are overly confident in our investment abilities despite abundant evidence of our incompetence we fret too much over each investment instead of focusing on our entire portfolios we like to "get even then get out " hanging onto bum investments too long in the hope we will recoup our losses but maybe our biggest problem is our lack of self control according to the commerce departments bureau of economic analysis the u s savings rate was slightly negative over the past months thats an alarming change from the to savings rate that was common from the s through the early s indeed a recent survey by washingtons pew research center found that of americans describe themselves as the type of person who "always looks for ways to save money" and yet concede they dont save enough and say they often or sometimes spend more than they can afford need to sock away more money below are nine ways to cajole yourself into saving and yes ill readily admit it i use many of these tricks myself every year your top financial priority should be fully funding your employers k retirement savings plan whats so great about a k a chunk of your income avoids immediate taxation and you get tax deferred growth and possibly a matching contribution from your employer but maybe more important a k involves forced savings the money comes straight out of your paycheck so theres no agonizing over whether to save or spend you can also compel yourself to save by arranging to invest automatically in your favorite mutual funds with these plans your monthly &# &# or &# fund investment is deducted directly from your bank account as an added bonus fund companies like t rowe price group and usaa investment management will waive their regular &# or &# investment minimum if you sign up for an automatic investment plan also check out the aarp funds where the usual minimum is a mere &# and automatic investors can open an account for just &# a month to sneak in a little extra savings try rounding up your required monthly mortgage check to the nearest &# youve got to write the check anyway so it isnt any great bother to make it say &# rather than &# these extra principal payments will reduce your loan balance possibly saving you thousands of dollars in interest over the life of your mortgage make it a rule to save any money you receive thats out of the ordinary such as tax refunds overtime pay year end bonuses and insurance reimbursements for health care expenses because these windfalls arent part of your regular salary theyre a relatively painless source of extra savings you may also get a windfall in the form of an annual salary increase if you arent currently saving enough force yourself to sock away part of the increase you might boost the percentage of salary you contribute to your k or crank up the sum you save each month through your mutual fund automatic investment plans want to save a little more this month as soon as you get your paycheck decide how much you will salt away and then immediately send off the money to one of your mutual funds many folks i believe get savings backward they set out to cut their spending and then save whatever is left but the odds are the money they hoped to save will somehow get spent thats why you should send off your savings as soon as you get paid the money will be gone from your checking account and you will be forced to live on whatever remains the danger of course is that you dont trim your spending and instead start piling up the credit card charges what to do you could use a debit card instead alternatively when you charge an item on your credit card you might deduct the sum involved from your checking account with any luck that will encourage you to be more restrained in your spending while also ensuring you have the money to pay the credit card bill when it arrives if that doesnt do the trick try a cash diet decide how much you will spend over the next week or two make a single cash machine withdrawal for the sum involved and then limit your spending to that amount consider using the check register self deception i described above you might even add a few wrinkles for instance my checking account earns interest every month i get reimbursed for the fees charged on cash machine withdrawals and i receive a small amount of cash back on debit card transactions when i balance my checkbook i dont include these sums instead leaving them as part of my accounts invisible balance one of these days i will calculate my true account balance and send the accumulated surplus to one of my mutual funds but for now i am happy to let the surplus continue accumulating knowing its another way i am saving money and knowing i have a sizable financial cushion should i suddenly need to write a large check to be sure such tricks are a little silly but they make saving money a whole lot easier and as my nest egg balloons all the silliness has started to seem awfully sensible jonathan clements also writes the "getting going" column that appears wednesdays in the wall
