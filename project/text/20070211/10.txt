real time the year of tech resolutions with a little help from some kind readers an all thumbs columnist learns lessons online edition at the beginning of i did something i almost never do i made new years resolutions five of them all tech related as i wrote in the early days of i was tired of living in a home filled with technology that vaguely worked the pcs were free of viruses and malware but they and their satellite devices couldnt or wouldnt talk to each other dropped network connections and were full of files overdue for a backup how had things become so bad i wondered even though i knew the answer it was a combination of being busy and worrying that if i messed with technology that mostly worked or could be coaxed into working id just make things worse but enough was enough i decided on five goals  make my network more reliable make the two pcs and laptop able to communicate and get our main printer on the network  fix my airport express so music on the downstairs pc could be selected via the upstairs laptop and played through the stereo  get a second tivo and put them both on the network so they could exchange programs  ditch our long distance and local phone companies in favor of our cable tv company  get our digital photos organized movies on camcorder tape transferred to dvd and all important files backed up the most important step i took turned out to be promising publicly to fix these things once id done that my lack of attention to my apartments tech troubles stopped being a quirk and became a character flaw and i had to take action id kind of expected that thats why we make resolutions after all whether its to a spouse or to thousands of readers what i hadnt expected was that id stumbled on a great way to get things done my first batch of resolutions brought in all sorts of invaluable technical advice from readers with far better technical chops than mine my friend allan said hed bring up his mac and troubleshoot the network a reader sent step by step instructions that got the airport express working and other readers happily kibitzed about alternatives to the phone company and the same thing happened every time i offered an update on resolutions saving me invaluable time and frustration heck i should write a book i could call it the tom sawyer principle a step by step guide for getting smart kind folks to fix your life after you demonstrate your own helplessness after which to steal a funny idea from reader charlie brenner i could write living the tom sawyer principle and the tom sawyer diet and hit the road offering funny stories and aphorisms to corporations for thousands of dollars an hour my first resolutions went pretty well i changed my mind about some things most notably the value of network printing and whether to get a second tivo but within a few months id accomplished a lot a years worth of music and photos were backed up our photos were organized with picasa as recommended by readers the airport express was working and my network dropouts had gone away im still not sure why though i think it was a windows update flushed with this early success i decided to press on with evicting the telcos from our apartment in favor of the cable tv company customer service stories and the quirks of new york city apartment buildings made me reject vonage i even added a new summer resolution id get a second monitor for my study pc the new resolutions didnt work as well having bought a second monitor i got scared off by the cascade of complications involved in making it work with my doddering dell and the switch to cable tv phone service disrupted my tivos phone connection forcing me to revive a shelved plan to put tivo on our wireless network but there was a lesson in that too i got blistered by readers for giving up way too easily on both the monitor and the tivo connection my favorite kick in the pants email "getting tivo on a home wireless network is trivially easy dont stress so much about it at least not publicly ok " with some help from my kindly band of fence painters i got back on track putting tivo on the network was indeed trivially easy and once i had my second monitor working i wondered how id managed without it so what are my tech resolutions i didnt make any partially thats because many of the technical problems that bothered me a year ago have been solved yes that sound was me knocking wood but more than that its that i approach tech problems differently now because i learned some things struggling with s resolutions be flexible at the beginning of my biggest annoyance was probably wireless network problems after spending hours battling to get one balky desktop pc on the wireless network i had what in other parts of life is called a moment of clarity its a desktop pc its not going anywhere who cares if it has a wireless connection i ran an ethernet cable around the perimeter of the room under the carpet to the router pc worked problem solved things change i initially decided not to put tivo on the network because i read all sorts of horror stories about incompatible wireless adapters but that information was out of date the tivo project turned out to be the easiest thing i did all year if something seems fraught with difficulties or too bleeding edge for you make sure youve got current information and if you still decide against it check back now and again take it slow and write things down if youre not technically minded fiddling with technology can be a frustrating odyssey of false starts and seemingly random advances and setbacks break the problem down into steps try to assess and or solve them one at a step and write down what you tried and what happened ask questions even with all the different possible combinations of hardware and software out there it isnt likely youre the first person to ever have whatever problem youre trying to solve google it and see what you find use horse sense to assess the quality of the sites and answers that come back of course if that doesnt do the trick dont be afraid to pose your question on a tech forum after making sure it hasnt already been answered there are a lot of kind strangers out there who get a kick out of helping people dont be scared start small and work your way up youll find success breeds success this winter our tivo started acting peculiarly exhibiting all the symptoms of a hard drive in its death throes i did some googling and wound up replacing its hard drive with a new one with twice the capacity a project that didnt require much more than a screwdriver and a little patience last week i replaced the failing battery in my ipod mini it took about minutes the apartment doesnt run perfectly by any means and i havent accomplished everything i wanted to do ill keep tabs on vonage one day ill get a network printer up and running and i really need some kind of continuous backup system but itll be ok im sure i can figure it out thats not a resolution but a realization got any tech resolutions for if you had made some in howd things turn out write to me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
