eyes on the road whats in a name ford hopes taurus can help revive profits online edition whats in a name in the car business it could be a few hundred million dollars a year at least thats what ford motor co is hoping fords decision to yank the taurus and sable names back out of the grave got a lot of attention last week to some it was another sign of disarray in fords marketing strategy for others it was evidence that alan mulally fords new chief executive officer is bringing a fresh common sense perspective to the struggling auto makers business still another viewpoint is that reviving the taurus name despite the years of abuse heaped on it by ford management shows just how crazy the u s auto business has become as the number of models on offer has spiraled above all of the above is the answer it seems like a century ago but from the late s until the mid s the ford taurus was a sensation launched at a time when the dominant player in the mid sized sedan market general motors corp was pushing a bevy of boxy look alike sedans such as the chevrolet celebrity the taurus turned heads with its rounded aerodynamic looks and comparatively refined interior the first generation taurus had its flaws the model was recalled more than half a dozen times for various problems but the car kept selling and ford executives of the time explained that by pointing out that customers paid attention to what they called "things gone right " as much as "things gone wrong " around the same time in the late s toyota was starting to crank up u s production of its camry model the camry was smaller and less adventurous in its styling than the taurus indeed toyotas main mission at the time was to catch up with sales of the honda accord the japanese sedans while blessed with strong reputations for quality didnt offer the tauruss blend of style size and power thats one reason why the taurus was americas best selling car from to another was fords focus on the car two factories one in atlanta and one in chicago churned out tauruses and the almost identical mercury sable those plants were consistently ranked among the most efficient in america by harbour and associates the auto industrys semi official manufacturing scorekeepers at first neither toyota nor honda could match fords manufacturing or marketing firepower so powerful was the tauruss success that executives in other industries looked to fords strategy for inspiration including a boeing co executive named alan mulally so what happened ford botched the redesign of the taurus creating a car that was less attractive and felt less roomy the companys attentions turned toward selling sport utility vehicles and the taurus was allowed to decline into service as a rented mule with hertz and other rent a car agencies as its main customers toyota meanwhile goaded initially by the tauruss success as well as the comparative success of the honda accord rolled out successive generations of its camry each more powerful better featured and more "american" than the one before the camry launched last fall looks like a lexus compared to the boxy compact toyota sold under the same name in toyota has changed everything about the camry several times since but toyota hasnt changed name or what it stands for in the toyota lineup for a lot of camry buyers ads for the car are unnecessary they already know what a camry is because toyota has been drilling the same message into americas head since the first george bush was president camry reliable comfortable efficient transportation at a moderate price its an equation that sells more than camrys a year with more than models to choose from in the u s market consumer overload is becoming a serious issue for automotive marketers divide the likely overall sales volume of the u s light vehicle market by and you get about cars sold annually on average per nameplate thats not a recipe for big profits quick name the compact crossover sport utility vehicle gm sells in its pontiac brand did you guess torrent if so you may be one of the people who bought one last month gm has days supply of torrents on hand as of jan of course new names do break through chrysler did very well with the sedan but that car like the old taurus had unique styling and a well known brand under the hood "hemi " toyota is hailed for the genius of its scion brand but the success of scion followed several years of toyota executives groping around for a way to capture the attention of young buyers remember the late unlamented toyota echo moreover scion scored in large part because of an eye catching car the toaster shaped xb the more pedestrian xa didnt sell well and is about to be replaced by a different car called the xd moreover scion has cleverly defined success as selling only about cars a year in america in the mainstream of the market consistency has clear rewards a six cylinder toyota camry sells for an average of around &# more than a six cylinder ford five hundred according to power information network data harvested from a network of dealers around the u s a six cylinder honda accord sells for an average of &# more than the ford in january a camry took just days to sell on average according to pin a five hundred sold on average after waiting days more than three months at the dealership as a dealer that difference translates into several hundred dollars extra inventory carrying costs the current rule of thumb in the auto industry is that it costs as much as &# million a year for three years to properly establish a new nameplate in the market for a car that sells copies annually thats about &# a car or the difference between profit and loss on a lot of programs mr mulally in an interview last week says his interest in reviving the taurus began on the day he arrived at ford last fall "the taurus in my mind and the vast majority of customers minds was the ford family sedan it was dynamite and an industry leader but then we stopped investing in it " at the same time mr mulally saw ford struggling to position the five hundred sedan as something new and different from the taurus but to mr mulally it wasnt "this is our family sedan " he said likewise the wagon version of the five hundred which prior management had christened the "freestyle" was nothing more than fords family wagon why not call it the taurus x as in crossover "we were investing in the new taurus " mr mulally says "we just called it the five hundred thats the saddest thing " just changing the name of the five hundred to taurus doesnt mean mr mulallys solved all the problems ford still faces a challenge to communicate to customers who might have bad memories of the more recent less inspired taurus that this new taurus has at last a competitive engine a horsepower liter v instead of the old cars liter horsepower mill its a touchy subject but it might not be a bad idea for ford to make more out of the fact that the five hundred excuse me taurus shares a lot of its design and safety engineering with fords volvo luxury brand in the end the name matters less than the substance of the car that wears it send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj
