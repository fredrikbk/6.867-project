love &amp money readers react caring for an aging relative a few weeks back i wrote about my wifes torment at watching her mom and other family members struggle to care for her moms aging father the family had promised him that he would never have to leave his home but now hes years old and requires around the clock care the family members are determined to live up to their promise at a significant cost to their own lives that issue resonated with readers across the country and across the age spectrum and thisweek i want to share some of the email that has arrived fred sales a year old retiree in charleston s c says "anyone who extracts a promise from a family member to never take them to an assisted living facility is being incredibly selfish " older people who can no long care for themselves mr sales says "have no right to set rules on others about their care " mr sales says his cousin "promised her mother she would never" put mom in a care facility "the daughter wound up leaving a good job and retirement plan to care for the mother " mr sales says "this is wrong please encourage readers not to ask for such a promise and not to accept such a request promise to do the best possible with the budget and ability to help period " sara etheridge in decatur ala agrees but comes at it from a different angle shes and caring for her year old husband struggling with alzheimers "i do this " ms etheridge says "because im happier with him at home with me and i will continue this way as long as possible " she has some help with his care but she has told her children who all live out of state that "i do not expect them to disrupt their lives to care for their father they respect my decision and give me as much support as they can " ms etheridge says there is a difference between caring for a spouse and caring for a parent she adds "i do not think parents should ask their children to promise not to ever place them in assisted living or a nursing home they cannot possibly foresee how difficult care can become every case is different and each family must decide for itself how to handle its situation i would hope however that the decision is based on more than a promise made when neither the parent nor the children realized what a sacrifice that keeping this promise could become " sandra peterson in st paul minn wrote to defend those families that determine that an assisted living facility or a nursing home is best for an aged parent when her father died near ms peterson and her siblings had to face "the heart wrenching question of moms future she didnt want to leave her home of years and it ripped her childrens hearts out to imagine her leaving " yet with the onset of alzheimers ms peterson says "she could not stay at home alone " with her mothers input the family found an assisted living center where mom "is surrounded by peers who all have faced the loss of their homes and most have experienced the loss of a spouse her small apartment is full of the important things of her life sorted into labeled boxes so that they are far more accessible than had they been scattered around a house " still she adds "is mom happy in her apartment no shes lonely and misses her husband and children and her house does that make the situation wrong i dont think so " home ms peterson says "is just a building what she wants is something she cant have her own youth her husband and her seven young children at home together "we all love our mom and do many things to make her life as good as it can be she has children who enjoy quality time with her and who are not completely exhausted emotionally and mentally by full time care giving responsibilities "i do deal with guilt about doing the wrong thing and about not doing enough it hurts to have encouraged mom to move from her home it was my childhood home and my heart still aches but i didnt make my mom years old i didnt make up this life cycle thing things change throughout the course of our lives and appropriate living situations change too eventually the waning years of our lives make the family home no longer viable or appropriate " when donna mcconkey in knoxville tenn was younger her mom would ask that ms mcconkey and her two sisters never put her in a home ms mcconkey says that as the "smart alec child id assure her that thats exactly where shed be " twelve years ago her mom was diagnosed with dementia alzheimers ms mcconkeys sisters spent seven years caring for their mother but began falling ill themselves and "were ready to put mom in either assisted living or have her go from home to home every days neither idea i felt was a good one so she came to live with me " it was a stressful time ms mcconkey says "mom didnt like the way i did things she was constantly running away to go home i wasnt able to take her to my sons soccer games so i missed them all my son became resentful that our life had had to change so much " there were times she says "id run into the bathroom lock myself in and just cry for god to help me please " but as her mothers condition worsened she "became her old loving self " ms mcconkey says she says her mom has been living with the family for five years and "it has been so worth it both of my kids are better people for sharing all our lives with my mother "it is so great to have had this time with my mom theres been time to talk about things that i wanted to but didnt and it really doesnt matter that she wont remember two minutes from now weve sung songs together and ive heard her talk about people that were way before my time weve sat on the porch and just rocked and its really ok "i feel so sorry for the people who rush to place their loved ones in a home and do not take the time to enjoy these last years what a gift they are missing i never thought id be in this place never desired to be "but i am so thankful " she says "that i was allowed this time " jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall
