in the shadow of stalin los angeles when was the last time music had political importance " esa pekka salonen the music director of the los angeles philharmonic asked me late last month the question was partly rhetorical the conductor was stumping for "shadow of stalin " a late blooming l a philharmonic music festival just about to hit its stride but it also reflected his very real interest in some larger questions about the nexus between politics and art specifically music "its an endlessly fascinating subject " he said noting that recent openings of long sealed russian archives have increased our understanding of the u s s r mr salonen felt that now was the right time to explore eastern european music composed during stalins years in power as well as during the aftermath of his reign besides the conductor had his own questions including "what was shostakovich really thinking " but there was another troubling factor involved the steady tilt backward happening right now in vladimir putins russia "if you think of the kind of news thats started to come out of russia lately " mr salonen said "the crackdown on the freedom of speech and the obvious problems of establishing an open democratic system these issues of art freedom democracy totalitarianism have not gone away " mr salonen certainly deserves points for being au courant but unfortunately "shadow of stalin " which ran from april to june fell short of such past philharmonic triumphs as the conductors stravinsky celebration in or last years "minimalist jukebox " the exuberant showcase for an elastic genre programmed by john adams there were worrisome signs early on as "tba" appeared with disconcerting frequency on "shadow of stalin" promotional materials and even after the festival got under way with a bland film component new titles like "music after the thaw" were being appended to programs in an effort to achieve much needed cohesion this sense of ill preparedness suggesting a broadway opening in need of postponement culminated on may in an evening called "russian chanson " a veritable ladys handbag of mismatched material the evening was headlined by devotchka a lively able quartet of multitalented young musicians from denver best known for contributing to the "little miss sunshine" soundtrack the group mostly played generic "international" music combining vocals guitar fiddle accordion upright bass percussion and unexpectedly sousaphone and theremin in various combinations but only when tenor timur bekbosunov a native of kazakhstan joined them for three popular russian songs written between and was the programs promise fulfilled alas those gratifying moments could not compensate for what followed saul williams recited paul robesons testimony before the house un american activities committee and then his own slam poetry which mixed crude sexuality with criticisms of president bush petra haden daughter of jazz bassist charlie haden sang "summertime" from "porgy and bess" in a manner that mistook slow and doleful for deep the frequently out of tune legenda duo followed and was then succeeded by victor rivkin a sort of slavic tom waits the grand finale consisted of everyone but ms haden returning for "the song that helps us live and love " sung in russian with gusto and best appreciated when liberally inebriated vastly more serious music making came in three programs featuring mr salonen and the philharmonic these divided soviet music into an experimental period stifled in an era during which composers reached accommodation with the totalitarian regime and a time after stalins death when the government brooked some dissent at least from composers in satellite nations the first of these dubbed "music before the crackdown" and performed on may and contained suites from two shostakovich operas "the nose " based on gogols short story and "lady macbeth of the mtsensk district " the visionary work whose crude action and musical dissonances precipitated a harsh rebuke from pravda the headline "muddle instead of music " has gone down in cultural history more important was what followed intense government scrutiny of artists and their works a shift that engendered various responses creative timidity inevitably among them a symphonic suite taken from gavriil popovs "komsomol patron of electrification" was also on the bill as was alexander mosolovs "the iron foundry" a gripping five minute tone poem sonically depicting the transformation of molten metal into cold steel its worth noting that mosolovs music was something of an old friend having been first played by this orchestra back in in introductory remarks mr salonen dubbed "the iron foundry" a classic example of futurism he then added "i believe this is the loudest piece in the repertory " and proceeded to prove it leading the philharmonic in a driving reading that sacrificed neither focus nor tension the following week on may and june brought "music behind the iron curtain " featuring scores by gyorgy ligeti karel husa and witold lutoslawski none a russian but all profoundly affected by communism only lutoslawskis "concerto for orchestra" had been performed by the philharmonic before but the highlight of the evening the music notwithstanding came when mr husa now joined mr salonen on stage the festival and the philharmonic season in general concluded on june and with a program needlessly dubbed "music after the crackdown" presenting sergei eisensteins film "alexander nevsky " with prokofievs famous score performed live by the philharmonic and mr salonen this was not the first time the orchestra had played the score in this surprisingly successful fashion andre previn began the tradition at the dorothy chandler pavilion in and yuri temirkanov repeated the feat not quite two years later at the hollywood bowl but by resurrecting it in disney hall complete with crashing organ crescendo at the films conclusion mr salonen was investing both the music and the movie with the mantle of high art "this movie is very impressive in many ways " mr salonen told me on the phone "it is still war propaganda with prokofiev writing this heroic score but it nevertheless has moments of great beauty and emotion and its fascinating how two great artists collaborating on what is ostensibly propaganda turn it into art because of their talent " that may be the central lesson "shadow of stalin" imparts fear collaboration resistance and exhilaration variously entered into the creative process of soviet composers but no matter what the climate someone there was producing music of lasting value that is worth celebrating anytime but it takes on greater resonance when we see dark clouds and long shadows forming mr mermelstein writes about the arts for various print and online publications
