home &amp family cranky consumer prowling the racks with personal help we test services for shopping early word of sale special to the wsj rather than hunting down a harried sales clerk shoppers at many stores can request a little undivided attention while personal shopping services have been available at department stores for years they are now being offered at a wider variety of places including electronics shops and boutique retailers but the question for consumers is the same is such assistance worthwhile or just a less pushy way to get you to buy more stuff to find out we tested the free personal shopper services at three department stores bloomingdales neiman marcus and nordstrom at a small retailer ralph lauren and at an electronics store apple we wanted to find out how easy it would be to obtain these services and see if the shoppers were knowledgeable and would help us find items we wouldnt see on our own with the exception of bloomingdales it was easy to set up a session at apple we made an appointment online in seconds at the other stores we were able to just walk in and ask for help neiman marcus has an online form you can use to inquire about personal shopping but we had better luck calling a local store to find out if it offered the service not all stores do nordstrom doesnt have designated personal shoppers but if you ask customer service can page a manager to be your personal shopper for the day at bloomingdales the secret to connecting with a shopper eluded us at one store we needed to make an appointment about days in advance which wasnt appealing and at a second one the shopper didnt return our call and wasnt in the store the day we stopped by so we never experienced the service at the stores we contacted around new york a bloomingdales spokesperson says that the person who took our call didnt meet the companys standards we had different requests at each of the other stores ipods offer a lot more memory than they did when bought ours a little over a year ago so at apple we wanted to know if might be time to upgrade at neiman marcus we asked for help buying clothes for a conference a business casual outfit for day and something dressy but business appropriate for evening at nordstrom we wanted help finding a few summer pieces that would let us make the transition from our getting snug regular clothes to full on maternity wear at ralph lauren we asked for advice on styles that would flatter a pear shape over all the personal shoppers did the kinds of things one used to expect from every store clerk back in the days when shopping wasnt a contact sport they actually listened to what we wanted and asked questions at the clothing shops personal shoppers chose things for us we might have overlooked set us up in a dressing room and brought new sizes if we needed them they also tipped us off to future sales and encouraged us to take advantage of services like in store tailoring while the saleswoman at ralph lauren knew fashion and made good suggestions we had to keep reminding her that narrow cut items like pencil skirts just didnt work for us a ralph lauren representative says its hard to get a sense of how its service works on a single visit it seems silly to have to seek out a specially appointed person to get attentive service at a nice store but with good service so hard to come by its valuable to know these shoppers exist given how good their advice was we would go back to apple nordstrom and neiman marcus in particular and ask for a personal shopper any time were serious about buying something sheree curry contributed to this article write cranky wsj com company web site apple www apple com retail personalshopping what we found the shopper gave us much to think about with full explanations of various gadgets such as the nano and the video ipod what we bought nothing but the personal shopper didnt seem to expect us to and he invited us to set up another appointment if we wanted to buy something or just had more questions comment apple stores can be intimidating with their crowds and hipster buzz having one on one attention made it easier to navigate the store and understand the products company web site bloomingdales www bloomingdales com what we found its best not to count on the bloomingdales personal shopping service at least at the new york area stores we contacted for spontaneous shopping what we bought nothing comment the web site says the services is "available in most of our stores every time you shop " our experience fell far short of that company web site neiman marcus www neimanmarcus com what we found the shopper steered us toward eileen fisher and carmen marc valvo whose styles suited us she said we could bring an item back for in store tailoring what we bought nothing yet but the shopper put several designer suits on hold for us so we could come back and buy them when they go on sale comment the shopper gave us advance word about a sale we appreciated her attentiveness and low pressure approach company web site nordstrom shop nordstrom com what we found the shopper picked an empire waisted halter dress by michael kors that we wouldnt have looked at twice but it was just what we we needed what we bought a pair of cropped linen pants with a stretchy waist band a smock style t shirt and a dress we could wear on its own or as a tunic over the pants we have a second dress and summer sweater on order comment had we known that tracking down a shopper would take so long we would have left and come back later our shopper though was helpful and wed give the store a second chance company web site ralph lauren www polo com what we found rather than pointing out the pieces that would work best with our figure our shopper took us through the racks and talked about each piece in the store what we bought nothing an off the shoulder top looked great but was complicated to put on so we took a pass a pair of pants she suggested was promising but out of stock in our size comment we might try again if we had an occasion for which we needed a very specific outfit we would have liked it if the shopper had given us more personalized advice
