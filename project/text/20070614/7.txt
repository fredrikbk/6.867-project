ahead of the tape rising yields may not mean inflation angst the rise in long term interest rates has less to do with inflation than one might think investors have been selling bonds the world over pushing yields higher in the u s the yield on the year treasury note has gone to from over the past three months bond yields have risen by similar amounts in germany japan and the united kingdom over the same period the yield on the year treasury inflation protected securities has risen nearly as much tips as these bonds are called give investors a payment that rises and falls with the inflation rate treasurys by contrast offer a set payment so higher inflation hurts their value if investors were worried about inflation treasury yields would be rising but tips yields would be unchanged because holders of those bonds know that they will get a guaranteed return above the inflation rate because yields on both bonds are rising it means that investors inflation expectations have barely budged other countries inflation indexed bonds carry a similar message indeed economists dont expect any surprises from coming inflation gauges todays report on wholesale inflation from the labor department is expected to show that producer prices rose by in may from april pushed by higher food and energy prices fridays more important report on consumer inflation is also expected to show a gain in the parlance of wall street it looks like real bond yields that is bond yields less the inflation rate are rising thats good news for pension fund managers and other long term investors who need to generate consistent returns over inflation they can put more money into the safety of treasurys and still get the returns they need the flip side of that is that they may not need to put as much money into risky assets hedge fund managers and private equity firms take note rate cut hopes find home in housing market fears with the year treasury note yielding near where the federal funds target rate has stood for the past months the bond selling spree may have run its course what could trigger more selling an inflation scare could do the trick raising the specter of rate increases by the federal reserve though most key inflation gauges in the u s have trended down in the past few months fed funds futures show that investors believe theres an chance for a rate increase to at the feds october meeting thats a big shift from a month ago when the contracts priced in a chance for a rate cut in october such bets largely rested on the belief that the housing downturn would slow growth so severely that the fed would step in to ease the pain but a number of factors a manufacturing rebound a solid labor market and signs of strong growth and inflation overseas caused investors to give up hopes for a rate cut wall streets rate cut hopes die hard though and investors shouldnt be too surprised as renewed calls for lower rates crop up ironically the t bond selloff could do just that when yields shot up last year new home sales plunged the latest move is sure to spark jitters that housing will worsen the solution rate cuts such a scenario is one reason why bond prices may not fall much further scott patterson send comments to justin lahart wsj com or scott patterson wsj com
