cooking have been available for a while the latest products combine various technologies and speed up air and channel it in different ways for even faster results conventional ovens rely on heat from coils or a gas flame but high speed models use a combination of microwaves and high speed hot air and unlike with microwave cooking the manufacturers say the ovens cook food more evenly and can brown the outside of foods turbochef for example uses hot air "tornados" to cook and brown the food and microwaves can contribute to the cooking process it has no temperature dial but instead users choose from pre selected cook settings that are programmed into a computerized screen for example users select "bake" then "vegetable" then "potato " the viking ovens are similar the company says that its nearly pre programmed recipes allow consumers "to set it and forget it " despite their higher speed these appliances arent necessarily energy hogs induction cook tops generally save energy because less heat is lost into the air companies say that the latest high speed ovens and dishwashers also dont use extra energy over all the turbochef oven for example causes a spike in energy consumption while it is being used but the company says it actually uses the same or less energy than regular ovens because its in use for less time but the technology means people must be accustomed to controlling a screen on their oven and must also tweak their own tried and true recipes the devices can also be loud one person likened the sound of his ge ovens powerful fans to an "industrial hair dryer " "when it comes down to it people are a little intimidated " says meredith miller the marketing manager for clarke kitchen showrooms the new england distributor for sub zero and wolf appliances

appliances tim laird a year old events planner who frequently entertains at his home in louisville ky says it took four or five days of reading the instructions watching the video and experimenting
