the daily fix sentimental u s open picks come from across the pond online edition at least one american columnist is rooting for a british isles golfer to win this weekends u s golf championship in the washington times dan daly points out that just about every worthy american golfer has won a major after long waits david duval phil mickelson davis love and others have already taken a grand slam tournament and now only one american under has won at least pga titles without a major thats john cook who "i hasten to add is a mere four months away from being eligible for the champions tour " mr daly writes that leaves three sentimental favorites from across the pond scotlands colin montgomerie englands lee westwood or irelands paddy harrington remarkably though no european has won the u s open since nor any major since even as the continent has cleaned up at the ryder cup rooting for a foreigner to win the u s open somehow makes sense at this years odd challenging course in oakmont pa "the u s open is grind it out golf so treacherous as to breed timidity so difficult as to cause despair " tim sullivan writes in the san diego union tribune "if the masters is the most splendid of the major championships the open is the most sadistic this by the length of a tiger woods tee shot " oakmont has gotten a dramatic shave since ernie els won the open there in "the course has been uprooted of at least trees in a removal process that bordered on a spy operation in the years since els victory " chris dufresne writes in the los angeles times "the big twig wigs at oakmont wanted to restore the layout to the links style vision h c fownes had originally intended for the course which he designed and opened in but also wanted to keep the tree removal secret from members who might be opposed a plan was hatched to remove the trees a few at a time in the cover of early morning darkness the logs sliced and disposed of before members arrived over time oakmont was picked clean leaving a barren waterless patch of golf hopelessness oakmont looks different now like a mugger after a shave but remains one of the most ominous tests in the sport " among the courses odd features this year the longest par in tournament history the yard eighth hole yet toronto star columnist dave perkins isnt impressed saying there are plenty of tougher par s on major courses "players have been griping about the holes length since last years u s open but thats what these guys most of them do " mr perkins writes "they always think someones doing something nefarious to make their lives difficult plus it bruises their egos to be seen hitting woods into par s " who has what it takes to solve the quirky oakmont course see fix golf guru tim carrolls pick seven years ago spurs officials gregg popovich and r c buford met tim duncan in san antonio to try to persuade him to remain with the team rather than leaving for orlando and the chance to play alongside grant hill also represented by mr duncans agent lon babby the meeting was awkward and tense "the only reason this is funny at all to the participants is because everything worked out for everyone " buck harvey writes in the san antonio express news "popovich didnt have answers because there were none " mr harvey writes "the spurs didnt have many draft choices or much cap space and if they could have predicted the future and told duncan he would someday win with a french point guard and an argentine slasher had they said that babby said wednesday laughing we would have gone to orlando " few nba fans are laughing about mr duncans path toward a third win in five years with those compatriots the spurs three wins in the first three games of the finals have been desultory "dont blame the spurs for this repulsive style " mike monroe writes in the express news "their goal is to win its the cleveland cavaliers who believed their only chance was to make the finals a half court grind this plays right into the spurs strength the help and recover funnel to the middle defensive scheme popovich learned from hank egan back in the early s the spurs are the most adaptable team in the league they ran with the phoenix suns in and and prevailed averaging points they even averaged points against the defense minded jazz " si coms kelly dwyer agrees arguing that the cavs are squandering lebron jamess talents "its unfair to james talented and well compensated as he is to be asked to create something off a simple screen and roll or isolation play nearly every time down court " mr dwyer writes when mr james does try to create by passing to his teammates fans and the basket are often punished with a painful brick "hes not going to sneer at his teammates and hes not going to ignore them because theyre not playing up to his standards " michael wilbon writes in the washington post "passing a ball to a professional basketball player shouldnt be a sign that lebron is weak but its a sign that cleveland isnt good enough " several columnists agree with that premise and look ahead to future finals newsdays ken berger and espn coms bill simmons are among those calling for a new playoff format that would create the possibility of a finals matchup between the best two teams in the league even if theyre from the same conference "cleveland had no business being in the finals none " mr simmons writes "thats why im one of the biggest basketball fans on the planet and yet i care more about the draft than the finals we need to fix this immediately " sportslines ray ratto says the finals fit well with the generally putrid sporting events of boise state on new years day notwithstanding "maybe this is the punishment we get for putting our entertainment needs ahead of our educational ones " mr ratto writes "maybe this is the payback for our lousy sense of priorities but probably not we havent had priorities for decades now but we have never had a sports year quite like this to say it sucks is to demean the verb still there is always hope i mean nothing strange has happened to barry bonds this year yet right " speaking of bonds there are rumblings that he might be left off the national league all star game roster next month despite leading the league in on base percentage plus slugging percentage baltimore sun columnist peter schmuck blames commissioner bud selig for baseballs bonds ambivalence as the slugger approaches the record breaking no "selig needs to make a strong statement about the questionable legitimacy of bonds pending achievement or he needs to hold his nose and show up for the celebration " mr schmuck writes "those really are the only two acceptable choices " the print journals jonathan eig faces his own tough choice regarding bonds jonathan has tickets to a potential record breaking game and he wants to know what you think he should do with them for more details see the box at upper left of this column baseball may want to see bonds go away but he remains a big
