into clos these loans are light on protections for lenders when companies fail to meet performance benchmarks the s&amp p report warned that such loans carry the risk of "diminished recovery prospects" should borrowers default on them and said the rating agency will change its criteria for rating clos "to reflect the potential expectation of increased loss exposure on cov lite loans " it advises to look more closely at the loans going into clos and "demand more traditional covenant strong protection " the loans that go into clos are often used in private equity buyouts of big companies "clos have powered the credit market " says ken buckfire co founder of miller buckfire &amp co a boutique that restructures companies rating services have great power in the clo market
