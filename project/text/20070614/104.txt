tweaking the standard issue pc retailers expand lineup of exclusive machines can you comparison shop for many consumers who are shopping for a personal computer the ones they find in stores all look the same but a pc sold at a best buy or a circuit city is now increasingly different from one at a wal mart or a compusa thats because there is a movement afoot by pc makers such as hewlett packard co dell inc and toshiba corp to build exclusive pcs for certain retailers the exclusives range from pcs designed specifically for one retailer to special component configurations to pc vendors selling their wares just in one store if only for a limited time choosing an exclusively designed pc can end up costing consumers more money but the products are generally of higher quality the trend while not new is growing on sunday wal mart stores inc started selling dell desktop computers that were configured for the massive store chain one desktop model priced at &# comes with a inch flat screen monitor and gigabytes of storage for photo and music lovers wal mart will also sell an exclusive &# dell notebook computer in its sams club stores starting later this month the laptop comes with two

gimmicky "i dont really care how the computer looks " says mr bong who resides in walnut creek calif "i care more about the performance " these pc designs for stores are growing as retailers and pc vendors seek to differentiate themselves amid a cutthroat and maturing u s pc market over the first three months of the year u s pc sales rose only down from a year earlier according to market research firm idc that was the lowest first quarter growth rate for pcs since when the tech world was mired in a slump as a result pc makers are increasingly being forced to use savvy marketing new technologies and fresh designs to draw the attention of customers "its obviously very competitive out there so if retailers have something you cant buy anywhere else that is a pretty big benefit to a retailer " says bruce greenwood an h p vice president he adds that h p plans to expand its program of making special edition notebooks for retailers but while the exclusive pc trend gives consumers the option of purchasing a computer often viewed as a cookie cutter product that is distinctive the new products also give retailers and pc vendors a way to get consumers to pony up more money for one

than everyday pcs because of the time and effort pc vendors and retailers put into designing them says roger kay an analyst with endpoint technologies associates inc he adds that tenacious consumers willing to shop around can also find good deals among exclusive pcs retailers acknowledge that they can charge more for some exclusive pcs but argue that the products are still competitively priced exclusive products are "really a move to make the more premium and less commoditized " says jason bonfig of best buy mr bonfig adds that best buy aims to do more exclusive pcs that may include specialized technology such as a single button to turn on a webcam instead of multiple clicks through webcam software
