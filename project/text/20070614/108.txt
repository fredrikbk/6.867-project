why bhutto and the elites hate musharraf readers of benazir bhuttos commentary "democracy for pakistan " editorial page june who are unfamiliar with pakistans history need to be aware of certain facts  as prime minister of pakistan ms bhutto proved to be one of the most incompetent leaders in the history of south asia and was dismissed in november by pakistans president for what he called her regimes "nepotism corruption" and "mismanagement " during her chaotic administration in the mid s scores of people were being murdered in the streets of karachi every day  her return to power or that of her pakistani peoples party would almost certainly trigger a return to anarchy and open the door to a taliban style fundamentalist coup ms bhutto dismisses this possibility as "nonsense " asserting that "more than two thirds of pakistanis are distinctly moderate" in their religious views the same appeared true of iranians in as well but when iranian liberals and human rights activists convinced the u s to withdraw support from the shah just as todays pakistani liberals are urging us to do to gen musharraf the result was ayatollah khomeini khomeinis tehran successors would do anything to bring a similar radical islamic republic to power across the border in pakistan especially if it meant gaining access to pakistans nuclear weapons  the current hatred of gen musharraf has little to do with the nature of his government his real "crime" is that he is a muhajir the son of one of millions of indian muslims who fled to pakistan during partition in although it was muhajirs who agitated for the creation of pakistan in the first place many native pakistanis view them with contempt and treat them as third class citizens ms bhutto herself as prime minister in the summer of referred to pakistans muhajirs as "rats" and said they had "bad blood " in an interview with india today a muhajir spokesman responded that "we have bad blood it was this blood that built this country " even for western educated pakistanis like ms bhutto the scion of an elite sindhi family the sight of a common muhajir like gen musharraf as pakistans supreme power holder is intolerable pushing for his fall has little to do with "a return to democracy " it is far more a matter of restoring pakistans equivalent of jim crow  gen musharraf has not only been a good ally for america he has been good for pakistan per capita wealth and income have advanced significantly tensions with india over kashmir which at one point in led pakistan to the brink of nuclear war have eased at considerable risk to himself gen musharraf has tried to rein in the forces of jihadism and end foreign support for fundamentalist maddrasahs his regime has hardly been perfect however compared with the maliki government in iraq its record is impressive especially in fostering a safe relatively open and secular pakistan yet it is precisely that pakistan that the countrys liberal elites now want to put at risk thanks to their hatred of gen musharraf ms bhuttos column is not only an exercise in hypocrisy it is a display of short sightedness on a massive and tragic scale arthur herman charlottesville va mr herman is completing a full length study of gandhi and churchill which will be published by bantam dell in
