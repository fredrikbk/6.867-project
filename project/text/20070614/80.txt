readback an irish frame of mind farrells novel troubles alternates between bloody reality and humor online edition in when he was years old my great great grandfather james fergus crossen left ireland to come to america a miller by trade he was so successful in melrose minn where he and his family settled that he built the first two story house in the village he also served as a justice of the peace and was called judge crossen a title that would also suit many of his descendants this week im going for the first time to the country the judge abandoned to put myself in an irish frame of mind i wanted to read a novel set in ireland i consulted the guardian of londons web site searching its books section for a top list of irish novels the guardians top lists are an excellent source of book recommendations the guardians list put "ulysses" at no but i was delighted to see that no was j g farrells novel "troubles " the first volume of his empire trilogy having earlier reviewed "the siege of krishnapur " the second of mr farrells three books about the fall of english colonialism "the singapore grip" was the last i knew he was my kind of author in prose as polished as waterford crystal mr farrell alternates between bloody reality and slapstick humor so fluently that you can grin and wince in the same sentence the troubles of mr farrells title were the violent skirmishes just after world war i between the nationalist sinn fein party who wanted self rule for ireland and the ruling anglo irish aristocracy their murderous squabbles are seen through the eyes of a shell shocked english veteran major brendan archer who has come to ireland in because he thinks he might be engaged to an irish girl that he doesnt know for sure is characteristic of this doleful yet comic character who finds the irish and their internecine quarrels so baffling "surely theres no need to abandon ones reason simply because one is in ireland " the major says to a young catholic woman "in ireland " she replies "you must choose your tribe reason has nothing to do with it " the major has no family friends or home so he moves into the mischievously named majestic hotel which his patrician fiancees family owns the gradual surrender of the once grand hotel to feral cats invasive vegetation and dry rot is so brilliantly evoked that its almost painful meanwhile the political situation in ireland is deteriorating to the point where places in the majestics dining room are set with knives forks and revolvers bullets are in the sugar bowl mr farrells mother was irish his father english and the primeval animosity between the two peoples and their religions is explored with the relish of a connoisseur the protestant perspective is offered by edward spencer who owns and runs the majestic thinking about catholics he considers "the absurd squadron of saints buzzing overhead like chaps in the flying corps supposedly ever ready to lend a hand to the blokes on the ground the pope with all his unhealthy finery the service in a gibberish of latin that no one understood well such thoughts do not actually have to occur by a process of thinking they run in the blood of the protestant irish " sarah devlin with whom the major falls in love represents the catholics poking fun at the humorless "beastly prods " who are "as literal as a lump of dough " but there are dozens of other unconventional characters including the requisite drunks clerics constables snobs and servants mr farrell who grew up in england ireland and the far east was a handsome athlete studying at oxford university when in he was diagnosed with polio and he lived for a time in an iron lung he won the booker prize in for "the siege of krishnapur " and he published "the singapore grip" in in early mr farrell moved to a cottage on the irish coast later that year while he was fishing he was hit by a wave and swept out to sea he was years old mr farrell would be relieved to know that although irelands troubles are still not over the battles are increasingly being fought with words not guns the country i will visit is for the most part so peaceful and prosperous that if judge crossen were alive today he might have chosen not to leave write to cynthia crossen at cynthia crossen wsj com
