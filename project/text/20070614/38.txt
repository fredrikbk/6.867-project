home &amp family but does it taste good a rack of lamb or chocolate souffle in mere minutes when i heard about the oven by turbochef technologies that lets homeowners cook gourmet meals up to times faster than a regular oven i was skeptical for someone like me who finds instant oatmeal tricky an oven this fast conjured visions of steak going up in flames or worse mealy and flavorless microwave dinners so i tried it out i went to a company showroom and with the help of a company chef cooked a gourmet frozen pizza in two minutes a large rack of lamb in five a souffle in two minutes and asparagus in seconds my test found that if consumers dont mind the &# price tag the oven is easy to navigate and can produce a savory three course meal in minutes unlike food cooked in a microwave there was no uneven cooking or soggy crusts the lamb came out perfectly medium and was nicely seared the oven which works by using high speed hot air and occasional microwaves may be good for amateurs because it takes the guesswork out of cooking the oven not the cook automatically chooses time and temperature for example when i put in the lamb i merely selected from one of the ovens cook settings in this case "broil " then "rack of lamb " then the approximate weight i hit "start" and in five minutes and seconds it was done the faster speed can foil home cooks rhythm with a two minute pizza theres less time to set the table do some cleanup or linger over a glass of wine using your favorite existing recipes can also require some experimenting to find the most appropriate settings if need be you can of course cook things for a longer time or take them out sooner and quicker cooking time may indeed be convenient when entertaining for the holidays but then again isnt there an element of tradition in putting a pound turkey in the oven at dawn and having it roast for half the day see related article "super fast food appliances for the impatient cook viking ge and others tout high speed ovens fridges a four minute rack of lamb" wsj june
