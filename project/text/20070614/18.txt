joint venture to buy surplus properties from the catholic church and redevelop them instead of a marriage made in heaven the burkle follieri alliance has degenerated into a nasty name calling fight that has dragged in not only the high profile california investor and his handsome young italian partner but mr follieris actress girlfriend as well it has even touched a former president in late april an investment fund thats part of mr burkles closely held yucaipa cos filed suit in delaware state court accusing mr follieri and his firm the follieri group with "willfully and systematically misappropriating" at least &# million of the over &# million yucaipa had up to that time sunk into the joint venture follieri yucaipa investments llc the suit alleges that misappropriations went to finance the year old mr follieris "personal extravagances and budget mismanagement " among the purported extravagances private jet travel for mr follieri and his girlfriend actress anne hathaway a penthouse apartment in new york used by mr follieri "massive charges for five star lodging meals and entertainment" as well as medical care for follieri relatives and a dog additionally the suit says hundreds of thousands of dollars were improperly loaned to the follieri foundation a nonprofit charity run by mr follieri and his family though he isnt mentioned in the lawsuit former president bill clinton is both a possible victim and indirect beneficiary of the alleged misdeeds he is a senior adviser and potential profit participant in the burkle managed yucaipa investment fund whose money the suit says was misused by mr follieri and his firm but a charitable initiative headed by mr clinton also received a &# million commitment last year from the follieri foundation to vaccinate children in honduras that move earned mr follieri kudos from mr clinton at a major new york gathering last september a spokesman for mr clinton said the former president wasnt involved in creating or operating the real estate joint venture mr clinton has met mr follieri a "few times" among the hundreds of people he routinely meets but "does not know him well " the spokesman added in a written statement mr follieri denied any wrongdoing and dismissed the "petty allegations" in "mr burkles vindictive lawsuit " he added that the joint venture "owns numerous highly valuable properties" and that mr burkles "refusal to consent to various real estate transactions are causing vastly more harm than any of the items set forth in his complaint " earlier this week the follieri group filed court papers saying that it was stepping down as managing member a step yucaipa had been demanding and moving to dissolve the joint venture in its filing the follieri group said because of yucaipas actions "the business purpose of the joint venture has been frustrated " in the suit yucaipa is also seeking unspecified monetary damages the follieri fracas marks what appears to be a small but embarrassing business misstep by the year old mr burkle who built his fortune buying and selling supermarket chains but has now expanded into numerous industries including airlines and magazine publishing yucaipa is working with an employees union at dow jones &amp co to find a bidder for the company other than news corp yucaipa officials say that in years of existence their operation has averaged an eye popping annual rate of return a yucaipa spokesman said despite the disagreement with mr follieri his organization is happy with the properties bought by the joint venture and feels its overall investment is secure yesterday evening the spokesman said yucaipa now believes the disputed amounts have been repaid in an interview yesterday evening mr burkle said he now feels "in a pretty good place" in regards to the follieri venture and if the disputed money has been repaid there wouldnt be a need for continuing the litigation records from the delaware lawsuit help paint a picture of a business relationship that blossomed fast and withered almost as quickly mr follieri and his father pasquale an italian businessman formed the follieri group in it aims to "provide assistance to the catholic church" by purchasing surplus church properties and "renovating them for uses such as low and middle income housing community centers day care facilities senior citizen housing places of worship offices and retail spaces " according to the follieri groups web site prior to starting the follieri group the younger mr follieri had worked at various jobs in europe including starting his own cosmetics company legal problems have cropped up before in mr follieris family in his father was convicted by a lower court in italy and given a three year commuted sentence for embezzling from a bankrupt company whose assets he had been charged with overseeing his legal problems were reported in italian weekly lespresso according to the ruling a copy of which was viewed by the wall street journal pasquale follieri used the assets of the company for personal purposes such as filling his own gas tank and buying spare parts for his boat as well as siphoning off cash the case is on appeal the senior mr follieri couldnt be reached for comment but raffaello follieri through a spokesman said his father was innocent of any wrongdoing the yucaipa lawsuit says the follieri group "touted itself as having substantial and valuable contacts with the vatican " andrea sodano identified in the suit as a follieri group vice president and consultant is the nephew of cardinal angelo sodano a former vatican secretary of state the suit said some of the joint ventures money was paid to a firm run by andrea sodano for "engineering studies " the suit said yucaipa officials hadnt been able to get access to those engineering studies mr sodano who isnt a defendant in the suit couldnt be reached for comment last year the vatican said it didnt have a relationship with the follieri group by early mr follieri was ensconced in new york and popping up in gossip columns as the boyfriend of ms hathaway whose movie credits include "the princess diaries" and "the devil wears prada " messrs burkle and follieri met through an attorney they both knew in new york and the relationship developed rapidly the delaware court files contain a may letter from mr burkle to "dear raffaello" saying that "it has been a pleasure to get to know you over the past month or so " yucaipa was ready to make its &# million commitment last september messrs burkle and follieri were among roughly attendees including laura bush bill gates and warren buffett at a gathering of the clinton global initiative an effort by the former president to recruit people to tackle problems like poverty and disease president clinton called mr follieri to the stage to praise his foundations vaccination pledge ms hathaway serves on the board of the follieri foundation ms hathaway who isnt a defendant in the delaware suit said through a spokesman that "i have faith that the court system will sort this out " the clinton spokesman says that the former president honored a number of people besides mr follieri that day last september he added that none of the billions of dollars pledged as part of the clinton global initiative go to the organization instead the money is spent directly on tackling a particular problem by early this year yucaipa officials were complaining to mr follieri about how the joint venture was being operated according to the delaware lawsuit filings the lawsuit claims that "virtually from the start " the joint venture which was operated by the follieri group ran over agreed upon budgets and began making "urgent capital calls" on yucaipa for cash to meet payroll as yucaipa officials looked deeper they began to find evidence of improper spending the suit charged in march yucaipa executive robert bermingham sent mr follieri a letter demanding "increased fiscal responsibility and accountability" and labeling as "preposterous" any efforts to blame his firm for the joint ventures problems in response mr follieri called yucaipas position "disingenuous " he blamed yucaipa for holding up property development deals and called the alleged misuse of funds a "result of a little money that needs to go back into the right pot" which he insisted would happen spending by the foundation has "enhanced our business image " said mr follieri adding that yucaipa officials "were aware of what we were doing " a follieri attorney says the joint ventures loan to the foundation has been repaid gabriel kahn contributed to this article
