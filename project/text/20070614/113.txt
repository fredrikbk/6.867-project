you have weapons in your computer to monitor your kids one of the most vexing problems in home computing is finding a way for parents to govern their childrens use of computers and the internet the goal is to keep their kids safe from the creepier content and people on the internet and from spending too much time on the computer of course in many families these problems are solved with good parenting skills and establishing trust and limits but even strong parents could use some technological help for years add on programs have attempted to give parents some control over what children can do on the computer some of these have been ok but many have had weaknesses that were exploited by kids who are typically technically savvier than adults many parents however dont realize that the latest versions of the two main computer operating systems microsofts windows vista and apples mac os x tiger have parental controls built right in on both platforms you can control even which programs a child can run this is key because it prevents kids from running alternative web browsers or other programs that may not be susceptible to parental controls both also allow you to specify which web sites a child can visit another crucial feature these built in controls are free of charge and fairly easy to use even better because they are designed by the same companies that built the operating system and arent bolted on afterward they can impose limits in ways that kids may find harder to evade i have been testing these built in parental controls while they arent perfect i can recommend them as powerful tools to help parents get a handle on their childrens computing and online activities on both windows and mac the trick is to make sure the computer used by a child has multiple accounts or logins one for a parent should be set up as an "administrator" account the type that grants its user powers to change various settings including the power to establish parental controls on other accounts this administrator account should be protected by a password and this password should never be shared with the child if the child knows it he or she can log in as the administrator and weaken or remove the controls in addition you should set up a standard or more limited account for each child who uses the machine people logged in via these accounts cant change many settings on the computer and cant override the controls once logged in to your administrator account you can apply different limits to each childs account in windows vista you can find the parental controls settings in the control panel under the heading user accounts and family safety you must be using the home basic home premium or ultimate versions of vista to apply these boundaries they arent available in the business or enterprise versions on the mac in tiger you can find parental controls in the system preferences program by clicking on the accounts icon you select the standard account you want to control and then click the tab labeled parental controls in addition to restricting which web sites kids can visit and which programs they can run vista but not the mac includes an extensive system of controls on games on the other hand the mac allows you to block a child from using a printer or burning cds the mac system but not vista allows you to specify exactly with whom a child can exchange emails or instant messages as long as the child is using apples own built in mail email program and ichat instant messaging program to ensure compliance you would have to limit the child to using only these programs and not competitors or web sites that perform these functions in vista you may be able to set up similar limitations within the individual email or instant messaging program but its easier on the mac if a nonapproved person attempts to send your child an email the mac system can even forward the email to you on the other hand vista but not the mac allows you to set time limits for a childs use of the computer another strong vista feature absent on the mac is a detailed report on the childs activities that can be emailed to the parent though the report doesnt include email and instant messaging activities vista also can filter out web pages based on content categories such as sex or drugs apple is planning to add a time limit feature web content filtering and a new activity logging feature in its forthcoming leopard operating system due in october determined kids wanting to view pornography or contact strangers could probably find ways to evade both systems its awfully hard to shut down access to everything of which you disapprove without also blocking access to valuable content and functions but the logging and reporting features should at least make evasions detectable after the fact so if you want to put some technological muscle behind your parenting dont overlook the parental control features hiding in your own pc
