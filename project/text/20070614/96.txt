the daily fix lebron cavs come up short as spurs look to sweep series online edition lebron james and the cleveland cavaliers had their chance last night against the san antonio spurs in game of the nba finals a chance to avoid what now looks likely a sweep which has columnists calling the teams star player "lebroom " unlike the first two games in san antonio the cavs managed to keep it close as the series moved to cleveland for one of the citys most anticipated sporting events in years but even holding the spurs to points wasnt enough to please the victory hungry fans as james missed a last second three pointer that would have tied the game no foul was called even though the spurs later admitted thats exactly what they were trying to do foul lebron who shrugged off the swipe by bruce bowen as "incidental contact" and said it didnt affect his shot so the spurs won the second fewest points in an nba finals game and giving them a lead in the best of seven series the mood in cleveland after the game was dour even though the city has plenty to be proud of after making it this far but fans were holding out hope that the cavs could bring the city its first championship of any kind in years "the miracle moment came and went with no deliverance at hand not even that of lebron james whose stock in trade is amazement " wrote columnist bill livingston in the cleveland plain dealer "there was no call this time and no shot to gratify what a sign in the screaming stands called believe land james missed the th miss in threes tried by the cavs " fellow plain dealer writer michael k mcintyre put it more bluntly "this magical season was supposed to end with the cavaliers wearing championship rings not toe tags " as he goes on to remind us "no team has ever lost the first three games in any nba playoff series finals or otherwise and survived " tony mejia of cbs sportsline says "its over" for the cavs who "wasted their lone opportunity to win a game in the nba finals " and tells us that while national interest has been lackluster the series means everything to cleveland "take your opinion of this championship series put it in your back pocket and understand something " he writes "the games you shun and switch your channel from mean everything to a city that hasnt won a single thing in over years everything " so much of clevelands hopes for the series were riding on the shoulders of one man james just delivered against detroit with his epic performance in game when he scored of his teams last points and carried the cavs to a double overtime victory over the pistons the comparisons to michael jordan began again and legendary status was quickly assigned to james but rob oller writing in the columbus dispatch says james is not yet worthy "they say he is but thats in human years if age is measured in expectations then lebron james is going on methuselah he is the white haired old man he portrays in his shoe commercials some of us are growing up some are growing old lebron is doing both the man child " mr oller says "lebron wasnt terrible last night scoring points and grabbing eight rebounds with seven assists but the next jordan wasnt good enough when his team fans and city needed him to be and that is how greatness is measured to step up when its absolutely necessary as it was against the spurs " all this talk about lebron james and cavs and they havent even won a game meanwhile tim duncan and the spurs are on the brink of their fourth title in nine years all along duncan as been the key player david friedman writes on nbc sports "duncan shuts down the paint on defense forcing any cleveland player who drives to shoot a contested shot his defensive work in the previous games seemed to affect the cavaliers approach in game they settled for too many three point shots and connected on just three of their attempts from behind the arc " mr friedman explains "on offense duncan seems to be a magnet for cavaliers players who swarm him trying to prevent him from utilizing his deadly jump hooks and face up bank shots that leaves the other spurs wide open behind the three point line and they came through by making of their three pointers " while duncan and the spurs got the job done the win wasnt exactly pretty according to mike finger of the san antonio express news who offers up some local cleveland and pop culture analogies "if game of the nba finals could be liquefied and dumped into a local waterway the cuyahoga river would still be burning if game was an exhibit in the nearby rock and roll hall of fame it would be displayed right next to earth wind &amp fire and it would be called dearth bricks &amp mire it was so brutal there were reports of people flipping over to a rerun of the sopranos to watch something with less potential for ugliness it was so vulgar even larry flynt was tempted to agree that some things should be censored " if the nba just doesnt do it for you maybe major league baseball will suffice yesterday saw the seasons second no hitter from year old detroit tigers pitcher justin verlander chicago white sox pitcher mark buehrle accomplished the feat on april and as the fix then pointed out almost threw baseballs first perfect game in three years and the new york yankees won their seventh game in a row to get to for the season heres how john lowe describes the no hitter the first for the tigers since in the detroit free press "they just build and build like nothing else in baseball the way that justin verlander struck out the first two milwaukee batters of the game tuesday night you could think that would be no hit stuff if he could sustain it for nine innings when verlander struck out seven in the first four innings you could think this might be the best hes ever looked and when he wheeled into the seventh you could think hes gone from not allowing any hits to seriously working on a no hitter from there the adrenaline and the bedlam and the tigers defense took over " indeed as dana wakiji says in the detroit news "two key plays tuesday night helped verlander keep his no hit bid alive late in the game " in the seventh inning magglio ordonez had to make a sliding grab of corey harts fly ball and one inning later neifi perez made a backhanded flip from his knees to placido polanco who then threw to sean casey at first to complete the double play verlander was quick to credit his teammates "ive got to give all the props in the world to my teammates behind me tonight without them this couldnt have been done magglios great catch neifi and polanco turning that double play casey at first it was an all around performance " on espn jerry crasnick writes "every no hitter requires a degree of luck and fate and the planets aligning properly a bad bounce here or a poor decision there can be enough to separate a pitcher from his place in history and sorry not today " while thats true some saw verlanders performance coming "not to say that verlander is a hall of fame lock at age " says mr crasnick "but when your fastball hits triple digits and your curveball and changeup overwhelm hitters in a way that radar guns cant measure every start has the potential to make big news no one with the exception of opposing hitters understands that better than the men who evaluate baseball talent for a living " mr crasnick points out a "remarkably prescient story" by danny knobler of booth newspapers written before verlanders no hitter yesterday it quoted two scouts who said the pitcher might strike out batters in a game one day only that day was now in a follow up piece today mr knobler writes "no hitters are amazing to watch because of the way they unfold sometimes they come out of nowhere sometimes youre surprised tuesdays was no surprise " the new york yankees also accomplished something relatively speaking they won their seventh game in a row beating the arizona diamondbacks to bring their record back to this season "it was a bad night to be a worm a lonely night to be an outfielder and as always these days a great night to be a yankee " writes tyler kepner in the new york times "symmetry and round numbers abound in the bronx where the yankees are finally at with games left in their turnabout smiley face season " filip bondy exclaims the new york daily news "the yankees have turned their frowns upside down emanating pure fraternal bliss not even rain clouds last night could obscure their blue skies this is the most ecstatic team in the bronx since may of " but as newsdays wallace matthews reminds us is "the epitome of mediocrity " he says that while the yankees "are officially no longer a bad team " theyre "not quite a good one yet either but they seem to be on their way " dale earnhardt jr has made it official he is leaving his familys race team dale earnhardt inc to join hendrick motorsports home to four time nextel cup series champion jeff gordon it gives hendrick arguably the most formidable lineup in racing history and gives earnhardt arguably his best shot at winning the title "the most powerful free agent on the racing market has found himself a new home for next season and its with racings version of the new york yankees " writes tom bowles on si com "the rest of nascar better watch out " the charlotte observers david poole says "in the land of ought to be the son of seven time champion dale earnhardt ought to be the arch nemesis of hendrick motorsports " in the eyes of some nascar fans he will be seen as a defector writes mr poole "this is the last remaining hatfield heir going to work for mccoy inc its a north carolina graduate coaching dukes basketball team its babe ruth leaving the new york yankees for the boston red sox " found a good column from the world of
