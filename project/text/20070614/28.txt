cutting ties should states sell stocks to protest links to iran in ohio rep mandel pushes for pullout white house opposed columbus ohio three years ago josh mandel was fighting insurgents as a marine in iraq today as a freshman state legislator here hes aiming at another big target iran and its nuclear program in march weeks after he was sworn in rep mandel startled veteran lawmakers when he announced plans for a bill that would force the states five public pension funds to divest themselves of stock in foreign companies doing business in iran the funds manage over &# billion in assets and among the companies targeted were more than a dozen with major investments in ohio including japans honda motor co "the state should not be investing peoples hard earned dollars in countries that are sworn to americas destruction " says the year old republican lawmaker a new legislative movement is tapping a wellspring of anxiety over iran and its perceived threat to u s troops in the middle east and to u s allies such as israel it has sparked fierce debate over what role local governments should play in guiding u s foreign policy and in directing the investments of the nations huge public pension funds which altogether hold more than &# trillion in assets at least other statehouses across the country are considering similar anti iran efforts last week florida gov charlie crist signed the nations first iran divestment bill into law and the california assembly unanimously passed a bill forcing the states two huge public pension funds with more than &# billion in assets to shed their iran related assets that bill is now headed to the state senate texas illinois michigan and new jersey among others are also weighing divestment legislation some of the bills broadly target all companies active in iran while others focus on companies involved only in its energy sector congress is offering unusual support as both parties search for ways to increase pressure on iran last month democratic sen barack obama and republican sen sam brownback both presidential contenders introduced legislation to support the local divestment bills and to shield divestment legislation from potential lawsuits challenging the states right to enact laws that impact foreign policy the effect of the state divestment laws is likely to be mostly symbolic as legislatures intend to give the funds a year or more to shed the targeted shares still proponents hope divestment will weaken irans economy and destabilize its government in the s a divestment campaign led dozens of u s companies to cease doing business in south africa helping end the apartheid system more recently pressure over sudans handling of the atrocities in darfur helped push british engine maker rolls royce plc and two of europes largest technology companies germanys siemens ag and switzerlands abb ltd to announce they are pulling out of the country the effort has big implications for the public pension fund industry forcing the sale of tens of billions of dollars in foreign equity holdings in dozens of blue chip companies could cost the funds tens of millions of dollars in administrative costs alone furthermore the funds argue that buying and selling assets for political reasons undermines their responsibility to shareholders and could set a precedent for passing laws targeting investments in china or elsewhere "no one is for terrorism " says laura ecklar a spokeswoman for ohios second largest fund the &# billion state teachers retirement system which has strongly opposed the mandel bill "but no matter how noble the cause pension funds shouldnt be used to set foreign policy " the bush administration is strongly opposed to the legislation arguing that it threatens to torpedo the larger diplomatic effort to isolate tehran the u s britain france and germany along with china and russia have been stepping up economic pressure on iran to try to persuade it to stop its uranium enrichment work which they believe to be part of an effort to develop nuclear weapons the u s also alleges that iran is supplying shiite militia groups in iraq with weapons which are being used to kill u s troops while u s companies have long been barred from operating in iran more than multinationals have investments there from british dutch oil giant royal dutch shell plc and french telecommunications equipment company alcatel sa to swedens electronics company telefon ab l m ericsson companies targeted by the various iran bills say they are paying close attention to the effort but so far none appear to have backed away from doing business in iran as a result many dispute the efficacy of economic sanctions and all say their investments are unrelated to irans nuclear program ohios effort is driven by mr mandel who joined the marines in after finishing college he was summoned to iraq in where he served for eight months as an intelligence specialist in al anbar province one of the roughest areas of the country over feet tall and rail thin mr mandel is so young people mistook him for a page when he first arrived in columbus citing his marine affiliation mr mandel refuses to comment on iraq his campaign platform focused not on the war abroad but on local issues like attracting jobs to the area and protecting the tax base of local schools the legislator says he got the idea for the bill in december after reading an opinion piece written by missouris republican state treasurer sarah steelman one of the movements most outspoken proponents ms steelman last year launched a "terror free" public fund in missouri that filters out shares from companies doing business in iran north korea sudan or syria countries listed by the u s government as sponsors of terrorism in she persuaded the states retirement system to shed shares in the same companies knowing he would need help battling the pension funds mr mandel recruited another newly elected republican rep shannon jones to co sponsor the bill "when josh came to me with this i said were going to do what it was a crazy idea but i was taken by it immediately " says ms jones a former congressional staff aide and republican campaign worker from outside dayton "i couldnt get over the fact that my own retirement money is investing in a little bit of terror " the two spent more than a month drafting the bill introducing it in april along with a lengthy written defense to pre empt potential criticism while some senior republicans were leery the bill attracted co sponsors out of the state house of representatives members but it drew immediate fire from ohios pension funds administrators complained that the measure if passed would affect shares of more than international companies and require the funds to sell by one estimate more than &# billion in holdings administrative costs of divestment alone would top &# million they said rallying their forces the funds emailed "action alerts" to thousands of the states million current and retired state employees alleging that the bill could gut their retirement and health care accounts and urging them to call their local representatives "a delayed response may be devastating " read one alert sent out in may by the ohio state teachers retirement system an even louder outcry arose from ohios industrial belt the bill which roped in companies with even small engagements with iran affected not only honda but daimlerchrysler ag bridgestone corp siemens and thyssenkrupp ag all of which have factories in ohio the pension funds estimated that the targeted companies employed more than workers in the state one of the first critics to pull mr mandel aside was rep matt szollosi a freshman democrat his message the bill would chill the investment climate in ohio a state already hard hit by the loss of manufacturing jobs "i told him straight out that daimlerchrysler has a new jeep plant that straddles my district " mr szollosi recalls "theyve invested up to &# billion in that plant the bill as introduced would have had a devastating impact on ohio from an economic development standpoint " the ohio chamber of commerce also lobbied lawmakers to oppose the bill linda woggon who heads the chambers governmental affairs shop sent a memo in may to members saying the bill would set a "dangerous precedent" by inserting politics into investment decisions and could put "our states business climate at risk especially in todays global economy " most of the states major newspapers including the hometown columbus dispatch editorialized against the bill mr mandels bill won some significant backers too james woolsey a former director of the central intelligence agency under president clinton flew in to testify in favor of divestiture local jewish groups organized a letter writing and telephone campaign to push the bill the powerful lobbying group the american israeli political action committee also sent in advisers then ohio house speaker jon husted a republican initially wary of the bill advised reps mandel and jones how to beat back opposition he said the bill had to get smaller and shouldnt target companies active in ohio so in may mr mandel and ms jones decided to follow floridas lead and only go after companies with investments of more than &# million in irans energy sector many divestiture efforts focus on companies with investments in energy which accounts for more than a quarter of irans total economic output the companies include french energy company total sa norways statoil asa and malaysias petronas but the authors in ohio also expanded the bill to include companies investing in sudans oil fields in a bid to put pressure on the sudanese government over darfur on may mr mandel brought in some of his most powerful supporters iraq war veterans in ohio and other states the carnage in iraq fueled in part by iran supplied weapons has given emotional impetus to the divestment movement at the hearing the father of an ohio marine told lawmakers how his son was killed last year in iraq by a bomb traced back to iran that day the narrower bill sailed through the financial institutions committee by a vote of to five backers included early critics like rep szollosi and unexpectedly ohios third largest fund the &# billion ohio police and fire pension fund the fund had decided to remain neutral on the issue a move seen as giving tacit support to the bill hundreds of the funds active and retired members have served in iraq "our members see things a little differently say from the teachers or other state employees " says fund director william estabrook last week speaker husted postponed a full vote on the measure and proposed a compromise in which the funds would voluntarily divest themselves from half of their iran energy related holdings within six months and the remainder after that in exchange the house would refrain from passing mandatory legislation two days later all five of the state funds agreed to the deal though rep mandel says he hasnt decided whether to support the compromise or push for a full vote of his bill legislation in other big states has faced less opposition floridas iran divestment bill enacted into law last week won the backing of state veterans groups the local afl cio and the state teachers union the law which also targets sudan related investments takes aim at the shares of companies in the &# billion florida retirement system fund the states main public pension fund on the florida list are russias two huge energy companies oao gazprom and oao lukoil the fund put up little public opposition to the bill despite an initial estimate that it could cost the fund up to &# million in administrative fees californias divestment bill is the handiwork of freshman state assemblyman joel anderson a republican from san diego who portrays the drive as a matter of simple investment logic "any idiot understands that iran is a dumb place to be parking taxpayer money " he says like mr mandel mr anderson originally tried to push through a bill targeting the shares of all foreign companies in iran but he also finally settled on legislation focused on irans energy sector his revised bill which gov arnold schwarzenegger supports could go before the california senate as soon as september divestment supporters are moving to another challenge state pension funds invest much of their international holdings in index funds making it impossible to shed individual company shares following missouris lead louisiana and other states are now looking to create funds that would bar the shares of companies active in any country listed by the u s as sponsors of terrorism the bush administration is taking aim at states efforts deputy treasury secretary robert kimmitt blasted the legislation in a speech last month saying "our economic sanctions against iran are intended to engage not confront our allies " mr mandel doesnt buy that theres a conflict between state measures and the administrations efforts in washington "the federal government is doing what it can " he says "and so are we "
