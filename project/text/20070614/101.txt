backed bonds is looking to sell some &# billion of the home loan related investment vehicles owned by high grade structured credit strategies enhanced leverage fund three people familiar with the situation tell bloomberg the month old fund which had about &# million of investors money and borrowed a lot more to increase its buying power is down this year bloomberg says goldman sachs and bank of america are among the dozen big wall street players that loaned the fund around &# billion the wall street journal adds a good chunk of that seems to have been used to buy up the subprime debt that has so infamously soured this year as poorer more risky borrowers began defaulting en masse amid the broader real estate market downturn pacific investment management has estimated that holders of securities issued on the back of subprime loans could lose as much as &# billion bloomberg notes other hedge funds with similar exposure will likely be watching closely to see whether bear stearns can salvage much of the subprime loan investment at an auction that opens today earlier this week a group of hedge funds that included paulson sent a letter to the securities and exchange commission asking the agency to keep an eye out for manipulation of bonds tied to subprime mortgages bloomberg reported yesterday the letter "told the sec that investment banks may pay inflated prices to buy bad loans that are collateral for bonds " bloomberg said citing paulson executive michael waldorf "removing delinquent loans may prevent bonds from defaulting and triggering losses in the banks investments in derivatives " it said while todays sales are just a drop in the &# trillion market for bonds tied to residential mortgages "it is still a large amount to be sold at one time and a potentially troubling sign for the broader mortgage backed bond market " the journal says bear stearnss own exposure to this market is expected to contribute to what analysts expect to be a decline in the quarterly earnings the investment bank is scheduled to report today but the journal says the firms exposure to the hedge funds losses is limited since it and some bear stearns executives had invested just &# million in the fund hamas nears unfettered rule of gaza the turn from quasi civil war to civil war in the palestinian territories may have come today even if the steady escalation of inter factional violence this week may have surpassed the limits of battlefield semantics fighters from hamas captured the most important gaza security headquarters of fatah and witnesses tell the associated press the victors dragged the fatah gunmen from the building and executed them in the street in front of their wives and children a bloody demonstration of the islamist groups political and military supremacy in gaza in the less impoverished west bank where fatah remains dominant president mahmoud abbas for the first time ordered his elite presidential guard to strike back at hamas and defend the political movement he inherited from yassir arafat but fatah forces in gaza "were crumbling fast under the onslaught by the better armed and better disciplined islamic fighters " the ap says subpoenas issued to ex white house staffers determined to find whether the firing of u s attorneys last year were tied to the prosecution of corruption and voter fraud cases two congressional panels issued subpoenas yesterday to former white house counsel harriet miers and ex political affairs director sara taylor thus far the bush administration has refused to let congressional investigators have "unfettered access to testimony and documents that lawmakers have sought as part of the three month probe even as justice department documents and testimony have shown that the white house was deeply involved in the firings " the los angeles times notes these are the first subpoenas from the house and senate judiciary committees on the matter that have been served directly to the white house or its staff and signal "that democrats are willing to pursue protracted litigation to determine whether president bush or his top aides played a significant role in identifying u s attorneys to be removed " the washington post says the decision escalates what the post calls "a constitutional showdown" over the dismissals that could end up being decided in court regulators eye

review the messages or if the sender cannot be identified they should consider blocking them from the workplace " the times says "but some outside the committee said that regulation and enforcement
