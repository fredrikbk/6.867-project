sites is letting users post their private personal finance details and share advice with each other on tracking their spending and making better investment decisions some of the sites such as wesabe com and geezeo com include many of the same features offered by popular software programs such as intuit inc s quicken and microsoft corp s money such as the ability to track spending in different categories and from different sources in one place but they also allow users to get feedback from peers that is tailored to their specific circumstances some allow users to rate the quality of other members tips or provide feedback on various products or services theyve used josh young a year old environmental engineer from cincinnati decided to try out wesabe after reading about it in various blogs he wanted to pay off his credit card debt and the two car loans that he and his wife shared and he expected the site would help identify areas where he and his wife were overspending but he also got help from other users who shared their own tips on reducing debt and cutting spending "one of our goals was to pay off all our debt and were almost there " says mr young some consumers may have security concerns about sending their personal financial information to a web site in general the sites say their systems are protected against identity thieves and are just as safe as banking online wesabe for its part stresses that it doesnt store users login information on its servers and screens out any personal information from the data to protect users privacy the type of information you need to enter into these sites and how public that information becomes depends on the site and what you want to get out of it at geezeo for example users provide their passwords for their bank and credit card accounts which the site uses to automatically pull users data into its systems at wesabe users download a software program onto their computer and then enter their passwords the program then pulls their data from the banks to users computers and then uploads it to wesabes computers at both sites users data is kept private although members can voluntarily share more information about themselves with other people the sites will also aggregate user information to reveal spending patterns in the community such as the average amount users spend on gas but will not disclose individual data at other sites such as the just launched covestor llc which allow investors to share their portfolio information members manually input transaction data for their brokerage accounts or provide their account passwords to have the firm automatically track their trades members can choose to remain anonymous and the actual dollar values of trades and specific holdings of each member always remains confidential with only percentages displayed still other sites with names such as buxfer com and billmonk com help college roommates friends and family members keep running tallies of shared expenses at the same time some smaller brokerage firms such as tradeking and zecco holdings inc s zecco com are letting clients share information about their holdings recent trades and investment strategies with other users if they choose users of the sites can reveal as much or as little about themselves as they want to at networthiq com a site run by portland ore based fourio llc users information is kept private until they choose to create a public profile at which time only their general net worth statistics are made public and any personal information such as email addresses remain private an estimated two million households are expected to use these sites by the end of next year says jim bruene editor of online banking report who published a report on the sites last week that number is expected to jump to about million households in years the sites could remain niche players however if they arent able to attract enough users he says "not everybody wants to see their bank account balances " he says dow jones &amp co the publisher of the wall street journal and iac interactive corp are jointly developing a personal finance web site the target audience for these sites is younger users "the idea of looking at a ledger and seeing a check number thats really boring " says harper reed a year old software engineer in chicago who uses wesabe to keep track of his spending "but being able to say im trying to spend less money at amazon and seeing how many people are also trying to save money at amazon is a better way to quantify the numbers to me " the ability to share and compare ones finances with others can also help motivate people to build their wealth networthiq lets users create profiles based on their actual net worth they can then compare themselves with others by age income or occupation link to other users and track their progress on a blog about one third of the sites registered users choose to make their net worth figures public although the data are self reported and the users identity is masked on geezeo members can create discussion groups with other users about specific financial topics the site lets members create a consolidated view of their financial accounts and use text messaging technology to get quick balance updates from their mobile phones starting this week users will be able to provide feedback on financial products such as student loans credit cards or savings accounts "this totally makes sense for the something crowd " says brian jones a financial adviser in fairfax va and author of "getting started the financial guide for a younger generation " "theres a lot of utility here because their situations arent that complex this generation is very comfortable with online profiles and is very open with sharing information online " katie mccaskey a year old new yorker likes the anonymity of being able to discuss her personal finances online "i recently went back to graduate school and i freaked out about how much this degree cost me " says the freelance artist who now uses geezeo to keep track of her finances "after frustrating everybody in my family and social circle with my concerns " she started writing a blog to swap advice on paying down debt some sites also allow users to keep track of shared expenses between friends and family mike zazon a year old student in columbus ohio previously used spreadsheets to keep track of expenses that he had to split with his roommate now whenever they pay bills they post the transactions on buxfer which automatically divides up each persons share and alerts others in the group by email or text message that an expense has been posted "it takes away the awkwardness of going to collect later " says mr zazon
