solar companies of all sizes race to develop cheap efficient panels in a laboratory in palo alto calif engineers testing new super powerful solar panels shock them with searing heat and deep cold then blast them with wind sand and hail the year long battery of tests aims to assess the reliability of new panels being developed by a start up called solfocus inc the panels contain curved mirrors that magnify the suns rays up to times concentrating them onto a tiny solar cell that converts them into electricity far more efficiently than conventional panels "we even shot them with bb guns " says nancy hartsoch the marketing director for solfocus how the panels stand up has big implications and not just for solfocus which raised &# million from venture capitalists last year also on the line whether after decades of unfulfilled promises solar power will become a cost effective alternative to coal and natural gas hampered by its high cost solar power accounts for less than of world wide electricity generation it costs to cents to produce a kilowatt hour of electricity from solar panels compared with about three to five cents burning coal according to the international energy agency a different approach known as concentrating solar power uses huge arrays of mirrors or solar dishes to track the sun and collect its heat to make electricity yet even that costs nine to cents to generate one kilowatt hour for now government subsidies are necessary for solar power to develop and the biggest markets for it arent the sun drenched southwestern u s but germany and japan whose generous incentives have spurred growth but that equation is beginning to change solfocus is one of nearly a dozen start ups competing alongside established solar giants like japans sharp corp to develop a solar panel that is both cheap and efficient well known tech venture capitalists like apax partners benchmark capital and us venture partners as well as google founders sergey brin and larry page have poured cash into solar start ups in recent years meanwhile established leaders in conventional solar panels like sharp the u k s bp plc and germanys q cells ag have well funded research labs working on their own technology whoever can come up with the answer will be able to claim a large chunk of the solar power pie an &# billion market that is growing by more than a year "the race is on " says george scott who spent years in the solar industry and now runs a renewable energy consulting firm in england of course even if solar power explodes it wont replace coal as the primary source of electricity anytime soon "solar will only be a small part of the solution to global warming " says christian reitzberger who has invested in solar companies for apax partners but solars environmental contribution is considerable even if it provides only a fraction of the worlds electricity because it can kick in when demand is the highest usually utilities fire up old inefficient coal plants when demand is high invariably spewing out higher levels of greenhouse gases if solar were used at peak times instead the worlds energy grids would be cleaner and more efficient for years solar panels followed a standard design large blue or black rectangles made of silicon the panels which account for about of todays market do a decent job of making power converting anywhere from to of the suns rays into electricity depending on clouds weather and location but the high cost of silicon makes them far too expensive to compete with coal or gas with some states in the u s calling for programs to increase the use of renewable energy solar power is already growing rapidly here california has set up &# billion in incentives to spur solar power and gov arnold schwarzenegger is calling for solar in one million homes the u s congress is also debating a law to encourage renewable energy sources nonetheless most of the spending on solar installations is happening in europe where many governments have set up so called feed in tariffs that require utilities to buy electricity made from renewable sources at above market rates first solar inc the largest maker of next generation solar cells launched its product on the german market in and has signed major contracts for solar installations in the not so sunny climes of bavaria and saxony founded in phoenix ariz in and backed by a venture capital firm controlled by wal mart heir john t walton first solars "thin film" panels are relatively cheap because they use only of the costly semiconductor material found in conventional solar panels but engineers at the companys ohio plant struggled for years to get their manufacturing process to an industrial scale the method involves feeding a sheet of glass into a pressurized chamber filled with cadmium telluride gas which condenses in a thin uniform layer onto the glass "every time you fix one piece of the production line another part would go out of whack " says first solar chief executive michael ahearn first solar ended up spending &# million and six years to get it right far more than the initial plan of &# million over three years but its finally paying off revenue grew to &# million in from &# million in the company signed long term contracts with six european solar project developers totaling megawatts about the size of a coal fired power plant that are expected to bring in &# billion in revenue through the worlds biggest megawatt solar park is now being built in the saxony region by juwi gmbh using first solars thin film cells when first solar went public in june it was listed on the nasdaq at &# a share it closed at &# yesterday mr ahearns goal is for first solars panels to compete with fossil fuels even without government subsidies by as early as "its a big challenge certainly but its not a pipe dream any more " he says many other companies are also pursuing thin film solar cells which minimize the use of silicon or eliminate it altogether to drive manufacturing costs even lower nanosolar inc in palo alto has attracted &# million in venture capital for its method of printing solar cells on rolls of shiny foil the company spent two years researching how to make ink filled with nano particles of copper indium gallium selenide and another two years designing the manufacturing "the ink is basically the secret sauce " says martin roscheisen nanosolars chief executive q cells the second largest maker of traditional solar cells after sharp is taking a different approach to next generation solar technologies the company has bought invested in or developed joint ventures with four companies researching four different types of thin cell technologies pilot batches of the cells have been made and scaling up production of some should start this year says q cells chief technology officer florian holzapfel many in the solar industry are betting that the market will make room for products with different prices and efficiencies "what works for a solar array on a rooftop in tokyo wouldnt be the best choice for the desert in spain " mr holzapfel says corrections &amp amplifications christian reitberger invests in renewable energy and technology companies for apax partners a june marketplace article on the race to develop new solar panels misspelled his last name reitzberger wsj june
