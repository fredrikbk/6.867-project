detroit pursues sweeping cuts in union talks big cite wide cost gap with asian auto rivals threat to export jobs detroits big three facing their worst crisis in decades are seeking unprecedented concessions from the united auto workers union in a bid to narrow what they say is a &# an hour labor cost disadvantage against asian rivals like toyota motor corp and honda motor co auto executives say the unusually tough stance by general motors corp ford motor co and daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group marks their latest attempt to stanch heavy losses in their north american auto operations it also sets up a potential showdown with the uaw which has a year history of winning progressively richer contracts for its members as the two sides prepare for contract talks that start this summer in recent years the union has agreed to work rule changes and benefit cuts for its retirees designed to save the auto makers billions of dollars a year however uaw president ron gettelfinger who declined to comment on the coming negotiations has argued his workers shouldnt bear the entire cost of detroits restructuring the big three have talked tough before ahead of contract talks only to agree in the end to a costly labor deal this time around however people familiar with their plans say all three are united in believing they have no choice but to close the &# billion a year labor cost gap between them and their leaner asian competitors on cars and trucks built in the u s the three are also resolved to move jobs abroad if they cant bring down u s wage and benefit costs one industry executive says gm ford and chrysler have eliminated about uaw jobs over the past two years through buyouts and other means the three which currently employ about of the uaws active members say they pay union workers &# to &# an hour when wage health care and pension expenses are factored in by comparison according to big three estimates toyota and other asian auto makers pay &# to &# an hour at their u s plants which together employ about nonunion workers "we need to eliminate most if not all like " of the gap says a senior automotive executive involved in labor planning "it has to be gone by the end of the contract or doing business in the united states is unsustainable " all three domestic auto makers "will move investment in plants and people outside the country" if they dont bring u s labor costs in line with those of toyota and the other foreign auto makers the executive said detroits auto makers are in a more precarious position than at any time since the early s ford and gm are bleeding cash in north america and their debt ratings have sunk to junk status control of chrysler is about to be passed from german industrial giant daimler to private equity firm cerberus capital management llc which has profited by aggressively restructuring distressed companies the big threes competitive problems extend far beyond labor costs a point uaw bargainers have made in the past and will likely make again union leaders have said the auto makers should invest more in improving the quality and design of their vehicles the three companies allowed quality to deteriorate in the s a stumble that still haunts them by hurting their standing with consumers detroit also resorted to discount driven marketing undermining its profits and cheapening the image of its brands moreover the auto makers have been slow to respond to shifts in consumer tastes over the past two years a sharp rise in gasoline prices caught them with too much of their production capacity devoted to trucks and sport utility vehicles that got relatively poor mileage mr gettelfinger the uaw president has been maneuvering for two years to soften the potential blow to the unions more than active and retired members agreeing to mass buyouts some cuts in retiree health care benefits and moves to improve factory floor efficiency former and current union officials say mr gettelfinger prefers to make smaller less dramatic sacrifices that still add up to substantial savings concessions such as changing work rules to allow for outsourcing of jobs such as janitor or materials handler or restricting the amount of time a union worker can remain unemployed but on full pay in the industrys so called jobs bank such moves can save an auto maker tens of millions of dollars per plant in recent speeches mr gettelfinger has reiterated calls for the federal government to take over some or all of the auto makers health care burdens "the uaw believes it would be immoral and irresponsible to abandon the hundreds of thousands of retirees who helped build gm ford and chrysler we are simply not going to do that " he said in a speech earlier this month jerry sullivan president of uaw local at fords dearborn truck plant says his members know this summers talks will be all about trying to catch up with toyota "but closing that gap it will be very difficult " mr sullivan says "hopefully we can get something worked out thats why all the big minds are getting together to talk this summer " the big three argue that toyota honda nissan motor co and other foreign auto makers building cars and trucks in the u s and not the uaw set the industrys rate for labor this year more vehicles are expected to be built in the u s by non uaw workers than by uaw members for the first time in the unions year history according to csm worldwide uaw workers in gm ford and chrysler plants earn about &# an hour in wages roughly the same as the nonunion workers in the u s plants of toyota honda and nissan but the uaws generous health care plans and pensions for the hundreds of thousands of union retirees and their dependents more than double the total hourly cost by contrast the foreign owned auto plants in the u s havent been around long enough to accumulate significant numbers of retirees detroits labor costs are continuing to rise mainly due to rapidly increasing health care expenses according to an internal chrysler estimate the labor cost gap could grow to &# an hour by if nothing is done cutting total labor costs by anywhere close to &# an hour would be an unprecedented accomplishment for decades the uaw has won steady improvements in job security and benefits as well as wage increases of to per year four former and current uaw officials with knowledge of the unions thinking say mr gettelfinger wants to sign a new contract that among other things slows or stops the rapid decline of uaw membership the unions membership could sink below as a result of the tens of thousands of buyouts and early retirements gm ford and chrysler are now in the process of completing it had one million members in the uaw has made significant concessions to save jobs in other industries the auto makers are studying a six year deal the union reached with heavy equipment giant caterpillar inc in january which allowed the company to pay new hires between &# and &# an hour compared with &# and &# for previous hires uaw caterpillar workers must pay some of their health care costs for the first time and get annual bonuses but no raises over the term of their contract "a deal like the caterpillar contract would take out &# to &# an hour of that &# gap " said one senior automotive executive familiar with plans for the uaw talks detroit especially gm would like the three companies to merge their combined &# billion retiree health care obligation into a separate trust it would be partially funded by the auto makers but managed by the uaw a uaw official that has worked on national contract talks said the union is analyzing a similar trust that goodyear tire &amp rubber co recently created for its union retirees one of the unions lawyers dan sherrick negotiated a similar health care plan for the uaw a few years ago with engine maker navistar international corp the goodyear trust involved just &# billion in unfunded health care liabilities and goodyears steelworkers union had also previously agreed to inflation caps which the uaw hasnt by contrast the big three would have to come up with billions of dollars to fund such a trust the uaw would likely have to agree to accept just cents to cents on the dollar of funding for the trust to make economic sense for the auto makers one individual familiar with the process said see related letter "letters to the editor at ford quality was our motto in the s" wsj june corrections &amp amplifications the three u s auto makers current uaw wage costs of &# to &# an hour per union worker &# higher than wage costs of asian transplants such as toyota and honda includes the cost for retiree health care and pensions the retiree costs account for about of that &# an hour gap the rest is due to active worker wages benefits and other union negotiated issues a page one article thursday didnt say how much of the gap was due to retiree costs wsj june
