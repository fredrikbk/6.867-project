politics &amp economics bombing deepens fears in iraq attack on shrine comes as u s plan is at critical stage the repeat bombing of a revered shiite muslim shrine in iraq threatens to further inflame sectarian tensions across the country just as the u s led security plan enters a critical stage and the iraqi government struggles to forge key political compromises in near simultaneous blasts yesterday insurgents destroyed two minarets of the askariya mosque in samarra a place of worship that holds great theological significance for iraqs majority shiites the same mosque had already lost its landmark golden dome in a brazen attack in february that event mobilized shiite militias to retaliate against iraqs minority sunnis and unleashed tit for tat violence that displaced thousands of iraqis from their homes in mixed neighborhoods and left many dead in the hours after the explosions iraqis braced for more trouble and early reports indicated sporadic retaliatory strikes against sunni targets several sunni mosques were attacked in and around baghdad according to the associated press iraqs shiite dominated government imposed a curfew and ordered increased protection for religious sites while the countrys top shiite cleric ali al sistani called on iraqis to refrain from revenge the repeat strike against the already ruined samarra shrine left many iraqis angry at their government and at u s troops "we have a saying that you cannot be bitten twice by the same snake so its a shame on the government that this happened again " said jasim abu mohammed a year old shopkeeper in sadr city a massive shiite district of baghdad other residents there reported hearing rocket launches in what could have been retaliatory attacks by shiite militiamen fear of retaliation gripped residents elsewhere in the iraqi capital miles south of samarra "im now in a room with no windows because shooting is everywhere in my neighborhood " said araaz mohammed a year old sunni who studies computer engineering "i dont know what to do tomorrow im supposed to take a final exam in my college but because of the curfew i cant do it and im not sure if ill stay alive to do it " in the mixed baghdad district of sayidia some armed residents fanned out to prevent outsiders from entering and shot at two suspicious cars locals said ever since the u s led invasion in the city of samarra has been a battleground between u s troops and sunni insurgents which are a mixture of the sympathizers with saddam husseins regime and elements linked to al qaeda after last years strike against the shrine many promises were made to rebuild the dome but instead it sat in ruins guarded by iraqi security forces the americans usually dont provide perimeter security for places of worship because the presence of foreign soldiers near mosques inflames local passions after yesterdays destruction several iraqi police were detained indicating the possibility of an inside job the pattern of the attacks both yesterdays and last years suggests that insurgents could have slipped past the security cordon to place their explosives top u s military and civilian officials in iraq place the blame on al qaeda saying it was trying "to sow dissent and inflame sectarian strife " attacks by al qaeda militants including car bombs in crowded areas destruction of bridges and a recent suicide bombing inside the iraqi parliament have become among the biggest challenges to the u s led security plan higher numbers of american and iraqi security forces recently deployed in baghdad and some other areas have led to an initial reduction in sectarian violence but have so far proved ineffective in stemming attacks by sunni extremists these attacks in turn have raised fears that the shiite militias may lose patience and restart their campaign of sectarian revenge in earnest "despite the initial success of stepped up security measures in recent months the situation in iraq remains precarious " the united nations said last week the iraqi government is under rising pressure to pass measures deemed necessary to reconcile the sectarian and ethnic agendas these include adoption of laws governing the distribution of oil revenue among iraqs regions and the easing of sanctions against those tied to the baath party yet the iraqi leaders have been unable to deliver on the benchmarks causing growing frustration in washington instead factions of the iraqi government appear to be drifting further apart iraqi employees of the wall street journal in baghdad contributed to this article
