off the wall storage sites for art sigrid p thorne views the burgeoning art market which this month saw record breaking results in impressionist modern and postwar contemporary sales at christies &# million and &# million and sothebys &# million and &# million from a somewhat different perspective as chief executive officer and president of the fortress a fine art storage company with facilities in boston new york and miami she knows that all art buying results in objects that have to go somewhere and that "many collectors end up with more than they can fit in their homes " private collectors of art are the fastest growing segment of her companys business whose other client categories are museums corporations art galleries and individual artists and fine art storage is a growing segment within the entire self storage field an &# billion a year industry comprising more than storage facilities nationwide providing more than two billion square feet of space because of the value and fragility of art objects fine art storage differs from other forms of warehousing heat and humidity controls fire suppression equipment extra security both electronic alarms and actual personnel and trained art handlers and sometimes conservators and registrars on staff are common the price for all this can be high far higher by a factor of between five and than at a typical roadside storage facility ev stone president of jersey city n j based mana fine arts whose clients are principally art collectors and gallery owners notes that the average rental charge ranges from &# to &# a month but these clients have the money "typically they have two or more homes and may rotate artworks between these homes " she said "they may have spring and winter artworks that they rotate after that they just have more art than they have room for " certain collectors put their possessions in storage for short term periods such as while a house or apartment is being remodeled but a lot more is kept in storage for years ms stone added that some clients buy art "not for enjoyment" but purely for investment "the works dont even come out of the crate theyre just put into storage for years until the artists career develops and then theyll sell them " out of sight doesnt mean out of mind and it doesnt necessarily mean always out of sight either most fine art storage facilities have stylish gallery lighted exhibition rooms where pieces can be brought out and put on display for the benefit of curators scholars prospective buyers and even the owners "occasionally we bring clients to jersey city " said justin vandeursen assistant director of new yorks neuhoff gallery which works with "a significant amount of sculpture" that it cannot store on its premises and so relies on mana fine arts for some overflow about pieces at present "at the drop of a hat they can make works available for viewing " available for viewing doesnt mean that stored art gets looked at all that much "its stored in crates piled up on top of each other or next to each other and they have to be taken out of the crates very carefully and put on display and then put back into the crates very carefully " said adam lindemann a manhattan entrepreneur art collector contemporary african and oceanic and author of the recently published "contemporary collecting" taschen he adds that all that doing and undoing is an additional expense in storing his art "most of my art is in storage " he says and "i dont look at it nearly enough " museums are perhaps the largest square footage customers of the fine art storage industry "museums have a critical need for additional storage their basements can only hold so much " says ani rivera president of leverett mass based archival matters a storage middleman for museums private collectors and art galleries "storage is not a fashionable part of museum work exhibitions are " says mr rivera former collections manager at new yorks guggenheim museum when he started at the guggenheim in the museum rented storage space in five separate warehouses in manhattan and queens eventually relocating most of the stored pieces to one building the museum purchased in the west s of manhattan but even that wasnt enough more art just keeps coming in according to tim dietz vice president of the alexandria va based self storage association the industry began in rural and suburban america "clearing out stuff from the garage and making room for the car or clearing out a bedroom so someone could sleep in it " eventually making inroads into cities over the past quarter century fine art storage has been principally an urban affair and with it has come issues of environmental controls and enhanced security the self storage association has no industry definition of some of the terms individual facility owners use "climate controlled " "true humidity controlled " "museum quality controls" and mr dietz stated that "the courts are establishing the meaning of these terms " one of those courts the ohio court of appeals ruled in april that the owners of a storage facility in west geauga fraudulently represented their site as "climate controlled" to a man who found his stored furniture and collectibles damaged other lessons for the nascent fine art storage industry are equally hard won fine art storage sites and storage facilities in general tend to make the news only when catastrophe strikes in a fire consumed hundreds of contemporary paintings and sculptures at momart a fine art storage company in london that same year &# million in paintings were stolen from a now defunct warehouse in bridgeton mo in late there was a blaze at an artex fine art storage facility in dedham mass and sometime in or a gbp sculpture by anish kapoor disappeared from londons fine art logistics the fires at momart and artex began at connected buildings that spread to the storage sites newer fine art storage warehouses are built at a distance from neighboring structures the artex site also did not have a sprinkler system which its newer sites all have the growth of the fine art storage industry represents the art market in overdrive as artists keep on producing homeowners look to decorate more walls than they own and museums receive hundreds or thousands of donated items every year the oversupply of artists has created its own aesthetic in which one after another artist seeks to draw attention to himself or herself by being yet more outlandish creating art from chocolate shavings or "commentaries" on pornography or actual pornography or something else that briefly grabs a headline artists in eras past regularly created works that fit on most walls or on a table top if a sculpture and the overproduction of art seemed less troubling now with so many huge paintings room filling installations and new media creations artworks by sought after artists are destined more for the warehouse than for display museums certainly have the longest experience with the problem of too much art it has become axiomatic that great art or art by great artists will end up in museums the storage problem of collectors eventually becomes that of an institution unlike private collectors however who can simply stop acquiring more things or just sell off what they no longer want these institutions have boxed themselves in with a rule their associations have established all money earned from deaccessioning must go toward acquisitions as a result museum officials are only able to rearrange the overflow not solve it and on the home front moneyed collectors no longer view themselves as restricted by the four walls in which they live artworks move from a gallerys storage to a collectors storage rotated in like basketball players on the bench ours is a society whose answer to almost every problem is buy something and art has become yet another area of over accumulation for the wealthiest strata perhaps when future archaeologists seek to document the high culture of our times the most emblematic artifact they uncover will be the art crate mr grant is the author of "the business of being an artist" allworth
