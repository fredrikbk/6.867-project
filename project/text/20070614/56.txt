liberty echostar plot intelsat bid joint offer would set up unusual pairing of rivals looking to reduce costs liberty media corp and echostar communications corp are preparing a surprising joint offer for satellite communications provider intelsat ltd which is accepting final bids for its auction today according to people familiar with the matter the pairing represents a bold cooperation between satellite tv broadcaster echostar and media holding company liberty which is slated to take control of competing satellite broadcaster directv group inc in the coming months the two firms still could decide against making a formal bid intelsat is expected to draw bids of &# billion to more than &# billion according to people familiar with the auction the company already supports about &# billion in debt put on the company after a series of mergers and one time dividends paid to its group of four private equity owners if it succeeds the joint bid would create a highly unusual partnership between two strong willed rivals who run satellite to home broadcast systems that currently compete with each other but the two have been exploring ways to work with one another according to people familiar with their discussions their main goal is to reduce operating costs these people say and a substantial amount could be cut from both firms with an intelsat purchase the satellite broadcast segment is different from the satellite services business where intelsat is the industry leader intelsat provides wholesale capacity over satellites and its best customers are cable television providers the businesses rely on separate fleets ground facilities and capital investment schedules but there are similarities between the designs and technical details of the satellites used for both purposes last year echostar chief executive charles ergen surprised many on wall street by projecting an investment of more than &# billion to dramatically expand echostars satellite fleet with some of the proposed satellites slated to lease wholesale capacity federal regulators are bound to carefully scrutinize any such partnership partly because the cable industry traditionally has considered satellite broadcasters as archrivals when it comes to attracting subscribers the bid also could pave the way for closer ties between directv and echostar or possibly even lead to a merger proposal that consumer groups and other critics have long asserted would hurt consumers people familiar with the process said intelsats current private equity owners believe that because intelsat is in a different business than echostar and directv the joint bid doesnt pose antitrust hurdles under this argument cable operators would retain existing long term contracts for satellite capacity or they could switch to fiber lines as an alternative antitrust questions are likely to come up in the course of the auction which could conclude as early as this weekend private equity firm blackstone group which prompted the auction isnt expected to bid according to two people close to the process providence equity partners another private equity firm is expected to participate as well might a group of other players such as carlyle group and australias macquarie bank ltd according to people familiar with the auction but the most intriguing combination is clearly the liberty echostar group over the years mr ergen has repeatedly broached the idea of forming a limited joint venture between his dish network and rival directv in the past few months liberty chairman john malone and mr ergen have met several times to discuss ways to develop broader cooperation according to people familiar with the discussions including gaining access to additional satellites already in operation echostar liberty and intelsat declined to comment
