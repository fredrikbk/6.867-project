terrorist safe haven federal courts historically have been reluctant to interfere with the presidents efforts to protect the country in time of war judges have explained that they have little expertise in military and intelligence matters and are not well equipped to second guess the presidents decisions on how best to defeat the nations adversaries this judicial restraint appears to be a thing of the past after decades of criticism of the courts for failing to stop some notable wartime excesses such as the internment of the japanese during world war ii the pendulum is now swinging too far in the other direction fueled by the s rights revolution the post civil rights era celebration of judicial power and the suspicion and distrust of executive power and military authority after watergate and the vietnam war the federal courts now seem to feel far too comfortable rejecting actions that the national executive deems necessary to protect the lives of american citizens the latest example is the decision by a fourth circuit panel in the case of ali saleh kahlah al marri mr marri is a member of al qaeda who trained at osama bin ladens terrorist training camp in afghanistan in the summer of he met with khalid sheikh mohammed the mastermind of the sept attacks and then traveled to the u s just prior to those attacks to serve as an al qaeda sleeper agent the government believes he was intended to be part of a second wave of attacks on our country and was researching ways to disrupt the u s financial system after he was arrested the government searched his computer and found materials relating to chemical weapons jihad and al qaeda as well as credit card numbers the fourth circuit panel held that despite president bushs formal written determination that mr marri is an enemy combatant waging war against the u s he is instead a "civilian" who can only be treated as an ordinary criminal it did not question any of the facts put forward by the government about mr marri instead the court held that foreign terrorists on our soil are categorically beyond the reach of american military power what about the supreme courts decision in hamdi v rumsfeld just three years ago which accepted that we are at war and held that even u s citizens may be detained as enemy combatants according to the fourth circuit decision that case was different because yaser esam hamdi was fighting for the taliban carrying a gun on a traditional battlefield what about the world war ii precedent in ex parte quirin where the supreme court unanimously upheld the power of the military to try u s citizen nazi saboteurs who came onto our shores disguised as civilians to commit acts of terrorism that too was different according to the court because those terrorists were working for "the military arm of an enemy government " according to the fourth circuit decision unless you participate in actual combat against the u s on something that looks like a traditional battlefield or are allied with the armed forces of a foreign government you cant be an enemy combatant and the u s military is powerless to act against you at least on u s soil a mere al qaeda terrorist who is a member of a sleeper cell is like timothy mcveigh or the unabomber a civilian rather than a soldier and can only be treated as such by our government only the tools of criminal law enforcement are available never mind that the supreme court made clear at the outbreak of the civil war that president abraham lincolns decision to treat the rebellious citizens of the southern states as enemy combatants belonged to him alone "whether the president chooses to accord to them the character of belligerents is a question to be decided by him and this court must be governed by the decisions and acts of the political department of government to which this power was entrusted " the fourth circuit has now claimed the power to make that determination itself in the modern era some of our judges apparently feel comfortable that they know better than the president who we are fighting against and whose enmity and organized violence against us requires a military response the implications of this ruling are dramatic under it if mohammed atta had been apprehended on sept the military could not have taken custody of him and interrogated him and absent the ability to charge him with an ordinary crime under the u s code even the civilian authorities could not have held him for long the only option would have been for the police to arrest him and give him a miranda warning and a lawyer no pressure could have been exerted to extract intelligence that might have prevented the next days attacks and he would have been free to alert his confederates who were still at large planning those attacks and if the evidence against him had been obtained without a warrant come from a confession not preceded by miranda warnings or come in the form of a hearsay intelligence file from a cooperating foreign intelligence service whose assistance had to be kept secret there would have been no choice but to release him under the al marri decision the u s homeland becomes a relative safe haven for foreign terrorists on the global battlefield an out of bounds where the military cannot incapacitate them the courts ukase that people like atta are as a matter of law just a law enforcement problem takes us a long way back toward pre thinking it ludicrously misconstrues the authorization for the use of military force aumf passed by congress just days after the towers collapsed which plainly regarded the kinds of individuals who mounted the attacks as presenting a military threat and committing acts of war against us the idea that the aumf authorized the use of military force against the taliban who harbored al qaedas leadership but not the actual al qaeda terrorists who perpetrated the attacks simply makes no sense and the courts ruling ignores that al qaeda clearly regards itself as making war on us sending its holy warriors here not merely to transgress our laws but to attempt to destroy our nation and its global power the attacks were directed at the centers of american financial military and political might the balance of judicial control of executive action during wartime can never be calibrated perfectly as a nation we used to err on the side of too much presidential power and victory we knew that we could always correct our excesses and make amends for errors after the war was over and our constitution and values were once again secure with the ever increasing judicialization of warfare we now seem to be erring on the other side given who our enemies are what they want and what they are prepared to do to get it this new kind of error could prove far more costly mr berenson a washington lawyer was associate white house counsel to president bush
