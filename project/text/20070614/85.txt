running from rate storm defensive or cyclical stocks which will be the best bet as market volatility plays out bonds are driving the stock market right now so stock investors looking to profit from the rise in interest rates need to figure out what is going on in the bond market yields have risen quickly because expectations for economic growth which had been tepid suddenly got stronger even if they remain modest if the economy was growing strongly already then a boost in growth would have spurred inflation fears this leaves the economy and stocks in a sweet spot that should benefit cyclical stocks such as retailers and basic materials companies that gain from growth but investors should keep their eye on more defensive names such as drug companies and consumer staples like food companies later this year as higher interest rates could eventually slow the economy "the u s economy has really seemed to come out of the first quarter slump with serious speed " says bruce bittles chief investment strategist of robert w baird &amp co "but perhaps even more important the yields are being driven by rising rates globally " as higher interest rates start to bite defensive sectors such as consumer staples tend to stand up well in a slowing economy and big drug and health care companies "have done better in terms of rising rates and slower economies " said barry ritholtz chief market strategist at ritholtz research &amp analytics consumer discretionary stocks meanwhile tend to do worse because higher rates will take a bite out of joe and jane six packs wallet they will stop spending on things they dont absolutely need in this case companies like wal mart stores inc could suffer while personal products maker procter &amp gamble co could fare better materials and energy stocks are likely to perform well in a higher rate environment driven by inflation concerns according to research by riskmetrics a data research firm in new york that measured the impact of a half percentage point interest rate rise on the standard &amp poors stock index based on share prices of the past months the stocks in the materials sector which includes makers of chemicals paper and glass would have risen on average just more than while energy stocks would have climbed consider though if rates are on the upswing because economic growth is a lot stronger than people thought the move in the treasury market could be chalked up to a perception that inflation is heating up and discretionary consumer goods stocks should do just fine in fact a stronger economy means profits for consumer goods companies might continue to rise at a robust pace plus they will get an added boost from higher rates in the form of increased interest on all of the positive cash flow they generate that scenario has many investment strategists saying this interest rate rise is different from what has often been seen in the past "i dont think this is an inflation move this is a broader recognition that growth is going to be more ebullient than people think " said wayne wicker chief investment officer at vantagepoint investment advisors llc in that case some of the old thinking on how to play a rate rise might be dated take retailers they were "dead on arrival three weeks ago now theyre not " said james paulsen chief investment strategist at wells capital management who believes the move in treasurys is due to growth not inflation but makers of consumer goods which typically are seen as a safe haven when interest rates turn higher wont benefit as much from quicker economic and in turn earnings growth "if youre going to have a rise in rates with accelerated earnings defensives are the worst place to be " mr paulsen said if rates are higher because investors believe the economy is strengthening then cyclical sectors such as consumer discretionary and technology would benefit because they are typically buoyed by higher personal and corporate spending luxury retailers such as tiffany &amp co and consumer technology giant apple inc fall into this category along with medical technology firms and telecommunications companies "higher risk higher yield types of investments will benefit from higher interest rates as there is rotation out of bonds " says michael woolfolk chief currency strategist for north america at bank of new york "the nasdaq should do very well under these circumstances " big money center banks such as citigroup inc also could do well although they might benefit whatever the reason for the move in rates that is because banks see their profit margins improve when the yields are higher on longer term bonds than shorter duration investments allowing banks to borrow money from depositors at lower rates and lend it out at higher rates until recently banks were pinched because long term yields were less than shorter dated ones the catch in all this is that rising rates eventually will act as a damper on stocks that could initially benefit if the rise in treasury yields is due to stronger than expected economic growth "right now the fact that this is driven by stronger growth is a positive for the consumer " said wellss mr paulsen but nine months to a year from now those higher rates will have acted as a brake on growth and consumer spending could start to flag he added
