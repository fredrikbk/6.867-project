nattering nabobs revisited very strange bedfellows by jules witcover publicaffairs pages &# in his memoir "go quietly or else " spiro agnew richard nixons first and much vilified vice president recalls an unexpected social encounter "when i was in washington recently " he writes "having dinner with a few of my old secret service agents jules witcover came over to my table he is the author of two obviously biased anti agnew books witcover knelt alongside me at the table and whispered im sort of an agnew student ive written two books about you i know more about you than anybody else and id like to write the story from your viewpoint i burst out laughing every time i think of that incident after dipping his pen in poison to write two books about me witcover had the nerve to ask me to help him write another " nearly three decades later mr witcover is back for a third try the first "white knight the rise of spiro agnew" appeared on the eve of agnews fall a case of bad timing the second "a heartbeat away" was a postmortem on agnews resignation written with the washington posts richard cohen but it appeared on the eve of richard nixons own fall and was overshadowed by it another case of bad timing now agnew is safely immobile and so is his boss timing doesnt seem to be an issue like all great reporters mr witcover is persistent this time around he says he has gleaned new information on the nixon agnew relationship especially from the white house tapes that bob woodward calls "the gift that keeps giving " but the hitherto unpublished tape excerpts are sparse and come to very little mr witcovers interviews with former agnew staffers plow no new ground although a former staffer myself i was not among those interviewed there are lots of quotes from "the haldeman diaries" and other familiar sources still mr witcover breathlessly pursues his theme as if it too were not familiar nixon the quirky heavy schemes to replace his loyal vice president the man who had defended his president so doggedly during the antiwar protests of the early s for its dramatic arc "very strange bedfellows" relies on an extended marriage metaphor nixon is the spouse with a wandering eye agnew the cuckold and john connally the homebreaker to play the metaphor out mr witcover does not shy away from psychobabble cliche we are told that nixon saddled "with a galloping inferiority complex especially about his appearance and his awkwardness with manly men " had once fallen for the "tall erect and impeccably groomed agnew " in general nixon "seemed to question his own manliness " mr witcover writes thus nixon was "very impressed by big handsome and commanding males " along came connally a new republican in nixon was awed by "the dominant will and personality of the texan in whose presence nixon was reduced to schoolboy adoration " nudge nudge wink wink connally was thought to be the frontrunner to replace agnew whose resignation came in october amid mounting legal troubles until the job finally went to gerald ford mr witcovers analysis is less embarrassing though not more persuasive when he drops the creaky archness and tells us what he really thinks nixon and agnew he claims "launched a destructive demonization of liberalism and the american news media not long afterward that effort nurtured in turn a resurrection of the conservatism that had seemed buried in the ashes of the goldwater debacle and by the revival flowered in the election of ronald reagan and the era of neoconservative republicanism that followed " unless youre an unreconstructed s liberal with an absolute corner on virtue you may not immediately see what is so wrong with that but of course the indictment doesnt stop there mr witcover locates the origin of todays evils as he sees them in the campaign with campuses "in noisy revolt" and george wallace "adding racist fuel to the flames " the stage was set for nixon and agnew to cast themselves "as twin preachers of the politics of repression under the guise of patriotism " today mr witcover believes "echoes of the phenomenon reverberated in the tandem chorus of george w bush and dick cheney trumpeting another senseless war and the expansion of executive power in its pursuit " here then is the real reason for mr witcovers revisiting a tired subject a third time to argue that nixon and agnew foreshadow in their awfulness mr bush and mr cheney as spiro agnews chief speechwriter until his resignation and a member of richard nixons writing staff until his i obviously do not come close to sharing mr witcovers judgment or his politics i can attest though to the growing tension between the two men that mr witcover describes but even during agnews bleak last days in office he spoke no ill of his boss toward the end i sat down with him to talk at some length about his tenuous situation and about two important speeches that were coming up one in los angeles another in chicago give me good language about the achievements of this administration he told me and yes of this president as we rose to leave he said "play me some organ music john " did he feel some bitterness a measure to be sure but it was not excessive he summed it up in a letter written to me in two years before his own death "judy agnews wife and i will attend the nixon funeral tomorrow i have never fully been able to forgive the abandonment in but i have enormous respect for his accomplishments " historys verdict on nixon so far seems to be closer to agnews respect than mr witcovers caricature mr coynes most recent book co authored with linda bridges is "strictly right william f buckley jr and the american conservative movement " published by wiley
