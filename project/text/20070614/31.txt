ericsson aims deeper inside india china biofuel help easier financing are part of pitch for more mobile business swedens telefon ab l m ericsson is targeting more business in india and china two of the worlds biggest and most lucrative mobile phone markets in part by pitching biofuel power solutions and offering easier financing terms to extend infrastructure to rural reaches in china ericsson is hoping to maintain its dominance as new developments in the fast growing telecommunications industry begin to shape the market and in one indian region it is helping operators use local crops like cotton and fish oil to power phone transmitters in areas beyond national electricity grids outside chinas major cities less than of the population has mobile phones and in india where of the people live in rural villages that mainly lack a mobile network less than of the population owns a mobile phone earlier this week ericsson chief executive carl henric svanberg chinese president hu jintao and wang jianzhou chief executive of china mobile ltd the countrys largest mobile phone operator by subscribers reached a &# billion deal to supply telecom network equipment in regions in china in india ericsson the worlds largest wireless equipment maker by sales looks set to pick up the majority of an estimated &# billion contract with indias third largest mobile phone company bharat sanchar nigam ltd despite motorola inc s attempts to defeat the deal in indian courts mr svanberg says china with million mobile phone subscribers is expected to double its telecom market by while india is expected to have million users by though analysts believe western rivals alcatel lucent and motorola might be losing market share to ericsson in emerging markets ericsson faces a challenge from home grown equipment makers including huawei technologies co based in chinas southern region of shenzhen last month huawei said it was targeting growth in overseas revenue in to &# billion mr svanberg who since joining ericsson in has helped turn the company around from near bankruptcy to a net profit of billion kronor &# billion last year is undeterred having already captured a market share in chinas gsm mobile phone market mr svanberg says ericsson has the power to compete with aggressively priced chinese rivals gsm or global system for mobile communications is the most popular mobile phone standard in the world and is often referred to as second generation or g mobile phone technology "india and china today have more minutes of use on g phones than the whole of europe does because theres no fixed line telecoms " says mr svanberg in the pune maharashtra region of india ericsson is working with mobile operator idea cellular ltd and the gsm association an industry body to develop biofuels using local nonedible crops that can power mobile phone transmitters in areas beyond the reach of the national electricity grid ericssons mobile handset joint venture sony ericsson in which japans sony corp has the other stake also is targeting rural india and china in the past two months sony ericsson has inked contracts to supply phone distributors china postel mobile communications equipment and shenzhen telling communications corp deals valued at &# million and &# million respectively in february sony ericsson also unveiled four low cost handsets aimed at mobile phone customers in emerging markets richard windsor a london based telecom analyst at japans nomura says ericsson has also been using its working capital to help many growing operators fund projects although it isnt providing a loan as such ericsson is agreeing to longer payment terms on many of these projects giving operators more time than many european operators to pay for services and infrastructure mr windsor says that while ericsson rival nokia siemens networks is gaining some ground in india the majority of its business comes from siemens ags former relationship with operators in the region the finnish german joint venture has developed village connection a product it claims brings affordable voice calls and text messaging to rural villagers that can afford to spend only &# to &# a month in comparison ericsson is grabbing share from alcatel lucent in the emerging market gsm sector says mr windsor and the company currently is installing a new base station every minutes in india alcatel lucent which has posted two profit warnings since its creation through a merger late last year said in may that revenue declines in its wireless business were largely driven by low volumes especially in g gsm radio in some emerging markets however it said it had increased its market share in china it declined to divulge actual market share or figures for india motorola declined to give market share figures on india or china but said it was experiencing strong growth in the middle east and africa in china ericsson faces two potential threats while the majority of chinas mobile phones now operate on gsm networks the government and china mobile are testing a homegrown version of third generation or g technology known as td scdma which differs from the common standard being adopted across europe and north america ericsson has only a roughly share of the total td scdma contract zte corp and huawei are among the local vendors that picked up a large part of the deal nomura says there is a significant risk that td scdma can become the dominant technology in china and if this happens ericsson wont have the cost advantages it has in other mobile technologies reaching out ericssons agenda in china and india india  million subscribers largest subscriber base after china and u s subscriber growth million per month largest managed services market in the world china
