politics &amp economics how palestinian authoritys survival is imperilled with gains in gaza hamas could force a greater schism jerusalem escalating factional violence in the gaza strip is raising questions about whether the palestinian authority can survive what may be a total split in control between the two palestinian territories the rupture has wider regional implications since the authority the palestinian quasi government remains central to efforts to create an independent palestinian state that is at peace with israel yesterday fighters loyal to islamist faction hamas appeared to be on the verge of gaining military control of the square mile coastal strip which is home to almost million palestinians hamas which leads the palestinian authority had been working in a tense coalition with its rival faction the secular fatah movement headed by mahmoud abbas by last night news reports from gaza and witnesses said hamas fighters had systematically wrested control of most major fatah positions in gaza hamas denied reports that prime minister ismail haniyeh had agreed to a truce with mr abbas saying the two were in preliminary talks only "it seems the political horizon for hamas is seizing control of the ground in gaza " said mouin rabbani a middle east analyst for the brussels based international crisis group an independent think tank mr rabbani said he saw virtually no hope of a political solution soon he said it remains unclear what hamas would do if it wins complete control in gaza how the fatah organization might respond or what the international community or israel might do "no one has seriously thought about what comes next " mr rabbani said israel and western governments including the u s have been allied with mr abbas and fatah while u s rivals syria and iran have close ties to hamas a hamas military victory would be a blow to the bush administration which remains opposed to the islamist group and has supported fatah after hamas won a surprising victory last year in parliamentary elections that the white house advocated the bush administration led a global campaign to economically and diplomatically isolate hamas washington then seized on a more aggressive tack leading efforts that have been coordinated with israel and the bush administrations arab allies to build a well trained and well armed cadre of fighters under mr abbas the latest round of fighting follows israeli news reports that an american general serving as a security adviser to mr abbas wanted israel to allow a major new shipment of arms and munitions into gaza for fatah the u s has strongly defended its push to strengthen fatahs security forces saying it was necessary to boost the authority and security of mr abbas state department spokesman sean mccormack described the surge in violence in gaza as an effort by hamas to take over gaza and undermine "any sort of political accommodation within the palestinian political process " on tuesday hamas offered fatah fighters two hours to clear out of their security offices in gaza declaring that those who remained would be potential targets more bloodshed loomed following a similar ultimatum yesterday in which hamas gave fatah fighters until tomorrow night to relinquish all of their weapons hamas television yesterday evening showed some of mr abbass men attempting to flee gazas southern border crossing with egypt other images featured caches of what it said were american made weapons seized by hamas fighters after clashes with fatah fighters the fighting leaves in tatters the agreement by the two palestinian factions to share power and work together in a unity government the coalition was formed in march following similarly bloody fighting and the intervention of saudi arabias king abdullah from the beginning the biggest dispute in the formation of the coalition was over who would control palestinian security forces hamas appears to be trying to settle that issue with force fatah has said it wont officially participate in the coalition until the fighting stops a senior fatah security official said yesterday that hamass military positions in gaza didnt necessarily mean that the group was gaining real power "controlling buildings does not mean they control the people " said the senior official who spoke only on the condition of anonymity he added that "no military force could control million people " this official and others worried about permanent damage to the palestinian authority which is supposed to be the backbone of a future palestinian state "we need to make a strategy " the fatah security official said "because we are the mother of the baby and we have no choice maintaining the authority should be the priority " total control of gaza by hamas could create a permanent rupture of authority with the west bank where fatah is stronger and israel maintains a strong security presence nabil amro a senior adviser to mr abbas said he was telling the palestinian president to dissolve the coalition government declare a state of emergency and somehow find a way to reassert authority over gaza "there is no horizon for continuing the partnership" with hamas mr amro said but he also acknowledged that gaza was now largely in the hands of hamas "this is what we see now and whats happening but politically we cannot declare this we cannot give up on gaza " he said neil king jr contributed to this article
