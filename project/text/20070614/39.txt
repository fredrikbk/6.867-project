fda weighs shift in safety checks on food imports risk based system to focus on products posing biggest hazards washington the food and drug administration is likely to propose a major shift in how it inspects and regulates imported food as americans continue to devour vast amounts of imported and sometimes exotic food the goal is to shift to a "risk based" system under which fda inspectors using extensive information would focus on shipments posing the biggest potential hazards to do that the agency could collect more data from overseas on how foods are produced and handled called "life cycle" data and feed it into a database for its inspectors under the new approach countries and private businesses including foreign manufacturers importers and u s manufacturers using imported ingredients might be required to provide the fda with more information about the production packaging and transportation of imported foods currently critics say fda inspectors are expected to block tainted imports but often get little information indicating which imports might be dangerous over the past years the number of imported food items has tripled while the fdas food budget has stagnated as a result only of food imports are physically inspected "the shift is to be more proactive to put more focus on prevention " said david acheson the fdas assistant commissioner for food protection who is working closely with fda commissioner andrew von eschenbach on a new plan to improve safety of both imported and domestic food details arent settled but dr acheson said he expects to propose a safety plan in the next two months the plan which hasnt been finalized is likely to include several elements from a fda blueprint that has been lying dormant in the agency for five years according to current and past fda officials michael doyle director of university of georgias center for food safety said it would be "a major step forward" if the agency adopts the risk management approach and converts to up to date screening and testing technologies as originally proposed in the plan "it sounds like the strategic plan is whats needed for the evolving situation that we see with the rapid increase in food imports " he said "the longer the fda waits to reorganize itself in addressing the issue of the day the more difficult it will be for the agency to catch up to the problems of the future " the fdas moves come as congress and the bush administration are debating how to improve the safety of both imported and domestically produced food amid the importation of contaminated pet food and tainted toothpaste from china earlier this year the fda in the wake of last years e coli contamination of spinach recommended tough regulations on the u s fresh produce industry but was rebuffed by its parent agency the department of health and human services now under fire for not moving aggressively enough to protect the food supply the administration seems to be more amenable to taking steps to beef up safety the import strategic plan details of which werent made public at the time called on the agency to move to a risk management approach in which products from countries with mixed or subpar safety records would get closer scrutiny the idea was to "enable fdas inspectors to focus their inspections on the highest risk shipments while facilitating importation of safe and secure products " says benjamin england a co author of the plan and former regulatory counsel at the fda mr england a lawyer at jones walker in washington now operates a consulting firm fdaimports com the agency would spend little time worrying about products from countries considered to have strong food safety standards such as britain and canada and focus instead on products and countries with less stringent regulatory standards such as china said william hubbard a former associate fda commissioner who was involved in drafting the plan any comprehensive retooling of the fda import policies would require approval from the hhs and the white house and increased funding from congress the cost of the plan was estimated at &# million a year according to former fda officials dr acheson declined to provide updated figures the plan is one of several approaches being discussed inside and outside the fda to improve food safety in congress some democrats such as illinois sen richard durbin and connecticut rep rosa delauro have renewed a push for a single food safety agency currently federal agencies including the fda and the agriculture department administer as many as laws dealing with food safety last week four house democrats led by energy and commerce committee chairman john dingell of michigan urged the fda to consider banning all food imports from china if the agency cannot vouch for their safety the import plan could have better prepared the fda for food scares for bulk imports for example the agency would get a broader picture "that covers the products history from raw materials through production transportation to the u s manufacturer or producer if there is one storage and to the ultimate consumer " according to a annual report by the fdas then commissioner mark mcclellan dr mcclellan who left the agency in march said the agency had hoped to implement the plan but the agencys budget which rose after the terrorist attacks soon declined "if the additional level of resources had continued we did intend to carry on with the plan " dr mcclellan is working with mr hubbard and other former fda and hhs officials as well as industry and consumer groups to get more funding for the fda through coalition for a stronger fda dr mcclellans successor lester crawford said he didnt propose the plan to hhs or the white house but said there wasnt a policy decision to stop the program the agency he says was preoccupied with the implementation of the bioterrorism law and had to deal with the dwindling resources "the plan was never killed it just never got there " said mr crawford "its the layers of approval you need momentum to do that " this time many believe the momentum is present in the past three months some chinese made products such as wheat flour frozen fish and toothpaste were found to contain toxins wheat flour contaminated with the chemical melamine was reported to kill thousands of cats and dogs and ignited a massive product recall ontario based pet food company menu foods income fund said the recall cost it at least &# million not including legal settlements and future sales declines
