refugee scandal every day iraqi civilians are killed on the streets and in their homes by insurgents and many of them are targeted for a simple reason they have either worked for or have some other connection to the u s government as a matter of policy the u s has officially opened the door for many of these civilians by offering them refugee status here but in practice that door has been effectively closed this became increasingly clear recently when the state department revealed how many iraqi refugees were allowed into the u s during the month of may that count stands at precisely one in april the u s also admitted just a single iraqi refugee meanwhile from baghdad at nearly the same time that the state department was releasing its may figures came ominous news two iraqis a husband and wife team who worked for the u s embassy in baghdad were killed a statement on the internet made clear why "the swords of the security personnel of the islamic state in iraq are with gods grace slitting the throats of crusaders and their aides and lackeys " following a barrage of criticism in the media and on capitol hill in february the bush administration announced that up to iraqi refugees would be allowed to enter the country this year there is of course a backlog of iraqi refugees waiting to be admitted to the u s so the administration might have quickly increased the number of new refugees admitted but the number actually fell from in february to just eight in march the department of homeland security which has recently received the files of iraqis waiting to be processed announced on may that it "is poised to approve the applications of nearly iraqis " but even these numbers are disappointing it turns out that dhs is promising to expedite just cases for a total of people refugees plus their families set aside whether dhs will actually deliver on this promise and the numbers are still bleak just iraqis have gained entrance into the country over the past eight months do the math there are applications left to grant between now and the start of the new fiscal year on oct dhs must pick up the pace undersecretary of state paula dobriansky recently wrote on these pages that people such as the couple killed in baghdad "served the cause of freedom with dedication and honor they saved countless american and iraqi lives and because of this are often targeted by insurgents " she is exactly right among the iraqi refugees i met in the middle east earlier this year many worked for u s military or american companies they had great letters of commendation from their former american bosses and great hopes to be among the admitted to the country in istanbul a father of two small boys showed me medals and diplomas from the u s military for which he worked as an interpreter in damascus a mandaean christian told me how close he was to dying when the u n headquarters was attacked while he was a security guard there in amman a technician who used to install satellite dishes for gis showed me a death threat and told me his brother had been killed and in beirut a former soldier of the free iraqi forces told me that hes terrified that local islamic militias will learn that he served as an intelligence officer for the americans and will capture and torture him he asked me to help him hide his u s issued id which authorized him to carry an ak a pistol and a satellite phone the lives of these men and their families are now in shambles because of their previous service to the u s and none of them has been told theyre on the short list to be let into the country and even if they were even if iraqis were admitted by the end of september this would still be very few the administration could have authorized more than three times as many admissions for it had slots for refugees out of a total of that were not allocated to any geographical area plus allocated specifically for the middle east in the first eight months after the end of the vietnam war at the direction of president gerald ford the u s government and the u s armed forces facilitated the movement to the united states of over south vietnamese refugees some would say there are too many differences to compare iraq to vietnam but similar exoduses have happened before hungarians fleeing soviet tanks in and cubans escaping from fidel castro in came in droves more recently bosnians running from ethnic cleansing in the balkans came in larger numbers than we are now allowing for iraqis so when secretary of homeland security michael chertoff says that "americas tradition of welcoming international refugees is unrivaled" he may be right historically speaking nowadays however what is unrivaled is the abyss between his rhetoric and the admissions granted by his department and this makes it harder for america to win its battle for hearts and minds in the middle east ms husarska is senior policy adviser at the international rescue committee
