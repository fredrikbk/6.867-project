two new operas two troubled title heroines anna karenina opera theatre of saint louis tomorrow and june on the surface these two new operas have a lot in common thomas pasatieris "frau margot " commissioned and performed by the fort worth opera and david carlsons "anna karenina " now playing at opera theatre of saint louis florida grand opera gave the world premiere in april are based on linear traditional storytelling and scored with lyrical neo romantic music they feature big roles for dramatic soprano incidentally both title heroines end up drug addicted and insane and tackle themes of infidelity and redemption neither hits the jackpot but "frau margot" comes closest in a welcome break from the current rash of "great books" operas "frau margot" has an original story a creative riff on a tale that leonard bernstein once related to frank corsaro the operas librettist and director bernstein was one of many composers who sought permission from alban bergs widow to complete his opera "lulu" helena berg told him that she would consult her husband about it through a seance permission was denied mr corsaro built this intriguing tidbit into a tidy plot ted the young composer conductor gets the job and is drawn into the life of frau margot the widow a retired opera singer she tries to re create her past through him as well as through her laudanum induced trances but ted falls for kara margots young companion this turns out to be a repeat performance for kara was the composers student and his mistress margot goes mad and poisons kara with laudanum mr pasatieri was a prolific opera composer until when he moved to los angeles and began orchestrating film scores the music of "frau margot" is lush and voluptuous studded with big romantic arias duets and ensembles all admirably set for voices and the orchestration not surprisingly is unusually skillful and effective still the three act opera three hours with intermissions needs to be tighter and creepier mr corsaro and mr pasatieri give too much weight to the developing love story as well as to a couple of comic interludes a barbershop quartet of waiters and an in joke aria about aged divas for walter margots admirer and her husbands publisher this open hearted material upstages the obsessed margot immured in her mausoleum of a house and does not sufficiently foreshadow the final tragedy mr corsaros production did well with that foreshadowing however using still projections and video as he did in his iconic versions of "the makropolos affair" and "die tote stadt" at new york city opera he conjured both the period and the thriller like film noir quality of the piece alison nalder designed the sets steven bryant the costumes matt frey the lighting and peter nigrini the video the excellent cast centered on lauren flanigan in the title role ms flanigan can be inconsistent but here her soprano sounded healthy and gleaming and her performance was frighteningly intense especially in her mad scene where she confesses her crime in a splendid climactic moment baritone morgan smith and mezzo patricia risley sang passionately and had nice chemistry as ted and kara mr smith wittily channeled a hint of the young leonard bernstein bass baritone daniel okulitch inspector osterland and tenor allan glassman walter admirably rounded out the cast joseph illick was the effective conductor for "anna karenina " mr carlson and his librettist the late colin graham who was also to have directed the opera had to distill a sprawling russian novel for the stage they narrowed it to the two central love stories anna who leaves her martinet husband karenin for the dashing count vronsky and the innocent romance of the idealist levin and his beloved if flighty kitty but the two act three hour score felt endless nonetheless a kind of spark notes precis with the emotion left out in this version karenin is a sympathetic figure and vronsky an underwritten cipher annas rush for freedom thus makes little sense and both the development of the anna vronsky affair and its final unraveling along with annas addiction to morphine are dramatically unclear the opera tells us about things such as annas love for her son rather than making us feel them mr carlsons score which is for the most part blandly lyrical and rhythmically unvaried doesnt add depth lots of duets among the many characters feel very similar and big set pieces dont come off one scene at a horse race bore an uncomfortable resemblance to the "ascot gavotte" from "my fair lady" though the composer does create occasional heat to evoke annas passionate nature some of his vocal settings took the excellent kelly kaduce into impossibly high territory undercutting his intent and the final redemptive epilogue after annas suicide in which the virtuous kitty and levin contemplate the value of life closing with a big major chord seems tacked on a philosophical musing better left behind in the novel stage director mark streshinsky who took over the project when mr graham died in april went a bit overboard on the melodrama with characters too frequently flinging themselves to the floor in despair neil patels bare bones set an inner and an outer turntable usefully changed the numerous scenes but looked a lot like a lazy susan robert perdziola designed the many attractive period costumes mark mccollough did the lighting like ms kaduce the rest of the accomplished cast did their best with the material christine abraham was warm as dolly annas sister in law sarah coburn was bright voiced and youthful as kitty of the competing bass baritones christian van horn came off better as karenin than robert gierlach did as vronsky brandon javonovich was a sympathetic levin and william joyner captured some of the fecklessness of stiva annas brother the english diction was particularly good over all stewart robertson was the capable conductor but even he could not dispel the operas longueurs ms waleson writes about opera for the journal
