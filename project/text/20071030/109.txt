some no brainer savings ideas the recent mortgage loan crisis has exposed the dark side of predatory lending practices but it may also help bring to light a potentially larger issue not only are americans making poor choices when it comes to loan deals but too many americans are making poor choices or no choices at all to prepare financially for retirement the average social security benefit is about &# a year it is meant to supplement retirement not fund it altogether yet half of all families have no other savings in retirement accounts people who do set money aside are not putting away nearly enough half report savings of less than &# there are many reasons why household savings are so low but sheer inertia plays a role many americans simply dont make the choices needed to prepare for retirement those who do take the time to consider their choices find the decisions too complex and complexity translates into nonparticipation and poor financial decision making there is a way to harness the power of inertia the automatic k in which workers are enrolled by default in a k unless they opt out one year after the pension protection act of helped smooth the way by clarifying some of the laws the evidence shows that automatic k is working according to a survey of employers nationwide by wells fargo &amp co reported using automatic enrollment and according to a survey of k and profit sharing plans by the profit sharing council of america of employers automatically increased the contribution rate for employees in more than twice the number previously what does automatic enrollment mean for employees the retirement security project launched by the pew charitable trusts estimates that a year old male professional will save an additional &# through automatic k enrollment and escalation by age enough to fund an additional eight years of retirement the success of automatic enrollment in k s has policy makers looking for other ways to utilize the same "default" approach to help employees increase their contribution level gradually over time invest prudently and preserve their retirement benefits through rollovers at the time of job change to help the million workers who dont have access to an employer sponsored k a bipartisan group of legislators led by sens jeff bingaman d n m and gordon smith r ore and reps phil english r pa and richard neal d mass have introduced a bill to create an automatic ira this would be a standard ira account but funded through payroll deductions it would also offer automatic k like features such as an automatic investment choice level of contribution and enrollment under the proposal employers with or more employees that have been in business for at least two years would enable employees to save their own money in an ira by using the employers payroll system the automatic ira allows employers to facilitate employee saving without having to sponsor a formal erisa regulated retirement plan or make matching contributions firms would receive a temporary tax credit to offset any initial administrative costs either the employer or the employee could choose which financial institution would hold the money the retirement security project estimates that the automatic ira could increase ira participation rates significantly from the current rate of one in and could ultimately increase net national savings by nearly &# billion annually the next step is to use the same automatic mechanisms to enable workers to have the security of a guaranteed lifetime retirement income with annuity like products employees could either have annuities built into their retirement savings programs perhaps by directing the employer match into them or be strongly encouraged to convert all or a part of their savings upon retirement a conversion of savings into annuities could be phased in over time or it could be accomplished on a trial basis that the retiree could reverse if he or she chose or it could be in the form of "longevity insurance" that does not begin until say age or so the key is to make the process as easy and seamless as possible we have learned through hard experience that financial education although important is not enough it has to be accompanied with procedures making it easier for workers to make appropriate decisions just as the automatic k and automatic ira would help to ensure that employees have enough retirement savings automatic guaranteed lifetime income would help to ensure that they do not outlive their savings ms tyson is a professor of business and public policy at and

oct commentary "some no brainer savings ideas" by laura dandrea tyson should have stated that a pew retirement project estimated "that a year old male professional will save an additional &# through automatic k enrollment and escalation by age enough to fund an additional four years of retirement " wsj oct
