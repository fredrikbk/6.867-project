wrinkles no blotches yes a skin therapy shows results cosmetic lasers and other devices touted for skin tightening yield unpredictable results researchers say but amid the confusing claims one technology is emerging as a reliable way to improve skins appearance pulsed light skin doctors largely agree that pulsed light can get rid of freckles brown spots and broken capillaries that give skin a mottled appearance pulsed light by combining wavelengths heats and destroys pigmentary changes including the flushing associated with the skin condition rosacea patients are predominantly women in their s and s but more men are getting treated especially those with red blotchy faces who are "embarrassed" that people think they are heavy drinkers says vic narurkar an aesthetic dermatologist at the bay area laser institute in san francisco pulsed light was introduced in the u s in by a predecessor of israels lumenis ltd the inventor shimon eckhouse says he coined the term "intense pulsed light " or ipl the name is trademarked but has spread into wide usage lumenis has perhaps two dozen u s competitors today and more around the world the technology is generally considered safe but patients can be burned by a poorly trained technician those with dark skin need to be particularly careful and some may not be candidates for treatment doctors say treatment can leave patients with a slightly red face for a day or two the effectiveness of pulsed light to treat aging skin is backed by human tests but the studies like those for most medical devices are small compared with those for new drugs product makers typically do only as much research as needed to meet food and drug administration requirements which are generally less rigorous for devices than for drugs the real test of a devices effectiveness say many doctors is in the marketplace where pulsed light is proving to be successful "weve done about treatments in this office over the last seven years far more than anything else except maybe botox " says dore j gilbert a cosmetic dermatologist in newport beach calif referrals are "patient driven which means its working " he says pulsed light is the fastest growing aesthetic device category says michael moretti president of medical insight inc an aliso viejo calif market research firm many scientists and doctors had panned ipl when it hit the market the technology is less sophisticated and cheaper to make than lasers "many doctors looked at ipl and said this isnt a step forward its a step backward " says dr eckhouse who adapted technology used in military and commercial applications such as food sterilization but while lasers focus an energy beam on more specific targets pulsed light has been shown to destroy a broad range of lesions the first step in a so called ipl photofacial is to wipe off makeup or sunscreen most dermatologists use a topical anesthetic for to minutes then a lubricant is applied to make it easier for the physician or nurse to glide a hand piece over the skin the eyes of the operator and patient are protected from the bright diffuse light that flashes as the device is fired dr narurkar says he typically does two passes over the entire face with the second in a perpendicular direction to the first patients receive one to six treatments spaced three to four weeks apart each session takes to minutes some studies show results can last as long as five years but many patients return regularly dr narurkar says he charges &# for the first session and &# for each subsequent one prices at the high end of the range but around the country its not unusual for a course of treatment to cost &# medical insurance doesnt pay for it pulsed light isnt very effective against wrinkles though some patients see improvement dr gilbert who trains other physicians says he instructs them not to tell patients that pores will get smaller or that fine lines and wrinkles will disappear "you dont want patients to think youre a snake oil salesman " he says email healthjournal wsj com
