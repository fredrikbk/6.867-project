airlines and ual corp s united airlines airlines have long lavished attention and effort on the new york to los angeles route its the commuter line of movie stars and money moguls one of the most heavily traveled airline routes and often one of the most profitable too small wonder that airlines give los angeles new york flights prestigious flight numbers like flight and small wonder too that so many airlines have tried to compete over the years flying between the nations two largest cities trans world airlines began nonstop flights between los angeles and new york in and since then many airlines people express mgm grand air tower air jetblue and america west just to name a few have tried to wedge their way in among the big carriers most however have failed but virgin america has deep pockets and long term dreams it is already attacking cross country markets from a california base from san francisco and los angeles virgin now flies to new york and washington the airline also flies from san francisco to both los angeles and las vegas roxanne kimmel who works for a los angeles ad agency and flies to new york about once a month was won over by virgins entertainment system on a flight in early october "i watched a movie i ordered food and listened to radio " she said "im going to use this airline a lot " other travelers have had more of a mixed experience david seidler a hollywood writer paid only &# to get to new york and while he loved the price he was less thrilled with the cheese and crackers snack he bought for &# and the &# fee on virgin to check his second bag "if they keep their prices down and the quality of their service up they will make inroads " said mr seidler while competitors have matched prices offered by virgin they havent dumped a bunch of flights in virgin markets trying to vacuum away customers american and jetblue airways corp have each added a few daily trips between new york and california since virgin launched southwest airlines co which decided recently to return to san francisco international airport after pulling out a few years ago decided to add seven trips a day between san francisco and los angeles starting next month united has built up a bit too at its san francisco hub carriers say markets are strong and so the added service they profess isnt a direct response to virgin "if were adding its because markets are performing well " said john tague uniteds chief revenue officer southwest says it is ready for battle too the airline has daily flights in california and "were in it for the long haul " said brad newcomb senior director of marketing at southwest the big move back into the los angeles san francisco route southwest already has dozens of flights up and down the california coast from oakland burbank and other airports is simply to "provide customers as much choice as possible " he said jetblue may actually have the most to lose since it is the airline most like virgin america a well financed start up with discount prices a high quality product focused around in flight entertainment and heavy reliance on transcontinental traffic a jetblue spokesman said the airline is "continually reviewing our product and investigating options for enhancing our onboard experience " one area jetblue believes it still has the upper hand is legroom vital on long flights jetblues all coach cabin has half of its seats at inches of "seat pitch" the space from a point on the seat to the same point on the seat in the next row and half at inches virgins coach seat pitch is inches thats something fredda weiss noticed when the person in front of her reclined her seat on a virgin flight the seat back was almost in her lap she said making the entertainment system screen hard to see and the trip uncomfortable "all the high tech may be impressive on first glance but it pales in comparison to a more comfortable space " she said competitors fought virgins launch probably harder than any other start up in u s history the u s department of transportation forced virgin to reorganize its structure to comply with u s airline ownership laws that prohibit foreigners from having more than of the voting control of a u s airline despite the battles and current high fuel prices fred reid virgins chief executive said the companys launch has gone "very very well " virgin says it filled more than of its seats in august and while passenger loads have fallen once summer ended they have been better than the company expected "we want to have a national presence and we want to be in all major markets eventually " mr reid said the airline has had some glitches with its web site and in flight entertainment system but new antennas on planes should help improve reception over the rocky mountains for example virgin plans to add more food and beverage choices later this week and plans to experiment next year with some high end food offerings for sale despite skepticism about the new airline mr reid said virgins u s controlling investors are sophisticated patient and tenacious and are in the airline business for the long haul big legacy airlines will be around a long time he said but new entrants will continue to grow and continue to shake up the marketplace and give travelers more choice "this juggernaut is not going to be stopped " he said
