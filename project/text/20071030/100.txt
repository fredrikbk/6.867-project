protectionism and the falling dollar reactions to the dollars relentless decline have been mixed some think of the dollar as an instrument of government policy and believe that a cheapened dollar protects the u s from foreign competition others assert that movements in the dollar are a natural result of market forces my work places me among a third group of observers who see the dollars decline as unnatural and dangerous the value of the dollar measures market confidence that the government will preserve the purchasing power of its debt hardly a question that should be left unanswered or delegated to markets to guess a fall in the dollar is the first in a familiar sequence of closely connected and undesirable events the steps in this process not necessarily always occurring in exactly the same order include substantial rises in the prices of gold and other commodities increasing inflation a bear market in bonds capital outflow from the u s economy financial uncertainty a decline in the investment performance of equities fed rate hikes and flattening economic growth in todays world currency movements are directed in large part by protectionist sentiment granted protectionism is no longer so much a matter of tariffs or quotas for specific industries usually its a unified effort to cheapen the dollar relative to foreign currencies so that its hoped u s exporters will gain a price advantage or overcome a price disadvantage belief in this theory lives on despite its preposterous implications if we could make the dollar completely worthless the logic goes domestic producers would wipe their foreign competitors off the map and the u s economy would take over the world the fallacy is that international prices are set by competition and habitually compensate for currency changes as many countries have found out the end result of allowing the value of a currency to depreciate is hyperinflation and economic collapse as in weimar germany in the s and in zimbabwe today nevertheless too many people believe that whats good for exporters must be good for the whole economy the fact that exports underperform when the economy grows best and outperform when the economy grows least does not sway them and as long as the u s treasury and congress continue to telegraph their desire for a cheaper dollar markets will allow the dollar to depreciate the touchstone for protectionism in the u s is the trade deficit historically when the deficit has widened the foreign currency value of the dollar has declined when the deficit has narrowed the dollar has risen congressional intolerance for the deficit has been growing throughout this decade and this year it appears to be spinning out of control protectionists are focused on china because of the sheer size of the bilateral deficit with the chinese they export to us five times as much as we export to them nothing like such a ratio has been seen since the mid s when japanese exports to the u s exceeded its imports from the u s by a factor of three and "japan bashing" was in vogue in washington to their credit the chinese have consistently declined to cooperate with the u s desire to try to shift the terms of trade against them by depreciating the dollar or so relative to the yuan as a result pressure on the dollar to decline has been diverted to other currency markets where resistance has not been so strong and that may explain the current dollar decline but now european central bankers are beginning to complain its hard to argue that the overall economy is suffering so much that it needs protection a sustained slowdown has long been feared but is yet to appear consumer spending is growing despite the housing markets troubles and the unemployment rate remains historically low so what is all the fuss about its probably the same old political problem that results from all economic progress some parts of the country are hurt by globalization even as the economy as a whole is boosted perhaps politicians are also in awe of chinas growth they may still be shell shocked by the speed with which our bilateral trade deficit widened after the chinese economy began to be reintegrated with the free world more than a decade ago for whatever reason the bush administration led as tradition decrees by the treasury and the congress with new york sen charles schumer at the fore are aggressively pursuing a dollar cheapening policy with china principally in their gun sights most presidential candidates including the democratic front runners have signed on the markets responding to all of these political voices are pricing the dollar lower and lower its a myth that deficits are created by currency misalignments they are driven by the business cycle in the late stages of a u s business cycle expansion as now exports traditionally outgrow imports and the trade deficit narrows as a result when that occurs the dollars foreign exchange performance tends to improve with a delay of about a year symmetrically after u s imports grow faster than exports the dollars foreign exchange performance tends to deteriorate although you dont hear it from the press u s exports have now been outgrowing imports for two years a multi year decline in the exports to imports ratio bottomed in at final data for the second quarter of show a ratio of about back to where it was five years ago from mid to mid exports grew while imports grew our bilateral exports to imports ratio with respect to china has also been rising that stabilized back in and is slowly increasing the trouble is that politicians look at trade "gaps" rather than ratios and the trade imbalance between the u s and china is so huge that exports have to outgrow imports for quite a long time before the deficit narrows its ironic that because economic vitality keeps imports growing it also fuels protectionist sentiment the fervor with which politicians are still intent on cheapening the dollar can be traced back to the economys strength protectionism is a political and intellectual virus that attacks the soundness of a currency even in the midst of economic health unless it is checked but there is no one on duty in washington who is willing to perform that role so its too soon for trade deficit mania to calm down quite yet the economy is still sucking in imports conditions for a sustained rise in the dollar have been created only quite recently but they are there now it should be only a matter of time before protectionist politicians turn to more urgent matters and the traditional cyclical upturn in the dollar reappears mr ranson is head of research at h c wainwright economics inc
