catholicstore com also encourage buyers to put the statues in the house "we dont advocate burying " he says "some of those statues are quite beautiful " catholic leaders also say that faith and devotion are necessary in addition to burying a statue otherwise the practice amounts to little more than superstition or magic but they are also enjoying the saints newfound popularity "if they have a good result and they think it was st joseph it might inspire them to practice more " says msgr connell once someones home sells the custom holds the statue should be dug up and put in a place of
