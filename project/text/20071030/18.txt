business technology best of the business tech blog excerpts from recent entries at wsj coms tech blog why apple ads tout iphone for both home and office apple inc s new ad campaign features real people describing how they use their iphones for work and personal reasons and these people dont appear to have asked the tech departments permission in one ad an airline pilot brags that he was able to avoid a three hour delay by looking at a weather forecast with his iphone when he saw it was clear at his destination he persuaded air traffic control to let him take off this raises another question is the state of air traffic control so poor that a pilot with an iphone has that much influence another ad ends with this quote "with this phone i can accomplish every single area of my business that no other phone has ever been able to do and it makes me a better businessman and a better artist at the same time " that should erase any doubt that apple is positioning the iphone as a business tool but apple doesnt seem to be counting on information technology departments to embrace iphones the marketing strategy at least the one evident from the ads is to appeal directly to individuals and get them to start using the device for work once the business benefits become evident this will strike a familiar chord in many workplaces where employees are already doing an end run around the tech guys just as the line between work and life is blurring for many workers the tech that they use in the different realms is blurring as well rather than restrict themselves to the tools that the it department issues people are using instant messaging and web based software if they think it makes them more productive it departments hate it but workers often arent deferring to them anymore beware hot tech werent we supposed to have jetpacks by now that question comes to mind whenever we hear about a "game changing technology" that years later hasnt changed a thing the latest tech to earn this inglorious distinction rfid that is radio frequency identification tiny computer chips that were supposed to be on every razor blade and carton of milk by now rfid adoption rates are dropping which is hard for a technology that hardly anybody used in the first place proving again that it is best to approach heavily hyped technologies with caution rfid "tags " as the bar code like labels are called were supposed to revolutionize logistics instead of having to scan every bar code by hand businesses could slap an rfid tag on a product place it in the vicinity of a scanner and all the information about the product what it is where it was shipped from when it expires would be recorded automatically the promise was so great that just three years ago patrick duparcq a professor at purdue university forecast that the total market for rfid would reach &# billion by and that the cost of each rfid tag would be five cents today rfid tags still cost around to cents each and because companies would need to buy millions of them to reap the full benefit "its difficult to build a business case for using rfid " says bob lieb a professor at northeastern university mr lieb who has just completed a study of logistics providers found that only of these companies customers the people who need to ship and track stuff have so much as committed to using rfid at some point in the future thats down from last year only of companies are conducting rfid pilots also down from last year it isnt just price holding rfid back the technology doesnt work as well as it is supposed to rfid is supposed to automate that task of reading bar code information but it needs to be effective for it to make sense unlike a hand held bar code scanner there is no human around to know that an rfid scanner missed a read tom mckenna a vice president at penske corp says that scanners only read about of the rfid tags in his companys pilots "you need a breakthrough on the dependability " he says strike out jargon terms like "solutions " "robust " and "leverage" arent just meaningless they are harmful they intimidate people who arent familiar with information technology at best causing them to stay quiet when they should be asking questions and at worst preventing them from taking an interest in it we thought we knew the chief culprit pr people there is at least a handful of buzz words in most press releases but maybe pr people arent to blame we recently received this email from a pr professional "i share your hatred of common marketing terms even as im forced by my superiors to use them " and the other day a different pr person told us this doozy "i once edited the word seamless out of a press release the client called me up and protested if we dont say its seamless how will people know its seamless "
