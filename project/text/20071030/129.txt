why rate cut isnt a sure thing bowing to market pressure could prolong dilemma for feds policy makers the market is convinced the federal reserve will cut interest rates tomorrow but for the fed itself it is a closer call the behavior of financial markets implies near certainty by investors of a quarter point cut in the feds key short term interest rate but for policy makers the decision is between the quarter point reduction and no cut at all a half point cut is unlikely to get serious consideration from fed officials though some in the market expect it both courses of action have risks perhaps the biggest is that the markets certainty that rates will be cut creates a burden on the fed to deliver ordinarily meeting market expectations isnt a goal in itself for the fed but the current environment is more fragile than usual and thus the consequences of disappointing the market are potentially more damaging against that the fed will have to weigh the risk that a cut will stoke inflationary psychology the fed can mitigate the risks on either front with its accompanying statement no rate cut could be accompanied by a statement opening the door to a future cut a cut could be accompanied by a statement damping expectations of more reductions "i would guess market expectations would be the deciding factor " said lou crandall chief economist at wrightson icap a research arm of icap a money market brokerage mr crandall doesnt expect a cut citing the risk that doing so would prompt investors to expect another in december putting the fed in the same bind on the other hand he said if the fed thinks it will cut eventually market expectations may nudge it to do so now rather than later he said on sept the fed cut its target for the federal funds rate charged on overnight loans between banks a larger than expected half a percentage point to since then market expectations of what the fed would do at its two day meeting that ends tomorrow have swung wildly analysts views moved in tandem j p morgan chase originally called for a quarter point cut then revised that to no cut on oct as stocks hit new highs and unemployment insurance claims remained low then "everything turned against us " said economist michael feroli housing data and financial markets weakened and in speeches fed officials didnt counter rate cut expectations on oct the firm again said the fed would cut of dealers surveyed by dow jones newswires agree failure to deliver could cause credit markets to weaken and stocks to dive mr feroli warned "i think it will be ugly " as of yesterday the implied probability of no change was according to options data analyzed by the federal reserve bank of cleveland the probability of a quarter point cut was and of half a point cut the case for remaining on hold comes down to the economic forecast while housing data has deteriorated further there is little sign so far that it has spilled over to the broader economy fed officials dont appear to have significantly altered their forecast of a return to moderate growth next year helped by last months rate cut many market interest rates have come down stocks have recovered from their swoon two weeks ago while inflation concerns have receded they havent disappeared especially given the dollars drop some officials may argue that at the federal funds rate is still high relative to underlying growth and inflation but the biggest argument for cutting rates will be market expectations fed officials didnt intend to nudge the market to expect a rate cut so they will have to weigh the possibility that markets are signaling a more pessimistic view on growth and credit markets than the fed sees the fed can use other tools to influence reactions to its rate action if it cuts the accompanying statement could damp expectations for more by suggesting the risks to growth have receded it could go the added step of saying the risk of weaker growth equals the risk of higher inflation if it stands pat the statement could keep a later cut on the table by stressing continued risks to growth or market stability fed officials are weighing issuing more forecasts and could do so at this meeting perhaps for release with the minutes three weeks later a forecast would provide context to the feds decision
