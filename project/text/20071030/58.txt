huckabees statement on schip carbon tax john funds view of my and a half year record as governor of arkansas and my vision for americas future "another man from hope " editorial page oct calls for me to set the record straight its important to note that every living republican in arkansas who has been elected to either a statewide or a federal office has endorsed my candidacy im grateful for their support and proud that in i received the largest percentage of votes ever received by a republican gubernatorial nominee in arkansas and that arkansans re elected me to another four year term in november i am even prouder that throughout my tenure as governor and lieutenant governor of arkansas i campaigned tirelessly for countless republican candidates for the state house and federal office and even helped get some elected as governor i pushed through the arkansas legislature the first major broad based tax cuts in state history a &# million tax relief package for arkansas families led efforts to establish a property taxpayers bill of rights and created a welfare reform program that reduced the welfare rolls in the state by almost we also doubled the standard deduction to &# for single taxpayers and &# for those who are married in total i led the fight to cut taxes and fees more than times during my years as governor saving the people of arkansas almost &# million when i left office arkansas had over &# million in state surplus one of my proudest achievements was signing legislation creating arkids first creating health insurance coverage for more than arkansas children who otherwise might have gone without i am firmly committed to finding a way to provide health care and a better education for americas children who hold the key to our nations future unfortunately there seems to be a serious misunderstanding about my schip comment at a recent presidential debate i was not criticizing president bushs veto as a matter of policy but as a matter of politics i fully believe that mr bush should have negotiated a compromise and not let it get to the point of a veto mr bush indicated he was willing to spend more than the &# billion he originally proposed but less than the &# billion the democrats pushed through so there was clearly room to negotiate in no way do i support spending an additional &# billion or moving two million children from private insurance to government insurance or letting schip be a step on the path to socialized medicine i believe that we must be good stewards of our environment and support many paths to reducing our emission of greenhouse gases such as more nuclear power and alternative sources of clean energy as part of our overall effort i also support a cap and trade system which has worked well for reduction of sulphur dioxide emissions however i do not agree with those who want all allowances to be auctioned off because i believe that will create too great a burden on businesses the alternative to cap and trade is a carbon tax which i dont support it is difficult to fully understand the institutional challenges of a republican running for office in arkansas in when i was elected lieutenant governor i was the fourth republican to be elected to statewide office since reconstruction students of arkansas politics should talk to former u s senator tim hutchinson u s rep john boozman or former rep jay dickey all of whom support my candidacy for president but none of whom is cited in mr funds commentary about these challenges nevertheless running for election and re election and more importantly governing in an overwhelmingly democratic state prepared me to climb that next mountain running for president and leading america with an optimistic vision and solid plans to successfully confront the complex challenges we face today mike huckabee presidential candidate former governor of arkansas little rock ark see related letter "letters to the editor arkansas tax burden" wsj nov
