for those about to pretend to rock this holiday season brings a face melting showdown between music videogames the biggest and loudest battle in the videogame business this holiday season could turn on a simple question who can rock the hardest the battle will be fought with controllers shaped like guitars drum kits and microphones in a category that has become a gold mine thanks to the huge success of guitar hero a game that makes players who cant play a lick feel like virtual rock stars this past sunday guitar hero iii legends of rock the latest version of the activision inc game hit stores featuring a new wireless guitar controller for jamming along to original recordings of pearl jams "even flow " guns n roses"welcome to the jungle" and other axe heavy tunes but the title which has dominated the music games category will now face a formidable new competitor named rock band which goes on sale next month instead of one instrument for controlling the game the game has four a guitar bass microphone and drums to better simulate the thrill of being in a music group although many analysts believe guitar heros reputation will be hard to overcome this holiday season rock band has two major assets behind it the creative team that made the original guitar hero harmonix and the deep pockets of viacom inc s mtv which acquired harmonix last year the music games genre has found an immense audience by stretching the boundaries of what videogames are there have been more than million copies sold of the earlier versions of guitar hero in the u s since the games first installment was released two years ago for total sales of &# million according to npd group inc guitar hero has also successfully tapped into new audiences partly by avoiding the mayhem thats common in many games activisions own research shows that of the users of guitar hero are first time players of game consoles including many musicians guitar hero iii and rock band share a similar concept simulating a sense of creative participation in the music the games score players on the precision with which they hit color coded buttons that correspond to visual cues that flash on their tv screens in synch with songs users dont technically "play" the musical notes with their instruments but if they dont hit the right buttons on their controllers the songs dont sound right as users play the games show computer animations of rockers strutting on stage to further convey the mood of a performance guitar hero was the brainchild of alex rigopulos and eran egozy the founders of harmonix cambridge mass the two who had previously worked in the computer music group at the mit media laboratory conceived the game as a way to help players reconnect with a desire to make music an impulse most people give up because of the difficulty of playing musical instruments says mr rigopulos the current face off between guitar hero iii and rock band follows a split between harmonix and the music game they created last year redoctane inc guitar heros publisher and owner of rights to the brand was acquired by activision of santa monica calif for &# million mtv later that year acquired harmonix for &# million seeing in the deal a way to blend its legacy in the music industry with videogames a form of entertainment its young viewers are highly savvy about with mtv behind harmonix mr rigopulos says the team finally had the resources to make the music game they had always wanted with rock band he says "theres this feeling of synchronicity of people locking in " that feeling comes at a price though rock band will cost &# to &# depending on the game console a user has for a bundle that includes the game drums a microphone and an instrument that can be played as either a guitar or bass a steep sum for a single game guitar hero iii is priced at &# to &# for a bundle that includes the game and guitar most games which typically dont come with specially designed controllers cost &# to &# analysts predict rock bands price and lower brand recognition gives guitar hero a good chance of significantly outselling the mtv game this holiday season "i think right now the cost is too great for most people " says michael pachter an analyst at wedbush morgan securities predicting that rock band could narrow the gap next year activision executives believe guitar heros emphasis on a single instrument will give it more mass market appeal while rock band might pull in more hard core players with its multi instrument focus rock band players can also play the game with a single instrument if their friends arent around "were supremely confident about what will transpire in the next days " says dusty welch head of publishing at activisions redoctane but rock band can rely on the full promotional power of mtvs music themed cable channels including mtv vh and cmt in one of the most aggressive marketing campaigns yet for a videogame mtv plans to pull out all the stops to build awareness among its viewers of rock band weaving the game into its programming mtv values the promotional time at &# million rock band will be set up in the home of the participants of mtvs "real world" reality television show in mid november there will be a "battle of the bands" competition shown on mtvs trl music video show pitting two groups of gamers that were selected during a cross country tour vh has even done a spoof documentary in the style of its "behind the music" series called "rock band cometh the rock band band story " which chronicles the antics of a fictional band that plays the plastic instruments from the game "it was really easy to figure out how to create awareness heat and buzz on our music networks " says van toffler president of mtv networks music and logo group while guitar hero is entrenched in the category executives at electronic arts inc the games publisher thats distributing rock band on behalf of mtv say rock band has the benefit of the talent that created the original guitar hero "you have to ask which is the cow and which is the milk " says david demartini vice president and general manager of ea partners "i think harmonix is the cow " rock band and guitar hero iii will both come with greatly improved music most of the songs in previous versions of guitar hero were covers of rock songs which somewhat diminished the authenticity of the experience in contrast most of the songs on rock band and guitar hero iii are master recordings by the bands that made the songs famous both games will allow players to purchase and download extra song packs from the internet among the musical additions to the new games are the rolling stones which contributed "paint it black" to guitar hero iii and "gimme shelter" to rock band metallica licensed two of its best known songs "one" and "enter sandman" for use in guitar hero iii and rock band respectively marc reiter who works for q prime the firm that manages metallica says the band was previously approached to license its music to games including guitar hero but never agreed because makers only offered flat fees instead of royalties based on sales with rock band and guitar hero iii the game makers finally agreed to grant royalties mr reiter says metallica is happy about the decision since a couple of them play guitar hero as do their families and fans "we felt we were remiss in not being in there " he says
