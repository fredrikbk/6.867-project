politics &amp economics fred thompsons southern strategy bypassing iowa and new hampshire on the road to the white house concord n h fred thompsons cameo appearance here yesterday to register for the ballot and formally open his state headquarters was only his second visit to this early primary state since he declared his candidacy for the republican presidential nomination nearly two months ago he was gone by evening mr thompson has been similarly parsimonious with his iowa travel time a fact not lost on kingmaking locals the perceived snubs may seem shortsighted but the candidates time management fits squarely into his broader plan for winning the nomination rely on the early voting southern states of south carolina and florida "in most of the polls were ahead in south carolina or a strong second even though weve invested almost zero resources at this point we view that as a solid opportunity for us " says bill lacy mr thompsons campaign manager mr thompsons "red state" focus could have a particular payoff if the nomination comes down to a delegate count competition since the party gives extra weight to states that voted for president bush in or elected republican governors and members of congress most of those states lie in the south the midwest and the rocky mountains "our polling shows us that we tend to do better in those three areas particularly in the south " mr lacy says "that has to do with who fred is wheres hes from and has to do with some of the baggage that mayor giuliani and gov romney have from being from new york and massachusetts and having more liberal records " he adds thats a reference to mr thompsons two biggest rivals former new york mayor rudy giuliani and former massachusetts gov mitt romney its not a conventional presidential strategy to play down iowa and new hampshire candidates who have tried skipping them generally havent fared well and mr thompson said during his visit yesterday that hes planning on spending enough time and money in new hampshire to at least make a respectable showing before the vote heads south at a visit to a dental insurance company here mr thompson told about a hundred employees that he intended to campaign in the granite state "early and often" and that while "i havent bothered you yet" with advertising he soon would after formally filing his candidacy papers he faced pointed questioning from the local media which hasnt seen him in over six weeks asking how he expected to win if he wasnt going to campaign there he said hes planning to run an "aggressive" campaign in new hampshire and "well be back here shortly " his aides said they expected him to return to the state in the next few weeks but couldnt give a timetable mr thompsons more natural base is in the south as one of two southerners in the race he is counting on his accent as well as his social and economically conservative views to appeal to voters there his chief regional rival former arkansas gov mike huckabee has gotten favorable reviews for his debate performances but lags far behind in fund raising he had &# in the bank as of the end of september compared with &# million for mr thompson "everything he stands for is really what south carolina is all about " says gresham barrett a south carolina republican congressman who has endorsed mr thompson noting the candidates longstanding opposition to abortion tough stance on immigration and fiscal conservatism south carolina will be the fifth state to choose delegates for the republican convention after caucuses in iowa and wyoming and primaries in new hampshire and michigan voters in south carolina are scheduled to head to the polls jan floridas next days later before the big onslaught of feb states mr thompson received support in the latest south carolina poll according to an insider advantage survey of republican primary voters conducted in early october he had a five point advantage over his rivals messrs giuliani romney and mccain while mr thompson is more focused on south carolina than iowa or new hampshire hes not spending as much time or resources there as his main rivals so far this year mr romney has visited south carolina times and mr giuliani eight according to national journal which tracks candidate visits mr romney and mr giuliani have both been there twice just since mr thompson entered the race according to their campaigns mr thompson has visited south carolina just twice since entering the race the second time last week for one day where he made three public stops before flying to alabama for private fund raisers each of the leading republican candidates brings their own problems to south carolina though mr thompsons may be the easiest to fix the biggest rap against him has been about his low energy speeches and lethargic campaign schedule mr thompson counters that hes running the race his own way and told reporters yesterday that he needed time to raise the funds necessary to run ads and field a competitive campaign his competitors face other obstacles despite backing from leaders at the evangelical bob jones university mr romney still faces distrust from some christian conservatives wary of his mormon faith the decision by pastor don wilton former president of the south carolina baptist convention to recant his romney endorsement didnt help both mr thompson and mr giuliani have acknowledged that they dont attend church regularly but mr giulianis efforts to defend his position on gay rights gun control and his pro abortion rights stance remain an issue "mayor giuliani has problems with some of the issues on the right while a fiscal conservative hes not a social conservative " says randy page executive director of south carolinians for responsible government a nonprofit that has lobbied for school vouchers he has endorsed mr thompson but even mr page says his candidate needs to spend more time in state "south carolina is a very relationship state they like to see and feel and touch their candidates " he says mr thompson recently did spend four days in florida visiting seven cities and rolling out his first big policy initiative on immigration it was his second trip to the state since he announced his candidacy yet his decision to speak for five minutes to a gathering of party officials and activists a few weekends ago after spending &# for the opportunity confused some party leaders messrs giuliani romney and mccain spoke at much greater length and he lost out on the endorsement of collier county sheriff don hunter just two days after the two men met while mr thompson was rolling out his new immigration plan mr hunter endorsed mr romney instead
