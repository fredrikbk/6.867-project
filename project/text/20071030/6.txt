attack of the superbugs one of the early morning television news shows recently staged a live feed from a suburban maryland high school it was the latest to close after a student contracted a virulent and drug resistant bacterium called methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus or mrsa pronounced "mersa " its become this seasons equivalent of shark attacks every day bringing new terrifying reports although the dangers of such bacteria are hardly new researchers working at the centers for disease control and prevention reported this month that nearly americans died in from mrsa and about were infected doctors have been reporting for years that mrsa was cropping up with alarming frequency the same is true for other bacteria in rochester n y doctors recently reported nine children stricken with a strain of the bacteria that causes ear infections streptococcus pneumonia that was resistant to all antibiotics commonly used to treat the condition the real news isnt that these bugs exist but how woefully unprepared we are to deal with them as we make progress in fields like cancer we are taking a u turn on bacteria despite advances in drug development the bugs have increased their iq nearly as fast as research outwitting our medicines efforts have turned to preventing bacterial spread and clamping down on antibiotic prescribing theres no question that poor hospital hygiene overuse and sometimes misuse of antibiotics contribute to educating bugs at our expense but preventative efforts alone wont solve our bacterial challenges what we need most are better diagnostic tests and new medicines this is high stakes science but the pipeline isnt promising since just new antibiotics have been approved by the the food and drug administration only two of which work in fundamentally new ways only new antibiotics are in development inside big drug companies compared to an average of more than a decade ago since leaving the fda this year as its deputy commissioner ive advised a few biopharma firms making antibiotics and the venture investors supporting them regrettably however many big drug makers have followed the lead of eli lilly a pharmaceutical company that once pioneered antibiotics only to exit the business entirely the problem theres not a lot of payoff for developing drugs aimed at infections first they last only days or at most weeks limiting sales and the better the drug the more likely doctors and hospitals are to keep it on the shelf as a last resort most hospitals require that doctors get special approval to prescribe the best new antibiotics in that regard whats good for public health isnt necessarily good for antibiotic development capricious regulation is another problem adding to uncertainty and in turn the cost of development for drugs targeted to many common bacterial ailments the fda historically required so called non inferiority trials this meant a new antibiotic needed to prove it was generally no worse than existing treatments in order to win regulatory approval otherwise conducting trials to prove a new antibiotic was better than a sugar pill placebo or superior to existing drugs would require huge trials and in some cases was simply unethical if it meant asking patients with potentially serious infections to risk treatment by placebo that changed just last year when a handful of fda reviewers became miffed that companies would get drugs approved through these non inferiority trials without proving the new drugs were better than older medicines and then market the new drugs for broad upper respiratory indications the reviewers brought their complaints to congress which has since leaned on the fda at one point asking the government accountability office staffed with lawyers and policy analysts to opine on the nuanced scientific question of non inferiority trial design the political intrigue has pushed the fda to raise its approval bar in some areas jettisoning the non inferiority approach for some ailments while leaving a mess of uncertainty for many others so how do we surmount these obstacles to get the drugs and diagnostic tests we need to stay ahead of aggressive bacteria like mrsa first we need to recognize that developing drugs aimed at super bugs is not an ordinary pharmaceutical business and requires unique incentives if public health policies compel doctors to hold the best new antibiotics in reserve we need to compensate with incentives for developing those niche drugs one way would be to clarify the rules under the orphan drug act to include drugs that target resistant bugs that law provides special incentives for drugs that treat rare diseases including patent protections and streamlined regulatory review the fda needs to create better opportunities for companies to target not only conditions such as pneumonia or skin infection but also specific bacteria like multi drug resistant staph the fdas guidance on other aspects of antibiotic drug development is similarly murky due in part to fluid standards congress recently had to write into law a demand that the fda produce guidance on antibiotics for acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and acute bacterial sinusitis finally released yesterday merely issuing documents doesnt guarantee clarity and one of the fdas recent documents on an aspect of antibiotic development ran several pages saying little the fda should collaborate with the infectious disease society of america idsa to develop meaningful guidelines that provide clear pathways to new drug development the idsas credible voice could also buttress the fda against the maneuvering of a handful of staff who take their views to politicians when they lose internal scientific debates finally we badly need better tools for rapidly detecting resistant infections in blood even screens for bacterial genes today it can sometimes take days to discover that a patient is infected with a resistant bug if there were better diagnostics similar to the "rapid" strep test bacterial infections could be distinguished early and doctors could treat patients with confidence drug companies could also more easily develop drugs targeted to specific bugs conducting clinical studies aimed at specific pathogens and making sure the right patients got the right drug early in the course of their illness when drugs can make the most difference but the diagnostics business has been a lower margin affair for many years steering product developers into other fields there are complicated reasons for this but medicare has systematically tried to drive down prices for diagnostic tests often refusing to pay for new tests altogether in turn the big companies that make the tests committed a fundamental mistake early on by adopting a strategy of charging lower prices for the throw away test kits and premium prices for the platforms they run on a reverse of the old razor blade model the big diagnostic companies figured they would make most of their money off the platforms theyre regretting that now the strategy may have worked if they had continued to innovate but now many of the best ideas for new tests are coming out of small firms that have little ability to sell their own big platforms and a hard time premium pricing diagnostic tests in a market conditioned by the big firms to expect cheap razor blades most existing antibiotics are as old as the earth screened out of nature where they resided doing battle with bugs for centuries we need to accelerate this evolution in our laboratories public policy mistakes are partly to blame for creating this inhospitable environment for new development and it will take a concerted effort to improve it the only sure way to stay ahead of bacterial evolution is by escalating this arms race dr gottlieb a practicing physician and resident fellow at the american enterprise institute was previously a deputy commissioner of the food and drug administration see related letters "letters to the editor superbugs are dangerous but we are not powerless against them" wsj nov
