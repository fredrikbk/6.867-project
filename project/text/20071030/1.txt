a wider web to find their niche firm looks to pair news outlets ads with smaller sites in the blog world donklephant com is nearly unknown but that hasnt stopped the political web site from getting advertisements from the likes of at&amp t alamo rent a car and netflix the ads which pepper the site run next to full length stories from major news organizations including the associated press united press international and mcclatchy donklephant gets both the news items and the ads from a closely held company called voxant which is one of the bigger players in an important segment the business of helping both news organizations and big web advertisers gain a presence on small sites that are influential among niche audiences several web firms broker the distribution of news on the internet but most focus on getting that content onto sites with heavy traffic such as huffingtonpost com or newsmax com voxant by contrast offers news videos text and photos from major outlets such as the ap and the british broadcasting corp to nearly small web sites nearly all of these small sites have registered fewer than half a million visitors since they started donklephant says it has had only visitors this month that makes the site too small to have its monthly traffic measured by firms like comscore it is rare to find entire stories from major news outlets on smaller web sites and those licensing deals have allowed voxant to attract the interest of online ad networks including broadband enterprises and doubleclick the network that google has agreed to buy such networks which purchase ad space for their clients are on the lookout for highly targeted ad buys in areas like entertainment sports and politics many advertisers and content companies including news organizations believe that these smaller web sites are an underexploited slice of the internet analysts estimate that while the top web sites get roughly half the traffic on the internet in the u s the other half of the traffic is divided among thousands of sites such as donklephant advertising flows disproportionately to bigger sites because most advertisers dont have the time to scout out the smaller niche sites or to police those sites to make sure the content doesnt get too edgy for their tastes a number of advertisers are leery about social networking sites and arent completely comfortable with sites that post user generated content "theres a huge lack of high quality inventory to sponsor " says michael shehan chief executive officer of online video ad network spotxchange a unit of booyah networks which has run ads for the film "" and for companies like suntrust banks on voxants network of niche web sites voxant has a team of researchers who spend much of their time searching for obscure web sites in areas like sports entertainment news health and business it has a separate team of people who monitor those sites for offensive language or images sites that violate voxants decency policies or those of its clients are quickly pulled off the roster says voxant ceo jeffrey crigler news outlets are recognizing the value of getting their content onto a wider array of sites "our traditional model is to license feeds to established publishers " says jane seagrave vice president of new media markets for the ap "but in fact there are a lot of people who are publishing blogs and niche publications online that want a few stories a few videos its hard to reach that market by yourself " a handful of companies are trying to fill the middleman function that voxant provides but the reston va company is one of the few that has struck deals with about publishers including the ap bbc and the wall street journal a unit of dow jones when a web site decides to embed a news story from voxant voxant and the news provider each receive of the revenue the web site receives the other the news organizations can scan a voxant web site to see an updated list of sites where their stories appear and can block their content from being seen on certain sites advertisers using voxant can specify a target demographic type of content and time of day among other criteria voxant tracks click through rates and says it hopes soon to be able to track how often viewers buy something bryon evje chief operating officer of online ad network broadband enterprises says one frustration with voxant is that it doesnt provide advertisers with the names of sites that are running their ads instead it gives them broad demographic information about the sites and their audiences a voxant spokeswoman says the company is trying to change that for blacknewsmagazine com a new site which is trying to fill a "void in african american news " the advertising and news content have helped add legitimacy says the sites founder christopher kountz "if you come to a web site and you see advertisers youve never heard of you dont think much of it " says mr kountz whose web site has received visitors his month "but if you come to a site and you see fortune companies then people believe this must be good because theyve got these advertisers and they pay more attention "
