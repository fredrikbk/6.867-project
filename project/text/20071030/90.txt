pentagon puzzler president bush gave a speech last tuesday at the national defense university in which he observed that "the need for missile defense in europe is real and i believe its urgent " perhaps bob gates should re read it we say this after the secretary of defense appeared in prague the same day to say the administration would press ahead with plans to build a limited ballistic missile defense system in poland and the czech republic but would "delay activating them until there was concrete proof of the threat from iran " mr gates also suggested that russian personnel might be allowed on the site in light of the kremlins "concerns" that the installations comprising some interceptors and radar pose a threat to its nuclear deterrent czech prime minister mirek topolanek properly dismissed mr gatess latter idea saying "of course there will be no russian soldiers here and there were never supposed to be " that reference isnt subtle a country that is now perhaps the most pro american member of nato should not have to hazard its own security to appease its former occupier and certainly not so the u s can appease that occupier thats especially true when vladimir putins government has been bullying other former soviet republics and satellites georgia estonia and poland by means of trade embargoes cyberwars diplomatic harassment and worse mr gates was also less than reassuring with his comments about delayed activation and the need for "concrete proof " current and former pentagon officials tell us that "activation" can mean any number of things from nearly the equivalent of a flick of a switch to something more time consuming but its unclear why the u s should invest several billion dollars in an inactive site especially since a ballistic missile whether from a rogue state like iran or a terrorist group that somehow manages to obtain one could be launched with little to no warning in any case mr gates wasnt clear about the standard of proof hed require to consider irans threat "concrete " in his speech mr bush noted an intelligence assessment that "with continued foreign assistance iran could develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the united states and all of europe before " but he also noted that iran already has missiles capable of hitting turkey israel and u s forces in the persian gulf and that it is currently developing a missile that could reach as far as poland hungary and slovakia the notion that the u s must wait for "concrete" proof before it acts runs contrary to the whole purpose of ballistic missile defense as mr bush observed missile defense is intended to do more than prevent a ballistic missile from reaching its target its also meant to alter the "calculus of deterrence" by dissuading potential adversaries from launching and building ballistic missiles in the first place the sooner it is built the less likely it will need to be used the deeper mystery is why we are negotiating with mr putin at all russian objections to the proposed site make no sense interceptors pose no threat to russias estimated arsenal of nuclear weapons the russians have not helped their case by doing tehrans bidding at the u n security council or by treating mr gates and secretary of state condoleezza rice with contempt during their recent visit to moscow persistent reports that russian scientists have been abetting the islamic republics programs dont build confidence either a pentagon official assures us that there "isnt any daylight" between the president and his secretary we trust that means mr gates has come around to mr bushs point of view not the other way around
