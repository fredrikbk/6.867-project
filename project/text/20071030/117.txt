business day sign up for the e mail here an offer of immunity for blackwater security guards under investigation for their role in the shooting of iraqi civilians last month has left the justice department and the fbi wondering how to proceed with the already complicated criminal inquiry all the blackwater bodyguards involved in the sept embassy convoy shootings in baghdad were given legal protections as investigators from the bureau of diplomatic security an arm of the state department sought to find out what happened three senior law enforcement officials tell the associated press the case concerns a convoy of american diplomats and blackwater guards which approached crowded nisour square in baghdad as the new york times reports a second blackwater convoy in the square to control traffic opened fire killing people and wounding blackwater and the state department initially said the convoy had come under fire but witnesses and iraqi investigators indicated otherwise its not clear why the diplomatic security investigators agreed to give the guards immunity or who authorized doing so the ap reports citing one state official as saying "if in fact such a decision was made it was done without any input or authorization from any senior state department official in washington " the bodyguards spoke to state investigators only after receiving so called garrity protections which ensure their statements can only be used internally and not for criminal prosecutions the ap says because of the protections justice department prosecutors cant bring charges against the guards based on their statements to the diplomatic security investigators the justice department could still prosecute based on other evidence and has turned over the case to the fbi but some of the blackwater guards have refused to be interviewed by the fbi due to the promises of immunity from state one law enforcement official tells the washington post any statements that the guards give to the fbi could be used to bring criminal charges the ap notes before the immunity offers were made the justice department was already confronted with the legal question of whether any american civilians in iraq could be prosecuted at all the times writes u s citizens are immune from iraqi law under a directive signed at the beginning of the american occupation in furthermore civilian contractors cant be tried in military courts and it is unclear whether u s criminal law extends to acts committed in a war zone however the house of representatives recently passed a bill that would make contractors liable under a law known as the military extraterritorial jurisdiction act the times says adding that the senate is considering a similar measure the next major step in the investigation will come this week when a team of fbi investigators will return from baghdad and turn over their findings to the justice department then it will be up to justice to decide whether to prosecute the post says whatever the choice blackwaters future in iraq is uncertain the companys contract with the state department expires in may and iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki has said his cabinet is drafting a law that would force the state department to find another security company to replace it the ap reports to cut or not to cut market expectations of a quarter point rate cut tomorrow are putting pressure on the fed to deliver but the decision is for the fomc policymakers to decide and for them the choice is to cut by a quarter point or hold steady the wall street journal writes noting that a half point decrease is unlikely amid the recent volatility of the markets the fed has to weigh the risks of disappointing investors by keeping rates on hold with the possible inflation dangers of cutting the paper notes but ben bernanke does have a tool to mitigate risks if he decides to reduce rates the accompanying statement could damp expectations of more cuts on the other hand a decision to leave rates as they are could be accompanied by a statement opening the door for action at a later date the journal says regulating consumer products consumer product safety is on the agenda today in washington where the senate commerce committee is set to vote on legislation aimed at bulking up the resources of the consumer product safety commission the bill which is co sponsored by sen mark pryor d ark and sen daniel inouye d hawaii and enjoys strong support among democrats would boost funding by over the next seven years and allow the commission to hire about additional employees the wall street journal says that would be a big reversal of fortunes for the commission which has seen its staff cut to less than half the workers with which it was established in the paper notes despite a surge in the number of products it regulates in the past two months alone more than million toys have been recalled due to high levels of lead the new york times says the bill would bolster the commissions powers to police the marketplace and would raise the cap on maximum penalties to &# million from &# million the new york times notes but some of the provisions are raising objections from manufacturers and retailers as well as acting chairman nancy nord a bush appointee ms nord has proposed raising the civil penalties cap to &# million but opposes lifting it to &# million she also objects to a provision that would allow the agency to disclose details about potential hazards during investigations the journal notes tony fratto a white house spokesman tells the times that the bush
