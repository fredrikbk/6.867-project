a convict freed by dna evidence tries to find a life after years in prison mr williams needs help a stranger to his family baton rouge la michael anthony williams took a road trip through the southeast recently looking for a place that felt like home for more than half his years mr williams had lived in the infamously tough louisiana state penitentiary at angola he had been convicted of raping and beating his school tutor when he was years old only his family believed him when he said he was innocent dna testing finally exonerated him and he was released in march but since then mr williams has lived in a different kind of prison after years of estrangement he says his six brothers and sisters want nothing to do with him he has little education no job skills and few friends "its been lonely " he says "very lonely " mr williams is one of a growing number of convicts more than so far who have been freed from prison after dna testing proved them innocent after years of fighting to clear their names theyre emerging into a changed world with not much help to find their way a study of exonerees imprisoned an average of years by lola vollen founder of the life after exoneration program in berkeley calif found that nearly half suffer from depression anxiety disorder or some form of post traumatic stress disorder "exonerees are like torture victims or political prisoners given the psychological trauma theyve suffered " says vanessa potkin a staff attorney with the innocence project a new york nonprofit organization that used dna to help clear mr williams ms potkin says "michael is one of the harshest cases because he was so young and his prison experience so horrendous but he also represents the challenges and obstacles shared by many exonerees " to be sure some of their problems are common to anyone guilty or innocent confronting the world after serving a long prison sentence but experts say the issues are often worse for exonerees who have the added emotional and psychological burdens of having been wrongly locked away as well as having comparatively fewer services available to them when they are released the innocence project and other groups efforts to help inmates after theyve been freed have been hampered by a shortage of both programs and funds twenty two states currently compensate the wrongly convicted the funding varies from &# total to &# a year for every year of incarceration advocates argue that much more than money is needed exonerees need help with housing and health care and access to education life skills and job training so that they can become self sufficient mr williams had to persuade a louisiana state representative to write a bill on his behalf to appropriate funds for his compensation he was finally paid &# this past summer about &# a year for each year of his imprisonment mr williams was just a high school sophomore when he was tried as an adult for the rape of his year old tutor the womans head was covered during the attack but she testified that she recognized the teenager by his voice despite a lack of physical evidence mr williams was convicted and sentenced to life without parole when he arrived at angola he says a guard shackled him to the cell door and left it open exposing him to attacks from other inmates as he spoke his fingers traced a scar on his elbow left when he attempted to fend off an inmate who came at him with an ice pick mr williams was just another convict claiming innocence until when he learned about dna testing by watching the o j simpson murder trial on a prison television tests conducted by three different labs determined that the semen collected from the rape victim in mr williamss case could not have come from him the man who actually attacked her has not been found when mr williams was freed he had nowhere to go ms potkin tracked down several of his siblings but after years they barely knew him and refused to take him "when you are in prison for as long as i was people either think you must be guilty or at least damaged " says mr williams he didnt know how to drive he had never used a cellphone or left a message on an answering machine or typed on a computer he says that what surprised him most was the automatic flush toilets at wal mart even adjusting to the sounds of his new world was difficult he says that being locked up all those years had made his hearing particularly sensitive "in prison your ears are your eyes " he says "you know everyones footsteps " even now he cant get used to sleeping in the dark and has to leave the lights on the innocence project finally tracked down a younger sister kay jackson an army surgical technician in virginia she felt she owed it to mr williams to let him live with her and her teenage daughter and fiance a retired marine but it was tougher than she had expected "he was a year old man trapped in a year old brain " she says the smart mischievous boy she remembered had become a distrustful awkward self absorbed man he was angry unemployed and passed his days shopping and eating fast food his habit of taking long showers and sleeping with the tv on ran up her utility bills she says but he resented it when she complained he says he offered to pay mr williams went back to baton rouge but returned to virginia within a few months he had a series of jobs unloading trucks stocking shelves at target laying tar on roadways but he had trouble conforming to rules and none of the jobs lasted long mr williams offers different reasons for losing the jobs while laying road tar mr williams who weighs pounds and has high blood pressure says he suffered heat stroke between jobs mr williams liked to sit in a lounge chair in front of his sisters house where he became a magnet for neighborhood kids who loved to hear his prison stories the local homeowners association sent out a letter forbidding "loitering" in the neighborhood he left for good about a year ago mr williams still hasnt been able to find steady work here he used &# of his state compensation to buy a new car a toyota camry with a v engine and twin exhaust he invested some of the remaining money in an annuity and is living on the rest two weeks ago he lost most of his possessions when his electric oven caught fire and ruined his apartment the next day mr williams got hugs and sympathy from fellow parishioners at the nondenominational miracle place church in nearby baker la which was started by a former drug dealer regulars include several angola inmates a former prison guard and the local police chief in a few weeks mr williams will return to atlanta to look for a place to live there he hopes to join a small community of other exonerees he met through the innocence project mr williams believes that with a little more help he could make a better life for himself "if i could go to school for computers and get a place of my own " he says defiantly sitting in a lawn chair outside his charred apartment "if i could see a future "
