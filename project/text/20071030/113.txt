the daily fix girardi will take reins in bronx as torre considers heading west online edition joe girardi will reportedly be paid &# million next year to manage the new york yankees inheriting the responsibility of stretching the teams streak of consecutive playoff appearances to the burden of such expectations is an unwritten clause in any yankee contract but mr girardi will carry some extra weight hell be replacing joe torre who presided over more than a decade of routine excellence but last delivered a last world series title in the new yankees skippers big league managerial experience totals just games with the florida marlins where expectations were stuck somewhere around a non zero win total by that measure his young charges wins were enough to earn him the national league manager of the year award but tensions between mr girardi and the rest of the marlin braintrust left him and his award in search of a new employer gotham columnists stretch further back in the girardi timeline to declare him the right man for the job the ex catchers coach at northwestern praises his former pupils consistency "the same consistency and intensity that made him a student in industrial engineering at northwestern a three time academic all american " ian oconnor writes in the record "the same consistency and intensity that inspired the children of jerry and angie girardi to become doctors mathematicians and big league managers " new york post columnist mike vaccaro reminds readers that mr girardi arrived in new york as a replacement for a popular yankee then it was catcher mike stanley and did so with confidence and consistency judging from that experience mr vaccaro writes "he will never be overwhelmed by the job by the tasks inherent to the office to the expectations that attach themselves like barnacles to every day at the office there will never be a moment when joe girardi questions his capacity to hold the office " but newsdays ken davidoff revisits the most recent line in the girardi resume and wonders why hes no longer in charge of the marlins "the marlins not an organization that enjoys paying people for nothing decided that their differences with girardi were so profound that they were irreconcilable " mr davidoff writes "among girardis perceived sins a lack of respect for owner jeffrey loria and then general manager larry beinfest an inability to unite the coaching staff which consisted of some handpicked coaches and other inherited coaches which almost certainly will be the case with the yankees " meanwhile new yorker baseball scribe roger angell is still lamenting the departure of mr torre "is it possible that they have no sense of the calamity to the franchise and to the fans and to baseball itself that the departure of joe torre from new york represents " mr angell asks it sure looks like mr girardi wont be managing the best player in baseball next year alex rodriguez a shoo in to win the american league most valuable player award has opted out of his contract with the yankees his timing was wretched as noted in the fix yesterday but the move made financial sense argues tim marchman in the new york sun the yankees claimed that a rod would be getting a raise but mr marchman says that claim makes about as much sense as film studios flaunting box office records without accounting for inflation "why would he sign a contract that would essentially pay him less next year than he made this year coming off one of the greatest seasons in team history " he asks adds steve politi in the newark star ledger "he had a season unmatched in franchise history by anyone not named ruth or gehrig two players who never had the ability to test their value on the open market " even a rod defenders dont question the yankees insistence that they and a rod are quits so where will the year old with career home runs play next season not in boston if vocal fans at the world series clincher and at an impromptu fenway park celebration the next day are heeded but could a rod be driving across the triborough to shea stadium next season the mets famously balked at signing him seven years ago but might reconsider after their september collapse the move would require david wright to move from third base something he indicated before the season hed do for a rod "friends of rodriguez believe he would have a sincere interest in playing for the mets at the right price of course regardless of how it would damage his yankee legacy " bob klapisch writes in the bergen record "its worth noting that rodriguez was house hunting in greenwich conn in the last few months and the idea of staying in new york was seconded by his wife cynthia " the torre girardi and a rod shuffling occurs against the backdrop of a yankees red sox rivalry that has never been more heated at least in new york the boston globes matt viser discovered that in an interborough tour yesterday clad in red sox apparel "from the relentless glitz of times square to the lonely grit of yankee stadium drivers leaned on their horns pedestrians tossed the occasional elbow and a man passing out pamphlets in the garment district for a mens clothing store sale withdrew the sheet of paper when he saw what the reporter was wearing " mr viser writes "the venom cut across race gender and socioeconomic lines " brett favre enjoying a renaissance at age tossed a pair of touchdowns for yards and yards the latter on the first play of overtime to lead the green bay packers to a win over the broncos in denver "if the packers could go into denver a city where theyd never won by the way and beat a desperate broncos team that finally had its fans back after their two month fling with the colorado rockies it would go a long way toward solidifying their status as a bona fide contender " tom oates writes in the wisconsin state journal "consider it done " denver post columnist mark kiszla blames the conservative play calling of broncos coach mike shanahan for failing to give second year quarterback jay cutler a chance to win the game in regulation "the broncos have become the same play the percentages hope and pray no risk no reward team that makes parity just another word for mediocrity in the language of the nfl " mr kiszla writes the new england patriots sunday decimation of the washington redskins with pats qb tom brady running quarterback sneaks on fourth down while up furthered the debate about whether pats coach bill belichick is just ruthless or has crossed the line into poor sportsmanship well ok actually there isnt much of a debate in the washington post michael wilbon doesnt blame the pats for adding a few extra coats to the shellacking writing that "nfl teams compete on the most level playing field imaginable so the notion that another team should voluntarily stop beating another teams brains out is well dumb " but thats not to say he doesnt have a bone to pick with the skins meek acceptance of the tactics of mr belichick whom he charges "is still openly seething that the nfl caught him cheating like a dog and his primary goal is to humiliate every single opponent he comes across between now and the end of the season " he argues that the redskins should have made mr brady and by extension his coach pay for the breach of etiquette "the players sensing what was going on should have done whatever necessary to drill brady right in his strike zone " he writes "if brady walked off the field without help it would have meant the redskins didnt hit him hard enough if it brought a penalty or two so what the score was meaningless at that moment establishing the teams willingness to make the patriots pay for their boldness is all that should have mattered " tip of the fix cap to reader don
