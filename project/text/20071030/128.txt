wall street reckoning stan oneals looming departure as head of merrill lynch ends a remarkable career at the famous brokerage house and the news is causing a raft of reporting over the cultural changes and risk taking that mr oneal brought to "mother merrill " we think most of that is a sideshow what really matters is that wall street is beginning to hold its leadership accountable for the subprime debacle politicians and other faux populists like to gripe that ceos and mere "wall street traders" make too much money at least until theyre asking those traders for campaign contributions but along with the bonuses in the good times comes the peril of dismissal for major losses mr oneal brought merrill to new and profitable heights as he led the firm into the maze of subprime "collateralized debt obligations" this decade it was fun while it lasted and the vacation homes are great but amid the messy aftermath mr oneal first cleaned out the merrill executives who made the mistakes and now he is taking the fall himself thats capitalism one of mr oneals purported sins was to surprise merrills board last month when the size of the companys third quarter write down ballooned to &# billion from &# billion thats a big surprise all right and it suggests that oversight was late in coming but it also implies that merrill did the right thing by taking a good hard look at its books before reporting its results some other big banks havent been so candid as for merrills board while it may be wielding the ax against mr oneal shareholders have a right to ask why those directors were sleeping through we suspect some of the tightest white collars these days are over at citigroup americas largest bank and one with some of the biggest subprime exposure something like &# billion worth of so called "structured investment vehicles" sold in citis name are wobbling yet the bank is doing all it can to avoid absorbing those losses on its own balance sheet thus citi and a few friends have come up with the razzle dazzle of the &# billion "super conduit" fund to buy some of the assets and hope to ride out the storm weve been wondering why anyone not in similar subprime straits would want to invest in such a fund notwithstanding treasury secretary hank paulsons political blessing citigroup director and former treasury chief robert rubin owes mr paulson for that one but citigroup insists the fund is moving ahead and if they can pull it off so be it in any case the future of citi ceo chuck prince is very much on the line if he cant find a way to roll over those liabilities in the coming months the bank may have big write downs of its own citigroup shareholders will also have a right to demand accountability for mr prince and senior management this self cleansing is crucial for the financial credibility of individual companies as they try to win back customers many of whom have taken a bath but it is also vital to the larger financial system that the big banks are honest about their mistakes clean up their balance sheets and generally police themselves the short phrase for this is "marking to market " and while it may be painful for companies and ceos it will help the system work through the losses faster and prepare for recovery sooner its also important politically the more and sooner the financial community cleans up its own mess the better the chance that the political world wont have an opening to do it instead theres less damage to the capitalist system when individuals and companies are held accountable for their mistakes than when politicians decide that every financial "crisis" is an opportunity to shoot the wounded and change the rules and speaking of washington thats one place where no one is being held accountable for the subprime boom and bust that includes in particular the federal reserve whose far too easy monetary policy created a subsidy for debt that fueled the housing and subprime mortgage excesses one difference between wall street and washington is that in the latter no one ever admits a mistake much less suffers for it see related letter "letters to the editor oneals punishment hows &# million" wsj nov
