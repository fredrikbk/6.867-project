business technology gms tech czar is driving change from it perch szygenda cuts costs transforms the design process ralph szygenda has a motto never spend a dollar unless you know the return its going to get thats especially true as mr szygenda tries to weather one of the toughest environments in corporate america mr szygenda is chief information officer of general motors corp the auto maker lost more than &# billion in and &# billion in toyota motors corp is challenging gms role as the worlds largest vehicle producer in an effort to return to profitability and regain its position atop the industry gm is in the midst of layoffs plant closings and other changes for mr szygenda this has meant heavy cost cuts in his information technology department since he became cio in he has reduced the number of gms it systems to from last year he signed a record &# billion deal to outsource much of gms tech work to electronic data systems corp international business machines corp indias wipro ltd and others less money than what gm would have spent on its own to write and support its software overall the year old mr szygenda who was formerly the cio at bell atlantic and texas instruments inc has reduced his it budget from &# billion annually to &# billion while increasing spending on software development by he estimates his cuts have added &# billion to gms bottom line over the past decade but thats still a drop in the bucket for gm the challenge for mr szygenda isnt just to cut it costs but to use tech to reduce the time and money it takes to design build and deliver vehicles "no system ever saved anyone " says the cio "my job is to use it to transform the business " thats an oft stated goal for it departments but one few achieve in many companies the it department is often too busy keeping the systems they already have running to work on anything new says thilo koslowski an analyst at gartner group who covers the auto industry similarly it projects often take more time and money than anticipated which means the cio doesnt have much credibility when asking for funding for new projects too often cios focus on tech rather than business problems says jerry luftman a professor at the stevens institute of technology in hoboken n j he adds that only now are it leaders realizing that "the job is a business executive job not a tech job " to help the business one of mr szygendas key initiatives has been software that helps gms product engineers collaborate gm grew by acquisition with each of its brands acting as semi autonomous businesses chevrolets were designed by chevrolet engineers cars destined for europe were designed in europe this was done partly out of necessity since gms engineers were spread over locations world wide each of which used a different computer system the result duplicated efforts which added cost and slowed development time by earlier this decade it was clear that "we werent going to survive operating as different regions " says jim queen gms vice president of engineering so several years ago mr szygenda and his crew embarked on an effort to rip out and replace each of the different design systems with one system the effort involved hundreds of people and required tens of thousands of engineers to learn a new system gm which declined to reveal the cost of the change says the system was in place by the design process is further aided by a not yet completed system dubbed worldbook which serves as a digital library for design product and manufacturing information today gms cars arent designed based on brand or geography and duplication has largely been eliminated for example gms midsize vehicles like the chevy malibu saab and the opel vectra are now all designed in germany even though they are manufactured and sold in different parts of the world engineers can make fewer prototype vehicles and gm no longer has to worry about two groups both designing say doors for a midsize vehicle similarly the opel corsa despite being a european brand is designed in south korea because that is where gm designs its compact cars to incorporate local specifications into the design for example horns in cars intended for india need to be louder than those in the u s gms design engineers send files back and forth every day gm says the system has helped reduce vehicle development time and costs by it declined to disclose underlying numbers gm is now using the worldbook system to improve its manufacturing with the goal of making its vehicles anywhere in the world no matter where they ultimately will be sold gm analysts are starting to use software from mr szygenda that automatically gathers and analyzes car component and production data which has helped reduce from weeks to days the time needed to decide where to manufacture a vehicle despite these efforts "the it department cant save an automotive company " says gartners mr koslowski "but it can accelerate the efforts " "this is a fashion business " agrees mr szygenda "the best processes in the world dont matter if you dont have the best cars "
