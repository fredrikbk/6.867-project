medtronic recall exposes gaps in medical safety spotty data and testing left fda in the dark firm cites five deaths in late january something unsettling happened at the minneapolis heart institute on two successive days patients came to the clinic after their heart defibrillators had jolted them with huge unnecessary and painful electric shocks one year old woman said shed been zapped times in an hour doctors checked the hospitals records and discovered four similar cases had occurred in recent months each stemmed from a broken wire called a lead that tells a defibrillator when to send an electric shock to a malfunctioning heart all six cases involved the sprint fidelis manufactured by medtronic inc a leading medical device maker within days the heart institute concluded that the sprint fidelis wasnt safe enough told the company of its concerns and stopped using the product across the country physicians at leading hospitals from chicagos childrens memorial hospital to bostons brigham and womens hospital came across similar problems and some took similar steps but it wasnt until this month that medtronic of minneapolis reached the same conclusion on oct medtronic president and chief executive bill hawkins convened a meeting of top executives who decided that the company should suspend sales of the fidelis leads in one of the biggest recalls of a medical device it pulled all sprint fidelis models from the market citing five deaths in the devices three years on the market the events surrounding the medtronic recall expose a hole in the u s s medical safety system medical devices are regulated under different standards from those applied to prescription drugs the food and drug administration requires that almost all new medications be tested in human trials before they go on the market but some devices like the sprint fidelis leads are subject to lighter guidelines because they are considered modifications of earlier products the fda in most cases also doesnt mandate major studies of medical devices after theyve hit the market as a result both the federal agency and the company were handicapped in evaluating whether a widespread public health threat was emerging daniel schultz director of the fdas device center says that over the last several months "we had pieces of information that suggested there were certain problems associated with the fidelis lead " but he says "there was nothing we could point to specifically to say this is a violative product that needs to come off the market " sen charles grassley an iowa republican who has been critical of the fda is examining its handling of the sprint fidelis leads the agency meanwhile says it is developing a new surveillance program that will help it independently monitor the safety of heart devices "are there ways to identify problems more quickly " dr schultz asks "i think the answer is yes " but he adds "if you require a clinical trial for every design change what does that do to the ability of bringing new technologies to market " as the fidelis leads mystery unfolded the fda relied almost solely on medtronics limited data that left private cardiologists including those at the minneapolis heart institute to ring the alarm bells pressing both medtronic and the fda for action throughout and as recently as late september medtronic sought to reassure doctors at times blaming the problems largely on physicians technique in march a medtronic letter to doctors said its investigation "suggests that variables within the implant procedure may contribute significantly to these fractures " in announcing that it was suspending sales of the sprint fidelis leads on oct the company said they were failing at a rate of over months more than twice as often as its other top lead although the difference wasnt yet statistically significant that is it could still have plausibly been due to chance the safety gap between the two types of wires was widening rob clark a medtronic spokesman says the company didnt hide the problems or delay revealing them he says medtronic couldnt rely on data from individual hospitals and needed time to complete its statistical analysis and confirm that there truly was an excessive fracture rate with sprint fidelis "physicians disagree on the data " mr clark says "some still think this device should stay on the market " defibrillators are life saving devices that dispatch shocks to treat cardiac arrest and restore normal heart rhythm to work properly they depend on leads the complex wires that connect defibrillators to the heart muscle the wires sense aberrant heart rhythms and deliver jolts of electricity to revive a dying patient fractured wires can deliver unneeded and frightening shocks and on occasion can cause a lethal heart rhythm yet thick diameter leads have been known to pose risks so for years doctors clamored for ever narrower designs partly because blood clots tend to form around broader ones medtronic answered their call with the sprint fidelis among the thinnest leads with a diameter of millimeters about the thickness of a nickel in late the device gained fda approval and it quickly became the worlds most widely used defibrillator lead by early this year about of new medtronic defibrillators used fidelis leads some of the devices have been implanted in people around the world and about remain in patients chests the leads have brought in about &# billion in revenue for medtronic which has annual sales of more than &# billion like other leads made by medtronic and its competitors the fidelis leads occasionally broke but the issue went largely unnoticed until those two patients walked into the minneapolis heart institutes pacemaker and defibrillator clinic in january in both cases doctors at the clinic determined that the patients fidelis leads had fractured and misfired it worried linda kallinen the clinics technical director "we wondered if this was happenstance or not " she says adrian k almquist the doctor who treated the patients found the cases odd because the fractures had occurred within roughly two years of implant scouring electronic logs of other clinic patients ms kallinen found reports of four other fidelis fractures in the previous seven months she and dr almquist went to robert g hauser a senior consulting cardiologist at the heart institute who has made a career of studying defects in heart devices in dr hauser years old was instrumental in triggering the recalls of more than defibrillators and pacemakers made by guidant corp now part of boston scientific corp eight years ago he organized other cardiologists to create a private database of failures in defibrillators pacemakers and leads after hearing from ms kallinen and dr almquist dr hauser combed through his multihospital database he found similar trends of fractures in that database as well as multiple sprint fidelis lead failures in a separate federal database the heart institute decided to stop implanting the fidelis leads altogether and substitute an older medtronic lead that appeared to be safer the sprint quattro dr hauser contacted medtronic in february he and several other clinic physicians met at the heart institute with warren watson a medtronic vice president and an engineer dr hauser says he told mr watson that medtronic had a serious problem with its fidelis lead three identical device defects at one hospital he argues can signify a broader problem mr watson disagreed that there was enough evidence yet that the fidelis lead performed worse than others several participants in the meeting recall medtronic officials also suggested that lead fractures could have resulted from doctors mishandling the devices according to participants "they were blaming the implanters " says dr almquist who says he was offended by the suggestion mr watson and other medtronic officials declined to be interviewed for this story mr clark the medtronic spokesman wouldnt discuss specifics of the meeting but said there were hospitals that had implanted hundreds of fidelis leads with no fractures at the same meeting medtronic officials shared their own internal analysis of fidelis leads that had been returned to the company the data showed that from late through february of this year there had been fractures for a failure rate in the fidelis that compared with fractures or a failure rate of in medtronics other defibrillator lead the return rate data are imperfect however because few leads are ever returned to the company doctors often leave faulty leads in bodies and insert new ones because removing leads risks torn veins and dangerous bleeding the fda uses its discretion to determine whether a manufacturer should perform a safety or surveillance study after a device goes on the market in the case of sprint fidelis leads an agency spokeswoman said the fda didnt require any such study because "no issues were raised in premarket review that suggested the need for a postmarket study " since the fidelis was similar to an earlier design the fda hadnt required premarketing testing in human patients either agency officials also say that engineering bench tests can be more valuable than small human trials which might not identify relatively rare or longer term problems as with all devices medtronic has to file reports of fidelis problems reported by doctors or others to the fdas safety database medtronic had begun on its own a study as the leads went on the market by march it had data on patients the month before a team of medtronic analysts had begun the laborious process of tapping into carelink a proprietary system that allows doctors to monitor patients and their defibrillators remotely by phone or computer using computer files on patients fitted with fidelis leads the analysts set out to measure fractures and prefracture conditions they also had to contact doctors and hospitals to verify that what they were assembling matched doctors own records in part due to information from dr hauser medtronic on march sent out a "dear doctor" letter saying "medtronic has received reports from a limited number of implanting physicians indicating they have experienced higher than expected" fracture rates the letter cautioned doctors about how to handle the device to avoid problems meanwhile dr hauser submitted a manuscript to the journal heart rhythm based on his analysis of his multihospital database as well as a federal database dr hauser concluded that "the sprint fidelis high voltage lead appears to be prone to early failure " he sent an early copy of the manuscript whose findings would be published by heart rhythm online in april to the fda and medtronic the manuscript "put sprint fidelis on our radar " says the fdas dr schultz still the implications of one bad shock even one death in isolation were hard to discern fda officials say the agency lacked details about some incidents given the lack of information it couldnt put them in context or be sure they were all tied to a specific pattern of failure by this spring doctors were reaching their own conclusions frank mazzola an electrophysiologist at long island jewish medical center in new hyde park n y stopped using the sprint fidelis in april after seeing patients with lead fractures physicians at brigham and womens hospital did the same after they too saw problems at western pennsylvania hospital in pittsburgh cardiologist leonard i ganz says he stopped using the fidelis leads in may after two patients suffered multiple shocks "even though there was no statistical trend yet i was concerned enough that it might be" in time dr ganz says medtronic maintains that many hospitals using sprint fidelis implants werent experiencing any problems with fractures on july medtronic officials met again with dr hauser and other physicians at the heart institute dr hauser urged medtronic to stop selling the leads medtronics vice president for quality and regulatory issues reggie groves demurred using a powerpoint presentation to show that the incidence of fractures still wasnt statistically significant according to people present the company declines to elaborate according to the heart institutes ms kallinen medtronics ms groves said the company had identified a problem and was working on a possible remedy but had no intention of pulling the leads off the market the company was trying to get to the bottom of what was becoming a crisis medtronic says it learned about the five deaths potentially linked to fidelis leads between august and this september the patient study it had begun in by late july had data on patients and the separate eight month carelink analysis of patients was well under way using that information medtronic analysts by october determined that the fidelis overall failure rate over months on the market was higher than the rate for one of its quattro models medtronic consulted its outside advisory committee of heart doctors who thought the company had to act just after midnight on oct the company issued a news release saying it was withdrawing all sprint fidelis leads from the world wide market the release quoted mr hawkins as saying the recall "is the right thing to do given currently available information "
