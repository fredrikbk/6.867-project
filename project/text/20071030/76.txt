mayer and regina spektor when pearl jams eddie vedder canceled my morning jacket agreed to fill in at the first of this years two shows held saturday oct at the shoreline amphitheater here the artists met the tradition of performing "unplugged " though the word really isnt accurate most acoustic guitars and basses plug into amplifiers and the terms implication of folk like restraint was blown to bits by metallica drummer lars ulrich during the bands opener a surprising reading of rare earths "i just want to celebrate " the thrash metal bands lead singer james hetfield acknowledged the choice as "a bridge school shocker " declaring the performance as "acoustic and funk " metallica followed with tunes by nazareth garbage dire straits and bob seger its set ended some hours after the concert began the gorgeous northern california afternoon by then lost to the nights bone numbing chill but videos of metallicas performance were up on youtube well before dawn my morning jackets music is more suited to the acoustic tradition though it too can favor the roar of electric guitars here jim james and the band delivered alt country flavored rock on "golden " carl broemel played dobro over a shuffle by drummer patrick hallahan as mr james sang high and free while he picked guitar in a folk country style after mr young began the show with his ode to childhood "sugar mountain " the eclectic russia born singer songwriter regina spektor performed a charming set that the late arriving crowd missed but ms spektor aimed much of her set at the bridge school students in their wheelchairs at the rear of the stage before settling in at the piano she sang "aint no cover" accompanied only by the tap of her fingers on the vocal mike each song ended with a beaming smile by the moon faced ms spektor who enriches the tori amos model with her sly self deprecating humor her latest album "live at lollapalooza " sire shows why shes in a delightful category of one at jerry lee lewis has begun to slow down though his album "last man standing" shangri la was one of the biggest sellers of his year career his eight song set was fairly predictable a couple of tunes by hank williams a blues "hadacol boogie" and a few others before "great balls of fire" and "whole lotta shakin goin on " his right hand splashing over the pianos upper register while he pounded out a boogie woogie beat with his left dancing in the aisles the audience loved his performance as did mr young who watched from the side of the stage playing air piano and smiling broadly mr youngs own portion of the show was fairly muted hes on tour now behind his new album "chrome dreams ii" reprise on which he alternates his snarling brand of rock with gentle countryish tunes "im not doing any songs you know probably " he said to the crowd with an easy going band at his back that included his wife on vocals and vibraphone he settled in with five songs from the new disc including "the way " a wistful brian wilson like sing along and a "no hidden past" that allowed him to play several piercing staccato solos on guitar the album is one of mr youngs best recent releases and his set reflected his pride in the new music mr youngs fellow native canadians twins tegan &amp sara toyed and teased each other at one point sara threatened to quit the duo to become a guitar technician but john mayer was all business flanked by guitarists david ryan harris and robbie mcintosh he offered the events most intimate and shortest set playing acoustic versions of four songs from his album "continuum" aware mr mayer is a very tasty guitarist as his solos on "gravity" showed and its probably unfair to ask for more from an artist at a benefit but the audience was right to groan when he announced tom pettys "free fallin" would be his fifth and last song mr mayer had found a nice groove that might not have faded if his set had been twice as long mr waitss performance with the kronos quartet augmented by larry taylor on the upright bass was the highlight the endlessly inventive mr waits has played with kronos before they appear together on "healing the divide a concert for peace and reconciliation" anti issued in july but it was exhilarating to see them live kronos added a swirling slashing and altogether thrilling accent to mr waitss singular songs in a set that featured "gods away on business" and "the part that you throw away" from "blood money " his collaboration with his wife kathleen brennan and robert wilson for the latters adaptation of an play by the german poet georg buchner so anchored in german cabaret music was the waits kronos set that it seemed inevitable that theyd do something by kurt weill weill and brechts "what keeps mankind alive " was the eventual choice the tender support for mr waitss miraculous ballad "day after tomorrow" and violinist david harringtons gypsy solos in "way down in the hole" gave mr waitss music the kind of exploration and attention it deserves while accenting the gravitas it already has hes a national treasure and so is kronos as their set illustrated with stunning clarity mr fusilli is the journals rock and pop music critic
