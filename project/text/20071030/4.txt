amazonian swindle ecuador has a huge environmental problem courtesy of big oil since there have been at least recorded oil spills in the country including in the first nine months of alone their cumulative volume easily exceeds three million gallons scores of spills have never been cleaned up posing severe health risks for the local population rainfall in the area is said to smell like car exhaust small wonder then that when actress daryl hannah ventured into the ecuadorean amazon in june to have herself photographed dipping her hand into a lake of black sludge she characterized the situation as "potentially the biggest environmental case ever " only one problem the supposed villain in the plot texaco now merged with chevron ceased operations in ecuador in yet such details are rarely allowed to get in the way of a noble cause or a multibillion dollar class action the source of many if not all of the spills mentioned above is state owned petroecuador described by the latin business chronicle as "widely seen as one of the most inefficient state oil companies in latin america " in miguel munoz ecuadors energy minister admitted that "for over years petroecuador has done absolutely nothing to remediate those pits under its responsibility " he also acknowledged that the companys obsolete and underfunded pipeline system "is one of the most important causes of spills we face now " so how come chevron is in this picture plaintiffs lawyer steven donziger says its because texaco "made all the decisions about technologies and methods" and did "substandard work compared to what they were doing elsewhere " an alternative explanation as bank robber willie sutton might have said is because chevron is where the money is some background in ecuador invited texaco petroleum or texpet a subsidiary of texaco to prospect for oil in the countrys amazonian hinterlands which it discovered three years later by the mid s petroecuador became the majority owner in a consortium with texpet and gradually increased its stake until it assumed full control in an independent environmental audit conducted shortly thereafter concluded that texpet had abided by existing environmental regulations and industry practices though it recommended texaco invest &# million in remediation efforts to undo localized damages texaco ended up spending &# million on the project in the government of ecuador formally "absolved liberated and forever freed" texaco from "any claim or litigation by the government of ecuador concerning the obligations acquired by texpet " that might have been it but in an ecuadorean born massachusetts based "international human rights lawyer" named cristobal bonifaz filed a &# billion suit against texaco on behalf of indigenous ecuadorean tribes the case was dismissed in and again in on jurisdictional grounds mr bonifaz then brought the suit to ecuador pursuing it there until he was fired by his own "clients" in undeterred mr bonifaz brought the case again in san francisco chevrons home turf on behalf of new clients whom he claimed had contracted cancer from exposure to texacos sludge in august the california court threw out the suit on the grounds that at least three of the plaintiffs didnt have cancer at all and fined mr bonifaz &# "the sad fact " opined the court "is that counsels haste to sue and lassitude in investigation imposed a real and unnecessary burden on defendants our judicial system and truth be told the three plaintiffs who never even realized litigation would be brought in their name in the united states " meanwhile the case in ecuador moved forward in it got a pr boost when atlanta based toxics specialist and then plaintiffs expert dave russell was quoted in this newspaper as saying the ecological fallout was "larger than the chernobyl disaster" and could cost &# billion to clean up mr russell has since reconsidered that view telling me yesterday that the estimate was a "first guess " prepared "after a brief four day survey of the jungle based solely upon visual examination without any laboratory confirmation of contamination " as originally envisaged the ecuadorean trial was to have proceeded in two stages beginning with a finding of fact and only when that was completed an assessment of potential damages and liabilities according to chevron the trial descended to farce when the court allowed the case to move to the second stage without properly concluding the first nor was chevron reassured when ecuadors radical new president rafael correa began actively campaigning for the plaintiffs "let the whole world be witness to the atrocities texaco caused " he said in a typical blast those "atrocities" now include charges of dumping billion gallons of "toxic waste" into the amazon and committing genocide against several native tribes the problem with those charges is that at least one of the tribes the cofan has tripled in number in the last years according to anthropologist eduardo bedoya as for the toxic waste it turns out to be so called produced water extracted along with oil and gas according to a definitive study by the argonne national laboratory "produced water ranks first on the list of wastes that are generally exempt and warrant no regulation under subtitle c of the rcra resource conservation and recovery act " little of this is likely to make much of an impression on the legion of true believing mermaids and self interested ngos and lawyers looking for a fat settlement in a phone interview mr donziger allows that there is "a way out of this for everybody and im confident theres a sweet spot " which is a pity because there really is an ecological disaster happening in ecuador whose causes need to be understood and addressed even if the culprit isnt the usual suspect see related letter "letters to the editor chevron cant wash the oil from its hands" wsj nov
