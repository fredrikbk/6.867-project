stop the middle class tax raid fundamental tax reform must begin with a repeal of a tax that is now hitting middle class families and is threatening to grab back the benefits promised under the and tax cuts im talking about the alternative minimum tax amt and ive just introduced legislation to strike it from the tax code before it ensnares millions of middle class americans the amt was first put in place in to ensure that the wealthiest among us werent able to find enough loopholes in the tax code to avoid paying taxes entirely but it has grown in the years since this year alone it is threatening million taxpayers including firefighters teachers and others who were never intended to fall under its grasp the bush administration is calling for permanent repeal of the amt and has outlined plans for doing so as part of a comprehensive tax reform package that wont cost the treasury any revenue my proposal meets the presidents goal of a "revenue neutral" reform and more my legislation would repeal the amt so that taxpayers will no longer have to fill out multiple tax forms or wonder year after year whether they will be hit my reforms would also provide economic security to taxpayers they would allow millions of additional families to access the &# child tax credit raise the standard deduction and expand access to the earned income tax credit so that working adults will not face tax liability before reaching the poverty level in total the bill provides increased tax benefits to more than million families this is meaningful tax relief for those who need it most in order to achieve broad tax relief without increasing the national debt this legislation restructures benefits provided at the upper income levels the bill would also end the preferential and lucrative tax treatment currently enjoyed by private equity and hedge fund managers there is no justification for fund managers to continue receiving a lower tax rate on "carried interest " which is essentially compensation paid for the services they provide by adjusting the top rates and reducing windfalls paid out to some of the wealthiest individuals in the nation we can help restore a sense of equity and fairness that is critical to the success of our voluntary tax system our corporate tax laws are also in need of simplification as treasury secretary henry paulson recently highlighted as foreign competitors lower tax barriers to encourage investment america must modernize its laws to remain a business friendly competitive nation in order to create an environment that allows american businesses to compete and win internationally i propose a significant reduction in the corporate marginal tax rate and a removal of incentives for businesses to move jobs overseas the legislation will also repeal narrowly targeted tax breaks that have limited value can often be cumbersome for companies to realize and in some instances have outlived their original intent tax reform will not be achieved overnight however this package should bring even the most partisan conservatives to the table for an overdue debate on the future of our nations tax policies this nation must come to grips with the repercussions of recent fiscal irresponsibility opponents will attack my reforms by labeling them a tax increase this false rhetoric ignores the tax cuts that would be provided to some million americans as well as the joint committee on taxations determination that the bill is revenue neutral some of my republican friends have even suggested financing of tax reform with a round of tax cuts that are not paid for supporters of this approach should have the courage to lay out a precise plan for how they will pay for the ongoing war in iraq the commitments to our veterans much needed improvements in our infrastructure and investments in our health care and education systems the introduction of my bill marks the start not the end of the legislative process tax reform requires painful choices and my bill reflects that reality but those who would attack my bill without suggesting alternatives are in the posture of defending the status quo a posture that is outside the mainstream desires of the american people and the bulk of the business community over years ago my former colleague and then chairman of the ways and means committee dan rostenkowski delivered a speech on his desire to enact tax reform in response then treasury secretary james baker sent the chairman an audio recording of "theyre playing our song " the response from the bush administration and my republican colleagues in congress to the bill i have introduced may illustrate just how far they have strayed from the reform tendencies of the reagan administration while it is regrettable that congress and the administration have not worked together in recent years to enact bipartisan tax reform we must not miss this opportunity to simplify our tax code and put money back in the pockets of americas working families mr rangel d n y is chairman of the house committee on ways and means see related letters "letters to the editor wrangling over taxes with charlie rangel" wsj nov
