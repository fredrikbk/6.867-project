under fire for apparent breaches of civil and human rights over the past two months a georgian court in a closed trial convicted a group of opposition politicians of plotting a violent coup georgia televised the confession on corruption charges made by a political rival to president mikheil saakashvili and a preliminary report by united nations investigators disputes georgias version of an armed clash last month in which two russian ex military officers were shot "at point blank range " russia accused georgia of committing "premeditated murder" in the clash u n officials warn against drawing conclusions about how the russian soldiers died georgian officials say the country respects civil and human rights even some of georgias harshest critics say the country is making more progress on democracy and civil liberties than most of its neighbors still senior diplomats from countries friendly to georgia warn that while mr saakashvilis government gets high marks on economic and some other policies it is falling down on the rule of law that is potentially bad news for a country that wants to join the north atlantic treaty organization "its not enough to say youre in a bad neighborhood so people should give you the benefit of the doubt " said rachel denbar deputy director of the europe and central asia program at human rights watch u s officials are particularly concerned the u s has backed georgias bid for nato membership which is dependent on progress on democracy and the rule of law the u s sees georgia as a beacon of pro western democracy in the ex soviet bloc and an important non russian transport route for new oil and gas from the caspian sea basin the televised confession of former georgian defense minister irakli okruashvili has caused concern in diplomatic circles mr okruashvilis arrest on charges of extortion and procurement fraud came days after he accused mr saakashvili at a news conference of asking for the murder of a wealthy businessman "the confession of okruashvili raised questions in our minds about what the governments intentions were and we did tell the georgian government that we were concerned about this " said a senior western diplomat "for anyone looking at the timing it is hard to see this in a good light " said giga bokeria chairman of the georgian parliaments committee on legal affairs but he said the timing was decided by mr okruashvili who made his accusations a day after close associates were arrested in connection with the corruption case "he knew he was next " and the accusations against mr saakashvili were designed to make it too politically damaging to arrest him said mr bokeria mr okruashvili who repeated the confession in court couldnt be reached for comment mr saakashvili also has come under attack over the trial of figures from minor opposition parties charged with plotting the violent overthrow of the government the trial ended in late august with the conviction of all defendants and was held entirely behind closed doors unlike most georgian trials which allow for the benefit of public scrutiny defense lawyers said witnesses testified that evidence was planted a georgetown university linguistics expert for the defense said statements by prosecution witnesses were so near identical they had to have been coordinated "you have a clear pattern of the georgian judiciary doing exactly what the executive tells it to do " said lawrence barcella the u s lawyer for maia topuria who as leader of the pro moscow justice party and the lead defendant in the trial was sentenced to years in prison ms topurias father who fled georgia for moscow in is wanted in georgia in connection with an attempted assassination of former georgian president eduard shevardnadze rule of law is the only category of political and civic freedoms where freedom house the u s pro democracy organization scores georgia lower today than in before the popular "rose" revolution brought mr saakashvili to power mr bokeria the ruling party legislator acknowledges shortcomings in georgias legal system and said the government is trying to do something about it including the introduction of jury trials as of next year georgia also incurs criticism because it is relatively open and sets high goals he said critics at nongovernmental organizations say georgia is ahead of russia and other neighbors when it comes to democratic institutions one example russia raised the threshold for small political parties to enter parliament in legislative elections set for december and has said it will restrict the ability of the organization for security and cooperation in europe to monitor the vote mr saakashvili recently said georgia will lower the threshold to enter parliament in elections next year georgia however this month may have suffered a setback in its campaign to draw international support for its efforts to fend off russian influence the preliminary report of a u n investigation found that a clash between georgian and separatist abkhazian forces sept took place about yards inside abkhaz held territory which could suggest it was a georgian attack and not on georgian held territory as the government in tbilisi had claimed several abkhaz soldiers were wounded and two former russian military officers who the abkhaz said were training border guards at a camp were shot dead in the incident the u n report said an autopsy showed the russians were shot at "short and point blank range " though a final report on how they died will come later georgia says the clash happened as its troops were intercepting abkhaz saboteurs attacking a strategically sensitive road in the area alan cullison contributed to this article corrections &amp amplifications maia topuria leader of a minor opposition
