how union drive divided a city new haven leaders stand with labor in hospital battle a union organizing campaign at a hospital in new haven conn has erupted into a public battle after an arbitrator ruled last month that the hospital engaged in illegal tactics to sway workers not to join the union what makes the battle striking is the coalition of community leaders who have criticized the hospital including the president of yale who sits on the hospitals board local leaders are upset because they helped to broker a deal in april that cleared the way for the construction of a &# million expansion by yale new haven hospital to build a new cancer center the project had been stalled until a list of demands by the city were met including a fair union election "the hospital betrayed the community trust " says john destefano jr new havens mayor who says he would be less inclined to support future requests that the hospital makes on other projects nationally many union officials and consultants who work for employers during organizing drives are watching what happens saying the dispute has broader implications in labors effort to win national and local political backing for organizing efforts and for harsher penalties for companies when they intimidate workers indeed the new haven battle comes at a time when more local elected officials are weighing in on organizing drives in many cases taking the side of unions who say companies are pressuring and intimidating workers in the weeks before secret ballot elections the afl cio and other labor groups are trying to get federal legislation passed that would allow unions to organize workplaces when a majority of workers sign cards indicating their interest in a union in a process called card check currently businesses can insist on a secret ballot election overseen by the national labor relations board but unions argue that employers have the upper hand in such cases because they can wage campaigns on company grounds against the union in new haven the deal last spring included a labor agreement between the hospital and district of the service employees international union which had been battling each other for nine years the agreement gave the union a year to try to organize blue collar hospital workers without intimidation by either side the hospital agreed not to hold mandatory meetings to discuss the union and both sides agreed not to use disparaging language in december an arbitrator ruled that a hospital supervisor violated the labor pact as well as the law in the run up to the election by coercing workers to attend meetings in which she made false statements about the union and suggested that if the union came in workers could lose pay benefits and potentially their jobs the arbitrator said that other supervisors were apparently authorized to hold similar meetings vincent petrini a yale new haven hospital spokesman said the hospital took immediate steps following the arbitrators ruling and gave supervisors four hours of training on labor law so that mistakes wouldnt be repeated however he said the arbitrators decision reflects "a very isolated situation" and the hospital disagrees with the arbitrators conclusion that similar meetings were widespread he also said the union violated the labor pact in at least one instance it is unclear if the ruling will have any effect on the hospitals expansion project but the working relationship between the community and its hospital has been soured following the arbitrators decision the union election originally set for dec was postponed indefinitely by the nlrb pending its own investigation the unions organizing campaign has come to a halt and city officials and outside observers dont see a quick resolution especially since it could take years for the nlrb to rule on unfair labor practice charges filed by the union in a statement the hospitals board said it "deeply regrets" that the election was postponed hospital board member richard levin yales president issued his own statement saying he was "dismayed" that the hospital had "violated the letter and the spirit" of its agreement "i think youre going to have a multiyear war again " says andy stern president of seiu "i dont think theres any way to have a fair election the atmosphere has been completely ruined "
