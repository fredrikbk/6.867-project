new regimen inside abbotts tactics to protect aids drug older pills price hike helps sales of flagship a probe in illinois in the fall of abbott laboratories grew worried about new competition to its flagship aids drug kaletra then it seized on an unusual weapon that helped kaletras global sales top &# billion a year even as it exposed abbott to criticism that it was endangering patients the weapon was an older abbott aids drug called norvir it is a key part of drug regimens that include rival companies pills previously undisclosed documents and emails reviewed by the wall street journal show how abbott executives discussed ways to diminish the attraction of norvir with the goal of forcing patients to drop the rival drugs and turn to kaletra at one point the executives debated removing norvir pills from the u s market and selling the medicine only in a liquid formulation that one executive admitted tasted like vomit the taste would discourage use of norvir and competitors drugs the executives reasoned and abbott could claim it needed norvir pills for a humanitarian effort in africa another proposal was to stop selling norvir altogether a third proposal carried the day quintupling the price of norvir one internal document warned the move would make abbott look like a "big bad greedy pharmaceutical company " but the executives expected a norvir price hike would help kaletra sales and they bet any controversy would eventually die down they were right kaletra sales in the u s rose over the next two years some objected that the price hike made it harder for patients who needed drug combinations pairing norvir with non abbott pills to get their medicine after an initial burst the criticism faded partly because abbott exempted government health plans and aids drug assistance programs from the norvir price increase the debate at abbott over norvir provides a rare inside look at a pharmaceutical companys efforts to maximize profits and thwart competitors the industry has come under fire in recent years for tactics such as heavy marketing of drugs that offer little advantage over older products and paying generic drug makers to delay the introduction of cheap copycats norvir represents a twist in which a company took advantage of its monopoly over one drug to protect sales of another more profitable one an abbott spokeswoman melissa brotz says the company never seriously considered pulling norvir from the global market or withdrawing the pill version in the u s abbott denies raising norvirs price to protect kaletra and says the increase didnt hurt its competitors since their drugs continued to gain market share and they later raised their own prices it says the price increase was intended to better reflect norvirs medical value after years of being underestimated illinois attorney general lisa madigan has been investigating abbotts price hike for three years saying it may be an example of unfair pricing that violates the states consumer fraud law a lawsuit filed in u s district court in oakland calif by two aids patients and the service employees international union health and welfare fund alleges that abbott broke antitrust law by using its market power to boost kaletra sales the case is scheduled to go to trial in early in the s a new class of drugs called protease inhibitors revolutionized the treatment of aids by impeding the human immunodeficiency viruss ability to reproduce itself these drugs turned the disease from a death sentence into a chronic manageable illness for many patients norvir which received food and drug administration approval in is a protease inhibitor serious side effects prevented it from being used as a stand alone drug but abbott found that at small doses norvir boosted the effectiveness of other protease inhibitors norvir soon received wide use in the drug combinations taken by aids patients in abbott introduced kaletra which combined a new abbott made protease inhibitor with norvir in a single pill kaletras effectiveness and convenience quickly made it the most popular aids drug with of the protease inhibitor market by and annual u s sales nearing &# million by contrast norvir when sold as a stand alone drug was bringing in less than &# million a year in the u s then in june bristol myers squibb co introduced a new protease inhibitor called reyataz bristol myers presented a study it funded suggesting that reyataz boosted with norvir was as effective as kaletra at holding hiv in check and had a better effect on cholesterol levels reyataz was also more convenient because it required fewer pills a day as reyataz began gaining market share abbott executives considered ways to protect kaletra sales on sept jeffrey devlin abbotts hiv marketing director emailed a slide presentation to a colleague that discussed two options quintupling norvirs price or withdrawing norvir pills from the u s market and leaving only the liquid version of the drug the pill withdrawal option would dramatically improve kaletras sales and cripple reyataz the presentation predicted because the drug regimen that included reyataz would suddenly become more expensive it forecast that u s sales of kaletra would grow by to between and while u s prescriptions of reyataz would fall by to over the same period under the scenario anticipating that people would wonder why the norvir pills were suddenly unavailable the document recommended telling the american public that they needed to be sent "to the developing world i e africa " as part of a humanitarian effort but mr devlin fretted that forcing americans to swallow norvir in liquid form "will always be a tough sell " abbott was keenly aware of the liquids unpleasant taste in a deposition the following year with investigators from the illinois attorney generals office john leonard abbotts vice president of global pharmaceutical research and development referred to liquid norvir as "this fluid that has been ill just say it characterized as tasting like someone elses vomit " when abbott briefly halted the production of norvir pills in because of manufacturing problems patients resorted to creative methods to block the liquids foul taste these included using a straw to shoot it to the back of their throats coating their mouths with peanut butter or chocolate and numbing their taste buds with ice or popsicles foreseeing a backlash over the taste mr devlin recommended the price increase but the liquid option stayed alive on sept jesus leal then vice president of abbotts virology franchise recommended it in an email to a colleague "please dont be stunned by the outcome of the thought process " mr leal wrote to her mr leals concern a price hike on norvir would be hard to justify abbott might claim it couldnt afford to produce the drug at the lower price but it would face exposure "if forced to open books " he wrote the liquid switch on the other hand would "minimize any federal investigations regarding price increases" he argued mr leal who has since left the company says today the email "was part of a long and vigorous debate within abbott and should not be taken out of context " a slide presentation titled "hiv communications plan" and dated sept reviewed the two options and added a third pulling all formulations of norvir from the global market this radical step the presentation said would remove "pricing from public debate" and render moot any discussion of the liquids taste however it noted that abbotts "corporate reputation" would suffer as for the price increase scenario the document listed as a "pro" that health insurers might stop covering norvir which would hurt sales of other protease inhibitors and force patients to use kaletra among the cons it cautioned that the move would "tarnish" abbott chief executive officer miles whites debut as chairman of the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america the industrys trade group and "position" abbott as a "big bad greedy pharmaceutical company " abbott says this slide presentation was made by a public relations firm working for the company at the time in early october as a second new protease inhibitor from glaxosmithkline plc neared fda approval another internal document recommended the price increase it warned that if norvirs price wasnt raised "the abbott franchise will be severely threatened by the competitors ability to piggy back on norvirs uniqueness " if abbott took no action it predicted kaletra prescriptions would fall in abbott declined to make messrs devlin leonard and white available for comment ms brotz the abbott spokeswoman says mr white who remains chief executive didnt know that lower ranking executives discussed forcing americans to take norvir as a liquid or ending its sale altogether she says the executives were just brainstorming and quickly discarded some of the options these executives werent decision makers she adds however in a court brief filed in the california case last year opposing a plaintiffs motion to unseal the documents abbott said they "were prepared by and for some of the most senior officers at the company as part of an enormously important strategic discussion about norvir " in december abbott implemented its final decision a price increase norvirs u s wholesale price rose to &# from &# for milligram capsules the move made kaletra a cheaper option for american aids patients it raised the cost of using a reyataz norvir regimen by &# to &# a year in the case of regimens requiring more than once daily norvir boosting the cost rose by &# or more a year kaletra at the time cost about &# a year as abbott had foreseen the price hike triggered an uproar aids activists protested in front of the companys suburban chicago headquarters and at its annual meeting of shareholders three hundred doctors banded together to boycott abbott products and barred company sales representatives from entering their offices abbott exempted medicaid medicare and state aids drug assistance programs from the price increase it also announced that it would expand its own patient assistance program this enabled the company to argue that the increase was being shouldered by private health insurers not patients hollis salzman a partner with labaton sucharow &amp rudoff one of the law firms that brought the california case says the norvir price hike still made it harder for some patients to get drugs they needed "abbott single handedly turned back the clock on the treatment of aids " she says allen thornell an aids patient and plaintiff in the california case says the co payment required by his insurance plan at the time jumped to &# a month from &# when abbott raised norvirs price the new co payment represented a third of his take home salary as a result mr thornell says he had to quit his job as head of georgia equality a gay and lesbian organization his current insurance has a low fixed co payment ms brotz of abbott says mr thornell is not typical because most private health plans cap co payments at a much lower level she adds that people in his position are eligible for abbotts patient assistance program "our intention was that no patient be denied access to norvir " she says the norvir price increase also affected institutions that werent exempted such as state prisons the north carolina department of corrections which counts about hiv infected inmates saw its norvir costs rise to &# in the first quarter of from &# the previous quarter abbotts move "created a huge price discrepancy" between kaletra and rival drugs says david wohl an associate professor at the university of north carolina who works part time treating infected inmates dr wohl resisted shifting patients to kaletra unless he thought it was the best drug for them he says resulting budget difficulties forced prisons to cut back on testing inmates for virus resistance in may the national institutes of health held a public hearing to consider a request by a consumer advocacy group that it authorize cheaper generic copies of norvir to be made before the drugs patent expired the nih has legal authority to do that in cases where it has helped fund research into a drug but it has never used this power john erickson a former abbott scientist who did much of the research work on norvir spoke in favor of the request he testified that it was unlikely abbott would have funded norvirs early development without a &# million grant it received from the nih in abbott doesnt dispute the grant was important but says it also invested its own money in hiv research including &# million on clinical trials of norvir the nih decided in abbotts favor saying it wasnt empowered to determine whether a drugs price was too high to justify the price increase abbott posted a cost comparison chart on its norvir web site showing that norvir remained cheaper than other protease inhibitors however the chart implied that norvir could be taken on its own at a milligram dose when in fact it is approved at that dose only in combination with other protease inhibitors the fda ordered abbott to remove the chart in june calling it "false and misleading " and abbott complied over time the outcry faded private health insurers took a bigger blow but had little leverage because they could hardly deny patients a lifesaving drug insurer aetna inc sued abbott but dropped the suit within days abbott also settled a suit brought by the aids healthcare foundation the company agreed to support programs at the foundation which provides free medicine to poor and uninsured aids patients financial terms werent disclosed dr wohl says abbott has been "winning back some community goodwill including from me" with new initiatives such as a partnership with basketball hall of famer magic johnson to fight aids among african americans dr wohl says he has resumed making paid speaking appearances on behalf of the company u s sales of reyataz
