is tokyo set to rise optimism despite a meek tokyo japans stock market disappointed investors hoping for a big rally in as it struggled to post a rise for the year but strategists are cautiously optimistic that conditions are still in place to push japanese shares higher this year rattled by concerns over a slowing global economy that caused the countrys listed companies to issue restrained earnings guidance many investors grew weary of japanese stocks in the tepid rise in the benchmark nikkei stock average of companies was a letdown for investors recalling its jump in it also stood in contrast to the performance of the dow jones industrial average which rose last year tokyo trading remains closed today the market reopens tomorrow worries about growth havent disappeared but they are starting to fade a little while the u s isnt growing as fast as it had been the worlds largest economy is continuing to expand so are other key destinations for japanese exports like china and europe the japanese economy too has showed resilience as its recovery from years of slow or no growth continues expectations mount that consumers here long careful with their money will finally begin to loosen their purse strings corporate japan is feeling more robust too after a season of better than expected earnings companies reported pretax profits rose in the first half percentage points more than the average forecast according to goldman sachs group the stream of positive news has a growing number of strategists calling for a modest controlled rise in japanese stocks that could give the market a fifth consecutive year of gains they think earnings forecasts calculated as worries about a global slowdown hit a peak may be overly negative many also agree consumers will fuel economic activity lastly changing attitudes among individual investors will likely drive more money toward the stock market they say "we continue to believe there is massive potential" for japanese shares kathy matsui japan strategist at the tokyo office of goldman sachs said in a report in late ms matsui says earnings will likely rise in fiscal which ends march marking a sixth consecutive year of earnings growth in japan ms matsui says a combination of more revenue and streamlined companies suggests net profits in japan will rise in fiscal stronger than the consensus estimate of a gain she reckons that rise could push the topix index composed of all shares listed on the first section of the tokyo stock exchange to by the end of that would be a rise from its close of and much stronger than the past years gain of ms matsui like most strategists in japan forecasts the topix because it is broader and more representative of the share market than the better known nikkei average one question for japans economy is whether better corporate performance will translate into stronger consumer spending shoji hirakawa a strategist in tokyo for ubs says it will until now japanese corporations were mindful of the excessive spending that hurt their performances during the s and they kept a tight rein on wages but they have started to feel better about their prospects says mr hirakawa and he expects them to raise wages giving workers more spending power he also expects a rise in spending as a big number of japans baby boomers reach age this year and retire japans baby boom "generation" much more concentrated than americas is largely made up of people born between and eight million people will retire over the next three years and many will receive big lump sum payments from the pension system while much of that will go into investment and bank accounts mr hirakawa thinks the countrys hard working salarymen and women might splurge a little creating a surge in consumer sales he thinks the spending could push japans economy two percentage points higher mr hirakawa also sees the topix rising to over the course of the year not everyone is convinced the stock market will rise jonathan allum a strategist at kbc financial products frets that the economy remains fragile he worries that the bank of japan anxious to demonstrate its independence might raise rates unnecessarily this year "im not terribly optimistic " he says mr allum sees foreign investors lowering their risks in japan something that will push the topix down to in but the optimists see stocks getting a lift from a relatively new set of investors japanese individuals net assets in stock investment trusts similar to u s mutual funds and a favorite way for individuals to invest stand at trillion yen &# billion that is more than their roughly trillion in assets in according to the investment trusts association much of that money is coming into the market through defined contribution pension plans similar to k plans in the u s since these were introduced in more than two million japanese have entered into them and invested more than trillion yen while the amount is much smaller than comparable u s contributions it is increasing wider availability of investment trusts also has helped individuals get into the market in commercial banks started selling investment trusts increasing their popularity in japans post office which also doubles as a gigantic savings bank began selling them some post offices handle investment trusts "most japanese investors have finally become comfortable that the economy has truly exited its lost decade " john vail a strategist at nikko asset management wrote in a mid december report on the emergence of japans equity culture
