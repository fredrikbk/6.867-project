southwest china tobacco money has built highways railroads and hydroelectric dams hongta has branched into businesses ranging from hotels and real estate to securities trading its provided capital for biotech firms and paper and cement companies the issue revenue from cigarette taxes boosts chinas economy but smoking and smoking related illnesses are on the rise whats at stake chinas annual death toll from smoking is expected to more than double by whats next tobacco control experts hope economic changes will force the government into greater action "tobacco is a pillar of the economy " says liu ruisheng deputy director of the yunnan branch of hongtas parent company china national tobacco corp the worlds largest cigarette maker and a government owned enterprise but now five decades after the state went into the tobacco business china is in the early stages of an epidemic rising rates of smoking related diseases are one of the human costs of the chinese governments often single minded focus on economic development more than a million chinese people die of smoking related diseases each year according to official statistics compared with in the u s and thats just the beginning chinas economic boom and more sophisticated cigarette marketing efforts have been leading people to smoke more and to start smoking at younger ages chinas annual death toll is expected to more than double by if current trends continue epidemiologists say one third of all chinese men now age or younger will end up dying prematurely from tobacco related diseases the world health organization and some voices in chinas own public health agencies are warning of the looming crisis china has more smokers million than the u s has people "the costs to society are enormous " says henk bekedam director of the whos beijing office at the shanghai chest hospital which specializes in respiratory diseases surgeons and oncologists are scrambling to keep up with the rising number of lung cancer cases about a hundred people a day visit the hospitals outpatient clinic for intravenous chemotherapy treatments "we just dont have enough beds for all the patients " says liao meilin the physician who heads the hospitals lung cancer center the rising cost of smoking related medical care and lost productivity is forcing chinas policy makers to weigh the economic and social consequences of promoting cigarettes against the financial benefits some parts of the government are starting to argue that it is trading citizens future health for a near term boost to the economy planners at the powerful national development and reform commission which sets the nations industrial policy have been debating smokings pros and cons public health officials say smoking "is our biggest public health problem it should be our first priority " says yang gonghuan deputy director of chinas center for disease control and prevention "but many in the government and the public dont think so " she adds "some officials think tobacco control is good many are still opposed " so far tobacco is still in the drivers seat three of chinas largest taxpayers in were cigarette making units of china national tobacco including hongta tobacco taxes contributed &# billion or about of total central government revenue that year according to the state tobacco monopoly administration in yunnan tobacco taxes contributed nearly half of government revenue even shanghai with its large and diverse economy gets of its tax revenue from cigarettes "the government still puts more emphasis on the financial contributions and the development impact " of the tobacco industry says zhao xiao a former government economist now at the university of science and technology beijing "the influence of public health advocates is very weak " one reason is that under chinas largely pay as you go health service the government doesnt feel the full burden of the costs of caring for sick smokers people who cant pay cash for medical care often dont receive it and die at home the other reason is that tobacco revenue is especially important for some of the countrys poorest provinces where beijing is intent on driving economic growth in order to contain political discontent "without the speedy development of the tobacco industry yunnans economy cant keep growing at a fast and healthy pace " bai enpei the communist partys top official in the province said in a speech last year "we should unswervingly develop it and make this pillar of industry bigger and stronger " yunnans per capita economic output is about &# a year less than one sixth that of shanghai or beijing mr bai himself is a smoker in an interview with chinese state run television he said that tobacco is so important to the economy that "i wouldnt dare to not smoke " at the same time chinas state run cigarette makers are becoming increasingly sophisticated using marketing tactics that boldly associate their products with luck and good health popular brands include "good fortune" and "double happiness " appeals to nationalism are also common such as the "china" and "panda" brands prices range from about cents for a pack of cigarettes to as much as &# for high end smokes hongtas sports complex which serves as a training center for some of the countrys national teams is also open to the public it has an indoor swimming pool with a towering water slide a bowling alley tennis courts ice rink and soccer stadium banners that hang in the entry hall say "meet with hongta health will go with you forever " billboards around practice fields used by a soccer camp for teenagers tout the latest addition to the companys line up a cigarette called "new power " "ignite the passion of youth " ads say "hongta will go with you " smoking has become deeply ingrained in chinese society at weddings it is common for the bride and groom to give cigarettes to their guests as gifts the bride then lights a cigarette for all the men attending the ceremony in a rite that is supposed to augur well for the couples ability to have children about of all chinese adults the vast majority men smoke compared with of adults in the u s and about in europe and as incomes rise the average daily cigarette consumption per man is skyrocketing from four in and in to the current rate of nearly the average age when people start to smoke has declined too falling from in to in now about of middle school students smoke recent surveys have found zhang rong a year old high school student in shanghai says he started to smoke about two years ago and now goes through about a pack a day "many of my friends also smoke " says mr zhang "its fun " mr zhang says he is too young to have to worry about getting sick "i dont need to consider the health question yet " he says antismoking forces which have curbed many cigarette marketing initiatives in the u s and europe have little presence indeed until beijing signed onto an international tobacco control treaty backed by the who in tobacco control activists had practically no voice in that treaty ratified by china in the country agreed to take steps to limit tobacco advertising improve warning labels and take other steps aimed at discouraging smoking tobacco control efforts are in their early stages and enforcement is spotty antismoking activists have extremely modest aims one pilot project in three counties is focused in part on persuading parents not to smoke in the house with their children other programs are directed at urging doctors not to smoke at least while in hospitals or in front of their patients the chinese government became a cigarette maker after it took control of the country in and began to nationalize cigarette plants owned by private companies the company that became hongta was set up as a tobacco drying firm by the local government in within years the company started producing its own cigarettes the cigarettes like other consumer products in the days of central planning were then doled out by the government to workers soldiers and farmers under a ration system then in the late s and early s the chinese government started to loosen restrictions on agriculture in an effort to jump start economic growth the government also established the current tobacco monopoly system and began to invest in foreign cigarette making equipment improving the quality of locally made smokes and greatly increasing production capacity as the chinese economy started to grow and disposable income increased demand for cigarettes climbed mao zedong the first leader of communist china was an avid smoker and propaganda images of him one of the most common sights in china during his rule from until frequently showed him smoking the longevity of mao who lived to be has led many to discount the dangers of smoking tobacco control experts say by the mid s tobacco was a cornerstone of chinas economy and a critical source of funds for the government hongta was the top of the heap in the company which now produces about eight billion packs a year was the largest taxpayer in china hongta began using its earnings to fund infrastructure projects in yunnan and elsewhere the company built hotels in kunming and shanghai it built a six lane expressway from kunming south to yuxi where its headquarters are located the company also invested in some of the provinces largest hydropower stations in the run up to chinas entrance into the world trade organization in beijing came under increasing pressure to open its market wider to imported cigarettes faced with declining smoking rates at home the major cigarette multinationals based in the u s europe and japan all looked to china as a promising new market china highly dependent on revenue from tobacco fought to protect the industry and preserve the state monopoly on cigarette production and sales as part of its deal to join the wto china lowered tariffs on imported cigarettes to from foreign companies still arent allowed to make cigarettes in china at about the same time china national tobacco launched a campaign to make itself more competitive it began shutting down less efficient units and winnowing its portfolio of brands it also began modernizing factories and sharply improved the quality of its cigarettes which are made from domestically grown tobacco and packaging hongtas yuxi factory today looks like a large u s cigarette plant it is highly automated with the latest high speed cigarette rolling and packing machines from europe driverless forklifts guided by computer deliver paper filters and other raw materials to the assembly lines finished cigarettes are then put in cartons and loaded onto trucks entirely by machine china national tobacco for its part says its monopoly status has helped china curb cigarette consumption "we have a strategy of limited development " says china national tobaccos mr liu "we are doing it in a well planned restricted way our goal is to have restrained development and prevent it from expanding blindly " if it werent for the monopoly mr liu says cigarette production and consumption would be much greater the rapid growth of the chinese economy may help smoking foes government revenue from tobacco has been climbing steadily but its proportional contribution to tax income has begun to fall as other industries grow and the central government is slowly moving to improve health care coverage for its citizens currently much of the tobacco bounty goes to less developed parts of the country the bulk of the costs are borne by wealthier provinces which provide more access to health care for their citizens if the government begins to pay more medical expenses for more people it is likely to feel the costs of smoking more acutely tobacco control advocates say health economists are starting to tote up the costs of smoking to the chinese economy a study published in the british medical journal last year calculated that the direct and indirect costs of smoking from medical expenses to lost productivity totaled &# billion in china during the year "once you have lung cancer the expenses are endless " says ma huixian who was diagnosed with the disease in march since then mr ma says his family has paid more than &# for his care mr ma and his wife together have monthly income of just &# and are dipping into their meager savings to get by mr ma had two thirds of his right lung removed in june and hes also been through four rounds of chemotherapy he started smoking as a year old soldier and became a chain smoker of double happiness cigarettes he didnt quit until his doctor refused to treat his cancer unless he stopped smoking "i didnt realize smoking was so bad until i got sick " he says tang hanting in shanghai contributed to this article
