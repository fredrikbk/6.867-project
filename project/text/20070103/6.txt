as they are in the real world consider darrell schultes go round with "galvin" of overstock com inc mr schulte a year old web designer in north branch minn was shopping for a dvd of the movie "cars" and spotted a promise for free shipping on the overstock site but at checkout he was hit with a &# shipping charge an online chat session ensued with galvin a sales representative for the site who said free shipping applies only to "non media" purchases galvin asked mr schulte to check the fine print mr schulte found the disclaimer at the bottom of the web page and asked to cancel the order galvin said the company doesnt reverse transactions but because mr schulte was "an important customer " he said he would make a "one time exception " "thats the worst scripted answer i have ever read " mr schulte told galvin an overstock spokesman says the companys representative "should have shown better judgment and been more helpful in resolving the issue" and that its representatives dont use scripted answers to spur consumers to buy more instead of engaging in the cyber equivalent of window shopping online retailers are intensifying their sales efforts with a host of tactics some have added online dressing rooms where consumers assemble outfits real time communication with salespeople and online showrooms that display possible furniture combinations so youll be tempted to buy not just the chair but the ottoman and end table too though some of these features have been around for a while they are becoming increasingly prevalent and pointed the push in some cases is sparking a consumer backlash as shoppers recoil at some of the more aggressive sales pitches that are migrating online leigh ann gerow a freelance writer and web designer in las vegas tried a live online chat at dell inc s site a few weeks ago she hadnt received a confirmation email after ordering a new computer and wanted to find out whether her order had gone through she chatted with two salespeople but neither could solve her problem the most annoying part they kept using what ms gerow describes as "psychology speak" phrases like "i understand how frustrated you must feel " "i understand that this is an inconvenience for you " and "im sorry this is taking your valuable time " ms gerow finally gave up and called dells phone number for customer service "dell acknowledges that we need to do a better job of serving our customers " a dell spokesman says dell says it invested &# million in to boost its customer service by improving training hiring more people and offering new tools like dellconnect which lets dells customer support employees troubleshoot technical issues remotely then there is the online equivalent of the salesperson who insists those jeans really look great even if youre not so sure charles sporn a year old in new york recently encountered one of those in a web chat session with an apple computer inc salesman mr sporn posed as his dad and mentioned that he was considering buying a macbook pro apples high end laptop the salesman replied "very good taste " mr sporn remembers appreciating the compliment but being suspicious that it came so promptly he says he couldnt help but wonder did it have something to do with the fact that the macbook pro is among apples most expensive computers he also wondered if apple uses automated robots instead of humans in its sales chats an apple spokesman says the company uses real salespeople not robots but declined to comment beyond that later in the chat mr sporn mentioned that "his son" uses apples aperture software for photographers and found that it runs too slowly on his old powerbook the salesmans response "then you are definitely looking in the right spot i wouldnt recommend anything else if you were to use something like aperture " mr sporn didnt buy the computer if he does hell probably just take the bus to the apple store and get it in person he says to be sure some of the tactics retailers are using

accessories she had planned to buy some online retailers are also adding features and information guides meant to keep shoppers on a site for longer periods and draw them back more often which translates into more loyal customers who are likelier to spend large sums at qvc inc s qvc com the accessories and shoes group realized many customers were returning purses because they were misjudging from the web site how a bag would fit them so qvc added a "see how it fits" tool that superimposes a crude image of the purse on a silhouetted model now qvc says fewer buyers send back their purses still all this online help isnt always welcome "if i just bought a digital camera i dont need to buy a new computer to use with it even if they are giving me off on it " says vicky abrams
