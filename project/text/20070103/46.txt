in the fray should libraries target audience be cheapskates with mass market tastes "for whom the bell tolls" may be one of ernest hemingways best known books but it isnt exactly flying off the shelves in northern virginia these days precisely nobody has checked out a copy from the fairfax county public library system in the past two years according to a front page story in yesterdays washington post and now the bell may toll for hemingway a software program developed by sirsidynix an alabama based library technology company informs librarians of which books are circulating and which ones arent if titles remain untouched for two years they may be discarded permanently "were being very ruthless " boasts library director sam clay as it happens the ruthlessness may not ultimately extend to hemingways classic "for whom the bell tolls" could win a special reprieve and in the future copies might remain available at certain branches yet lots of other volumes may not fare as well books by charlotte bronte william faulkner thomas hardy marcel proust and alexander solzhenitsyn have recently been pulled library officials explain not unreasonably that their shelf space is limited and that they want to satisfy the demands of the public every unpopular book thats removed from circulation after all creates room for a new page turner by john grisham david baldacci or james patterson the authors of the three most checked out books in fairfax county last month but this raises a fundamental question what are libraries for are they cultural storehouses that contain the best that has been thought and said or are they more like actual stores responding to whatever fickle taste or mitch albom tearjerker is all the rage at this very moment if the answer is the latter then why must we have government run libraries at all theres a fine line between an institution that aims to edify the public and one that merely uses tax dollars to subsidize the recreational habits of bookworms fairfax county may think that condemning a few dusty old tomes allows it to keep up with the times but perhaps its inadvertently highlighting the fact that libraries themselves are becoming outmoded there was a time when virtually every library was a cultural repository holding priceless volumes imagine how much richer our historical and literary record would be if a single library full of unique volumes the fabled royal library of alexandria in egypt had survived to the present day as recently as a century ago when andrew carnegie was opening thousands of libraries throughout the english speaking world books were considerably more expensive and harder to obtain than they are right now carnegie always credited his success in business to the fact that he could borrow books from private libraries while he was growing up his philanthropy meant to provide similar opportunities to later generations today however large bookstore chains such as barnes &amp noble and borders bombard readers with an enormous range of inexpensive choices an even greater selection is available online before it started selling mouthwash and power tools amazon com used to advertise itself as "the worlds biggest bookstore " it still probably deserves the label even though there are now a wide variety of competing retailers full disclosure years ago i was a paid reviewer for amazon com the reality is that readers have never enjoyed a bigger market for books shoppers can buy everything from hot off the press titles in mint condition to out of print rarities from secondhand dealers they can even download audiobooks to their mp players and listen to them while jogging or driving to work companies such as google and microsoft are promising to make enormous amounts of out of copyright material available to anyone with a computer and a browser the bottom line is that it has never been easier or cheaper to read a book and the costs of reading probably will do nothing but drop further if public libraries attempt to compete in this environment they will increasingly be seen for what fairfax county apparently envisions them to be welfare programs for middle class readers who would rather borrow nelson demilles newest potboiler than spend a few dollars for it at their local wal mart instead of embracing this doomed model libraries might seek to differentiate themselves among the many options readers now have using a good dictionary as the model such a dictionary doesnt merely describe the words of a language it provides proper spelling pronunciation and usage new words come in and old ones go out but a reliable lexicon becomes a foundation of linguistic stability and coherence likewise libraries should seek to shore up the culture against the eroding force of trends the particulars of this task will fall upon the shoulders of individual librarians who should welcome the opportunity to discriminate between the good and the bad the timeless and the ephemeral as librarians traditionally have done they ought to regard themselves as not just experts in the arcane ways of the dewey decimal system but as teachers advisers and guardians of an intellectual inheritance the alternative is for them to morph into clerks who fill their shelves with whatever their "customers" want much as stock boys at grocery stores do both libraries and the public however would be ill served by such a faustian bargain thats a reference by the way to one of literatures great antiheroes good luck finding christopher marlowes play about him in a fairfax county library "doctor faustus" has survived for more than four centuries but it apparently hasnt been checked out in the past months mr miller writes for national review and is the author of "a gift of freedom how the john m olin foundation changed america" encounter books see related letters "letters to the editor your grandmothers library is still there just look in the database" wsj jan
