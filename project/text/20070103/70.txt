obscure chinese car maker seeks u s presence changfengs vehicles will be on display at detroit show communist lauds competition along with exotic cars and concepts from big global auto makers visitors to the international auto show this month in detroit will see vehicles from an obscure chinese auto maker called changfeng group co up close the five changfeng vehicles two sport utility vehicles two pickup trucks and a concept car dont look like much of a threat to established global auto giants all of them except for the suv called the liebao cheetah in english cs have quirky exterior looks that put them outside the mainstream of the flock of crossover utility wagons and pickup trucks crowding the u s market but changfengs presence in detroit its first international auto show outside china highlights a shift in the competitive landscape of chinas auto industry that could trouble detroits struggling big three in years to come chinas government until recently tried to limit the number of auto makers already more than by industry estimates through administrative guidance the better to develop a few large and presumably strong players beijing recently signaled it is prepared to let market forces have a larger hand in sorting out chinas chaotic auto sector although it is still trying through guidelines such as one it issued last month to discourage existing car makers from expanding manufacturing capacity too rapidly and new players from entering the market thats fueling the dreams of dozens of small regional chinese auto makers like changfeng which sells only about vehicles a year roughly the equivalent of half a years production at a typical u s car plant "before when competition wasnt free it was difficult for us to survive in the market compared with those big state owned enterprises " says jianxin li the companys year old chairman and a communist party leader in hunan province "real competition will do more good for us " real competition in china could also mean more headaches for big global auto makers outside china as changfengs detroit auto show display indicates chinese auto makers are looking to compete with the global giants in overseas markets for changfeng mr li says selling in the u s is important because it will help boost the image of the companys vehicles in china where picky consumers are suspicious of the quality of chinese brand cars the rapid growth of chinas domestic auto market has pulled in technology and technical talent that give even small auto makers such as changfeng the building blocks to assemble a modern vehicle fit for sale in a developed market if not right away then one or two product generations from now the first chinese cars sold in the u s in significant volume could be sold under the badges of daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group under a deal struck late last month between chrysler and chinese auto maker chery automobile co industry analyst michael dunne a vice president of market research firm jd power asia pacific inc says smaller chinese car makers such as chery great wall motor co and geely automobile co could have an edge in moving into export markets because they are nimbler and better able to adapt than some of the big state controlled vehicle makers "who will come out as a winner or a loser in the survival battle among chinas numerous auto makers and wannabes will depend on how they adjust themselves to the market " he says changfeng based in changsha hunan province represents the next tier of chinas automotive strivers the company with roots in a factory that repaired guns for the peoples liberation army in the s has put itself on a steep learning curve changfeng began producing suvs just a decade ago in a joint venture with japans mitsubishi motors corp in changsha changfeng is busy designing cars after engineering the two suvs it will display at the detroit auto show the company hopes to bring these to market as early as next year pending approval from beijing changfeng hopes sometime within the next decade to have trucks to sell in the u s under its liebao brand changfeng through its majority owned anhui changfeng yangzi motor manufacturing co unit already exports compact pickups to countries in the middle east africa and south america american dealers and others believe chinese auto makers will eventually crack the u s and other prominent auto markets but it wont happen overnight when asked whether he would become a changfeng dealer bobby thibodeau a detroit area car dealer paused changfeng is a "legitimate" player he says "but how quickly will they be able to bring those vehicles to u s market the jury is still out " among the keys to changfengs strategy is drawing on experienced chinese engineers who went to work for western auto makers but are now looking for opportunities as detroits big three cut staff changfengs head of product development for example is allen han a china born engineer who went back to china to work lured by the countrys rise as an automotive power after quitting his well paid engine research job at ford motor co in dearborn mich he just sold his house in plymouth mich and is moving his family back to china mr han is leading changfengs product diversification a move to take the company beyond building derivatives of mitsubishi designs such as the japanese companys pajero suv his immediate tasks come up with cars and car based crossover suvs by the end of this decade with changfengs own engines to power them to align changfengs vehicle styling more with consumer tastes in north america and europe mr han has turned to outside designers "in detroit the working conditions and the pay are much better but the city lacks energy and passion " says mr li the changfeng chairman "we have plenty of that in china " he says displaying vehicles at the coming detroit auto show is part of the process of building dealer interest in the liebao brand mr li is scouting around for "two or three good dealer groups" to promote the liebao brand in north america last october he and his colleagues visited a dealer part of a chain in the detroit area and will likely make more dealer visits when they come back to detroit this week for the auto show still knowing it has little in terms of technology human resources marketing savvy and brand identity to jump into the global market changfeng executives say they wont rush to build the companys fundamentals says mr li "we want to make sure every step we take is strong "
