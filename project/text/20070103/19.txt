caveat investor ipos of hedge equity funds hedge fund and private equity firms fiercely guard their privacy and have little interest in wooing small fry investors right not anymore firms increasingly are providing some juicy details about their operations as they issue stocks and bonds to the public but it isnt clear whether investors should be eager buyers for hedge funds the allure of these securities offerings is "permanent capital " or money that cant be withdrawn on a quarterly or annual basis that is once a firm has sold shares in an initial public offering any investor who later wants to sell his or her stake can trade the shares on an exchange but the firm itself doesnt have to worry about sending money out the door as hedge funds make more long term investments they want to make sure that investors dont withdraw money before the bets reach fruition raising public capital also enables hedge funds to be less dependent on their bank lenders permanent capital also is attractive to private equity firms which usually have to return money to investors when they wind down a buyout fund raising capital in the public markets can enable them to avoid a new round of fund raising which can be more cumbersome than an ipo courting the public is part of a growing shift by large hedge fund and private equity firms to become more "institutional" to look more like diverse

and bond markets public offerings also enable investors to easily buy and sell their stakes while avoiding the high minimum investments and net worth requirements usually necessary to invest directly in these kinds of firms the shares provide "cheap diversification" for investors says robert discolo managing director at aig global investment group a unit of aig that invests more than &# billion in

need to wait before they see an opportunity to invest money so cash raised from a public offering can sit around often earning little more than interest while the managers still collect fees hedge funds have had a better run of luck in public markets bankers say this is partly because hedge funds can invest proceeds more quickly plowing the cash into stocks bonds and derivative markets if they wish still these types of listings are considered too risky or hard to value by some investors many mutual fund managers dislike giving money to other fund managers to manage they prefer more control over how their money is put to use and some stocks that focus on acquiring interests in other companies such as cmgi inc have had a poor history cmgi which invested in a slew of technology companies

their exposure to alternative investments sometimes these firms are more comfortable with investing in listed securities than with putting money in a hedge fund directly
