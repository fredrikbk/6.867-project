lives its rolled through "theres a story behind every one if you can find it " says the year old farmer in he began trying to track down one that belonged to his late grandfather by then leonard gall had been dead for years and the tractor had been gone from the family for nearly twice that long but kristin galls memories were stirred after he stumbled across a tattered notebook in which his grandfather had jotted down the vehicles serial number along with the dates of each oil change the tractor was a farmall the turbocharged pride of the international harvester line when introduced in mr gall recalled riding the powerful red and white vehicle as a boy and sneaking out at night to listen to its am radio "i just wanted it back " he says so he plunged into the world of restoring and collecting vintage tractors where some antique models sell for more than &# john deere &amp co has a collectors center to help restoration buffs the annual red power roundup for international harvester collectors attracts visitors twin brothers mike and pat iott of ottawa lake mich spent nearly a decade tracking down the john deere that their maternal grandfather was driving when he suffered a fatal heart attack while trying to plow his way to the main road during a blizzard the tractor "is part of my history " says mike iott an inventory analyst for ford motor co in and around macon county mo where the gall family has farmed for four generations a tractor is still often seen as a measure of its owner farm finances permitting leonard gall born in didnt hesitate to trade in a tractor when he needed something bigger or more reliable and he was particular about his vehicles while he owned them washing them down after a day in the fields and making sure they were parked inside a shed each night in a photo of him and his two young sons calvin and larry made the local paper after he became the areas first buyer of one newly introduced farmall model later when grandchildren were born he sometimes got them pedal driven farmalls for christmas the used he bought in was an eye catching contrast to the all red tractors international harvester was known for it had brawny white fenders and gold metal trim its engine was one of the companys most powerful at the time "plow bigger plant thicker harvest cleaner " international harvester boasted in one magazine ad for the a balding smiling man who served on local church and school boards leonard gall installed an enclosed cab on his to protect him from the elements a rare bit of luxury that few local farmers indulged in at the time in careful script he documented its maintenance history in a spiral notebook that he kept in his repair shop which stayed in the family after his death in when kristin gall graduated from high school the previous year his father and uncle didnt need another full time hand for their farm after trying welding mr gall spent four dreary years making hamburger patties at a kansas city packing plant he returned to macon county in hoping to get back into farming "he knew he wanted to but i just didnt know if wed ever be able to " recalls marta gall who married kristin that same year and is now an elementary school art teacher mr gall worked summers on a highway line painting crew and spent the winters helping out in his father in laws auto transmission shop he borrowed &# in to buy a battered that had no connection to his family and which he began repairing for his own eventual use in he took out a much larger loan to buy a acre farm and rent some additional acreage for cultivation drought decimated his first crop of corn soybeans and wheat to ensure a steady income mr gall repaired auto transmissions in a garage behind his home in he came across the old notebook in his grandfathers shop it reminded him of better times and of how during the long days in the field a tractor sometimes began to feel like an extension of a farmers own hands having the serial number of his grandfathers meant mr gall would know he had the right if he found it "it would be just like getting a member of the family back " mr gall says relatives remembered that an area farmer named vernon carnahan had come to look at the shortly before it was traded in mr gall says that during a phone call mr carnahan acknowledged buying the tractor from a local dealer in and recalled who had bought it at a consignment auction about two years after that his son jackie carnahan now farms the land that once belonged to his father who lives in a nursing home jackie carnahan says the period was not a happy one for his father adding that like many other local farmers at the time he was caught between several years of low crop yields and double digit interest rates on his operating loans "when he sold that tractor he was definitely downsizing because of debt " he says mr gall discovered that the subsequently belonged to a farmer in la plata mo for seven or eight years until its engine developed a nasty knock and it was left parked in an open field for several years vandals broke out the cab windows a used implement dealer eventually bought the rusting hulk and resold it to houck supply a parts dealer in corning iowa about miles from mr galls home owner ray houck told mr gall he was welcome to come look through his acre salvage yard but advised that if the was there it had likely already been stripped of anything worth saving mr gall tried to concentrate on his farming but he was haunted by the notion that his grandfathers tractor was still out there somewhere "i just wanted to put it to rest so that i wouldnt be looking for it for the rest of my life " says mr gall who called houck supply again in this time the young employee who answered remembered there was something unusual about one of the old s out in the yard it had an enclosed cab the serial number was the right one mr gall purchased it for &# it was a far different piece of machinery than he remembered the cab was bent askew the radio was gone and the engine was filled with ice the bodys sheet metal was bent and battered mr gall spent more than a year overhauling its engine and smoothing out its body he bought yet another to serve as a "donor" tractor for parts and found an antique radio on ebay to match the one he remembered as a boy in he wrote an essay about his efforts for red power magazine a journal for international harvester collectors "i sat on that tractor for about an hour listening to that radio through the scratchy air waves " he wrote recalling the night when he finally finished "it was almost like being taken back in time i almost felt like grandpa was there smiling at me " these days mr gall doesnt use his grandfathers for hard chores although it is in demand at vintage tractor shows and is featured in a calendar produced by ageless iron almanac a collectors magazine on his farm the good years have outnumbered the bad since mr gall began his search even so the neighbors he rents land from are getting up in years and his own acre farm doesnt produce enough revenue to support his family with investors bidding up prices as they buy up local farmland for recreational purposes mr gall hasnt been able to afford to buy acreage that has come up for sale by looking for wrecks and bargains he has bought and begun to restore a dozen more old farmall tractors they are jammed tire to tire and hitch to grill in a big storage shed on his property "if i fall on hard times at least i have something i can sell " he says mr galls wife marta isnt sure their month old son hayden will be a farmer she says she wants him to make up his own mind mr galls hopes are clearer aiming to keep his grandfathers tractor in the family for at least one more generation he revived a tradition his grandfather started he bought his toddler son a pedal driven for christmas this year
