providers and equipment makers "the consumer is still driving tech " he said "weve seen a dramatic rise in people being able to download video on all types of devices " one of his firms largest positions in its growth portfolios for retail and institutional investors is cisco systems inc the shares gained in in large part from supplying chips that power many consumer electronic devices mr turner points out "cisco can have four or five more strong quarters going forward " mr turner said "in fact we see fairly clear sailing through for cisco as demand for more bandwidth continues to be a major story " new technologies with televisions and computer screens also are expected to spur more consumer activity in a flat panel television for example can require anywhere from four to times as many chips to run than a traditional cathode ray tube set "people used to hold on to their tvs for eight to years on average but now consumers are moving into digital sets and new technologies that require a faster repurchasing cycle " said edmund harriss co manager of the guinness atkinson global innovators fund its estimated that in about million cathode ray tube sets were sold world wide while flat panel versions will reach million new homes in about million cathode ray tube sets and million flat panel tvs were sold "the balance will continue to shift in " mr harriss said "many retailers around the world arent even bothering to market the traditional sets anymore theres much more revenue potential in the sets made with newer technologies " another driving force for tech in figures to be consumers in emerging markets mr harriss notes that in about of all personal computer sales came from emerging markets and of all handset revenue was projected as coming from developing nations "tech is turning more global which certainly makes its earnings potential more attractive going forward " mr harris said "in were expecting tech companies to be the third fastest growing
