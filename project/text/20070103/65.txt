news picture changes with cellphone video michael richardss racist rant and saddam husseins final moments were both captured by a tool on your cellphone you may not even know you have cellphone camcorders launched about four years ago have become ubiquitous some two thirds of mobile phones sold in november had a built in camera up from a year before and the majority of those could take video as well as still pictures according to npd group a market research firm the quality of their images is improving greatly to the point that even some professional newspeople use them now a new family of phones specializing in recording and viewing higher quality video is hitting the u s market up until recently most cellphones only allowed users to record as much as about seconds of poor quality video partly because of limited storage capacity devices hitting the market today have more memory and better lenses manufacturers also are focusing on such things as image stability and more frames per second to improve picture quality the nokia n which became available last year can record and view video at frames per second equivalent to dvd quality and twice as fast as typical cellphone camcorders the phone which is &# on nokia corp s web site and through its flagship store can record as much as two hours of video in one hour increments and the display screen can also be twisted to

gigabytes of removable memory the models also come with editing programs that allow users to combine their video clips with music and images also fueling the proliferation of cellphone videos carriers are making it easier for subscribers to transfer videos from handsets to friends or the world until recently most people who wanted to transfer videos had to follow a two step process first they had to move the videos to their computers using a memory card or usb connection then they had to upload them to a web site or send them as email attachments more recently carriers like verizon wireless a joint venture of verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc and sprint nextel corp have simplified the process by allowing subscribers to send videos to friends straight from their cellphones using a process similar to text messaging but this can get a little pricey sprint for example charges three cents a kilobyte of data to send photos or videos unless subscribers take a data package with unlimited messaging for &# to &# a month depending on its quality a mobile video clip can be several hundred kilobytes to a megabyte in size carriers also are making it easier for customers to send videos straight to web video sites for example verizon wireless recently announced that subscribers to its &# a month v cast service will soon be able to upload their video clips directly to video sharing sites youtube and revver inc from their phone doing so is expected to cost cents a clip unless photo and video messages are covered by their messaging plans to be sure cellphone videos

begun to use cellphone videos cnn correspondent nic robertson used a two megapixel nokia n camera phone last year to show a mob attacking his vehicle at a refugee camp in darfur sudan news corp s fox
