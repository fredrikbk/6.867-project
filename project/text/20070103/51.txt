julie taymors production tailors mozart for small fry and their attention spans the magic flute metropolitan opera through thursday new york what opera is the best introduction for children ive always thought "la boheme" is a good choice relatively brief lively with pretty tunes so what if the love story goes over their heads my children enjoyed janaceks poignant "the cunning little vixen" when they were small even though it was in czech they could read the titles and they liked the animal characters by contrast one well known conductors initiation at age eight was "salome" his mother picked the shortest show in the season the metropolitan opera eager to create a family friendly program for a series of holiday matinees opted to do some extra work on this issue julie taymors fantastical production of "the magic flute " with its giant polar bear puppets and dancing birds would seem like a natural for children with some careful cutting and a new english translation by poet and librettist j d mcclatchy the met devised an abridged version which opened for a six performance run on friday it lasted close to two hours without intermission rather than the usual three hours and minutes with one intermission of the complete opera all six shows with tickets priced lower than usual were sold out by the night before the first performance purists might quibble but the cutting was deft and almost seamless musically the shortened version preserved the delicate balance of gravity and humor in mozarts magical tale of a prince tamino who is dispatched to rescue a princess pamina and discovers wisdom in the process the overture was eliminated as were the pamina papageno duet "bei mannern " paminas attempted suicide and a personal favorite the chorale tune sung by the men in armor at the beginning of the "trial by fire and water" scene there were trims in arias ensembles and spoken dialogue but the story and the balance of the characters remained substantially the same mr mcclatchys translation was contemporary and clever without being excessively colloquial and worked beautifully in meter and rhyme for example the three ladies expostulating with tamino and papageno in the temple of wisdom declare "tamino why so cold and headstrong papageno you are dead wrong " the translation eliminated some of the sexist language that tends to make modern audiences laugh or cringe rather than painting the queen of the night as evil simply because she is a headstrong woman sarastro and his priests stress her determination to cover the world in darkness concise dialogue also clarified the nature of taminos quest and trials which can seem obscure in the original the strong cast included a majority of native english speakers including matthew polenzani an eloquent tamino morris robinson a rumbling sarastro and the crowd favorite nathan gunn as a rubber limbed mischievous papageno but even the non native speakers such as erika miklosa a splendidly stratospheric queen of the night and ying huang a piquant pamina delivered the english dialogue and sung translations with commitment and care and by putting james levine in the pit the met made it clear that this was no second string affair so what did the kids think gabe my nine year old companion an opera novice was most taken with george tsypins revolving transparent set and donald holders colorful lighting he liked ms taymors costumes but marginally preferred those of her broadway hit "the lion king " he adapted easily to the idea of a mostly sung performance which kept his attention throughout and his favorite character was sarastro whose deep notes he felt expressed wisdom he was puzzled by one of the inherent dramatic inconsistencies in the piece tamino is the hero but since he spends most of the opera under a vow of silence we know very little about him or his motivations while papageno the clown gets most of the air time as for those supposedly child pleasing special production effects gabe thought that the bear puppets that dance to taminos flute playing came out of nowhere they do and that the flying food of papagenos banquet was inappropriate since the three spirits who provide it are so serious for the record gabe also felt that papageno who couldnt keep a vow of silence to save his life didnt deserve to get his girl at the end and he thought the show could have been scarier still his mother reported later that he talked about the performance all evening and tried out a little opera singing he is very interested in attending another opera perhaps "salome" next time the two hour length didnt bother gabe but it was clearly a long sit for some one mother of two boys ages eight and six who were in the balcony said that the city ballets "nutcracker" was a better experience for them in large part because it had an intermission however their year old friend a girl was completely mesmerized by "flute " the boys had also liked "rigoletto " which has catchy tunes more drama and those all important intermissions the met is reportedly planning a series of family "hansel and gretel" performances next season and the companys continued outreach to this audience is to be encouraged yet perhaps the best lesson of this "flute" is for parents children can enjoy operas and not necessarily for the reasons that we think they will so message to opera companies now that youve got the parents attention lower the prices offer more matinees and get those kids in there while condensing great operas shouldnt be a regular audience building activity this classily abbreviated "flute" will surely whet some appetites for full length performances ms waleson covers opera for the journal
