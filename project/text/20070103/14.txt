business bookshelf why biotechs promise is so great but not its profits so far science business by gary p pisano harvard business school press pages &# it was years ago that genentech ushered in the era of biotechnology forming a company to create new drugs based on genetic engineering since then hundreds of new companies chasing the dream of blockbuster drugs have lost billions of dollars of investors capital it reminds me of warren buffetts crack about the notoriously unprofitable airline industry suggesting that any right minded capitalist would have shot down the wright brothers at kitty hawk cumulative profits for the entire biotech industry are meager the whole lot of them probably drip red ink if you take out amgen a year old company with &# billion in annual sales and like genentech and just a handful of others real profits can science and business mix gary pisano takes on this important question in "science business the promise the reality and the future of biotech " the problem according to the harvard business school professor is that todays corporate structures are allergic to the uncertainty and risk inherent in science "science business" provides a fascinating history of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology it ranges from bayer synthesizing an active extract of willow tree bark in thus creating the acetylsalicylic acid commercially known as aspirin to the cancer drugs of today somewhere in between the science or is it an art of drug discovery turned into a huge business so called big pharma with roots in the first half of the th century typically means companies that process naturally occurring compounds with organic chemistry while a wave of new biotech companies synthesize and genetically engineer drugs in an attempt to fight disease there is less of a distinction today both the pharmaceutical and biotech industries operate with enormous costs for research and development outlays that seem rational but end up being crapshoots mr pisano notes that "drug r&amp d is a highly complex process it is expensive time consuming and fraught with risk in these respects drug r&amp d is not too different from say the development of a new airliner a new microprocessor or even an epic movie " the key word is risk while an airbus plane intels core duo or "apocalypto" may have market risk their development is undertaken with confidence that the products will at least make it to market drug companies begin work on a new product with no idea whether it will even make it out of the lab much less progress through clinical trials and onto drugstore shelves a new drug might have the potential to be a blockbuster but then again only one drug out of newly developed compounds actually goes on sale "productivity" is not a word used often in the drug business drug development is a gamble in itself simply because of the hit or miss nature of the science or the "profound and persistent uncertainty " as mr pisano calls it "rooted in our current limited knowledge of human biological systems " but it becomes a staggeringly expensive gamble like playing blackjack at a table with a billion dollar minimum because of the facilities required and the legions of experts in chemistry biology genomics and other fields who pour their time and energy into research the "nature of this process is integral " mr pisano points out "it cannot be broken neatly into different pieces " and therein lies the rub most other science based businesses nowadays have made the transition from vertical to horizontal integration vertically integrated ibm ruled the computer industry for instance until the market showed that it was more efficient for microsoft and intel and dell and best buy each to own a horizontal layer of the business but in drug development attempts by companies to stake out a horizontal layer by providing just the compounds or the processes or the genomic databases have failed to take hold the conventional wisdom remains though that its much harder if not impossible to take risks inside large corporations where managers pay more attention to career risks than market risks given that venture capitalists exist to fund smart entrepreneurs with new potential blockbuster drug ideas biotech companies continue to sprout up ready to chase new ideas so we have vertically integrated big pharma plodding along with its risk averse corporate structure operating in a terrifyingly risky business and the more nimble biotech companies hoping to catch lightning in a bottle even as they bleed fortunes mr pisano in his conclusion calls for structural change in both businesses big pharma should take more biotech like risk and biotech should vertically integrate like big pharma in addition the entire drug industry should embrace more university research and use the grants process to push r&amp d at the basic science level im not so sure the biotech industry exists because wall street provides access to capital the stock market in its inimitable way looks at the industry strips away the high r&amp d spending and then models what a companys profits might look like on a normalized basis considering todays losses in the light of future profits failure is punished quickly even big pharma is not immune pfizers stock dropped in december on news that the companys new cholesterol treatment torcetrapib developed by using a biotech technique known as rna interference was dropped because of deaths and complications during clinical trials still pfizers established cholesterol drug lipitor is a &# billion a year drug when these things work they work big mr pisanos proposals for structural change are unlikely to be embraced unless wall street demands them investors may find "science business" particularly compelling mr pisano notes that "everyone from sophisticated vcs to aunt martha" invests in biotechnology companies "they hope to catch the next amgen now valued at &# billion never mind that probabilities are very low and on a risk adjusted basis it may not be a good bet the promise is there " so science and business will continue to mix for the moment they make a volatile cocktail mr kessler is author of "the end of medicine" harpercollins
