fiscally fit back to the future terri looks back at s family finances and ahead to the challenges will bring has a year come and gone already this time last year my editors and i decided to shift the focus of my column each week id focus on financial planning decisions and dilemmas that my family faced in doing so i hoped to shed some light on the financial and inevitably emotional decisions many couples face in managing household finances in return you shared your insights and experiences and offered much appreciated advice like many couples our age home renovations were a major financial focus for gerry and me in as i detailed in some of the financial challenges we faced last year a major backyard project was on our to do list we agreed on most of the fundamentals we both wanted a deck and an outdoor kitchen but i wanted an in ground pool while gerry wanted an easier to maintain and much less expensive hot tub instead after discussing it in my column many of you said you were on gerrys side among the main reasons higher insurance costs and the difficulty many homeowners have in selling a home with a pool you convinced me a hot tub it is project update the deck and patio are complete and well soon be shopping for hot tubs speaking of homes things look better for our continuing efforts to help my sister melissa and her husband joe find an affordable home in our area home prices were down sharply in from the previous year when the couple last looked at homes but left discouraged at how little &# could buy in our market but a similar tour in the fall showed some encouraging results we toured dozens of open houses with "for sale reduced " signs thats good news for first time homebuyers like them for the broader housing market not so much what are your thoughts on the housing market join my forum last year gerry and i also faced a self imposed deadline about a key question should we stop having children at age as we agreed long ago for various reasons or hope for one more child so our seven year old son gerald wouldnt be an only child that column left many readers in my forum on the topic seething at what they saw as our selfish and cold hearted approach to family planning ill admit to being a bit bewildered by the venom and left with second thoughts by a few unhappy tales of what its like to be an "only " gerry wanted to know how many of the angriest readers would be willing to sign up for babysitting services in the privacy of my email however a number of parents of onlies and onlies themselves said they supported our decision and vented their frustration over the pressure one child families often feel to have more children after giving it more thought gerry and i maintain that not having more children is the right decision for our family our biggest financial failures in first and foremost our health gerry knows that his smoking habit costs him about &# a week or &# a year after he now has a clearer sense of the more ominous cost of smoking last year his year old dad a former smoker was diagnosed with throat cancer my father in law suffered through some painful chemotherapy treatments but as of november hes received a clean bill of health good news and i hope more good comes of it gerry vowed that come new years day hed give up the habit for good and im confident that hell succeed its early i know but so far so good gerry quitting smoking also gives us an opportunity to talk with our son gerald about the dangers of smoking and how close our son came to losing his beloved grandfather hopefully it will help convince him to never take up the habit meanwhile my yo yo stop and go dieting has been a complete disaster not only did i gain weight in but i spent more than &# on weight loss tools and resources in the process not good and its not just out of pocket costs i need to worry about a study by the fred hutchinson cancer research center found that yo yo dieting could weaken the bodys immune system which could lead to increased susceptibility for colds and infections and possibly undermine the bodys defenses against cancer what will that mean for health care costs in my future i dont want to find out now i too have new resolve to work harder at living healthier last year my sister was diagnosed with a hereditary form of colitis and her doctor suggested all her siblings be tested my carrying around this extra weight can only increase my chances of contracting that or other illnesses so its time to get serious about losing weight and frankly id rather not have to buy any more "fat" clothes ive got a closet full of clothes two sizes too small and i aim to be wearing them by the summer we bought a new tv last year though perhaps we should have waited back in february gerry yearned for a big flat panel tv as the last piece of our family room remodeling project after shopping around we settled on a inch zenith model for &# total cost after taxes and accessories &# but thanks to fierce competition among electronics retailers flat screen tv prices have since plunged a quick search of some online retailers this week yielded prices for tvs similar to the model gerry and i purchased for &# had we waited eight months we might have saved at least &# maybe more are we sorry we didnt wait nope weve had a ball cheering on our favorite football teams giants steelers and jets on the big screen tv and face it all electronics get cheaper six months down the road sure we couldve waited and gotten a similar model at a lower price but whos to say the deep price cuts wouldnt have enticed gerry to buy one of the monster plus inch models that can now be had for &# to &# in the end we might actually have spent much more if wed waited opening my familys financial lives to you has been both more fun and informative than i ever could have expected this year i probably learned more about ourselves and how we handle our finances from you than i learned on my own for that im grateful and when my editor asked whether i wanted to continue writing about my family i responded with a resounding "yes " so with behind us what kind of financial decisions are on tap for one major concern is our sons health we learned last month that gerald has profound hearing loss in his right ear though were still in the process of determining the cause in addition to considering the possibility that our son may need expensive surgeries or hearing amplification devices that may not be covered by our health insurance policy were faced with another challenge geralds been having trouble with his schoolwork and his teacher and pediatrician believe that his hearing loss may be part of the problem to help gerald catch up to his classmates we plan to hire a tutor were taking a breather from our home renovation juggernaut until the home equity line of credit we used to fund the backyard project is repaid to keep debt from getting out of hand we never launch a new major project or make a major purchase until the previous costs are paid in full still storms have caused a few of our aging windows to break over the last year and the old siding is a bit of an eyesore when compared with the new deck and patio gerry is thinking about starting the windows siding project in the fall completing the project in might also qualify us for valuable federal tax credits to make our home more energy efficient since its uncertain whether these credits will be extended to it may make more sense financially to do the improvements this year and what about our boat last year gerry decided to sell it and then had second thoughts my issue isnt so much the cost of keeping the boat as it is the stress of gerry being the captain while everyone else enjoys themselves were hoping to finally get off the waiting list this summer for a slip at a state sponsored marina nearby our home which would slash our boating costs in half and last year we did a better job at spending more time on the boat ourselves while limiting visits from friends and family members who havent yet acquired their sea legs what are the chances well jump ship stay tuned youve heard mine now tell me yours what were your biggest financial challenges in did you save enough did you reduce debt were health care costs a burden and whats on your to do list for to get your financial house in order write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com or join me in an ongoing discussion on this weeks column my most recent column talked about my dads decision to continue to give my son gerald government backed savings bonds rather than contributing to his college savings account many readers wrote in to share their own experiences with savings bonds as gifts while others said we should cash the bonds in and fund the more tax advantaged savings account read on for a sampling of the letters which have been edited as always or join me in a continuing forum on the topic when i was a small boy in the late s my great grandmother left me a few thousand dollars for college that money was put in a trust managed by relatives and invested conservatively as i grew up in the s inflation was high and my returns were low because my money was "safe " then college tuition costs started their trend of growing much more quickly than the rate of inflation by the time i went to school the money was able to buy about a semester of college by my middle teens i knew that inflation was destroying the value of my college fund but i couldnt do anything about it until my trustee gave me control of the investments when i turned i had to watch the money melt for four years something that still bothers me when i think about the choices i had to make because of the decline in value its possible that your son will understand rates of return as well and later in life bad investment decisions may one day upset him tom hunter three cheers for your father it seems inappropriate to me for you to dictate the financial gift your father chooses i like his idea of leaving a legacy however modest to your son the investment returns you describe remind of people in the late s who assumed the stock market would always grow at a year or higher michael g herp ive found over the past years spent advising clients that my recommendations arent always followed i find this amazing because clients pay me handsomely for the advice i wonder "do they go to the doctor when theyre sick but decide not to fill the prescription s the doctor writes to make them well " the conclusion ive pieced together is that financial decisions are intensely emotional and connected to all sorts of nonfinancial issues such as self image family interactions feelings about children security and fear among with myriad others clark d randall i just went through this exact conversation with my father last week he called for the social security numbers of my two sons and i knew immediately why he asked i told him that while my wife and i really appreciate his offer to assist in saving for college with bonds our account had many more advantages return and flexibility being two i made the case that the plan is used to pay for tuition or can be rolled over to the other child in the event of a scholarship bonds and even a uniform gift to minors account are cash in the hands of a young adult at age and can be used for college tuition as intended or for a cross country road trip i suggested that on birthdays and christmas he explain the gift to each of them and how important it will be in their future its never too early to teach the concept of savings he agreed and the accounts were opened talking about money as a parent with your parents is never easy derek romanaux instead of a savings bond i would choose stock in a large well managed company one that operates in a time tested business and will provide modest but solid returns then sit down every year and without worrying too much about the stock price check if the underlying business is still sound or if it has deteriorated beyond repair and you need to sell the stock there will be other benefits to such a gift as your son grows you can do the yearly evaluation with him having learned the discipline of buy and hold investing as a child hes unlikely to make elementary mistakes such as maxing out his credit cards when he goes to college and once he gets his first job hell know the importance of investing in stocks as opposed to keeping his retirement savings in money market accounts as many somethings do today dan stratila thank your dad for me all too often i work hard to make emotionless decisions when it comes to money your story and your fathers decision puts a lot in perspective and i will remember it for a long time as i am sure your son gerald will when the time comes john r cronin i am and my grandparents gave me savings bonds as gifts the first several years of my life i redeemed them many years ago but kept one &# bond as a memory of my generous immigrant grandparents i might even frame it one day robert fogel write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com
