madison avenue sifts through clutter ad trends veer toward fewer tv commercials greater use of internet consumers may see fewer commercials on television in but a greater variety of ads on the internet thats the outlook for madison avenue after a year of upheaval in the ad industry with consumers flocking to emerging venues such as web based video and video on demand advertisers are scrambling to keep pace they are putting less emphasis on traditional tv and print ads and instead experimenting with a variety of new techniques including amateur style videos posted on youtube and traditional video commercials on the web marketers are also trying to figure out how much advertising they can place on mobile devices without being rebuffed by consumers many of these new outlets offer advertisers more data to track consumer response that is prompting marketers to demand more evidence from older media on whether their clever commercials make a difference in buying decisions amid all this upheaval here are five trends likely to gather pace in the coming year fewer ads network tv executives are beginning to realize that the dozens of ads and promotions that run during their most watched programs dont create the best environment for getting a specific ad message across to consumers network tv runs an average of about minutes of ads and promotions per hour according to research from wpp groups mindshare advertisers say research shows that running fewer ads reducing what they call the "clutter" would make it easier for viewers to remember the marketing message of those that do air during the past months some big tv networks have begun to experiment in earnest with cutting back the number of ads several have done sponsorship deals in which a single advertiser buys all the ad time during a show often using less than the usual amount of commercial time american express co for example sponsored an entire episode of "the west wing" with a limited number of ads nissan north america and time warner inc s warner brothers movie studio respectively sponsored debut episodes of "heroes" on nbc and "smith" on cbs with limited ads media buyers say this technique usually results in better viewer recall of the ads in the coming year look for one advertiser to cook up a deal with a network that finds the advertiser buying exclusive rights to a series and likely airing fewer ads in the show as a result jazzing up search ads paid search advertising on the internet is one of the mediums fastest growing categories but the format isnt the most imaginative web surfers usually see a companys name that is also a clickable link with some words of text underneath not too exciting but advertisers are trying to do more once focused mostly on driving consumers to make a purchase search ads are now starting to highlight other ideas even if only in a few words ron belanger vice president of agency development for search marketing at yahoo believes consumers are already starting to see "more sophisticated creative in some cases humorous" ideas for the words that appear in search ads in some cases this means tying the paid search ad back to a larger ad campaign and the slogans and phrases used elsewhere says penry price googles head of north american sales for instance the phrases used in a search ad could echo those used in a slogan or jingle in a tv spot what consumers will hopefully see he says "is more messaging that will remind them of what theyve seen maybe on television or what theyve heard on the radio or what theyve seen in newspapers or magazines " developing these new techniques is essential for internet advertising say media buyers the web is better known for direct response advertising not image and brand promotion which makes a more memorable splash "me" media advertisers have long put their ads on selected web sites magazines and tv programs increasingly they are digging a little deeper seeking out well known writers bloggers and other authoritative personalities for example international business machines corp last year sponsored a series of interviews hosted by geoffrey colvin a writer for time warners fortune the interviews with high ranking corporate executives appeared in print and online and ibm ads were seen adjacent to the content "what we are looking for is to attach ourselves to interesting people or topics that are very relevant for us " says deirdre bigley ibms vice president of world wide advertising and interactive more such deals are likely some say "i believe that we are going to see both audiences and advertisers migrate to individuals as credible brands and guides " says rishad tobaccowala chief executive of denuo a publicis groupe sa consultancy that examines emerging ad venues making a choice advertising has long been a passive experience ad messages washed over couch potatoes while they watched tv now advertisers including companies as big as unilever and adidas ags reebok are starting to take advantage of interactive tv technology that gets consumers to become actively involved in watching ads in an effort to promote its "i cant believe its not butter " nonbutter spread unilever last year posted on several cable video on demand channels a seven part animated series that spoofed a soap opera set in a refrigerator the series followed the plight of a curvy talking bottle named "spraychel " teaser ads for the show directed consumers to vod channels where consumers were able to view the clips browse profiles of the characters respond to polls or request a free cookbook after forking over personal information helping drive this trend is growing availability of video on demand services offered by most cable operators new yardsticks marketers will look for new ways of measuring the effectiveness of their ads for decades advertisers have decided where to buy space or time in part based on what they call "boxcar" numbers newspaper and magazine circulations and tv ratings the trouble is that these figures tell madison avenue only the number of people who might have seen an ad and do nothing to reveal whether any did see it and if they did whether they remembered anything about it or acted on it that is starting to change as interactive media such as the web offer advertisers data that track who saw their ads and how they responded when it comes to traditional media though marketers are still looking for better data some are calling for new ways to measure whether consumers pay attention to their ads in toyota motor corp struck a deal with nbc that required the network to demonstrate that its viewers paid attention and could recall particular details about a tv show such as its story line data from iag research a new york company that measures viewers response to tv programs ads and product placements were central to the deal look for more pressure from madison avenue for other traditional media outlets to agree to such demands and come up with data offering proof
