new generation of web sites has cropped up in recent months designed to help investors share ideas online with others who have similar investment styles such as which asian stocks or technology issues

participants users are assigned a score based largely on the performance of their stock picks and the accuracy of their forecasts joey fundora a year old computer network architect in miami logs in every morning to stocktickr which so far has about users "the first page that comes up is a list of stocks that my friends have recently added if you know that theres a user that you have a lot of similarities with often theyll bring up stocks that arent on your radar " taking their cue from such social networking sites as myspace com the new financial web sites with names like bullpoo com

member participants though some offer additional analytical tools for a fee "trading is a lonely profession " says richard todd a year old day trader in dallas who uses stocktickr "serious active full

discount broker shares advertising revenue with investors whose blogs the company features on its web site and established brokerage firms such as charles schwab corp fidelity investments and optionsxpress holdings inc say they are looking for ways to permit online customers to share more information with each other but skeptics say there is a risk of fraud from discussing your financial affairs with a group of strangers on the internet and its best not to be too revealing "talking about how much money you have and how much you have to invest is probably not the smartest thing to do " says charlene li an analyst at forrester research inc whats more the usefulness of the sites depends in large part on the size of the communities "youve got to have enough people in there to make it interesting for other people to join " says michiel de boer zecco coms director of product development heres how the sites work after registering members create their own profiles including details of their investing experience and preferred trading styles they typically can search for other users based on a menu of attributes contained in the profiles individuals can email each other to share investment ideas or sign up to get email notifications of other members favorite investments for the most part users exchange tips on stock holdings that are in virtual portfolios that may not reflect their actual investments though some participants choose to keep the holdings identical people who wish to remain anonymous can visit the web sites without logging on to see what other people are buying and selling but wont be able to offer opinions or affect other peoples ratings beyond that each site works slightly differently at bullpoo com which started last spring new members are given a virtual investment kitty of &# million to trade stocks listed on major u s stock exchanges and are ranked based on how well their virtual portfolios perform the site founded by simon lee a year old

itself as an online stock research tool provides ratings on more than stocks from individual investors and established brokerage firms the company says it has safeguards to prevent someone from trying to hype a particular stock investors must provide predictions on at least seven different stocks before they are assigned a performance ranking and investors with the highest rankings have a bigger
