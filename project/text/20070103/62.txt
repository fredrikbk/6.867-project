my charges against sec are justified over three weeks your paper published a column and an editorial portraying me as a former sec attorney who makes groundless charges against the wall street elite and sec officials the column attacks one of two pulitzer prize winning reporters who co authored the first new york times article about the secs pequot investigation you accuse the times and the reporter of "airing allegations that morgan stanley ceo john mack helped a hedge fund engage in insider trading " you toss in that i "brainstormed up the mack allegations " your editorial also accuses me of making groundless allegations but now against mr mack and the sec my allegations to the senate have focused only on the sec i have alleged senior sec officials gave mr mack favored treatment those officials fired me for questioning that favored treatment and the secs inspector general whitewashed the whole affair you claim no evidence supports these allegations my dec testimony to the senate judiciary committee now on its web site offers ample evidence on each point also it is not my practice to make empty allegations former enforcement director steven cutler made this point when the sec hired me as a "superior qualifications appointment " he cited my track record "substantial recoveries" in more than "consecutive complex cases " equally mystifying is your reference to my "long held sweeping grievances against hedge funds " before the pequot investigation i had no experience with hedge funds good or bad never invested in one never knew anyone who did before the pequot assignment it is unlikely that i used the term more than times in my life finally you proclaim your own credibility in coming to the rescue of the sec "we have no affection for the sec " that is surely true but how often would you come to the rescue of an sec that treated the wall street elite just like everybody else as required by law gary aguirre washington
