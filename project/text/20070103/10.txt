barrelhouse chuck goering keeps the blues alive for two weeks the children at the braeside elementary school in highland park ill near chicago had been listening to barrelhouse chuck goering play the piano sing and tell stories about historic blues masters hed known hed come a teacher explained to the chicago tribune "because we wanted to show the kids the roots of american music " at one point a year old said "i didnt know any of those famous names he talked about it was like they were keeping a secret from us " and another youngster brand new to the blues added "i really like the songs " those lively teaching moments took place three years ago but barrelhouse chuck still keeping the blues alive every way he can told me in december that recently hed been at another elementary school in rockford ill when a seven year old told him "the notes you play on the piano sound so sad to me " "well " he told her "you feel a lot better when you play those notes thats what the blues is about making you feel better to get them out " mr goering born in french canada and raised in ohio is he notes " cherokee " but since he first heard a recording by muddy waters when he was nine years old the blues became part of him from his teens on he worked as a blues apprentice in largely black clubs in the south and then in chicago learning from such classic mentors as sunnyland slim little brother montgomery pinetop perkins and muddy waters as he made the blues his own mr goering earned his professional name barrelhouse chuck in debra desalvos invaluable book "the language of the blues" billboard books based on interviews with many classic blues bards she explains "a bar where whisky is served straight from a barrel is called a barrelhouse the up tempo blues that developed in these establishments came to be called barrelhouse and those blues sped up the dancing " listening often to year old barrelhouse chucks cds "got my eyes on you" and "prescription for the blues" www thesirensrecords com also at amazon com i want to dance though i dont know any steps and his singing reminds me of stories jazzmen used to tell me about rambunctious rent parties but he can also make his "sad notes" tell the kinds of stories that later became known as "soul music " the sirens label is a passionate avocation of steven dolins a tenured professor of computer science at bradley university in peoria ill like barrelhouse chuck prof dolins has been drawn to the blues since he was very young and his way of helping keep the blues alive is through his record company in his notes for "prescription for the blues " prof dolins tells how barrelhouse chuck became so deeply steeped in the blues and as ive found out talking to chuck such a vivid storyteller about the pantheon of blues makers and shapers hes known off as well as on the stand writes prof dolins "chuck would show up at his heroes gigs sit in and socialize with them he not only trained with these musicians he would also chauffeur them live with them and ultimately care for them he became their family his recollection of special times with little brother and sunnyland are vivid hilarious and at times bittersweet " for example i was telling barrelhouse chuck how moved i was by his singing of the poignant "school days" on the "got my eyes on you" cd by floyd jones one of the original chicago bluesmen who could be found on sunday mornings singing at the open air maxwell street market "i knew floyd " chuck told me "i saw him just before he died in the hospital i held his hand saw him in the casket and i buried him but his music stays with me " chuck believes that the blues hes lived can stay a living music if enough young people who cant have the mentors he did can feel those sad and barrelhouse notes in the schools where hes told and played his stories the children encouraged him about the future because they clearly "do open up to the blues " of his gig at the elementary school in highland park chuck recalls with pleasure that he was very glad no one there "was trying to tell me about rap music compared to the blues the kids took it all in its like they werent spoiled by the garbage of today on the radio " those two weeks of blues at that school were generated by prof dolins whose daughter was at the time in second grade there he figured his daughter too needed to be educated in this roots music "at home she hears blues all the time but mostly listens to britney spears " there is a growing number of blues in the schools programs around the country but messrs dolins and goering feel strongly that there ought to be many more barrelhouse chuck brightened when i told him that on dec when the president announced the recipients of the annual presidential medal of freedom the countrys highest civilian award b b king an american blues legend was on the list for his "distinguished service" to the nation and i would add the world in jazz critic peter watrous wrote in the new york times "the wells that gave rise to so much american music have seemingly dried up blues culture is dead " but that same year john burnett of national public radio reported from the mississippi delta the deepest fount of black blues about a year old auto mechanic and blues guitarist johnnie billington whod become the johnny appleseed of the blues in the areas schools at the rosa fort middle school he had put together a blues band and as the youngsters played a slow blues mr billington pointed to a kid "you see hes feeling it see " barrelhouse chuck tells me hell accept any invitations he gets to go into classrooms "thats where the future of this music is " its too bad that clear channel and other corporate radio chains and stations have no playing time for barrelhouse chuck mr hentoff writes about jazz for the journal
