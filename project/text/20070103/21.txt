corporate focus business money is everywhere but for how long it may be time to put away the bubbly the new years forecasts are so unrelentingly sanguine that you have to wonder whether a tanker of strong black coffee is in order the u s economy will keep growing the housing market will recover the federal reserve will cut interest rates and financial markets will soar the world it seems has become intoxicated by the steady flow of what my fellow financial writers call "liquidity " money flows freely like the vodka from dennis kozlowskis infamous ice hewn david filling every dark and desolate crevice of the financial world there is a steady stream of resources to the most perilous of emerging markets the most hopeless of troubled companies and the most overextended of home buyers thats great fun while it lasts but does anyone seriously think it will last forever lets start with private equity private equity fund raising set a record last year as did private equity deal making this year will be even bigger look for a precedent breaking &# billion deal to be announced before the big ball falls in times square again the private equity geniuses would have you believe this is because theyve discovered a superior form of running companies perhaps some of them have but mostly what theyve discovered is an amazing gusher of money take the employee retirement system of texas which runs &# billion in pension fund assets for state workers two weeks ago the texas fund announced that it was going to divert to of its funds to private equity investments thats not because the texans have a crystal ball telling them great private equity investment opportunities lie ahead rather its because they see what theyve already missed savvier pension funds and endowments that made private equity bets five or years ago have enjoyed huge returns and everyone else is now scrambling belatedly to get in the game "its important for us to keep in mind were looking in the rearview mirror " trustee craig hester told the austin american statesman yes indeed in the meantime big public companies such as general electric whose plodding shareholder returns have put them out of favor with the pension fund crowd are selling off poorly performing businesses to who else private equity at his companys annual outlook meeting last month ge chief executive jeffrey immelt expressed wonder at his ability to sell off the companys dogs "you know there is just money everywhere today " he said "so youve got a lot of options " does it make sense for pension funds to push ge to sell off weak businesses and then finance the private equity funds that buy them that game has worked well in recent years largely because the privatized companies have been loaded up with cheap debt that ensures highly leveraged returns to their owners if the bubbly stuff dries up however the game returns to basics do private equity firms really do a better job running these companies than the likes of ge that remains to be seen the swollen river of liquidity is also behind happy predictions that housing will recover later this year despite rising default rates mortgages remain cheap and easy lenders are still willing to let borrowers bury themselves in debt to buy a new home the money gusher also helps explain why the federal government in washington can keep spending away without regard for projections of an exploding federal deficit and why the dollar remains relatively strong despite swelling trade deficits or why the dow jones industrial average has managed to go for more than trading days without a daily decline the longest such stretch in its history perhaps this flood of money will continue through the new year fed chairman ben bernanke has argued the money flows are the result of a "global savings glut " newly enriched investors in the developing world need to put their money somewhere and apparently even the most risky assets will do but as long as the good times are rolling dont expect mr bernanke to cut interest rates thats a tool hell only use when the economy takes a serious turn for the worse those who predict otherwise havent been listening to what hes been saying and dont be fooled into thinking that more drinking will ease the inevitable hangover at some point something a string of big defaults a sharp decline in the dollar or god forbid a major terror attack will cause the intoxicating stuff to stop flowing the world is still a risky place and liquidity at the end of the day is just another name for confidence eventually this confidence game will end please send email to business wsj com and see reader comments saturday at wsj com talkingbusiness
