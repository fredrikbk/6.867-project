exodus of skilled workers leaves germany in a bind frankfurt skilled workers such as engineers and doctors are moving out of germany in record numbers and fewer immigrants are arriving leaving some companies with crucial holes in their work forces and threatening the ability of the worlds third largest economy to compete globally high taxes relatively low salaries and inflexible working conditions are among reasons that a record german citizens left the country in the first year since that more germans ventured abroad than returned home that number was up nearly from the trend which continued through the first half of last year according to the most recent data available involves relatively small numbers of people in a nation of million even though it is impossible to tell whether those who leave are gone for good the flight of the countrys engineers academics doctors and others has ignited fears of a brain drain it has spurred some german companies and politicians to demand changes in immigration laws and other actions to attract and keep highly trained workers about of german companies say they cant find qualified candidates for open positions partly because of the flight of highly qualified workers the engineering sector alone boasts openings with architects and electrical engineers among the most sought after "we cannot simply look on as precisely those people emigrate who are valuable well educated and motivated " daimlerchrysler ag chief executive dieter zetsche said in the german weekly der spiegel "we should encourage people to immigrate who can help us solve our problems " however with unemployment at in germany about double the u s rate any loosening of immigration laws would face steep political hurdles the flight of skilled labor is gathering pace at a time when fewer immigrants are coming to work in germany and many other european union countries unfriendly immigration laws discourage many potential replacements for those who are leaving the resulting shortage of highly skilled labor is exacerbated by broader demographic trends that threaten the eus long term economic growth these include low birth rates and the large ranks of retiring baby boomers in the number of foreign citizens migrating to germany fell to down nearly from the same year more people left the netherlands than migrated there france meanwhile added

that some swiss complained about the influx german hospitals are struggling to cope with as many as unfilled posts for physicians that has forced some of those hospitals to redirect patients in need of complicated procedures to better staffed facilities so many academics have left germany that programs have sprung up to lure them back in the german academic exchange service a network of universities technical schools and other educational institutions started a program in the u s called gain which aims to keep german academics abreast of job opportunities back home german businesspeople abroad meanwhile flood blogs with complaints about the problems they faced in their homeland these include limited possibilities for promotion high payments into a pension system that they doubt will last through their own retirements and rigid labor rules that make it hard to switch jobs about engineering and business strategy jobs remain open at continental ag a hannover car parts supplier with billion euros &# billion in sales in in addition to enrolling employees in courses to update and upgrade their skills the company is lobbying the german government to lower the bureaucratic hurdles to recruiting engineers from abroad "the barriers are too high and it simply takes too long " said bettina koerner a continental spokeswoman she said a continuing lack of key personnel would risk damaging the companys ability to innovate and compete job seekers from abroad must prove they possess skills that cant be matched by domestic applicants or that they will earn at

eastern europe when eight former communist bloc countries joined the eu in many economists believe the hundreds of thousands of poles lithuanians and others who moved to work in these countries have
