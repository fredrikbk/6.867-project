whats the matter with kansas topeka kan so what will the topeka school board of brown v board of education infamy say to the brown family this time we could find out tomorrow when school board members vote on an application for the sumner lassiter academy charter school aimed at underperforming students in grades k the school is the brainchild of sandra lassiter and betty horton two of the citys leading school choice proponents "these kids deserve to have education options " says ms lassiter a former principal but the project has another significant backer in the person of cheryl brown henderson a daughter of the lead plaintiff in the historic supreme court decision that ended years of legal black oppression and if these three veteran educators have their druthers and if the fates have any sense of irony sumner lassiter academy will be housed in the now vacant sumner elementary school building the very edifice where ms hendersons sister linda was denied access a half century ago on account of her skin color current school board members dont share the racial animus of their predecessors to be sure but like other local school boards nationwide they do have a vested interest in preserving the public education status quo either way the result is that a disproportionate number of minority students and families whove long been ill served by topekas traditional public schools are being deprived of viable alternatives as ms henderson puts it in her letter of support "accountability access to equal educational opportunity and well trained educators are guarantees that can be put in place by something as simple as considering all options " charter schools are independently contracted public schools that function outside of the district bureaucracy hence theyre free to employ among other things innovative teaching methods extended school days and a longer school year in return for this freedom from union work rules charter operators are held accountable for student achievement unlike traditional public schools charters that fail to educate soon close charter schools have proven popular with children parents and educators alike the first charter was started in minnesota in and today there are some in operation serving more than a million students in states waiting lists are not uncommon still charters are vehemently opposed by the powerful teachers unions which are animated by a "no teacher left behind" mentality that has long put job security above learning ultimately unions see school choice as a threat to their monopolistic control over the existing pedagogic order chester finn and eric osberg of the fordham institute have noted that charter foes deploy a variety of weapons in their effort to limit the educational options of at risk children when opponents cant prevent a state legislature from enacting a charter law they work hard to keep the law as weak as possible and the most effective way of blocking charters is by giving union controlled local school boards exclusive authority over their creation as kansas has done in california arizona florida wisconsin and other states where mayors universities and nonprofits provide multiple pathways to authorization charters are flourishing in kansas however where only the local district can green light a proposal theyve been kept to a minimum only children or just over one half of of k students in the state are enrolled in charters many of which are located in rural areas rather than the urban centers topeka kansas city wichita where school choice is most needed "betty and i began this project because we were very distressed about the performance of kids in the district " says ms lassiter "if youre poor if youre african american if youre hispanic forget it were in a crisis " both women also reject the notion that more education spending would obviate the need for more charters and well they should between and per pupil spending in kansas rose while enrollment remained mostly flat yet when the state released standardized test results last month black and hispanic third grade readers trailed their white counterparts by more than percentage points "the achievement gap is so persistent " says ms horton "even when you infuse the kind of money topeka has millions of dollars in several magnet schools poor children and minority children are still underperforming " topeka has little incentive to grant charters for schools that will compete with the district for students so its no real shock that for the most part it hasnt the local school board has authorized a grand total of two charters since the states charter law was passed in moreover both proposals originated with the district making the schools more akin to extensions of its fiefdom than the truly independent contractors envisioned by the law ms lassiter ms horton and ms henderson all know that the deck is stacked against them they also know that the districts rejection of their application would be final leaving them no recourse other than to start the entire process again and thats exactly what theyll do if necessary "this is about true local control " says ms horton "this is about whether i say what i want for my child or whether a larger entity can dictate what i will get this is about educational civil rights " mr riley is a member of the wall street journals editorial board
