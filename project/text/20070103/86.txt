the daily fix louisville holds off wake forest for victory in the orange bowl it wasnt pretty but louisville got the job done beating wake forest in the orange bowl the no demon deacons looked like they might take advantage of a number of mistakes by the no cardinals and led early in the fourth quarter but louisville then righted itself riding eight play and play drives for the win and an mvp award for quarterback brian brohm mr brohms yards through the air were third in orange bowl history trailing only two guys named tom brady and matt leinart in the louisville courier journal rick bozich calls the game "the tug of war the university of louisville football team didnt anticipate and didnt need on a night when the cardinals hoped to fill the heavy south florida air with sizzling passes and a festival of touchdowns they found themselves in a street fight against a gritty wake forest team that had no plans to disappear the cards were not going to win style points with voters in the bowl championship series they had to forget that idea coach bobby petrinos players were simply trying to grind out enough points to win the fedex orange bowl a landmark moment in the growth of their ascending program some grind some fourth quarter some finish " louisville has legitimate title hopes for but everything may turn on where mr brohm a potential top pick in the nfl draft decides to spend his senior year "from the gmac bowl in to the liberty bowl in to the gator bowl in to the orange bowl in louisville has ascended from a high powered offensive curiosity in conference usa to one of the nations elite bcs conference teams " writes luke winn on si com "big east champs this year national champs the next it could happen but much of it hinges on whether brohm returns for his senior year " wake forests cinderella bid ended in rags but oh what a ball the demon deacons had in the winston salem journal scott sexton celebrates a thrilling year "the little engine that roared magnificently through a thoroughly unexpected and utterly enjoyable football season sputtered and finally died late last night " he writes adding that "once a little time passes and additional perspective is gained this season will be viewed for what it was a magnificent achievement by a lovable group of overachievers that will be celebrated for as long as football is played at wake forest university " in the south florida sun sentinel dave joseph praises an "opposite world" in which a school with just undergraduates could play a bcs game after shocking acc giants "how refreshing " he writes "suddenly a bcs game didnt have to be life and death to be appealing it didnt have to come down to a coachs job on the line it didnt have to feature behemoths like florida state or miami it could star a small tie dyed school from winston salem n c " an unforgettable part of the demon deacons year was linebacker jon abbates in game tribute to his little brother luke who was killed in a car accident last february writing before last nights game ed hardin explained the tradition in the greensboro news record "when the third quarter winds down abbate turns and scans the wake cheering section until he locates his father steven the gesture began this way on the suggestion of the family pastor to make the fourth quarter lukes quarter father and son make eye contact and they hold up their hands five fingers outstretched for luke then the family stands as abbates teammates join in then maryanne abbate has to sit down she cant bear to watch what happens next " still abuzz from monday nights amazing hugely entertaining showdown between oklahoma and boise state in the fiesta bowl well how couldnt you be a wild hook and lateral a statue of liberty play and a postgame marriage proposal by the player who scored the winning touchdown this was sports at the highest level glorious to the point of laughing out loud for the sheer joy of it but wait "boise state tailback ian johnson could have completed the storybook night by saying he was going to disneyland " writes pete thamel of the new york times "johnson however offered a more fitting destination for where he will soon be celebrating in a couple of days ill be back plumbing johnson said of his part time job in boise state " and so may his school metaphorically speaking "the significance of boise states victory may ultimately be judged by where the broncos are ranked at the start of next season " mr thamel writes "boise state the western athletic conference champion has gone over the past five seasons but for some reason it is snubbed every preseason by pollsters and has to grind its way to the top of the rankings " still cant get enough the philadelphia daily newss bill conlin imagines the reaction if scriptwriters had drawn up the events of the fiesta bowl the detroit red wings honored steve yzerman last night raising his no jersey to the rafters during a minute ceremony before a packed house a packed house that left the guest of honor a bit uncomfortable truth be told "its not that the man lacks ego but he counteracts an immense level of self assurance with an equal portion of humble small town canadian perspective " drew sharp writes in the detroit free press "he walked around detroit tuesday with a red face that matched the color of the hockey sweater he graced for years " detroit mr sharp adds "is different than other cities living vicariously through the trials and tribulations of its home teams it bestows upon its brightest sports stars an allegiance that perhaps borders on obsession they might as well be family members as far as detroiters are concerned " in the globe and mail eric duhatschek offers an appreciation of yzerman focusing on two awkward partnerships that turned out to be fruitful yzermans drafting by the then moribund red wings hed wanted to be a new york islander and his early clashes with coach scotty bowman then there was the man himself of course "that capacity to compete harder than the other guys made yzerman unique as a player " mr duhatschek writes "he played inspirationally through a painful knee injury to help canada win olympic gold in he worked as hard as the members of the teams so called grind line kris draper darren mccarty kirk maltby but played the game with a higher ability level it made him the consummate professional the fact that he didnt ask his teammates to do anything that he wasnt prepared to do himself provided the red wings with an invaluable leader someone that could pull all parts of a disparate multi national team together " the shooting death of denver broncos cornerback darrent williams left the philadelphia daily newss john smallwood thinking of and the shooting death of california angels lyman bostock mr bostocks death was national news other than in denver mr williams wasnt "once murder shocked us " mr smallwood writes "now unless the killing is the result of some kind of twisted or bizarre act unless the victim is an a list celebrity unless the killer is famous on the way to infamy murder is just a quick read on the way to a more interesting story so many young men particularly young african american men grow up around violence and death and theyve accepted it as a normal part of life sadly because weve read about it heard about it or even seen it so many times weve done the same thing once the shooting death of a professional athlete would have shocked us now its just another everyday thing " tip of the fix cap to reader roger leibowitz found a good column from the world
