upside down and backward yet tame boston given their reputation as the mischievously subversive renegades of the art and architecture worlds diller scofidio + renfro have created a surprisingly decorous building for the new waterfront site of the institute of contemporary art boston which opened last month at first sight its effect is less "wow " than "huh " pedestrians approach the new square foot ica from its pedestrian looking delivery side the flat wall is an immediate letdown from the expectations raised by the prospect of the first completed building in the u s by these maverick americans previously best known for their work as artists and theorists at its most alluring when strikingly lit at night the museum turns its best face a dramatic foot top floor cantilever overhanging an outdoor expanse of mahogany bleachers away from the city toward the harbor although the spaces for exhibitions education eating and shopping are for the most part serviceably ordinary the architects do defy convention by turning standard museum topography upside down and backward the formal staircase at the front entrance of many traditional museums morphs here into grandstand seating out back the icas ground level main entrance however is a bit of a challenge to find a small heavy glass door tucked away in a corner under an overhanging outdoor staircase to get to the art you must ascend to the top which houses the museums concrete floored sky lit white walled galleries the ica wanted all its exhibition space on one level for a continuous experience and the square foot cantilevered loft in the sky was the architects resourceful solution to the problem of the small allowable footprint below the two levels below the galleries are principally occupied by an attractive steeply raked seat auditorium with a dancer friendly wood floor and an ever changing backdrop of harbor views through floor to ceiling glass artists producing works of theater dance or music for this space may want to figure in the delightful distraction of boats plying the water and seagulls flying in the air if not pushing one button will lower translucent fabric panels to block the view another button activates the descent of blackout panels still in a world of convention busting recent museum architecture in denver milwaukee and bilbao spain for example the exterior of the new ica bears a surprising resemblance to a utilitarian building nearby visible from the museum and a short walk away looms rafael vinolys million square foot boston convention &amp exhibition center also sporting an exaggeratedly protuberant canopy which like the icas has a downward tilting rectangular window jutting out beneath when i asked diller scofidio + renfros elizabeth diller if this resonance with mr vinolys building was intended she looked genuinely horrified and declared "youre the first person whos mentioned that to me ill have to go to look at it " such mainstream comparisons must be jarring to provocateurs known for their biting institutional critiques fully displayed in a retrospective at the whitney museum their most famous built structure was the blur building a pavilion for swiss expo whose "skin" consisted of mist pumped through high pressure nozzles diller + scofidio joined more recently in their practice by charles renfro are also known for an unrealized design commissioned for eyebeam a new york museum for art and technology which resembles the ica with its ribbon like slab folding back and forth to form floors walls and ceilings the wood from the icas rear harbor walk rises up the public grandstand inside the building to the stage floor ascending the auditoriums stairs to its rear wall and its ceiling then outside again to clad the underside of the cantilever it could be that the husband wife duo of ms diller and ricardo scofidio were chastened by being chosen "were intensely interested in the museum as an institution what it means " ms diller noted "as artists we intervened in that system sometimes aggressively all of a sudden were asked to define that wall entirely this is a time when someone like jill medvedow the icas director gets a chance to select people like us who are normally thought of as dissidents in architecture so times have changed " the question is whether famously tradition bound boston has changed enough for the ica to attract its projected annual visitors when bostonians encounter cutting edge art their "perennial" reaction according to ms medvedow is "i dont get it " similarly ms diller noted "it remains to be seen how a museum like this will take in boston i think that on both jills part and our part we feel an equal weight of raising consciousness her about contemporary art us about contemporary space " she noted that although her firm eschewed bostons favorite building material "we did want to use one courtesy brick someplace i feel very naughty saying that " some of the "naughty" in the architects original conception got lost in construction the planned feature i had most eagerly anticipated was a long corridor along the entire width of the cantilever where art was to be hung on its currently bare wall and lenticular glass was to be installed along the side facing the harbor "the glass permits vision out when viewed from a perpendicular direction but blocks vision when viewed from an angle " an earlier press release explained the view of the harbor would follow beside you as you traversed the long corridor but would be obscured if you looked ahead or behind the architects hope that eventually the film creating this novel optical effect will be installed it was vetoed mr scofidio explained by vips including mayor thomas menino who visited the space during construction and favored "keeping the big panoramic view " the icas most audacious space and mr scofidios favorite is the vertiginously sloped mediatheque arrayed with rows of computer stations that were preloaded with educational and interpretive materials and digital artworks suspended from the underside of the cantilevered gallery this room descends to the downward tilting window framing a mesmerizing horizonless view of the water below virtual surfers will need to peer around their computer monitors to monitor the real surf two other areas are disorienting in unintended ways in the soaring lobby the mid afternoon suns fierce glare admitted through the enormous picture window and reflected off the polished wood floor renders vision nearly impossible this poses big problems for the clerk behind the counter of the museum shop struggling to serve customers while blinded by direct sunlight even worse while i was seated in the cafe a loud thud was heard as someone smacked full force into a glass wall beside the confusingly designed exit while the victim iced his forehead outside mr renfro assured me that this fault would be corrected by affixing stickers the icas strong suit as it should be is the intelligently interpreted display of recent art in well proportioned well lit spaces the resourceful creative team led by chief curator nicholas baume has a strong track record of discovering and showcasing new talent now they can better exercise their own talents including the acquisition of works for the icas nascent permanent collection drawn from its own exhibitions in a more commodious flexible environment the inaugural show "super vision " which explores myriad contemporary ways of seeing and being seen highlights a timely topic elucidated by labels and wall text with great clarity whats not yet clear is whether the icas finances will be able to sustain its vision for now it is counting on earned income and contributions to balance its expanded &# million budget but deputy director paul bessire acknowledges that the current endowment of only &# million is inadequate for long term needs "we need &# million for sustainability " also needed the additional buzz and attendance that the stalled development of hotels offices residences and stores in the scruffy area around the icas isolated site would bring "hopefully architects who are building around us will be a little more responsive now that were here " said mr scofidio "i think weve set the bar " ms rosenbaum writes on art and museums for the journal and blogs on culture at www artsjournal com
