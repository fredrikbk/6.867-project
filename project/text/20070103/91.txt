the mossberg solution edited by walter s mossberg making voice mail more like email service eliminates messaging steps press to reply despite spam and other problems email is highly useful and effective you can quickly send and receive messages delete or forward them and save them for reading at a later time a glance at your inbox can tell you a lot about each message including its subject sender and the time it was received but voice mail lags behind in key ways a voice mail still doesnt tell you the callers name or reason for calling unless you listen to at least part of it you usually cant reply to a voice mail with a message of your own as with email instead you must call the person back and you cant easily jump from the most recent voice mail to the th without listening to every message in between still voice mail has its place a phone call is much more personal than an email and lets you use vocal inflection to express your point whereas email expressions can sometimes be misinterpreted and its often easier and faster to speak your message than to type it out this week i tested pinger a free messaging service that tries to make voice mail more usable by emphasizing its strengths and making it a little more like email or like a cellphone text message this new service comes from pinger inc a silicon valley based company started by former palm inc employees pinger works by sending messages using a quick back and forth voice mail system you dial a special number say the recipients name leave a message and hang up the recipient is notified of this message and its sender via short message service sms and or email and then must dial in or go to a web page to hear the voice mail he or she can reply to the voice mail by pressing " " leaving a message for the sender and hanging up you can also log into your pinger account via the www pinger com web site here your pinger voice mails are listed like emails including the senders name time sent length and notes that you can add about each message a green arrow beside messages indicates that you replied and messages can be sorted by category pinger is one of several new services that are trying to bring voice into the internet age one called jott at jott com lets you dial a number and dictate messages to yourself like notes or reminders or messages that can be broadcast to others it even tries to transcribe what you say another called evoca at evoca com records and stores dictation for archiving sharing and podcasting it offers both transcription and translation overall pingers messaging service was most convenient when i was the sender rather than the receiver when i didnt have time to type a message on my blackberry or didnt want to bother with writing a text message on my phones numeric keypad pinger proved to be a fast hassle free process that took only a few tries to get down pat and it was helpful in situations when i wanted to leave a message rather than talk to another person but the process of receiving a pinger message on a mobile device isnt as straightforward as it should be in the time needed to receive and read the pinger text message notification about a voice mail some users could have already received and read a text message or blackberry email i got started with pinger by setting up an account with my first and last name email address and a four digit pin i entered my cellphone number as well as the make and model of my cellphone then i went to the web site pinger com to set up a list of contacts by entering names and email addresses of friends i manually entered a few contacts and then followed steps to import a more complete list of my contacts from microsofts outlook express contacts can also be imported from gmail yahoo aol entourage and outlook you can send and receive messages directly on the pinger site without a phone but you need a computer with a microphone to record messages but pinger is at its best when used as an on the go solution with your cellphone or mobile device i quickly left messages for friends in just a few steps after calling a special number a recorded voice asked "who do you wanna message " i spoke the name of one of my contacts the system repeated it back to me and a tone sounded after which i left my voice mail hanging up automatically sends the message to respond to a pinger message on your cellphone you press your phones "" button after listening to the original message and speak after the tone just like with email you can forward a voice mail or reply to all recipients of the message but until i became familiar with pinger i wasnt sure which numeric commands did what pinger gives as few vocal prompts as possible to simplify things for example if five messages are sent back and forth between two people the entire thread of messages will play back on the voice mail before any vocal prompts are heard this can be a little confusing unless you remember that the "" key always opens a help menu pinger may have trouble finding an audience the idea of using voice mail might be considered too old fashioned for younger users while the thought of receiving a text message to get a voice mail might be too complicated for older users and though pinger is currently free it may charge in the future for people who are already familiar with mobile messaging the extra step of calling in or logging on to a web site to get a message may seem redundant pinger hopes its service will appeal to those who dont currently use text messaging or email on a mobile device but still want a fast way to send messages if you prefer the personal touch of voice mail over email and text messaging or you dont always have time to call someone else for fear of starting an entire conversation pinger works well it takes a little practice to get comfortable with how youll use it in your everyday life but it offers a new way to look at messaging email address mossbergsolution wsj
