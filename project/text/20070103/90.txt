for the e mail here wal mart stores latest move to squeeze more savings from its labor costs seems likely to re inflame the companys critics and possibly stoke new debate over how workers customers employers and shareholders fit into the u s economy the biggest u s private employer plans to begin moving its workers from predictable shifts to a system that follows the number of customers in stores through the day and week the wall street journal reports using a computerized scheduling system akin to techniques being rolled out by much smaller retailers like payless shoesource and radioshack wal mart will begin to fully employ its new regime early this year and while the new system will likely give wal mart increased productivity and customer satisfaction as the journal notes it may play havoc with the lives of its employees workers may be asked to be "on call to meet customer surges or sent home because of a lull resulting in less pay the new systems also alert managers when a worker is approaching full time status or overtime which would require higher wages and benefits so they can scale back that persons schedule " the journal says "that means workers may not know when or if they will need a babysitter or whether they will work enough hours to pay that months bills rather than work three eight hour days someone might now be plugged into six four hour days mornings one week and evenings the next " the company however can benefit from the program and how it would allow stores to add and shed floor and checkout service workers to adjust to midday and

free up managers who are otherwise caught in the laborious task of making schedules the systems plusses and minuses aside wal marts use of such scheduling could promote the practice among other u s retailers since the companys size and long term success have often turned its customs into industry templates but the new scheduling also comes at a time wal mart has been trying to revise its public image following years of criticism from wal mart workers unions and recently some high profile democrats who decry the companys compensation and health care practices for workers and its reliance
