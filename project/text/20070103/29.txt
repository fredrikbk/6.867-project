common sense focusing on the big picture made a banner year smartmoney one year ago i had this to say in my annual new years column "there will be opportunities to make money in and it wont be dull " last year did indeed offer opportunities and lots of excitement to go along with them as ive said many times if you get the big picture right most of the details will fall into place the big picture when it comes to the market requires buying stocks when prices are low and selling when theyre high identifying those times has been a hallmark of this column based on a disciplined approach that looks at where the market has been rather than attempting the futile task of predicting where its going in this respect was terrific the market offered significant buying and selling opportunities to recap in april with the nasdaq near its low for the year i urged readers to buy it took almost a full year for a selling opportunity to arise at the beginning of april i urged readers to be prepared to sell and issued a sell recommendation on april the nasdaq hit an interim high of on april before embarking on a significant correction by mid june i was issuing a buy recommendation the timing in this instance wasnt quite as precise but the nasdaq duly hit its low for the year a little more than a month later the current rally was soon under way and although the nasdaq hasnt hit another of my sell signals i urged readers to raise some cash as the strong rally continued the nasdaq hit its high of the year of on dec it doesnt get much better than this and i once again urge readers not to expect this every year i dont purport to be able to identify precise market tops and bottoms my goal is simply to buy lower and sell higher and in i was amply rewarded my stock picking last year was also consistently profitable two of the "special situations" i recommended have been especially satisfying infrared technology concern flir systems recommended in may and cvs the drugstore chain trying to merge with caremark rx in july flir sank below &# a share before surging to more than &# recently the jury is still out on cvs but in less than two months its shares have recovered from &# to nearly &# another stellar performer has been google which i recommended in early feb when it was trading at about &# and again on march with the stock at &# the stock broke through &# a share before pulling back to &# last week is google stock again nearing a buying opportunity stay tuned in early march i recommended the phone and cable companies at&amp t verizon communications comcast and time warner i have had a long and at times frustrating belief in time warner and just when i was about to despair the stock came to life with all the energy of warners hit movie "happy feet " after sinking below &# in july twx rallied to close last week near &# in fact you could call the year of cable after a long period in the doldrums comcast soared from &# to &# even the stodgy phone companies did well confirming my view that theres room for cable and telephone at&amp t went from &# to &# and verizon from a low of &# to &# among other profitable recommendations last year was microsoft in may as a "value" play at &# a share it recently traded over &# of course no ones perfect and as ive said before if you dont have any losses you arent taking enough risks my biggest disappointment this year has been the dismal performance of the internet stocks ebay and yahoo the lesson ive taken from this humbling experience is that high expectations beget swift retribution when companies falter or simply fail to meet exalted predictions so whats my big prediction for this year with investors in such a good mood from the rally its hard not to be bullish but im going to stick to my mantra for the future there will be opportunities and it wont be dull james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsjcommon
