politics &amp economics clyburn leads southern blacks ascent to top posts in congress washington in this time of change in congress rep james clyburn a ministers son from south carolina takes his place tomorrow as the house majority whip the no democratic post and highest ever held by an african american from a southern district the year old mr clyburn who was before the voting rights act was enacted symbolizes the rise of a set of southern black lawmakers shaped by the region and with a distinctive approach to politics separate from that of black leaders representing urban northern districts georgia rep john lewis a sharecroppers son who won national fame in the civil rights movement will be chairman of a panel within the house tax writing committee rep bennie thompson once a mississippi alderman becomes chairman of the homeland security committee rep mel watt moves up in the financial services panel important to a charlotte banking industry just miles from where he grew up in poverty in north carolina "we have come from a part of the country where it was legal for people to treat people differently because of their color " mr thompson says "in many instances you find a passion for making sure that our systems are fair and equitable on the other hand you find a greater interest in community " their often rural roots and the black educational and religious institutions that sustained them through segregation still influence their politics "its like the turtle on the fence post he didnt get there by himself " says rep sanford bishop d ga "i come from a district that believes in god country work family and guns and not necessarily in that order for rural blacks a shotgun was just another tool on the farm and a way to protect you from the klan " southern black lawmakers also tend to be more conservative than their northern counterparts on social issues political necessity has required them to reach out to business and agricultural interests to gain white support and growing up under segregation put a premium on personal relationships with both blacks and whites that can make them adept at building coalitions in the new congress "i fish in a lot of ponds " mr clyburn says emphasizing his willingness to work with different factions "im basically a manager ive been managing something since i was years old " in congress that has meant fostering ties to departing speaker dennis hastert r ill with whom mr clyburn worked on tax legislation in important to depressed rural areas even as he did so mr clyburn was confronting then sen jesse helms r n c by persuading a reluctant president clinton to make a recess appointment of an african american to the fourth circuit court of appeals mr clyburn one of black freshmen elected to the house in from the south is a strong labor democrat but he admires former treasury secretary robert rubin for "sticking to his guns" in a recent standoff with party liberals in mr clyburn himself broke with his party to support a ban on late term abortions mr clyburn has built upon a set of extended family relationships from the region and across racial lines "i too am a southerner" is the working title of a book he is writing about his life he says racial injustice continues today in cases of white individuals manipulating property values for rural black homeowners but this is also a man who has served on the board of a prominent south carolina bank and maintains a friendship with a washington oil lobbyist whose white grandfather built a bowling alley for blacks in charleston in the s and then hired mr clyburn to teach black customers the game segregation fostered its own competitiveness "your parents told you you had to be twice as good and thats simmering in all of us " says elijah rogers a clyburn friend from their years at south carolina state an historically black college in orangeburg s c "still today we correct each other if there is a slip in grammar " biblical verses are spliced into conversation "whither thou goest i will go " mr clyburn says invoking ruths pledge to naomi after taking over the democratic caucus chairmanship in the last congress mr clyburn an african methodist episcopal churchgoer insisted on beginning party meetings with a prayer "i was always taught you lead by precept and example i thought it would be sinful to lay out precepts if i were not going to be an example " as congress prepares to write a new farm bill this year mr clyburn plans to read a prayer for farm workers at an event tomorrow and amid the outcry for ethics standards he served on a special panel that investigated his friend former rep earl hilliard a black alabama democrat who lost his seat after being reprimanded for misusing campaign funds in support of private companies in which he or his family had an interest "it was one of the hardest things i ever had to do " says mr clyburn who remains friends with mr hilliard "i sat with him just as im sitting with you and i told him im sorry you screwed up and this is the best i can do " that record could help him as democrats try to move their own rules changes this week to address ethics and lobbying abuses and on their agenda next week is a minimum wage increase a key issue for mr clyburns district which includes many of the poorest communities in south carolina the decade long freeze at &# an hour has made it harder for low wage workers to qualify for the child tax credit which was indexed to inflation in the same period and he has little sympathy for republican demands that democrats must bring their bill seeking a &# hourly increase through committee and not directly to the floor "sometimes its good to be smart sometimes its good to be symbolic " he says "i think we ought to bring that bill straight to the floor the old leadership refused to bring it to the floor and were going to bring it " segregations mark is clear in his protective reserve "he is guarded emotionally you never throw that off " said rep barney frank d mass "i wasnt born this way " mr clyburn says "i taught myself to be as reserved as i am in order to survive " as a boy mr clyburn dreamed of being in politics despite warnings from older blacks to keep his ambitions in check the civil rights movement thrust him forward in college when he was arrested several times for demonstrations in an early case the late rev i dequincey newman a mentor and south carolina civil rights activist picked him to take the stand at the trial after mr clyburn and other black students were arrested during an orangeburg s c demonstration it was common then for southern newspapers to print the names of black student protesters on the front page inviting retaliation against their families rev newman argued that in a white society the clyburn family was safe from economic retribution "your daddy is a minister and he aint preaching to no white people your mother is a beautician and shes fixing no white folks hair youre independent of the system nobody gets fired so youre it " mr clyburn says "it was my parents it was because of them i was picked out of the crowd wherever it is you are you dont get there on your own " john west an early progressive among south carolina governors tapped him to be the first black staffer to a sitting governor in modern times their friendship grew and mr clyburn became the states human rights commissioner soon after a post he kept for more than years he twice failed in statewide races but his efforts in south carolinas sixth district helped to oust a conservative democrat in the s who had won until then by playing to white tobacco interests and ignoring the black population and when lines were redrawn to create a majority black district in the early s mr clyburn won a crowded primary without a costly runoff and with sen barack obama d ill an african american considering a presidential run in mr clyburns annual fish fry in april is a must attend session because of south carolinas early primary "dont tell me things dont change " mr lewis says "walk in my shoes walk in jim clyburns "
