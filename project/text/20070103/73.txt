polar bear politics unless youve been hibernating for the winter you have no doubt heard the many alarms about global warming now even the bush administration is getting into the act at least judging from last weeks decision by interior secretary dirk kempthorne to recommend that the majestic polar bear be listed as "threatened" under the endangered species act the closer you inspect this decision however the more it looks like the triumph of politics over science "we are concerned " said mr kempthorne that "the polar bears habitat may literally be melting" due to warmer arctic temperatures however when we called interior spokesman hugh vickery for some elaboration he was a lot less categorical even a tad defensive the "endangered" designation is based less on the actual number of bears in alaska than on "projections into the future " mr vickery said adding that these "projection models" are "tricky business " apparently so because there are in fact more polar bears in the world now than there were years ago as the nearby chart shows see accompanying chart wsj jan the main threat to polar bears in recent decades has been from hunting with estimates as low as to bears in the s and s but thanks to conservation efforts and some cross border cooperation among the u s canada and russia the best estimate today is that the polar bear population is to it also turns out that most of the alarm over the polar bears future stems from a single peer reviewed study which found that the bear population had declined by some or in western hudson bay in the last decade but the polar bears range is far more extensive than hudson bay a u s geological survey of wildlife in the arctic refuge coastal plain concluded that the ice bear populations "may now be near historic highs " one of the leading experts on the polar bear mitchell taylor the manager of wildlife resources for the nunavut territory in canada has found that the canadian polar bear population has actually increased by to from over the past decade mr taylor tells us that in many parts of canada "polar bears are very abundant and productive in some areas they are overly abundant i understand that people not living in the north generally have difficulty grasping the concept of too many polar bears but those who live here have a pretty good grasp of what that is like " those cuddly white bears are the earths largest land carnivores there is no doubt that higher temperatures threaten polar bear habitat by melting sea ice mr kempthorne also says he had little choice because the threshold for triggering a study under the endangered species act is low the bush administration was sued by the usual environmental suspects to make this decision which means that interior will now conduct a year long review before any formal listing decision is made nonetheless the bears seem to have survived despite many other severe warming and cooling periods over the last few thousands of years polar bears are also protected from poaching and environmental damage by the marine mammal protection act so there is little extra advantage to the bears themselves from an "endangered" classification all of which suggests that the real story here is a human one namely about the politics of global warming once a plant or animal is listed under the endangered species act the government must also come up with an elaborate plan to protect its habitat if the polar bear is endangered by warmer temperatures then the environmentalist demand will be that the government do something to address that climate change faster than you can say al gore this would lead to lawsuits and cries in congress demanding federal mandates to reduce greenhouse gas emissions think were exaggerating no sooner had mr kempthorne announced his study than kassie siegel of something called the center for biological diversity told the new york times that "even this administration" would not be able to "write this proposal without acknowledging that the primary threat to polar bears is global warming and without acknowledging the science of global warming " her outfit was one of those who had sued the feds in the first place over the polar bears notwithstanding its location in the frozen tundra of arizona but no matter for want of a few hundred polar bears the entire u s economy could be vulnerable to judicial dictation with that much at stake mr kempthorne could have shown a stiffer backbone in resisting this political pressure at the very least he now has an obligation to ensure that interiors year long study be based on real science and the actual polar bear population rather than rely on computer projections any government decision to limit greenhouse gases deserves to be debated in the open where the public can understand the consequences not legislated by the back door via the endangered species act see related letter "letters to the editor looking at cold facts regarding polar bears" wsj jan see
