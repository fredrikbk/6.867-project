bush remains resolute on tax cuts president discloses plan for a balanced budget and a fix for earmarks washington as democrats prepare to take control of congress president bush sent a strong signal of his continued opposition to tax increases in an op ed in todays editions of the wall street journal mr bush contends that his deep tax cuts have kept the economy strong while shrinking projected deficits "the bottom line is tax relief and spending restraint are good for the american worker good for the american taxpayer and good for the federal budget " mr bush writes "now is not the time to raise taxes on the american people " he also writes for the first time but with few details that the budget he sends congress next month would "balance the federal budget by while funding our priorities and making the tax cuts permanent " mr bushs comments reflect his administrations reliance on tax cuts as both an economic elixir and a political weapon during the congressional campaign as republican scandals and the iraq war increasingly dominated the debate the white house leaned heavily on tax cuts as an antidote for bad news "the main reason for our growing economy is that we cut taxes " mr bush said in his last weekly radio address before the election broadcast live from a colorado coffee shop where he met with small business owners "entrepreneurs like the ones im having breakfast with this morning have put that money to good use they expanded their businesses and theyre creating jobs in their communities " he also frequently attacked democrats on the campaign trail including incoming speaker nancy pelosi for claiming to support tax cuts while voting against many of his mr bushs tax cutting rhetoric though wasnt enough to save republicans from what the president later termed a "thumpin " and as he begins the final two years of his presidency the impact of his arguments might again be muted democratic house leaders have made it clear they arent interested in any broad frontal assault on mr bushs income tax cuts which for the most part are scheduled to last until some democrats have even signaled that they would like to find a tax cut of their own to pass perhaps a longer term fix for the alternative minimum tax still mr bushs comments are sure to resonate on capitol hill in coming weeks as the new democratic majorities consider long term budget resolutions that either dont balance the budget or allow at least some of mr bushs tax cuts to expire down the road ms pelosi and other democrats have even discussed the possibility of raising income taxes for people above a certain level perhaps &# they also face pressure to reach a deal to restore the federal estate tax at some level after bringing the federal deficit to zero by while making permanent the tax cuts that are set to expire in and would require more restraint on spending than either the white house or congress has shown of late the last official white house budget forecast issued in july extended through fiscal and showed a &# billion deficit that year since then a continued surge in tax receipts has improved the outlook somewhat the congressional budget offices august baseline forecast which assumes the expiration of current tax cuts projected a deficit of &# billion by then mr bush will have been long out of office still he is sure to continue to challenge democrats in coming months on spending especially so called earmarks special interest projects in lawmakers districts he also will be tempted to veto spending bills which so far he has failed to do while praising democrats efforts to limit earmarks he promised to announce a permanent fix of his own today more broadly mr bush sounded the theme of federalism suggesting that "government closest to the people is more responsive and accountable" than washington a senior aide to mr bush said the president wasnt firing a fiscal shot across the bow at democrats but was simply "articulating a long held view that tax relief has worked " he added that americans "want their leaders in washington to cut wasteful spending the presidents budget will do just that " mr bush sought to set a tone of bipartisan cooperation in the op ed piece saying he was hopeful he can "find common ground" with democrats mentioning affordable health care energy and immigration reform as possible areas of agreement see related article "what the congress can do for america" wsj jan
