keep the steel rising eliot spitzer has been telling us for well it seems like forever that "on day everything changes " heres one thing that shouldnt the ground zero rebuilding plan the current master plan for those acres in lower manhattan isnt perfect in fact its real far from perfect it barely qualifies as ok but it has this virtue it exists and it is being built slowly haltingly yes but after far too long things are happening downtown beams are reaching skyward or at least aspiring to reach ground level from the bottom of the pit feet below buildings have been designed street grids have been laid on paper anyway mr spitzer the new governor of new york says he intends to take a "fresh look" at ground zero and the freedom tower i say look all you want guv come down here and stare at the site ill even offer to join him under the scaffolding that hangs over that alley formerly known as liberty street come look just dont do anything to slow reconstruction down here along with thousands of other new yorkers i walk past ground zero every work day and i look at it all the time this has given me time to reflect and ive decided that new orleans mayor ray nagin was right its a hole in the ground no question about it only rebuilding can change that sorry fact i dont particularly like the freedom tower its design is uninspiring the economic case for it is dubious at best i have moral reservations about trying to force public sector employees to work in a building that no private sector firm will touch with a foot pole but as a view from my office window it would sure beat a hole in the ground im confident im not alone in this tourists may flock to the fences that gird ground zero but i dont detect a sizable constituency for holey ness down here people whose lives are affected by the mess downtown just want things to stop getting worse and start getting better which means building something the trouble is that while everyones in favor of building something a lot of people differ on what should be built and where and so on its time we moved beyond that the plan weve got is the only one weve got and any alternative is likely to anger as many people who are now content as to content those now angry the real act of leadership here would be to declare that were moving forward that this scar in the fabric of manhattan is going to be repaired so look all you want mr spitzer but keep the concrete mixers mixing and the steel rising new yorkers have waited too long as it is mr carney is a member of the wall street journals editorial board see related letter "letters to the editor a selfish minorty vexes ground zero" wsj january
