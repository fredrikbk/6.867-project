find it on the web watch it on tv a new wave of devices offer to pluck video from internet now coaxing couch potatoes a more capable crop of gadgets is emerging to bring video from the internet to television sets the question is will consumers care that topic will be one of the hottest at the consumer electronics show which kicks off sunday night in las vegas it could also hang over next weeks macworld conference apple computer inc may say more about a &# device first discussed in september under the code name itv that allows tvs to wirelessly retrieve movies and other digital content that users have downloaded onto personal computers the idea of marrying tv with the internet has been discussed for years largely because of its potential impact on the economics of entertainment in theory creators of video programming could use the internet to bypass traditional channels of distribution including cable and satellite networks that trend could lower the cost of delivering content and provide many more entertainment options including interactive programming all that internet content could then be watched on a big screen tv from the comfort of the couch rather than squinting at a pc monitor but the first devices for moving internet content to tvs from pcs sometimes called media adapters havent sold well so far pcs adapted for playing downloaded videos on tvs also havent made much headway despite the high profile backing of intel corp under an initiative called viiv yet apple chief executive steve jobs galvanized a once fragmented market for digital music with the ipod and online music store a well crafted combination of hardware software and services could get more consumers interested in watching internet video on their tvs "the simplicity and the messaging that steve and company are going to put behind that product is really going to help this category " says kevin corbett vice president of intels digital home group hewlett packard co is taking a slightly different tack the computer giant plans to use the ces to promote the idea of high definition tvs that have built in wireless networking to draw downloaded video from pcs in another room says jan luc blakborn an h p director for digital entertainment another focus will be software that could serve as a navigation guide to help users choose among the new web based options on tv screens macrovision corp a silicon valley company best known for technology that helps protect unauthorized use of video and other content today is announcing a &# million deal to buy closely held mediabolic inc a company that sells such software for tvs set top boxes and other products at the moment however internet based tv seems more exciting to futurists than to couch potatoes forrester research last summer conducted a mail in survey of u s households asking consumers how much they would pay for a device that would easily allow internet video to be viewed on their tv sets some of respondents said they werent interested at any price josh bernoff a forrester analyst who is distributing a research report about the market notes that consumers routinely pan unfamiliar product concepts but he adds that the survey results show that educating buyers about such products over the next months will be crucial "people have no idea what youre talking about " he says why should they for one thing the trend could create new tv viewing options including homemade videos from web sites such as youtube concert footage and original programming from independent directors some users may simply want instant access to mainstream movies which may be passed around illegally on the internet or purchased from commercial services such as movielink and cinemanow so far consumers mainly view that material on desktop or laptop computers unless it moves to tvs internet video will remain a niche market mr bernoff and other observers argue "most people watch their televisions and that is not going to change quickly " says james chiddix a cable industry veteran who is chief executive of opentv inc a maker of digital tv software some major players of course have little incentive to open up tvs to the internet cable operators for example already offer broadband internet services on the same wiring that delivers tv channels but they could lose programming revenue if they allow their set top boxes to tap into competition from the web rivals by contrast see web delivered video as a way to neutralize the cable industrys ability to deliver video on demand at&amp t inc for example at the ces plans to show the latest version of homezone a combined satellite tv and internet video service introduced last year it offers a set top box that receives echostar communications corp s dish network service and downloads video content off the web directv group another large u s satellite tv operator has developed a high definition set top box that allows subscribers to retrieve photos and music from computers using viiv technology another way that consumers can transfer web video to a tv is using a pc to download content from the internet and then transferring it with a media adapter that has wireless networking these boxes some as small as an average hardback book typically cost &# to &# or so some early media adapters didnt play video reliably particularly high definition images because their wireless connections were too slow manufacturers including netgear inc d link corp and buffalo inc plan to show improved models at the ces with features including faster wireless technology and the ability to connect using home power lines h p and some other companies are skeptical that consumers will want to buy a new kind of set top box so they are adding networking capabilities to tvs digital video recorders and other consumer electronics products tivo inc for example last year added network connections to let its digital video recorders download a selection of internet based videos one hurdle stems from the many formats used to compress and store video on the internet youtube for example stores video in a format from adobe systems inc called flash that few media adapters support even if they did youtube videos are stored in low resolution that doesnt look good on high definition tvs an answer is to plug internet connected pcs directly into the tv intel has been promoting this concept with its viiv initiative which includes software that helps pcs translate video into tv friendly formats the chip maker is also applying the brand to media adapters and internet videos that have been certified to work well with viiv based pcs though mr corbett acknowledges that most consumers dont understand the options yet surfing with a remote control through so much new programming wont be easy and software to manage the options is a likely focus for companies at ces and macworld apple for example offers a navigation program called front row that could work with its new media adapter which is expected to go on sale in the first quarter for now problems such as format incompatibilities are prompting most players to favor a "walled garden" approach where consumers choose from preselected movies but cant roam to any web site apple is expected to help users view movies that are downloaded from its itunes online store and come from mainstream sources including walt disney co videogame kingpins also are forging links to the web users of microsoft corp s xbox can now use broadband connections to download hundreds of standard and high definition tv shows from a variety of sources sony corp allows users of the playstation to do the same thing though with a shorter menu users now can only get trailers and game demo movies from its so called playstation store on the web but the new game console comes with a browser that allows people to roam to sites such as youtube and watch its videos on tv nintendo co s wii device can also surf the web for videos or other content but the company hasnt emphasized that particular use even suppliers to the cable industry are getting into the act both motorola inc and cisco systems inc s scientific atlanta division are developing ways for their set top boxes to deliver content off the web some industry executives expect competition will eventually force cable operators to adopt such devices and that walled garden services will be supplanted by full web access
