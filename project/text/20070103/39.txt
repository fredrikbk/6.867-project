france seeks path to workplace diversity employers politicians wrestle with traditions that make integration a difficult process paris companies in france have begun scouring the countrys minority communities for untapped talent as changing markets make a diverse work force a valuable asset but beyond the business benefits the effort could help ease the economic disparities that were a major factor in last years nationwide riots france is struggling to adapt its egalitarian approach to education social welfare and employment to the dramatic societal changes brought on by four decades of immigration mainly from africa in fact one of the main impediments to france inc s outreach campaign has been french laws that in the interest of ensuring equality bar the collection of information on race ethnicity religion and the like so many companies have taken it upon themselves to go straight to the source french cosmetics firm loreal sa has started sending managers to high schools to offer coaching on how to write resumes and behave during job interviews car maker psa peugeot citroen sa is selecting some of its new hires through local unemployment agencies and community organizations in the so called banlieues the poor and mostly immigrant neighborhoods on the outskirts of french cities that were the locus of last years violent unrest and several companies including peugot and insurer axa sa have turned to anonymous resumes to help open the job market to mainly black and arab first or second generation immigrants who are estimated to make up of frances population high jobless rates squalid housing and a general alienation from mainstream french life were at the root of the riots during which protesters torched cars and buses and trashed office buildings schools and stores yet despite promises made at the height of the turbulence by the current center right government of president jacques chirac little has been done to improve the plight of banlieue residents how to integrate frances young minorities is at the top of the political agenda ahead of the spring presidential elections in the past few weeks representatives of both the ruling conservative ump party and the left wing socialist party have taken to the streets of the banlieues urging young people to register to vote "the vote is the best molotov cocktail " read one campaign slogan in a poor parisian suburb part of the problem for both politicians and companies is that affirmative action is considered by many in france to contradict the countrys deeply rooted egalitarian ideals and while terms such as "diversity" and "minorities" are slowly entering public discourse the french establishment firmly opposes introducing any sort of quota system in schools companies or public administration earlier this year political squabbles scuttled a bill that would have required companies to conceal personal data including names address and nationality from resumes before examining them and interior minister and presidential hopeful nicolas sarkozy was criticized by members of his center right party when he said he supported "positive discrimination " the anonymous resume bill was dropped because many politicians on the right and left dont like the idea of imposing a hiring system studies conducted within the constraints of french law suggest there are deep inequalities according to a report published in november by jean francois amadieu a professor of sociology at the university of paris a job candidate with a north african sounding name has three times less chance than one with a french sounding name to get an interview after sending out a resume listing the same qualifications in his study mr amadieu concluded that a significant number of employers in france therefore face the risk of being sued for discrimination efforts by individual companies are prompting some changes however when manuella arulnayagam the daughter of sri lankan immigrants graduated from an engineering school in july she spent a year sending out her resume and didnt get a single job interview at one job fair a recruiter dropped ms arulnayagams resume into the garbage can after giving it one glance recalls the now year old from nimes in southern france "throughout my whole life and studies i never wanted to believe that my name or my address could be a problem " ms arulnayagam says then a year ago the young engineer stumbled upon a makeshift job fair in the disadvantaged northern parisian suburb of seine saint denis the fair which had been organized by frances employers association medef and several of the countrys blue chip companies was aimed at finding hidden talent from areas recruiters usually disregard ms arulnayagam was assigned a coach who helped her apply for entry level engineering positions at several top companies she landed offers from oil company total sa and at loreal and opted for the latter under a similar job fair through which it hired ms arulnayagam loreal last year hired an additional nine people according to sylviane balustre derneville head of diversity issues at the cosmetics company ms derneville says one of the biggest challenges of these "job and diversity" programs is persuading young people who live in the banlieue or didnt go to top schools in paris that high profile companies arent off limits "they cant imagine applying or dont dare to " she says peugeot has long relied on foreign workers in its factories but the company now is trying to make its work force more diverse at the managerial level until the mid s the auto makers plant at poissy west of paris relied on charter planes of unskilled workers flown directly from morocco many of the moroccans ended up staying in france and their sons and daughters have now completed high school and university degrees in and around paris to give these and other aspiring professionals a better chance at a job peugeot has teamed with several local community centers in the banlieues around paris to scour for talent like axa peugeot also automatically redacts personal data from resumes received via the internet before they are examined by human resources personnel peugeot says that among the engineers and managers it hired in werent of french nationality were ethnic minorities with french nationality and came from areas in france classified by the government as "particularly underprivileged " to bolster their recruiting efforts french companies are now calling on the government to give them more flexibility in gathering statistics on minorities "we make commitments and take concrete actions but we end up in a situation where we cant even tell if were being efficient or not " says anne fourneau who is in charge of corporate responsibility issues at axa earlier this year axa and loreal both took part in a pilot study by frances national institute of demographics to test employees willingness to disclose their origins according to the studys results people were wary of classifying themselves in a particular ethnic or racial category but were happy to disclose where they or their parents were born for young people like ms arulnayagam the fact that french companies are starting however gradually to tackle diversity issues is a huge step forward it signifies she says "a change in mentality "
