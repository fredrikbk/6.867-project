inside the minds of kravis roberts private equity icons opine on their craft any fool can buy new york in the midtown manhattan office of private equity icon henry kravis an eclectic collection of books competes for shelf space with lucite "tombstone" trophies commemorating kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co takeover deals the tombstones seem to be winning kkr pioneered the buyout business in the late s and did the first leveraged buyout of a publicly traded company when it bought houdaille industries in for &# million even as the private equity business has mushroomed in the past few years kkr still owns bragging rights for the biggest deal ever the &# billion buyout of rjr nabisco in since its opening kkr has done deals and now is among the small handful of so called megafunds that have investment war chests of more than &# billion and are rapidly snapping up companies around the world last year kkr invested &# billion in companies and participated in about &# billion of deals it is expanding outside the u s through a &# billion fund it is raising in asia as well as a billion euros &# billion fund for europe in total kkr has &# billion to invest private equity firms have become some of the biggest employers in the nation mr kravis and his cousin george roberts who are presiding over an expansion of the firm head an investment company that has portfolio companies with &# billion in annual revenue and about employees at a time when private equity firms are the object of growing scrutiny messrs kravis and roberts sat down to discuss how the world has changed and how it hasnt since the early days of kkr mr roberts who is based in menlo park calif was on speaker phone perhaps the most surprising change kkr is no longer the "barbarian at the gate " a term popularized when it became the title of a book that chronicled the rjr nabisco takeover like their counterparts at other top private equity firms messrs kravis and roberts believe that management disillusionment is helping to drive the vast expansion of private equity investing "managements want to take the long term view but they know they get clobbered in the short term " says mr roberts "a lot of companies want to start new projects but they cant because they are afraid of the hit to quarterly earnings even though it may be right in three to five years when we say our average hold before selling the company or taking it public is seven years they sit up " "there is a constant churn in the share ownership of public companies " adds mr kravis "activist shareholders beat up the company because the stock isnt going up our size and indifference to quarterly results may make chief executive officers and boards take us more seriously " of course private equity investors like kkr want and expect good results from their portfolio companies their mission to clean up and turn around the company making it attractive to a buyer in the public or private market that can mean ruthless cost cutting or movement of jobs to cheaper markets in asia or elsewhere moves that fuel criticism of the buyout firms private equity advocates say the process makes firms leaner and more competitive kkr like other big firms such as texas pacific group carlyle group and blackstone group are swimming in cash raising whopping multibillion dollar funds with ease "i have never seen a time like this when money is so available and so global " mr kravis says the two cousins recall what it was like when they did the &# million purchase of houdaille years ago "we had to figure out how much bank debt was out there we enlisted five banks and none of them are around today " says mr roberts "now fast forward years and finance is a commodity and the debt is sold to institutions all around the world today banks will underwrite &# billion of senior debt " still both men insist that the heart of their business is not financial engineering "we spend only about of our time on that " says mr kravis "its all about how to make better operating decisions at our companies we have deeper teams our processes are better we have formalized plans before we buy we also make decisions more quickly on things like whether we have the right management structure " "we hold managements to higher standards because we pay closer attention " adds mr roberts "in a public company ownership is so diverse " critics believe that the private equity buying binge is loading too much debt on target companies messrs roberts and kravis believe the debt issue is overblown "in the average deal was debt and equity " notes mr roberts "in the average deal had equity and debt given that the average company in the standard &amp poors stock index is now eight times the size of years ago that means times the amount of equity of the old days to do a comparable deal that is why we dont believe there is a bubble " but they concede it is possible that some companies controlled by private equity firms may get into trouble some may even end up in the hands of hedge funds that buy the debt of troubled firms in the hope that that debt eventually converts to equity in a bankruptcy restructuring "private equity isnt riskless " says mr kravis speaking generally "some investments wont work out " rjr nabisco probably kkrs best known deal turned out to be less than stellar but "even if a firm loses &# billion on a particular deal its not good but it wont break the firm given that even &# billion is a small amount of the total size of the funds we manage " mr kravis also thinks the proliferation of deals hasnt reached a manic phase "it may seem like deal frenzy today " says mr kravis he says people do deals if the deal makes sense "the dollars are substantially bigger but on a per firm basis it isnt so different since we have grown our resources and human capital so much " all this is a far cry from kkrs early days "in we did eight deals interest rates were and the economy was not doing well " mr roberts recalls "as a firm we were a lot more stretched then there were six of us in the firm " the other big change in the industry is the global reach of the big u s private equity firms "fifty percent of the money raised comes from outside the u s in the s everything was domestic " says mr kravis "in eight of the deals we did were foreign " next year they see even more foreign spending sprees in more obscure places in addition to its core hunting grounds at home in europe and in asia the firm may look more closely at eastern europe turkey and south africa in the future mr kravis says what could bring the boom in private equity activity to an end the two said they havent spent much time focusing on the issue but they have two concerns the first is financial protectionism "if there is more protectionism if there were limitations on investment in the u s and capital flows were cut off that could have an impact on liquidity " says mr kravis he also worries about derivatives "there are staggering amounts of derivatives " he says "if there are difficulties and counterparties start to default that could pose problems" for private equity and other parts of the market one thing that hasnt changed in the decades of private equity "any fool can buy a company " says mr kravis "you should be congratulated when you sell "
