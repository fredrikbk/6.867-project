lack of affordability stymies health issues while i find it imaginative that holman jenkins jr has redefined the term "affluent" those with employer provided health care plans i disagree with his premise that to "fix health care" requires that the "affluent" must be soaked "the biggest secret in health care " business world feb the bigger secret in health care is that the folks who do not have employer provided health care coverage generally do not have access to something even more important they lack the ability and perhaps a legislated compulsion to purchase health insurance at a reasonable cost the biggest problem for these folks is that they are not on a level playing field with the "affluent " because they do not have access to managed care providers or pooled health insurance they are left to fend for themselves and face hospital pharmaceutical and care giver charges that can be three or more times the cost charged through health insurance plans for exactly the same products and services the poor will always be with us and for them we may need to ensure that medicaid is a workable solution but for those who are not "affluent " access to affordable health care insurance is the issue jeff green richmond va
