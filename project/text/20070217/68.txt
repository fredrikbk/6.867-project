pursuits travel central america a booming panama city awaits noriegas return how american retirees and a canal makeover are transforming the capital panama city panama when gen manuel antonio noriega gets back to this lush tropical city after a year absence the former panamanian strongman will scarcely recognize his old haunts i barely did the news that mr noriega plans to come back to panama in september after spending nearly two decades in a u s prison since being deposed in a invasion is the talk of the town his return has momentarily eclipsed the other omnipresent subject of conversation here the real estate boom fueled in part by american retirees which has turned this once laid back city known as a refuge for spies arms dealers and out of work dictators into an enormous building site with a manhattan like skyline in the making good times are expected to keep rolling the countrys famous canal is about to get a multibillion dollar makeover and a chunk of its down and out colonial city center is getting a facelift landing here recently for the first time in many years i recalled mr noriegas last day in panama which i covered for the wall street journal that day i spent hours waiting for mr noriega to come out of the vatican embassy where he had taken refuge from u s troops days earlier soldiers had blared ear splitting rock to drive mr noriega out of his refuge but to no avail i still remember some of the rather pointed musical jabs jimi hendrixs electrifying version of "the star spangled banner" and elvis presleys "jailhouse rock " inside the late msgr jose sebastian laboa who once held the job of devils advocate in the vatican arguing the canonical case against candidates for sainthood used his lawyerly skills to convince mr noriega to surrender mr noriega with his acne scarred face made a perfect villain the type of tyrant the u s at first loves to use and then loves to hate after days of loud music and artful persuasion mr noriega walked out into the waiting arms of u s antidrug agents and on to an eventual u s trial and conviction on drug trafficking charges if he does return to panama authorities have said they will put him on trial for murder in his miami prison suite mr noriega became a born again christian in his absence panama city has also experienced a rebirth of sorts the place teems with hip new restaurants and salsa joints new beach and eco friendly jungle hotels are nearby and ground has been broken on a long planned biodiversity museum by renowned architect frank gehry the rebirth is partly the result of another u s invasion this time by the advance guard of baby boomer retirees who have landed on panama citys shores not only are the americans here so are the canadians and europeans venezuelans one step ahead of the installation of fiery president hugo chavezs version of "st century socialism " are arriving in growing numbers another factor in the remaking of the city was last years vote via national referendum to go forward with a &# billion government funded project to widen the panama canal a few miles from the city center a third set of locks which will allow larger vessels to go through the waterway is expected to be completed by panamanians are betting the canals expansion will boost other related businesses such as insurance and financial services and help maintain growth rates of about the canal has been central to panamas history and its sometimes turbulent relations with the u s in president theodore roosevelt more or less carved out an independent panama from colombia in return for control of a mile swath of panamanian territory cutting through the middle of the country where the canal was built u s control of the "zone" fed panamanian nationalism leading to bloody riots in after thorny negotiations the u s finally turned over total control of the canal to panama in change is even making a dent in panama citys slummy colonial city center once the domain of prostitutes pimps and pickpockets years ago even looking at the fetid jam packed crumbling buildings of the old city made one feel in danger of contracting the yellow fever that mowed down thousands of canal workers in the s theres still work to be done but private and public money is being used to clean up some streets and a couple of squares are now home to trendy eateries many panamanians appear happy with the way their city and country are going carlos weil a former swiss currency trader turned panamanian art dealer who has six passports says the country is attracting people from all over the world half his clients are now foreign boosting his prices and expanding his market foreigners have brought with them lots of new restaurants and even the citys first serious bookstores from colonial times when the city was a key transit point for the transport of gold and silver from the mines of peru to imperial spain commerce has always been panamas driving force the loot then woke the greed of famed pirate sir henry morgan who sacked the city in the ghostly ruins of that first panama city can still be seen a couple of miles from downtown one of the worlds largest offshore banking centers panama still attracts its share of pirates and flim flam men my all time favorite for sheer verve and virtuosity was lloyd s rubin a jackie gleason look alike widely admired here as the king of the upfront fee scam for years mr rubin lured hundreds of would be entrepreneurs to panama where he relieved them of millions of dollars by charging exorbitant fees in exchange for promises to provide investment funds that never materialized in i wrote about mr rubin in the wall street journal the following year a notice appeared in local newspapers announcing mr rubins untimely death in thailand three years later mr rubin rose from the dead he surfaced in ecuador with an alias carlos campbell de cordoba a name i felt almost turned him into a long lost cousin he was returned to the u s where he pled guilty in georgia to fraud charges to do with his panama scheme and spent some time in prison mr rubin now runs an art gallery here panama has historically been a refuge for deposed autocrats and disgraced politicians after irans shah of shahs lost his peacock throne he lived for a few months on nearby contadora island haitis strongman gen raoul cedras a diving enthusiast found refuge here after the u s knocked him out of the box in and in ecuadors president abdala "el loco" bucaram ended up here after the congress dismissed him from office for living up to his nickname mr bucaram who insisted i was an agent for the central intelligence agency in my one interview with him is said to be a habitue of the citys casinos but ive never spotted him among the one armed bandits im happy to say that my favorite bar el pavo real or the peacock billed as panamas only british pub is still around the pavo real was panamas version of ricks cafe from "casablanca " a place where gun runners drug pilots and one of my best sources a cambridge educated insect exterminator who was also an acute social critic got together for drinks the late prima ballerina dame margot fonteyn who was married to a panamanian politician would drop in for lunch so did more recently john le carre in town to write "the tailor of panama " his remake of graham greenes "our man in havana " old panama city had a cozy almost familial air to it anybody who was anybody was related by blood or marriage that was brought home forcefully to me on my first visit to the country i was covering the riots that eventually led to mr noriegas downfall when unbeknownst to me my future father in law the deputy administrator of the panama canal and a man proud of his sicilian bloodline asked panamanian and u s military police to give me some rough treatment for reasons too complicated to go into here he thought mistakenly that i hadnt done the honorable thing by his daughter a diplomat in miami whom i had recently met to set things right he wanted the police forces to find me in the chaos of tear gas and flying rocks and give me a light work over to teach me a lesson in proper etiquette luckily the forces were busy with more important things i married his daughter shortly afterwards and now get along famously with her father that small town feeling where such favors are asked and granted is
