house irresolution a funny thing happened yesterday on the way to the house of representatives vote to "support" the troops but assail their mission in iraq the majority for this "non binding" attempt at gathering political cover was a lot smaller than advertised yes the democrats carried the day and thus can say to their antiwar supporters that they "sent a message " or something to president bush and the iraqis but the margin was smaller than media speculation had predicted with only republicans heading for the tall grass minority leader john boehner and the gop leadership deserve credit for making a spirited argument against the resolution that clearly won over many of their skittish backbenchers credit too to such "moderate" gop members as john mchugh of new york and jim saxton of new jersey who opposed the resolution despite the unpopularity of the war in their states and credit as well to the two democrats gene taylor of mississippi and jim marshall of georgia who didnt join their partys defeatist ranks as for those in favor no fewer than members were for the war before they were against it by our count republicans and democrats voted to authorize the war in october when it was popular but yesterday voted against it now that the going is tough we have more respect for those such as texas republican ron paul or ohio democrat dennis kucinich who voted against the war from the start the immediate effect of the modest majority vote may be to slow the momentum for speaker nancy pelosis "slow bleed" strategy to micromanage the war without actually cutting off funds democrats dont want to leave their fingerprints on defeat in iraq by actually voting to bring the troops home so instead theyre hoping to put restrictions on troop deployments that will make it impossible for the iraq commander general david petraeus to fulfill his mission yesterdays vote showed that if democrats want to execute this cynical duck and run they will have to do it without much republican help
