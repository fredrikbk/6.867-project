pursuits books southern discomfiters arthur raper may have been the best fed best coiffed man in the depression era south as he traveled the region gathering research for his book "the tragedy of lynching " he found that the lunch counter and barbershop were the best sources for unadulterated truth at the time raper was a sociologist working for the commission on interracial cooperation a federal agency created after world war i to help black veterans in the segregated south raper noticed that mob violence tended to make certain local citizens the officials at city hall the men who ran the newspaper guarded or embarrassed in a few cases they were even behind the violence they had nothing to say to an outsider asking questions but raper white and southern himself reared on a farm in north carolina knew how to pump the locals "i was just passing through town " he would say to a waitress "and i heard you had a lynching around here " and she might well respond by telling him what had happened as raper later explained "if youll just keep your mouth shut a little bit and say uh huh every now and then why theyll tell you what they know " people tended to assume raper noted that his attitude was no different from their own one "kind faced motherly" south carolina restaurant owner was particularly forthcoming she acknowledged that a local black man having been accused of raping a white woman had been dragged from the county jail and shot times "they should have burned him " she added for all his folksy technique raper was a scholar on a mission documenting antiblack violence juliette hampton morgan was his spiritual kin bookish in the literal sense she was a librarian and schoolteacher in montgomery ala and no less concerned with the anti black violence of the time but she was although seemingly timid more an activist than a writer three years after rapers "the tragedy of lynching" came out morgan joined the association of southern women for the prevention of lynching it was there in that she and the other members of the association signed a pledge to "no longer remain silent in the face of the crime done in their name " the phrasing refers to the fact that southern whites often lynched blacks accused of sexual crimes for morgan signing such a pledge was a daring step that would eventually cause this shy genteel daughter of "old montgomery" it should be remembered that montgomery was the confederacys first capital to become one of the most vilified whites in the south in the s she openly protested the demeaning treatment to which blacks were routinely subjected on the citys buses a decade later rosa parks in the same city would make the point even more dramatically as it happens raper and morgan wrongly obscure to most of us are each the subject of new biographies louis mazzaris work on raper "southern modernist" louisiana state university pages &# and mary stantons "journey toward justice" university of georgia pages &# remind us that the south was not entirely quiescent in the decades before the civil rights movement of the s and s long before the north sent protesters and camera crews across the mason dixon line a small but determined group of white southerners sought racial change raper and morgan were prominent among them in "southern modernist " mr mazzari has a large canvas to fill raper spent his most crucial working years in atlanta and in greene county ga but he traveled throughout the south and lived for many years in washington later in asia working for various new deal agencies and the state department he wrote almost a dozen books and in public forums he pressed for improved social conditions for both blacks and whites before enjoying a happy retirement on a virginia farm with his wife martha mr mazzari fortunately is more than equal to the task he offers an engaging account of this indefatigable do gooder capturing along the way a lot of period detail about the south and about the social world that raper was investigating needless to say the passages that document rapers research in the early s concerning southern lynching and a culture of violence and intimidation make for grim reading but rapers dogged ebullience acts as a kind of counterweight the easygoing raper delighted in the company of his fellow southerners whatever their views but he felt at odds with jim crow early on during his student days at the university of north carolina at chapel hill where he set up a barbers chair in his dorm room to help pay his way through college he was an outspoken opponent of segregation venting his opinions at the expense of social norms the vexing question of race relations seemed rather simple to him when asked later about his concern for blacks he told an interviewer "i saw they were pretty much discounted by a lot of people i thought they were real folks and had real feelings and deserved to be treated that way and i felt better when i treated them that way " one wishes that mr mazzaris biography had included the sort of photographs by dorothea lange and others that graced rapers own works and evoked the poor mostly rural south where so much drama occurred mary stantons "journey toward justice" does include photos and they are welcome showing the unlikely firebrand juliette hampton morgan as the very stereotype of a lady librarian her warm smile and sparkling eyes more than make up for her rather severe hair and dull dress this moving biography is indeed a portrait of one woman in one town but ms stanton a public administrator in mamaroneck n y is clearly writing about morgan to show generally what compassionate thoughtful people can do in the face of oppression and the price they may pay her earlier "from selma to sorrow" was about viola liuzzo the suburban detroit housewife murdered by the ku klux klan after she took part in the voting rights march from selma ala to montgomery to feel the earthquake that juliette morgan set into motion and the offense she gave it is important to grasp her social position morgans late father had once run for governor she lived with her mother lila bess and grandmother "big momma" both of them grand and demanding women who it can be said metaphorically drove juliette crazy the morgans were friends and neighbors of two prominent montgomery families the bankheads and sayres zelda sayre later fitzgerald after marrying f scott was just about crazy herself and living with her own mother little wonder that morgan suffered panic attacks which is why she did not get a drivers license until she was middle aged her car deprived state gave her plenty of experience riding the bus after years of watching black passengers cursed and spat upon she decided that she couldnt stand it anymore whenever a driver or passenger mistreated an african american morgan would pull on the emergency brake and exit the bus through the rear "colored" door seeing her climb aboard drivers would sometimes taunt blacks just to make morgan get off and walk home in the years leading up to the montgomery bus boycott of morgan wrote a series of eloquent letters to the editor challenging the white supremacy of jim crow they appeared in a variety of alabama newspapers and caused a sensation to her neighbors and acquaintances morgan could come off as a clenched old maid perhaps a little unbalanced but her letters reveal a fully engaged mind and lively intellect a devout episcopalian morgan insisted that the new testament required the equal treatment of everyone no matter their skin color she urged her library unsuccessfully to allow black patrons to use its collections her dec letter to the montgomery advertiser in support of the just begun bus boycott is especially moving "one feels that history is being made in montgomery these days " she wrote "it is hard to imagine a soul so dead a heart so hard a vision so blinded and provincial as to not be moved with admiration at the quiet dignity discipline and dedication with which negroes have conducted their boycott " she compared martin luther king jr s leadership to that of gandhi the first known instance of such a comparison the letter was praised in the black press and denounced in the white friends and library patrons stopped talking to morgan she was harassed with phone calls and the ringing of her doorbell in the middle of the night stones were thrown through the windows of her house even so a new drivers license in hand she picked up montgomerys boycott stranded cooks and maids taking them to work in the morning and back home in the evening but after a jan letter to the editor of the tuscaloosa news her mother called it juliettes "death warrant" commenting on the attempted integration of the university of alabama her world came undone she wrote "i have begun to wonder if there were any men in the state any white men with any sane evaluation of our situation here in the middle of the th century with any good will and most especially any moral courage to express it " after this swipe at the courage of white southern men a cross was burned on the morgans front lawn people boycotted the montgomery library and teenage boys taunted morgan in front of her staff often plagued by depression she found her state of mind deteriorating she underwent shock treatments which just made things worse the citys segregationist mayor determined to get rid of morgan cut her salary from the library budget finally she resigned two days later on july lila bess found her daughter dead in her bedroom next to an empty bottle of sleeping pills despite all the enemies she had made it turned out that juliette morgan also had many admirers they thronged her funeral service but there were no black mourners among them the church where the service was held turned them away mr ferguson lives in weaverville n c
