drop in housing starts stirs worry that wider economy will weaken a sharp drop off in new home construction is adding to concerns that the housing downturns impact could linger well into this year and may eventually seep into the wider economy builders slashed construction of new homes last month to the lowest level in nearly a decade a move that underscores the severity of the sectors slump and signals it will likely continue to be a drag on the economy at least through midyear while lower production among builders has already slowed economic growth stagnant or declining prices in many markets have coincided with an uptick in delinquencies among the riskiest mortgage borrowers monthly home construction readings are volatile and prone to weather induced fluctuations and last months plunge may somewhat overstate the market weakness yet in discussing the risks federal reserve chairman ben bernanke this week said the "spillover effects from developments in the housing market onto consumer spending may be more pronounced than expected " the big concern as yet unrealized is that a deeper housing slump would begin to restrict consumers spending the dominant driver of u s economic growth by making them feel less wealthy and limiting their ability to tap the equity built up in their homes to finance purchases the slip in homebuilding last year subtracted more than percentage point from inflation adjusted economic growth over the second half of there is a possible silver lining the plunge in new homebuilding activity in january down from december and from january levels could eventually hasten a recovery by reducing the overhang of unsold homes so far the weakness in housing has yet to spill over significantly to consumer spending instead it has slowed the pace of expansion just enough to reverse last years inflation surge still the possibility of further deterioration in the sector this year remains a risk to economic growth particularly if it is accompanied by rising loan defaults or a broad tightening of credit standards so far defaults and late payments have remained very low on prime mortgages which are made to lower risk borrowers and account for the bulk of home loans but late payments have risen swiftly over the past year on subprime mortgages those made to risky borrowers with spotty credit histories and on "alt a" mortgages a category between prime and subprime which includes many loans for which borrowers havent documented their income according to trade publication inside mortgage finance of mortgages outstanding are subprime in november payments were at least days overdue on of subprime loans packaged into mortgage securities up from a year earlier according to first american loanperformance a research firm in san francisco for alt a loans the delinquency rate jumped to in november from a year earlier the upsurge in late payments and delinquencies has created turbulence among subprime lenders and some large banks that bought subprime loans a couple of years ago have been pressuring subprime mortgage lenders to buy them back in its most recent survey of senior loan officers released last week the u s federal reserve found that some banks are getting more stringent to guard against the threat of defaults about of domestic banks reported that they had tightened credit standards on residential mortgage loans over the past three months the fed said adding that this was "the highest net fraction posted since the early s " moves to tighten credit standards could "create another leg down" in home sales and prices by making it harder for financially stretched buyers to get home loans said ivy zelman a cleveland based housing analyst for credit suisse group she also warned that rising foreclosures will cause more homes to be put on the market further weighing on prices but fed officials and many other economists say the problems in subprime lending arent severe enough at this point to significantly hamper economic growth doug duncan chief economist of the mortgage bankers association a washington based trade group said only of homeowners have subprime adjustable rate mortgages even if one tenth of these end up in foreclosure the peak hit after the recession mr duncan said that "its hard to see how that can be a macroeconomic event " concern would rise if troubles spread further among lower risk borrowers and lead to more defaults of alt a mortgages another risk is that many subprime loans were made to buy houses in high priced areas which may be more vulnerable to price declines any widespread delinquencies on these loans could result in lenders seizing the underlying homes and dumping them on the market that could exacerbate the industrys inventory problem which has already put downward pressure on prices and forced builders to increase discounts and incentives torn between yesterdays housing reports implications of slower growth and diminished inflationary pressure which makes additional interest rate increases less likely stocks were virtually unchanged yesterday the dow jones industrial average rose three points to close at pat moroney who heads the phoenix division of standard pacific homes a california based home builder said sales cancellation rates in phoenix soared as high as at times last year and averaged for the year as a whole the company has been offering incentives to potential buyers between &# and &# to help move unsold homes in some markets up from &# to &# in "we worked pretty hard to get through our backlog" of unsold homes mr moroney said "weve pushed a lot of cancellations through " in january the cancellation rate fell to he said given the stockpile of unsold homes many industry officials and economists greeted the sharp drop in new home construction last month as welcome news "i think its a positive indicator " said ara k hovnanian chief executive officer of hovnanian enterprises inc a large home builder based in red bank n j he said the figures reflect a decrease in new home orders over the past year and will help builders clear their inventories paving the way for a gradual recovery to begin later this year economists say the sooner builders cut back the sooner a rebound can occur "we look at this number and it makes us a bit more optimistic about when were going to see a recovery " said todd vencil a housing analyst at
