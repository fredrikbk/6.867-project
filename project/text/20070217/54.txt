pursuits food wine notes in the years we have been writing our tastings column which appears on fridays we have received thousands of questions about wine from readers in this column we answer some questions that touch on common themes we have edited the questions for space if you have a question drop us a note at wine wsj com be sure to include your full name city and state port for less i cant justify the &# and up for port wines anymore i recently had a bottle of warres late bottled vintage port wine that was pretty good its price was about &# any other recommendations michael salinas houston the world of port real port from portugal is a complex one vintage port is the top of the line its very special but also can be expensive and needs many years of gentle aging to show its best one less costly alternative is late bottled vintage port which is aged in barrels before its released and is more approachable when its younger its not as complex as vintage port but its still mighty tasty and affordable for much more about this including some specific recommendations drop us a note at wine wsj com and well send along our recent column in smartmoney magazine about lbv as its sometimes called an intemperate cellar my son and i built a small wine cellar in a corner of a crawl space in our home while not as environmentally controlled as one of those pricey wine refrigerators it has the charm of italian tile on the floor stucco walls hand made wine bins and of course the satisfying memories of my son and i building it together having a year of experience with the new wine cellar i have noted that the temperature fluctuates between and degrees are those temperature changes a problem eric gundlach owings mills md its good to hear from someone who understands that the best wine cellars arent just about the wine a good wine cellar is an environment thats full of memories and offers an oasis from the pressures of the real world when we moved to miami many years ago we turned the maids room into a wine cellar with floor to ceiling individual spaces for bottles a shelf for wine books a table and two chairs it had its own bathroom and its own air conditioning unit no matter what was happening in our lives everything was always perfect in that room when we sold that house in the realtor told us that the wine room was a negative because the new owners would simply want to tear it out how times have changed all that said unfortunately yes if you have a serious collection of fine wine you hope to cellar for a while those temperature fluctuations are harmful we would worry less if they were drink now wines the wine cellar sounds so wonderful that its worth speaking to a clever contractor or wine cellar expert to figure out how to make the temperature more constant refilling your glass i want your opinion of some advice i received from a friend of mine who lives in the wine country in northern california he says that one should not add wine to a partially filled glass and should wait until it is empty before refilling apparently the concern is that the newly introduced wine will change the character of the wine poured previously what is your take on this ken burger newport beach calif first in most cases when youre simply drinking a wine for fun and relaxation dont worry about it you dont want to turn one of lifes little joys into a fussy bunch of rules but that said when we are having a special bottle or were conducting a serious tasting we agree with your friend we tend to sip slowly from our glasses and swirl quite a bit so the wine in our glasses has generally been exposed to much more air and warmth than the wine in the bottle we prefer to finish whats in the glass before pouring more this also allows us to smell the empty glass which we often enjoy we would not by any means tell anyone that this is essential to do its just something weve done for a long time
