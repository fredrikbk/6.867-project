pursuits entertainment &amp culture morgenstern on movies how one scene can say everything deconstructing the best five minutes of little miss sunshine we all have favorite scenes from classic films the quirkiness and diversity of our choices can be astonishing lately though ive been struck by how many movie lovers share a fondness for the same part of the same recent picture as soon as i bring up the subject of my favorite moment in "little miss sunshine " someone is sure to finish the sentence ive barely begun with "the one where the son runs away from the van " what makes that moment actually a five minute long sequence so memorable or in my view enthralling the question starts to answer itself when you take the time as ive been doing to study the sequences substance on dvd all of the ingredients that give the movie its special distinction can be found in the emotional and dramatic concentrate of what the dvd menu refers to as scene "end of a dream " watch it on your own as a model of modern filmmaking but read what ive written about it only if youve seen the film theres no way to discuss such exceptional work without giving away crucial plot points and my own point is to celebrate specifics not to spoil pleasure the dream that ends has been dreamed by the touchingly tormented adolescent son dwayne who wants to be a test pilot he wants it so passionately that he has taken a vow of silence inspired by his goofy reading of nietzsche until he gets into the air force academy we know hell blurt out something sooner or later so his silence is a blithely funny set up in a film thats full of funny set ups the entire road trip is a set up for olives performance at the climactic little miss sunshine pageant and unexpected payoffs scene begins as a welcome respite from the shock of the grandfathers death followed by the hilarity of the encounter with a motorcycle cop who never notices the dead body in the back of the vw van inside the van whose broken horn keeps bleating disconsolately olive whiles away the miles by giving her brother an eye test with a chart she found at the hospital then she gives him a color blindness test and suddenly the comedy turns dark dwayne cant see the green a inside the circle of red dots he really is color blind that means as his intermittently suicidal uncle frank explains he can never be a test pilot at first dwayne processes this slowly but then the darkness explodes into full blown horror as the boy goes berserk beating on the seats and windows and when the van stops running from it down an embankment into a suburban field where he finally breaks his silence with a heartbreaking cry of "f f f " within the space of a couple of minutes weve been whipsawed though never manipulated from a state of benign enjoyment through several intermediate zones including anxiety to a sense of authentic tragedy thats remarkable enough but the scenes central drama is yet to come on the embankments edge dwaynes father mother uncle and little sister stare down helplessly at the solitary boy who has fallen to his hands and knees in an agonized crouch his mother ventures toward him tries to console him but hell have none of it he lashes out furiously reminding her of the familys flagrant failures following her retreat olives father turns to his little girl and says fairly hopelessly "you want to try talking to him " as she tiptoes down the slope we wonder what this unworldly child can possibly say the answer is nothing not a word olive puts one arm around dwayne rests her head against his shoulder and sits with him in healing silence its a gorgeous resolution of a desperate situation until the color blind test dwayne has been almost purely a comic character no more dysfunctional in his monkish silence and punkish truculence than the rest of his screwed up family excluding olive of course whos the films radiant life force his parents havent taken the full measure of his chronic anger to do so theyd have to hold themselves as well as their problem child to account but the film takes dwayne seriously from the start even though we dont know until scene what the writer michael arndt and the directors jonathan dayton and valerie faris have in store for him the secret of the films appeal is that its neither a comedy with drama nor a drama with comedy but a story thats open to its characters behavior where their feelings lead them is where the action goes the secret of scene s power is that once the comedy takes a hairpin turn into tragedy the only character who intuits the depth of that tragedy finally gets to act on it olive doesnt draw on some mysterious wisdom when her dad suggests that she try talking to dwayne she knows theres nothing to say shes just a little kid who sees that her brother is suffering but when she applies her comforting touch in that eloquent silence the whole family along with dwayne starts to heal scene is only one of at least as the dvd divides the film scenes that mix density with clarity simplicity with complexity in a modestly budgeted enterprise that may well win an oscar for best picture if that should come to pass it will be partly because this picture projects a bright ray of hope for the future of original films at a bleak conformist time in the mediums history while monster attractions with overhyped stars peddle primitive premises belaboring one primal feeling at a time "little miss sunshine" ebbs and flows dodges and feints derives generous emotional dividends from fugitive feelings and captures without confining the lovely firefly nature of life morgensterns picks making the scene in a perfect world every great scene ever shot would be instantly retrievable in this world a scene like the automat
