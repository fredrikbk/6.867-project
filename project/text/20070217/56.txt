pursuits home did it myself patching things up bonding over manure and other ways to juggle projects and relationship repair in nine years of marriage tom and carol ehart have raised four children moved three times and battled a life threatening illness but nothing quite readied them for this relationship test mr eharts master bathroom renovation "i started it in february of last year and its still not done " he confesses the night before ms ehart began radiation for breast cancer he started ripping out the year old fern textured wallpaper using fabric softener as a lubricant a trick hed read about on the internet says ms ehart "he couldnt fix his wife so he was trying to fix the bathroom " the glue didnt come off but instead of sanding mr ehart just painted over the bumps with martha stewart hydrangea blue his caulking left a thick unsightly line around the tub that he has yet to trim and the new towel rack has fallen off the wall four times "i am married to the most wonderful man who is the best father " explains ms ehart "but this home improvement stuff lets just say hes a big visionary and completion is not his strong suit " for his part mr ehart looks on the bright side "were still married " he says ive wrestled with these issues in my own home my journey along the home improvement path has not only saved me money its empowered me but doing it yourself can mean that relationships get bumped and nicked along the way unfinished projects are just the tip of the iceberg ive found there are thorny issues from time allocation is gutting the kitchen really a fun use of vacation for everyone to measuring sweat equity does cooking dinner and wiring the dvr count as much as painting the living room and if projects go amok the aftermath can tax the infrastructure of love as much as the walls around it andy bell ceo of handyman matters an international franchise of home improvement services knows all about this he reckons about half his companys calls originate from mucked up projects with guys getting most of the blame "its the hubby knows all category where the wife was saying dont do that dont do that " mr bell says when disputes arise on the job his advice to his handymen is firm "always side with the lady but try to keep the pride of the man intact " mr bell says "dig up something small like you did a really good job removing all that drywall buddy " readers familiar with these struggles have emailed tales and counsel about keeping relationships intact amid the flying sawdust michael jones of chapel hill n c made me laugh describing his efforts to get his wife interested in yard work "for years ive told mary ann how great her figure looks especially after mowing the lawn " mr jones says "it helps if you can buttress this by doing some cooking this worked pretty well until she had a hip replacement now i do the mowing and the cooking " when there are two do it yourselfers at home issues of control can arise don shuper of redmond wash advocates the sovereign authority strategy where household regions are divided up "warning " he writes "cross national borders carefully with full disclosure of plans tools and work permit from sovereign authority " meantime several readers noted their mates tendencies to tinker behind their backs "i think the funniest story is how the do it yourselfer on the sly starts a major project while the spouse is on a business trip and comes home to find new stuff replacing the suddenly disappeared old stuff " writes karen albright of apex n c responds her husband doug kaden "i do wait for her to leave town so i can do things without months of shopping and comparisons " as for myself i probably most identify with the travails of norah burden who owns her own home in bucolic rhinebeck n y she tells me that her boyfriend of three plus years is very much a part of the household but "because it is my house we have our power struggles and confusion about whose job is whose " partly the confusion is her own fault ms burden concedes because shes a control freak yet also wants her boyfriend jack involved plus they have different temperaments ms burden is happiest gardening and covered in mud while jack is an "urban creature " desperate to convert him into her dream "dirt haulin guy " she went so far as to buy him a carhartt work jacket for christmas "he looks just great and butch and sexy in it " but compromise is also part of her plan that means making a media room for jack with "the most repulsively large hi def whatever capable tv there is " shes also looked for tasks that might appeal to him and that she doesnt mind relinquishing for starters she put him in charge of all things electronic including rewiring an antique lamp which he completed after three trips to the hardware store and ms burdens online consultation of hgtv com so far so good my situation is similar i owned my house before meeting my girlfriend lisa and spent most of my time off tending to its needs she had a rented city apartment and was used to having weekends free my parents were avid diyers while lisa has no memory of her father ever pushing a lawn mower asking her to pitch in on chores seemed selfish it was my name on the mortgage but i worried that either our relationship or the house would fall apart lisa figured out the answer if we worked together she reasoned wed get the chores finished in half the time and could use the rest to unwind over the last year shes sacrificed her manicure countless times for the house ill never forget driving up one afternoon to find her weed whacking unprompted "you missed a few spots over there " she said steering the machine around me with a grin its not always fun i owe her big for the day we spread pounds of manure in an organic lawn foray but slowly the house has shifted from mine to ours and ive really tried to keep my end of the bargain putting aside one day each weekend to relax frankly i think lisas on to something email did it myself suggestions to wendy bounds wsj com
