pursuits leisure &amp arts sightings lincoln kirstein remembered why new york city ballets co founder has been largely forgotten new york time for a pop quiz what gallery owner gave jackson pollock his first one man show who commissioned aaron copland to write "appalachian spring" who produced the broadway premiere of "a streetcar named desire" if the names of peggy guggenheim elizabeth sprague coolidge and irene selznick failed to come to mind dont be embarrassed great art is made by great artists but much of it is made possible by other talented people more than a few of whom have slipped between the cracks of posterity take lincoln kirstein new york city ballet recently performed a program called "tribute to kirstein " a mixed bill of dances by george balanchine and christopher damboise that was the first installment of a year long celebration of the centennial of kirsteins birth even in his lifetime he wasnt exactly a household name and my guess is that most of the dancegoers who saw "tribute to kirstein" had no more than a vague idea of who he was and why it matters yet modern art in america wouldnt have been the same without him and nycb wouldnt exist at all born in boston in kirstein was the son of a department store magnate but early on he realized that he preferred art to womens lingerie while still an undergraduate at harvard he helped to found the harvard society for contemporary art a precursor to new yorks museum of modern art and edited hound &amp horn one of the most influential "little magazines" of the s and s which published t s eliot james joyce ezra pound and gertrude stein at a time when they were still viewed with suspicion by most american readers in kirstein saw serge diaghilevs legendary ballets russes and fell in love with its sophisticated blend of cutting edge choreography decor and music deciding that america needed a dance company of similar quality he persuaded george balanchine diaghilevs ballet master to come to the u s in to start one that venture proved short lived but the two men continued to collaborate launching the school of american ballet and in the manhattan based dance troupe that became new york city ballet two years later until his death in kirstein worked tirelessly to keep nycb going and it was in large part through his efforts that balanchine long unknown to the public at large came to be recognized as the greatest choreographer of the th century thats quite a resume and the foot kirstein with his stony brahmin profile close cropped hair and sober black suits cut a figure to match christopher isherwood claimed that he looked like "a mad clipper captain out of melville " indeed many people who knew kirstein in the second half of his long life use the word "crazy" to describe him that may be a bit extreme but the violence of his enthusiasms and the manic energy with which he espoused them remind me of a line from edwin oconnors "the last hurrah" "hes not a certifiable lunatic if thats what you mean but hes certainly at that stage where a mans friends begin to call him eccentric " so why is kirstein so poorly remembered one reason is that his actual achievements amount to surprisingly little hound &amp horn folded in and is now known only to scholars kirstein himself longed to be a creative artist but lacked the talent producing only a memoir a long forgotten novel called "flesh is heir " some interesting wartime poetry several books about dance and a fair amount of heavy handed art criticism some of it was strikingly prescient kirstein for instance was among the very first critics to praise the work of elie nadelman and walker evans but like many passionate amateurs his taste was erratic leading him to prefer such minor modernists as paul cadmus and pavel tchelitchev to the likes of henri matisse and fernand leger whom he dismissed as practitioners of "an amusement manipulated by interior decorators and high pressure salesmen " of course kirstein will always be remembered for having co founded nycb and the school of american ballet but probably not all that well even in his own lifetime he stayed in the wings preferring to let balanchine take the curtain calls "people have trouble figuring out who i am " he quipped "they cant make out if im a pr man for the city ballet or if it was all some kind of accident or if im just a rich boy who tagged along " it was no accident and kirstein deserves to be far better known than he is today he reminds me of duncan phillips the millionaire from washington d c who fell in love with modern art discovered along the way that he had a near infallible eye for quality and ended up building one of the finest museums in america like the phillips collection new york city ballet is a monument to a dilettante who turned himself through sheer force of will into a hard headed professional to be sure only a few of the many artistic horses backed by kirstein finished in the money but the one on which he placed the biggest bet came in first thats all it takes to make the history books mr teachout the journals drama critic writes "sightings" every other saturday and blogs about the arts at www
