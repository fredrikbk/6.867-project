worth the weight america is fighting a pitched battle with obesity and obesity appears to be winning according to the trust for americas health the percentage of americans who are overweight rose by percentage points from to to from of adults about half of these adults are technically "obese " this is a significant public health problem because excessive body weight has been linked to high blood pressure diabetes heart disease stroke arthritis respiratory problems and so forth the trend has entered the policy debate and may become an issue in the presidential campaign one republican candidate mike huckabee of arkansas advocates weight "report cards" for kids and instituted them in his state while governor ones proper shape is generally measured with the body mass index bmi which takes both weight and height into account the basic formula for bmi is ones weight in kilograms divided by ones squared height in meters people with a bmi under are "underweight" is "normal" is "overweight" and beyond that is "obese " this standard might strike you as distressingly stringent when translated back into pounds and inches for instance a foot tall man who weighs more than pounds is technically overweight but before this ruins your morning doughnut there is a side to americas weightiness that while not generally discussed is worth considering moderately overweight people tend to be happier than lighter folks indeed according to data from the university of michigan and indiana universitys center on philanthropy people in the overweight category in were less likely than those in the normal range to say they felt inconsolable over the past month they were also less likely to have felt worthless or to say that "everything was an effort " as we all know happiness tends to be reflected in the way we treat others perhaps not surprisingly therefore overweight people are more likely to behave charitably than people in the normal bmi range this is particularly true for men for example while of men in the overweight category gave money to charities in only of men in the normal range gave although giving falls back considerably when we move into obesity overweight men were also the most likely to volunteer their time for various causes and charities not only are they more likely to give overweight men also give away more dollars each year than men in the normal range do in total as well as to most individual types of causes from religion to poverty relief this is not entirely due to the fact that overweight men earn more money although that is also true imagine two men who are identical with respect to income education age race family status and religious affiliation the only difference is that the first has a bmi of while the second is a portly but still respectable on average the heavier man will give about more money away than the thinner man each year your optimal bmi may be between and for doctors but not for fundraisers in fact the top average giving level occurs at a bmi of about for a six foot man this translates into a gentlemanly pounds perhaps a new term should enter the nonprofit lexicon the "philanthropists paunch " it is obvious after only a moments reflection that bmi does not stimulate happiness and even less charity what is striking though is how well it predicts the latter since bmi per se cannot be the cause of happiness or giving differences between people how can we explain these curious patterns there are at least two possibilities first it is self evidently untrue that a bmi below is "normal " when only a minority of adults come in under this number in some communities virtually nobody does there is no disputing that thinner is healthier but between cheap food long work hours supersized restaurant portions and a ban on the delights of nicotine thin is simply no longer how most "normal " well adjusted people look the bright side is that in america unlike many other countries a normal life also involves foursquare virtues like charity and a good deal of happiness second we all know that its harder and harder to stay thin in america the growing effort required to do so might be emblematic in some cases of a tradeoff between focusing on oneself and thinking of others in the "devils dictionary " ambrose bierce defines an abstainer as "a weak person who yields to the temptation of denying himself a pleasure " when it comes to dessert todays abstainer may tend to be the person who denies the rest of us a smile or donation does any of this mean you shouldnt go on a diet of course you should if you need to but if you do dont forget your favorite charity mr brooks a professor of public administration at syracuse universitys maxwell school of public affairs is the author of "who really cares the surprising truth about compassionate conservatism" basic books
