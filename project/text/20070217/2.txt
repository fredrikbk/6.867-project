ask encore focus on retirement the nonspouse beneficiary and the ira can you clarify the current situation for nonspouse beneficiaries of k plans i thought the pension protection act of would require companies to give such beneficiaries the option to roll over their inherited assets to an ira but my plan administrator says the provision in the law isnt mandatory and so far no companies have advised it that they plan to provide for such rollovers furthermore ed slott an ira consultant advises on his web site that an irs ruling in january means the provision may not work for everyone are there any remedies for the problem dennis love marietta ga youre right before congress enacted the pension protection act last august a nonspouse beneficiary was required to withdraw all the inherited money from a retirement plan generally either as a lump sum or within five years that left the heir with a big tax bill and no chance to let the assets keep growing inside a tax deferred account there was no problem for spouses who inherited assets in such a plan because spouses already were allowed to move inherited plan funds to their own individual retirement accounts the new law was intended to let people in addition to spouses who inherit assets in retirement plans such as k s b s and section plans transfer those assets directly to what is called an inherited individual retirement account that way heirs could make withdrawals over their own life expectancies allowing the assets to grow thats the hope anyway while sitting in tax deferred accounts the big wrinkle came last month when the internal revenue service issued a notice intended to clarify the new law the irs said that retirement plans dont have to allow nonspouse beneficiaries to make direct transfers to inherited iras the irs notice surprised some financial planners and accountants including mr slott a rockville centre n y accountant who specializes in iras now if you inherit a k plan from someone other than your spouse you may or may not be able to roll the funds into an inherited ira depending on what the retirement plans rules allow and the irs issued a second memo this week making it clear that the provision wont work for a nonspouse beneficiary who inherited funds in a company sponsored retirement plan before mr slott says if youre a nonspouse who inherited assets in or later from a plan that does allow transfers to inherited iras its important to meet the irss deadlines for making withdrawals you would have to take the first required distribution based on your life expectancy by the end of the year following the year of your benefactors death where you take it from depends on when you transfer the assets to an inherited ira if you make the transfer in the same year as the death you have to take the first required withdrawal from the ira by the end of the year after the death if you do the transfer in the year after the death you have to take the first required distribution from the company retirement plan and then transfer the remaining assets to the inherited ira by the end of the same year says mr slott beneficiaries who fail to meet those deadlines dont get to stretch withdrawals across their life expectancies instead they have to follow the plans timetable for distributions generally taking it as a lump sum or within five years so if you inherit a retirement plan balance from someone other than a spouse the first thing you need to do is figure out what the plan allows if you can make a direct transfer to an inherited ira make sure the assets go directly from the plan to the new account and that you dont touch the funds in between if you do the assets lose their tax deferred status leaving you with a big tax bill for now if you are planning to leave your retirement plan to someone other than your spouse and you want to make sure your heir can stretch out withdrawals over his or her life expectancy your best bet may be rolling the funds into an ira as soon as possible rather than relying on your company retirement plan finally make sure you fill out a beneficiary form for the ira and keep a copy where your heirs would have access to it
