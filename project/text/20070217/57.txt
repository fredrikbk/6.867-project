pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations they sold their soul for a pot of message why do you think everyone is obsessing on the presidential race so early " the question came from a friend who works in magazines i told her id been thinking about the exact same thing were barely less than two years out and yet paying attention to presidential politics as if it were october part of the reason is structural a technological revolution spawned a media revolution new media is determined to win the day old media is desperate to keep up large investments are at stake competition forces its own dynamism everyones filing live on cable on the internet from manchester n h or ames iowa the chatter is everywhere in teddy white stood in the snow by himself in new hampshire and got to reflect now ten thousand teddys flood the zone of course theyre reduced to counting barack obamas nose hairs actually theyre reduced to scrambling over each other for the sound bite from the man on the street when they know actually that there is no man on the street anymore in terms of innocence ingenuousness "my first time seeing a speech by a guy who could be president " every voters a vet the most dismaying thing ive noticed the past years on television is that ordinary people who are guests on morning news shows the man who witnessed the murder the housewife who ran from the flames speak now in perfect sound bites they also cry on cue they used to ramble like unsophisticated folk and try to keep their emotions to themselves anchors had to take them in hand "but what happened then " now the witness knows whats needed and how to do it "and when she didnt come home matt i knew this is not like her and i immediately called the authorities " why does this dismay because its another stepping away from the real artifice detaches us even from ourselves earlier this week i heard a minister quote a spiritual genius "all the problems in the world are caused by mans inability to sit quietly in a room by himself " were restless and need action which in a modern media world means information we need the busy buzz the internet tv instant messages magazines and newspapers the beeps and boops and bops rudys up in iowa hillarys stuck we want to be among the first to have this information and the first to share it and we want it not because its crucial but because it distracts us from the crucial it takes our minds away from what is most important who you are for instance or what we are about its a great relief not to think about the important its a relief to focus on factoids and theres this by obsessing on the presidential race and i mean here not only journalists and editors and professional schmoozers but normal humans by turning our attention to the contests for the nomination and focusing on it and pondering how our neighbors experience edwards or mccain we help convince ourselves that the next guy can solve it all the next president will save us thats why its so important because the next president will turn it all around we like thinking this and i dont blame us i like thinking it too even though i know it isnt true because our next president will not have magical powers but thats not a manageable thought whats manageable is knowing how rudys doing in ames thats our problem the observers problem what about the observed what is the greatest problem with and for the candidates who are running so far there are many having journalists set up boot camp among your nose hairs is one it is hard to be observed and real but heres a bigger problem you remember the story from genesis of the famished brother who gave up his birthright for food "he sold his soul for a mess of pottage " the problem in national politics this year is the number of candidates of whom it could plausibly said "he sold his soul for a pot of message " he became something else adopted new views took stands the opposite of what hed taken in the past because he thought that if he didnt he could not win a base in the base "he" here includes "she " candidates take new views to create a new message you "sell your soul" to put on the policy skin media professionals fashion for you in this way you make yourself into someone else and its not as if the strategists will like you for your flexibility once i asked a political professional if hed come to like and care about the candidates hed worked with and he barked the old cynical strategists line "rule one never fall in love with the meat " the discomfort felt by candidates who do this must be great and echoes into the body politic does he mean what hes saying here when he said the opposite three years ago did he mean that maybe he was lying three years ago and is telling the truth now does that make me like him more or less if he repositions himself now will he reposition himself later these questions leave us scratching our heads the problem is not that people dont change their minds they do and its not that they dont have a right to change their minds they do but its understood as a sincere act only when it is explained when a change in stance is accompanied by an explanation about a change in thinking in approach in weighing new data or old truths otherwise its confusing and mildly disheartening a pragmatist might say it shouldnt be after all if a candidate is pro choice in and pro life in at least you know one thing he wont be changing his mind again everyone gets to change his mind once but on the big issues you only get one bite of the apple but it must be uncomfortable to walk around in a skin that isnt really your own it must be really damaging to your soul if you have a soul and not just appetites or a rugged rocky little sense of what you deserve maybe the candidates would do themselves good by leaving the trail a few days and trying to sit quietly in a room by themselves with no distractions and think about big things such as who they are
