earmarked for death you know the culture of spending on capitol hill is in bad repute when even legendary appropriator robert byrd of west virginia is condemning earmarks this week mr byrd proclaimed on the senate floor that the just completed budget "does not does not n o t include earmarks we eliminate over earmarks " were about to find out if he and his comrades really mean it on thursday white house budget director rob portman issued little noticed guidance to all federal departments and agencies that no congressional requests for spending should be accommodated unless they are "specifically identified in statutory text" which is to say the law this may sound like it ought to be regular practice but its a revolution in the beltway thats because in order to dodge the legislative earmark limits that mr byrd has been bragging about members have been speed dialing executive branch officials and asking them to fund their specific earmark requests out of agency budgets even though they were purged from the larger budget bill this congressional lobbying can be hard for the average federal bureaucrat to refuse since he doesnt want to offend those on capitol hill who control his budget mr portmans directive is intended to stiffen these backbones against such congressional extortion if the attempt succeeds in reducing earmarks this means the fiscal federal budget could have the fewest number of these pork barrel projects in many a year by the way thanks to efforts late last year by gop senators jim demint of south carolina and tom coburn of oklahoma to block a last minute bipartisan spending splurge the budget holds overall federal appropriated spending to the rate of inflation recent years have often seen three times that the budget does still contain a few spending tricks for example it moves &# billion to finance obsolete military base closings in order to pay for such democratic priorities as pell grants and global aids funding closing bases would save money in the long run and the money is supposed to finance the base realignment and closure process that congress approved but all told the fiscal is a change for the better if the executive branch follows the new white house guidance we could come remarkably close to the miracle of an "earmark free" year we assume senator byrd will applaud
