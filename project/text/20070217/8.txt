containing bonuses such as a gun or laser or an extra "life " theres also the deeply hated "flip pill " richard handler a former bond trader and now ceo of brokerage company jefferies group inc says he is constantly trying to beat his high score he plays in elevators and on the way to meetings or even in meetings "if i am on speakerphone on a boring call yes i have been known to play " he says
