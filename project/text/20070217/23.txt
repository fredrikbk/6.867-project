hot topic how expansions die since the current expansion really started to cook in any number of overwrought reasons have been offered to predict that disaster was imminent the budget deficit energy prices the trade deficit the "tapped out" consumer and so on the economy has weathered them all however we finally have a threat that really does bear watching namely a potential credit crunch precipitated by the housing downturn and rising default rates as federal reserve chairman ben bernanke noted in his senate testimony this week the economic damage from the real estate slide has so far been contained to housing but in addition to the pain that homebuilders have experienced banks and mortgage brokers are increasingly feeling the pinch especially in the sub prime sector and in a perverse sort of populism lawmakers are making noises about reducing access to credit for the riskiest borrowers which would only exacerbate the crunch and could help take the economy down into recession the delinquency rate on sub prime mortgages now above is near record levels banks that bought up those loans for securitization are now demanding to be repaid meaning that smaller institutions who thought theyd sold off their exposure are finding themselves on the hook in some cases forcing them into bankruptcy this accumulation of bad loans represents a crack in the foundations of the recovery typically a housing downturn and the credit problems that accompany it are a result of underlying economic weakness rather than their cause the economy slows people lose their jobs and are forced to sell under duress lest they default the distressed selling drives prices down but in this case it may work the other way around the feds remarkably easy monetary policy helped goose house prices over several years in turn a large number of first time buyers took advantage of low mortgage rates especially on adjustable rate loans to stretch their buying power in the hopes of leveraging their way up the home buying ladder but someone finally blew the dog whistle in late and the buying dried up now the housing market is flat to down across most of the country and loans with adjustable rates are adjusting upward so even with unemployment low and the economy still humming marginal buyers can suddenly find themselves forced to sell and if they had little equity to begin with they may not have much money left after they sell if they can sell at all if they cant they fall behind on their payments and the banks have to book the loans as delinquent thus does a virtuous circle caused by easy money turn vicious and interest rates arent even all that high at least not yet the feds concern over housings potential effect on the broader economy is no doubt one reason it has kept short term rates at for several months despite signs that inflation risks remain notwithstanding yesterdays monthly inflation statistics a function mainly of energy prices gold has climbed back up to &# an ounce the dollar is weak and "core" inflation remains above the feds upper limit the unknown is how far the credit contagion will spread while rising overall delinquency rates are still fairly low but if banks continue to be hit by defaults it may constrain their lending in other areas credit spreads which have remained remarkably narrow could widen meanwhile congresss newfound preoccupation with "predatory lending" could if it leads to changes in the law or in tough lending standards increase the credit squeeze currently beginning to be felt decreasing consumer access to credit would in turn cast a pall over consumer spending and add another drag on the economy we arent joining the partisans at certain newspapers who have predicted recession each of the last four years the labor market remains healthy the consumer resilient business investment robust and equity markets buoyant but this certainly is no time for congress to add to the risks of a credit crunch by committing such policy blunders as raising taxes imposing trade barriers or punishing foreign investment in the u s secretary hank paulson has prudently been adding financial plumbing capacity at treasury and he will need it to limit any credit fallout as for the fed we hope the tale mr bernanke told congress this week about perfect "soft landings" was right but we also suspect that the fed chief has his fingers crossed that the rest of the economy at home and abroad is strong enough to withstand the housing credit woes that the fed did more than its share to inspire
