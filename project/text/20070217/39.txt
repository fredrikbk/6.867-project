politics &amp economics african sugar production ramps up eu plan to cut tariffs shows how developing nations can benefit brussels the developing world has been adamant that rich nations abandon farm subsidies in order to get a global trade deal both sides say they want a flood of investment pouring into southern africas sugar industry demonstrates why the poor countries wont back down on this demand the hundreds of millions of dollars being spent to ramp up african sugar production is a direct response to european union plans to slash import duties and subsidies that for years have locked out farmers in developing countries the expansion shows how the eus gradual opening of its farm sector can boost production in some developing countries offer cheaper prices to european consumers and force inefficient eu producers to close "europe is relenting on tariffs that put developing countries at a disadvantage " says leonardo bichara rocha an economist with the london based international sugar organization "outside brazil southern africa is now the hottest spot in the sugar industry " the eu is being made to open its sugar sector by a world trade organization ruling europes nation political and trading bloc still spends roughly billion euros &# billion on farm subsidies annually the eu in particular france is also resisting wider cuts to farm subsidies in the stalled doha round of global trade talks which are designed to encourage rural economies in the developing world but proposals to cut financial support for fruit and vegetables produced in the eu are already being discussed with analysts expecting significant cuts in eu farm aid during the next decade the impact of the planned opening of the eus sugar market suggests those changes could trigger significant investment in some of the worlds poorest rural economies the small mozambique towns of xinavane and mafambisse dusty hardscrabble strips that remind some visitors of the u s s old west are betting big that they will be able to step into the breach when the eu lowers its sugar defenses in roughly two years time sugar concern tongaat hulett group ltd of south africa says it will spend &# million over the next two years to plant roughly an additional acres of sugar cane install modern technology in existing mills and hire more workers the companys south african rival illovo sugar ltd owned by associated british foods plc plans to expand in neighboring zambia although illovos board has yet to sign off on the plan according to a person familiar with the matter a spokesman for illovo declined to comment the &# million tongaat hulett group investment in mozambique is enormous relative to the countrys economy "it will make sugar a national economic pillar " said duarte da silva who covers the country for the tunis based african development bank per capita income in mozambique is &# a year making it one of the poorest places in the world the governments budget much of which is funded by foreign aid was &# billion in according to the international monetary fund "its not easy to find reasons to invest in countries" like mozambique said tongaat hulett chief executive peter staude in an interview "the civil war just ended and there are land mines and machine guns all over " one of the companys executives was shot at recently when his plane landed near the sugar mill in xinavane two things made the investment possible he said one is that mozambique has two functional harbors connected to rail lines infrastructure that doesnt exist in many other poor african countries mr staude said the other was the planned changes to eu sugar tariffs and subsidies "above all we want a platform to sell into the eu " he said for years brussels kept a high wall around its sugar market the worlds second largest after india and guaranteed high prices for the eus domestic producers and farmers often european sugar prices were four times higher than the world average but in the wto ordered the eu to cut sugar subsidies ruling that the payments were distorting global sugar export markets the u s doles out roughly &# billion a year in subsidies and other advantages to its sugar industry but it hasnt been the subject of a wto complaint mainly because the u s exports minimal quantities of sugar the eu has since eliminated a third of its price supports and cut subsidies in a bid to force out inefficient producers it also decided to eliminate duties for the worlds poorest countries which include mozambique and zambia starting jan the eu regulates sugar output and is offering producers money to close up shop farms have already disappeared from latvia ireland and slovenia by the european commission expects sugar production to fall to about million metric tons from almost million tons in while consumption is expected to stay at million tons a year that still leaves room for cheap african producers because eu sugar output could remain unsold the bloc also plans to gradually cut the price it guarantees to its sugar producers by for example the guaranteed price for a metric ton is set to be euros down from euros per metric ton this year the international confederation of european beet growers says the eus proposals will lead to the closing of factories and the loss of jobs in europe "these are hard times and the weakest will perish " said johan de rycker director of public affairs for tiense suikerraffinaderij a belgian sugar company founded in the u s is also opening its sugar market a crack eliminating quotas on sugar imports from mexico starting next year however u s sugar farmers will still receive guaranteed prices for what they produce a farm bill proposed by congress would leave the subsidies package intact for the next five years the eus elimination of import tariffs on most goods from the poorest countries hasnt yet resulted in a bonanza of investment in these countries this is partly because unlike in the case of sugar subsidies for eu producers of other farm products werent cut making it hard for importers to compete some of the countries also lack the fertile soil infrastructure or political stability needed to attract capital outside europe african sugar will likely have little effect on the global market for the sweetener the additional supply from africa will be small relative to sugar giant brazil which is revving up production world sugar prices are below cents a pound down from cents a pound last year
