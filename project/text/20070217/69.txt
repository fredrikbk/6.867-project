showed his copies of old masters paintings to w percy day a special effects expert and matte painter often credited with having invented the technique matte painting is so named because it involves overlaying or combining two separate shots to give the illusion that actors are occupying a grander setting such as the san francisco harbor chockablock with schooner masts in the opening scenes of " leagues under the sea " to produce the effect a portion of the frame meant to be occupied by scenery is blacked out in the filming an artist then paints scenery on glass in the shape of the blacked out area and the two images are combined in the darkroom when done by a professional it can be undetectable the rise of computer graphics has doomed painted matte shots in part because the paintings
