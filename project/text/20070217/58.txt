natural world the american museum of natural history is built on the belief that ones betterment through education will lead to the betterment of all the museums mountain gorilla diorama is an expression of this faith through the transformation of stones and bones into an art without artifice we feel empathy for an unseen world the master of the habitat diorama was a larger than life figure named carl akeley he was an artist who genuinely suffered for his art over two expeditions to africa in the s he faced down charging elephants and strangled an attacking leopard with his bare hands with a genius for invention and a polymaths interest in science naturalism and art he took museum education into the th century with his affecting tableaux of plants and animals his legacy of diorama art is finally getting its due akeley built the first diorama for science education a muskrat habitat still on display at the milwaukee public museum in he also created a culture of taxidermists foreground sculptors and background painters at the american museum that elevated his craft into an art form on the museums akeley eastman pomeroy expedition to africa artists joined scientists in the field shoebox size mockups were ported from camp to camp armed guards kept watch over the painters for fear of animal attacks akeley was there preparing material for a two tiered hall of dioramas dedicated to african mammals which he envisioned would include a heard of elephants as its centerpiece and the mountain gorilla display as its cornerstone each diorama scene would be a precise reproduction of the flora and fauna of an exact time and place each display would require extensive on site analysis each animal specimen would be sculpted in clay prior to mounting before akeley taxidermists stuffed hide with straw when the hall of african mammals opened years later it become akeleys most lasting achievement he never lived to see it in akeley died of dysentery and malaria on the slopes of mount mikeno in africas belgian congo he is buried just beyond view of the site now depicted in the museums mountain gorilla diorama using scientific information gathered from his expedition along with gorilla specimens akeley had collected and prepared in akeleys colleagues completed this diorama in it was a fitting tribute thanks to akeleys efforts on behalf of gorilla conservation belgiums leopold ii established parc nationale albert africas first national park and research facility in the park now spans three countries including the area around mount mikeno today the forest depicted in this diorama would undoubtedly be gone and the mountain gorilla would most likely be extinct were it not for akeley dian fossey a naturalist who walked in akeleys footsteps was killed near mikeno in protecting akeleys "amiable giants" from poachers her story became the subject of "gorillas in the mist " after akeleys death such background artists as james perry wilson foreground sculptors as raymond delucia and taxidermists as robert rockwell went on to exceed akeleys artistic achievements by mid century individual dioramas had taken on theatrical story lines the diorama artist attacked the challenges of dusk variable weather conditions and animals in motion the hall of north american mammals one floor below akeley hall and born from the spirit of akeleys mountain gorilla display contains many of these examples "all of the talents all of the staff and techniques and methods and tricks of the trade that were utilized in the akeley years were then brought to bear on the north american mammals groups " says stephen christopher quinn as the heir to akeleys exhibition department at the museum mr quinn published "windows on nature " the definitive illustrated guide to the dioramas last year as a kid i remember becoming attached to the small winter scene of a canadian lynx creeping up on a snowshoe hare along a rime encrusted ridgeline i imagine i wasnt the only one with feelings for the lynxs prey crouching beneath a balsam fir a similar emotion swept over akeley upon encountering the mountain gorilla "i envy that chap his funeral pyre " akeley wrote in his journal of theodore roosevelt spent his own boyhood in this museum his father was influential in its founding in and the original charter for the museum was signed in his familys home the theodore roosevelt rotunda the museums entrance hall designed by john russell pope has for generations served as the institutions lofty shrine to our conservation minded president affixed to the wall of this hall is the following roosevelt pronouncement "there are no words that can tell the hidden spirit of the wilderness that can reveal its mystery its melancholy and its charm " with his own form of virtual reality carl akeley developed a way to reveal natures hidden spirit without words next time you are at the american museum of natural history step out of the lobby into the akeley hall of african mammals make a left at the mountain gorilla diorama and you will find a masterpiece of diorama art that is as profound as anything in the museum mr panero is the managing editor of the
