players in hollywood and silicon valley will demonstrate theirs they like whats hip new attractive and future oriented in the s that was bill clintons breakthrough baby boomer presidency in its barack obamas multiracial post boomer candidacy that is why three luminous hollywood names the dreamworks trio of steven spielberg jeffrey katzenberg and david geffen are hosting an obama fund raiser in los angeles tuesday and its why one of mr obamas guides through silicon valley is wade randlett an early democratic force there through the technet advocacy group the two power centers represent increasingly important sources of democratic campaign cash the entertainment industry gave federal candidates &# million in donations according to the web site opensecrets org thats more than either drug companies or the oil and gas industry the &# million from the high tech industry lagged just behind those traditional powers nearly two thirds of those entertainment checks went to democrats as did slightly more than half the high tech money hollywood will prove more hospitable antiwar sentiment is fiercer there and mr obama benefits from his early opposition to president bushs iraq policy in contrast to hillary clintons vote to authorize the war silicon valley keeps a closer eye on tax and regulatory policy where mr obamas views are less defined mrs clinton soon to make her own northern california swing including a visit to google executives can boast of the shimmering new economy boom on her husbands watch and she will inherit important pieces of the financial machine that her campaign chairman terry mcauliffe put together for bill clinton then media mogul haim saban for instance has signed up for team clinton once again the first woman with a prime shot at the presidency has some new backers too legendary music producer quincy jones and executive clarence avant have agreed to help her especially valuable recruits this year because they like mr obama are african american "if those two put their shoulders to the wheel thats a huge deal " says one of mrs clintons financial "hill raisers " thats a critical "if " because even the richest american cant contribute more than &# to any candidates primary campaign in presidential fund raising it takes a networker of course the senator from new york has a potent financial network on wall street the campaign donations from the securities and investment industries exceed those of hollywood and silicon valley put together opensecrets org figures show the third top tier democrat john edwards enjoys backing from fellow trial lawyers and lucrative ties to labor unions an even greater source of donations than securities and investment firms but mr obamas left coast trip next week makes clear he will prove a handful for both rivals in the early primary contest over money retail wal marts results likely to show need for changes by gary mcwilliams when wal mart stores inc reports fourth quarter earnings tuesday those hoping for the roar of retails big engine accelerating into the new year are likely to hear gear grinding instead the wall street consensus is that the retailer will post a slender rise in quarterly net income down from a gain in the year earlier period the bentonville ark chains results have been dogged by marketing missteps lackluster gains and cluttered stores increasingly wal mart is reliant on opening new stores to boost its top line to get back into high gear wal mart needs to reignite sales at existing stores sales at stores open at least a year climbed a measly in the past year the lowest pace in at least a decade the retailer has tried various tactics to boost sales but none have worked very well one initiative a big push to attract upscale shoppers actually may have backfired and turned off the core wal mart customer so now wal mart is going back to basics at the companys annual gathering of managers two weeks ago wal mart gave store managers marching orders to present customers with cleaner stores faster checkouts and friendlier employees that the company which has some u s stores and internationally needs to lure customers back is a sign that it has a lot more work left to do it continues to overhaul management appointing a new chief marketing officer and head of u s business strategy in recent days the year starts with a small hill to climb the first quarter will be affected by eight fewer days of sales prior to easter this year the april holiday and passover which ends two days later have had a big impact on first quarter results in the past in the meantime wal mart is still working on turning around weak results in its apparel and home decor businesses two of its five key product segments overhauls last year were blamed in part for softer sales in the two areas despite offering better quality apparel and thread count sheets last year there was no sign of a payoff a bigger mountain is the prospect of a fat settlement in a class action discrimination suit alleging female employees were denied the same pay and promotion as males some wall street analysts are starting to factor the risk of a multibillion dollar settlement into their evaluations goldman sachs group estimates a decision on class action status by the full appeals court known as en banc could come in as little as seven months if the court sustains the plaintiffs chances for a settlement would grow goldman estimates wal mart says it has no plans to settle the suit and insists there are grounds to overturn the granting of class action status but so far two courts have upheld the status and rehearings may serve to keep the issue grinding in the ears of shoppers as well as investors newspapers tribune moves closer to a corporate rewrite by sarah ellison as the auction for tribune co limps to a close it is becoming clear that newspaper publishers cant sell their way out of their current woes tribunes board of directors is scheduled to meet late this coming week and while it is uncertain they will emerge from the meeting with an announcement company management and advisers are casting aside outside offers and working on what is being billed as a "self help" plan that is another way of saying that nobody came to tribunes rescue typically if a company avoids a takeover employees and management breathe a sigh of relief and go back to business as usual but if this auction ends as many expect tribune will have to self inflict the kinds of harsh changes that normally come from an outside buyer that will mean even steeper cost cutting and asset sales that is partly because tribune along with many other newspaper players waited too long to take the dramatic action that now is being thrust upon them tribune was forced into the auction process by its largest shareholder the chandler family which pushed for action just as panic was building about the industrys prospects the irony is that the chandlers were too late they are angling to remove themselves from the newspaper business they should have gotten out of years ago when they sold times mirror co to tribune in today the options are much more limited john rogers chairman and chief executive of ariel capital management one of tribunes biggest holders says the markets fear of newspaper companies is a result of "group think " "we may be looking back on things in the long term and say that this was the bottom of the cycle " he says by that rationale it is a good time to buy into the industry but timing the comeback of the industry is a risky bet and one that few investors are willing to take under the current plan at least tribunes fate is all in the chicago family sam zell a windy city real estate mogul and the chandlers are still circling tribune though any chance of either party making a successful offer is unlikely tribune isnt comfortable with either proposal being proffered and neither party seems willing to increase the terms under the structure being considered the company would spin off its television stations and pay out a dividend to its shareholders then one possibility is that the mccormick tribune foundation tribunes second largest shareholder behind the chandler family would help buy out part of the chandlers stake in the company that would solve two problems for tribune it would reduce the chandlers influence possibly booting them off the board and increase control for the management friendly foundation which is controlled by two former tribune executives the three other foundation board members are current tribune executives who have recused themselves from decision making while the sale process is under way the foundation is adamant that it acts independently from the company but in the past years the foundation has had only directors all of whom have been current or former tribune officials foundation offices sit just floors away from tribune management in chicagos tribune tower it is hard to see how buying up more newspaper stock is good for the mccormick tribune foundation if most shareholders are trying to get out of the newspaper business why wouldnt the mccormick tribune foundation want the same
