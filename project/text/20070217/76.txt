the buzz marketwatch weekend investor stocks long run up makes one bear change his coat sign of the times in a market that is going straight up short sellers are becoming an endangered species even brokers who specialize in finding "short ideas" a bet that prices will fall are dwindling i know one such broker who has been a source for years i called him the other day as i do from time to time to catch up when the discussion rolled around to asking about whether any names he was focused on stood out more than others he had quite a few but they werent companies he viewed as troubled his firms policy doesnt allow his name to be used but his story is too compelling to pass up like many traders who used to short stocks he has found it increasingly difficult to appease clients as they were experiencing losses as the stocks of companies with crummy fundamentals kept climbing "i found that shorting stocks was my bet against prosperity " he says so he started looking for other investments that would be geared more to his customers who tend to be older and he says "dont have the patience to wait it out for shorts to work some of my clients wouldnt even buy green bananas " his hunt focused on companies that were out of the mainstream and somewhat difficult to understand which he felt would give him an edge in a bullish bet for example the shares of centerplate inc which handles food concessions at ballparks and sports arenas are technically called income deposit securities a somewhat complicated structure that represents common stock and debt as is the case with his other holdings centerplate has a good cash flow and pays a robust dividend but his holdings also have higher than normal risks often associated with companies that throw off higher than normal yields which is why he prefers a basket of a dozen or so of these kind of stocks rather than owning just one oh and because all the stocks in that basket have had run ups he wouldnt buy any at current prices moving on options expensing the saga continues several weeks ago i wrote about how earnings per share estimates for many companies arent created equal largely because of the uneven treatment of options expensing by analysts many times they are merely following the lead of the companies whose own earnings reports and guidance excludes options expenses which can cause earnings to look better than they really are those estimates are then picked up by companies such as thomson financial which compiles a consensus number based on what the majority of analysts use as their so called headline estimate pity poor f networks inc which unlike many technology companies told analysts in november at the end of its latest fiscal year that starting in the first quarter it would only report earnings with options fully expensed most analysts ignored the warning and continued to calculate estimates without options expenses which means the first quarter consensus reported last month couldnt help but be a much higher number than the actual number to be sure the cents a share including options expenses was less than consensus of cents a share excluding them as a result fs shares slid in the after market as headlines pointed out the "shortfall " analysts responded by doing their best to crunch numbers and guidance excluding options expenses which makes the stock look cheaper than it really is why do they still do it "we dont know why " says a spokesman for a f networks neither do i what goes up another theme here in recent weeks has been the potential for biotech blowups of companies whose shares have been propped up on hype one area ready made for such stock market silliness is anything related to stem cells which gets us to osiris therapeutics inc i first raised red flags over this company in my column at marketwatch on oct pointing out that it was an early stage venture like profitless yet public company with a half billion dollar market cap before long it was closing in on &# billion before its recent round trip and then some seems as of this past week early stage results of a stem cell treatment to grow knee meniscus didnt go as well as expected the company reminded investors that the meniscus trial is one of four that it is actively involved with which is another way of saying for the gamblers in the room place your bets herb greenberg is senior columnist for marketwatch he doesnt own stocks except those of his employer and doesnt sell individual stocks short or invest in hedge funds marketwatch is a unit of dow jones which publishes the wall street journal email hgreenberg marketwatch com
