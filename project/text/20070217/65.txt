pursuits stadiums so long to the suite life a shift in corporate schmoozing has stadiums ripping out skyboxes what it means for the business of sports it was like watching an era of sports history being erased in early december construction workers sawed through the multiple layers of drywall and metal studs separating a row of skyboxes at the seattle mariners safeco field they tore up the suites beech hardwood floors and carted away their oriental rugs and leather furniture by the end of the week the eight skyboxes were gone in a reversal that strikes at a cornerstone of pro sports finances and of the way corporate america entertains teams around the country are ripping out luxury suites these perches have been used to justify billions of dollars in stadium construction over the past two decades but in many cities they are losing luster with surprising speed partly the result of factors that couldnt have predicted five or years ago from changes in tax laws to scandal driven reforms on corporate entertaining "at gm you cant even buy them a cup of coffee anymore " says lin cummins the marketing chief at automotive supplier arvin meritor in troy mich which has let the leases expire for its suites in four different sports bank of america cut back on its use of a handful of suites in part because it wasnt getting enough clients to fill the seats at pepco an electric products company that decided not to renew three of its four suites the ceo says taking clients on fishing trips is a better and more cost effective way to get face time the milwaukee brewers eliminated five of their suites this off season to make room for a lower priced square foot upscale party area that will be ready for opening day the chicago white sox one season removed from a world series title recently gutted of its suites to build a new press box other teams are hoping they can hold onto some of their suite customers by showering them with perks ranging from cooking classes to free suite renovations the detroit pistons have begun giving some suite holders a &# food credit and a &# credit to buy tickets to concerts and other events held at their arena in some big cities the skyboxes continue to draw consistently the boston red sox for instance have a waiting list but the mariners experience over the last decade shows why some teams are now having to rethink the suite concept when seattles safeco field was completed in the &# million ballpark was a huge draw for a business community that included titans like microsoft and boeing those companies helped boost the teams revenue by more than &# million a year by signing multiyear leases in the stadiums suites the suites which sell for as much as &# per season are a key reason why the team went from struggling financially a decade ago to being one of the most profitable teams in major league baseball by the suites had become a tougher sell for one thing the pool of companies that needed or wanted to entertain people at a time for games was shrinking according to bob aylward the teams executive vice president of business operations the mariners made several moves to try to lift sagging demand in the team began offering game packages for some suites that previously had been sold on a game half or full season basis then late last year following the lead of teams like the tigers and brewers they knocked down eight of the suites and created a lounge where people could get all the food drinks and other amenities of a suite but have it included in the price of a ticket the new all star club is a bit short on intimacy with a capacity of people but it is &# to &# per game versus at least &# for a game suite package the lounge has the potential to generate well over &# million annually which the team says would be a net gain because on a typical night to suites were sitting vacant "were smarter now than we were when we planned this facility " says mr aylward even in an era of rocketing television revenue for sports leagues ticket revenues remain a sizable part of overall revenue accounting for as much as of overall revenue for some baseball teams premium seating which includes luxury suites and club seats can make up close to of that prior to the s sports stadiums and arenas were built mostly with public money and bonds but in the s the formula changed as public money dried up along with taxpayers appetite for subsidizing sports teams whose contributions to the local economy were being increasingly questioned the new model called for sports team owners to pay some of the cost upfront or back the bonds with specific revenue sources like parking concessions and tickets the emergence of luxury suites and other premium seating gave teams a huge boost in the stadium financing game it created a big pot of money in the form of longterm leases that companies signed on the suites that teams could use to guarantee their bonds or contribute to stadium projects in other ways bank of americas decision to cut back on suites got started last summer the company examined employees use of the suites to find out how many of the free tickets were actually going to customers it found that in certain markets which the bank declines to identify the suites werent attracting enough clients to justify a full season lease in response the bank decided to sublease a handful of its suites and says it is considering doing the same with as many as more of its suites bank of america employees now have to fill out a form detailing the names and affiliations of the clients they are bringing and why those guests deserve a spot in the suite the tickets which are kept in a central location are assigned a client identification number and are sent only after the company grants approval for other companies that are cutting back on suites different factors are in play one is a tax provision that requires executives to pay taxes on business expenses like entertaining clients in a skybox that arent a formal part of their compensation more broadly in the post enron sarbanes oxley landscape executives are skittish about accepting both in house freebies and outside gifts that could be construed as a conflict of interest in washington congress has already been tightening its rules on gifts such as access to skyboxes there are other reasons for declining interest in suites now that a greater number of companies have them the perk has become less glamorous and is thus less of a draw at the same time more executives believe they can schmooze clients more easily and more effectively and at less of a cost in other ways in the late s almost all of the more than luxury suites at the cleveland indians jacobs field were sold the team says it has fewer than suites leased for this season the seattle supersonics used to lease more than enough of the suites at key arena to cover the team and citys debt on the facility now only half of the suites are full and the team is deep in the hole and asking for &# million in public funds to build a new arena teams currently charge anywhere from &# a year for loge level suites in small market ballparks like tampa bays tropicana field to as much as &# for the suites at the palace at auburn hills the red sox this season will charge as much as &# for their suites at fenway park after upgrading them with flat panel televisions heated outdoor seats surround sound and granite countertops some teams are trying new approaches to win over people like mr borkey from extra perks to new lounges when the atlanta braves had of the suites at turner field come up for renewal this year they made an offer to companies who decided to renew companies that signed long term extensions paid lower automatic annual price increases than other subscribers the braves also brought in one of the areas top interior decorators to renovate those suites according to the personal tastes of the occupants some teams like the braves are selling suite packages as small as five games and many others are offering up a growing portion of their suites for single game rentals the trend has even spawned a fractional ownership market similar to whats happened with private jets and luxury vacation rentals owners pass llc a california company that purchases suites from professional teams and sells them as part of entertainment packages already has over a dozen professional sports teams as suppliers since launching in another tack some teams are taking replacing their suites with vip rooms or rebuilding them not in the nosebleed section but below the stadium or arena these subterranean suites come with courtside or field level seats so ticket holders can move back and forth between the lounge and their seats the detroit pistons popularized this trend and now everyone from the dallas cowboys to the new jersey devils have similar plans in the works jack borkey sr the ceo of clevelands pepco says he wont miss his suites much his suite for cleveland browns games cost &# per person per game which comes to about &# per game "youre not really getting your moneys worth and you get the same thing done " he says "plus the team stinks "
