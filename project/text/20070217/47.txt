pursuits books muslims and the melting pot challenge american islam by paul m barrett farrar straus &amp giroux pages &# after the sept terrorist attacks most americans recognize that there is no islamist fifth column in the u s if even a small fraction of the four to six million muslims in america were part of such an enterprise the color coded terrorist threat levels would consist only of several shades of red and the council on american islamic relations would have more pressing concerns than the latest season of " " aside from that basic understanding though many of us suffer from a deficit of knowledge about islam not least its manifestation in america the religion is too often condensed into a single ideological bloc or portrayed along a single divide between sunni and shiite or radical and moderate the diversity of sects and views within the muslim population of the u s is hardly acknowledged at all former wall street journal reporter paul barrett attempts to close the gap with "american islam " he shows in compelling detail individual american muslims immigrants and homegrown converts alike practicing their religion in different ways the book is a thoughtful exploration that is both comforting and alarming on the whole mr barrett argues muslims "are an american immigration success story " he notes that "generous welfare benefits in europe allow muslims and other immigrants to live indefinitely on the periphery of society without steady jobs or interaction with the majority " but well educated ambitious muslims from around the world drawn to the u s by the opportunities it presents do not languish on the american periphery most find their way into the mainstream and they often flourish as well mr barrett profiles one such immigrant osama siblani of dearborn mich in the first chapter mr siblani arrived in america with very little worked three jobs to put himself through the university of detroit and founded a newspaper the arab american news the paper became enough of a force that local and national politicians now seek mr siblanis endorsement from pauper to kingmaker that is truly the best of america and mr siblani speaks with heartfelt reverence about the opportunities that america has afforded him so far so inspiring unfortunately mr siblani doesnt stop speaking there telling mr barrett "i support right now the iraqi resistance against american forces " and his paper publishes headlines such as "u s u k and israel the real axis of evil " in the same chapter mr barrett quotes an "aeronautical engineer turned imam" theorizing about americas "hidden plan" in iraq to oppress shiites on behalf of a "zionist special group" dedicated to preventing "the improvement of the relationship between christians and muslims " mr barrett shows the theological allure of islam and its startling challenge to american sensibilities by describing the passionate conversion of grace song a professional woman who had been searching for "a simpler more coherent vision of god " she finds it in islam yet the sheen of her new faith quickly dulls when she is sent to her mosques basement to pray away from the men another female convert recounts being harangued in front of non muslim friends by one of her fellow male congregants for not covering her hair in public a male american muslim preaches in a mosque "any woman who wears perfume so men can smell her it is as if she has advocated adultery " by contrast there is the uplifting story of islamic scholar khaled abou el fadl he progressed from being a kuwaiti teenage fundamentalist one who destroyed his sisters cassette tapes of the infidel singer rod stewart to being a moderate american sheikh and now ucla law professor arguing from quranic text for a humanist renaissance in islam but then other muslims have condemned mr el fadl for "befriending jews and other non muslims supporting muslim apostates endorsing music assisting muslim women claiming spousal abuse and owning forbidden dogs " mr barrett writes he notes further "two thirds of american muslims consider the united states immoral because of permissiveness toward sex outside marriage and toward alcohol both of which islam bans " all of which leads one to wonder did any of these immigrants watch satellite television before deciding to start a new life here yes america is the land of opportunity its also famously the home of "sex and the city" and "the sopranos " its true enough that american citizens need to show cultural sensitivity to diverse newcomers but sensitivity is a two way street a pluralistic affluent society needs to be understood on its own terms too it is a great place to escape repression and economic stagnation but it is most certainly not fertile ground for suburban caliphates based on seventh century mores mr barretts chronicle inevitably prompts such thoughts on the imperatives of our own culture a kind of renewed self awareness the price of admission to america may be a willingness to accept the idea that say women here dress and behave as they please or that our jewish neighbors are not to be demonized and we will enjoy all sorts of music even if some of us also get destructive urges when we hear rod stewart those who want to prostrate themselves before god any god are welcome to do so "american islam" reveals the variety of muslim experience in the u s as well as profound aspects of islam that are underappreciated in this country it also reveals the distance that some american muslims must travel before they will feel at peace in their new home mr macomber is a phillips foundation journalism fellow
