green thumb the right way to count your pile of money the latest government figures show that americans are socking away less for our futures than during any other sustained period since the great depression that sounds alarming however a close look at how the government calculates personal saving suggests the number may be incomplete affluent americans especially ought to be figuring their own savings differently counting important things that well add up below once you do your own math youll have a clearer snapshot of where your wealth really lies and a strong foundation to use as you build your financial plan first a bit about the government figure this month the commerce departments bureau of economic analysis put the nations personal saving at negative &# billion for december to get that number the bureau starts with after tax disposable income then subtracts "personal consumption" of all sorts heres what doesnt get counted though the increased value of stocks or mutual funds in brokerage or retirement accounts or the rising value of your home why not in part because the government doesnt trust fluctuating markets where sudden downturns can wipe out paper gains crashes happen still a different number the federal reserves most recent median family net worth figure is &# thats an all time high unlike commerce the fed does figure in brokerage and retirement accounts plus homes if youre already trying to figure out where you stand pay attention to the nomenclature commerces study of personal saving is all about the verb "saving" what you make minus what you spend but a more complete snapshot may well come from also adding in your "savings " the noun an accounting of your total assets and how theyve grown even if you havent realized the gains yet so try adding in these elements too homeowners could estimate what their residences are worth and subtract what it would take to pay off the mortgage plus taxes and closing costs take the resulting figure and knock off another to be safe since the market could fall in the time it takes to sell it meanwhile brokerage or retirement accounts that are years or more old probably have nice gains racked up above and beyond the intermittent deposits lop off in case of an unforeseen crash next week a bit less if you have lots of bonds or cash economists like the kansas city federal reserves c alan garner have suggested another possibility dont count all of your educational expenses for you or your kids as "consumption " as the commerce department does instead credit yourself for saving if schooling will lead to higher incomes adding all of these numbers up to figure out what you have "saved" turns out to be the easy part calculating what youll need and whether youre on track to get there is much harder when simultaneously saving for retirement college health care and other big ticket items financial planners offer the best help here since personal circumstances vary so widely one further caveat redefining savings does leave some macro questions unanswered too for instance will enough people be able to afford the stocks and houses that retirees will want to offload without damaging the economy still theres no need to let the government figures depress you you may not be a total spendthrift after all save your feedback ron lieber wsj com
