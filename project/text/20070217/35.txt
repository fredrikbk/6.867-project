missing in baghdad my father what happens when a call from iraq upends a reporters life in new york new york about oclock on a mid december morning i was awakened by a call from my brother in iraq "dad is missing " he said he was upset and some of his anger spilled out at me "you should be here " he shouted "you dont seem to care " my father had left home in baghdad that morning to go to the auto repair shop across town where he works fifteen minutes after he left car bombs exploded on his route to work and he hasnt been seen since his disappearance set off a desperate search by my family through the netherworld of war torn baghdad it also put me in the agonizing position of trying to help my family with the violent dislocations of civil war over the phone from thousands of miles away im the oldest son and have been studying and working in new york for more than two years since my father vanished my three grown siblings and my mother have looked to me as the head of the family every time i hear about a bomb going off i brace myself for the worst possible news last february my entire family went missing for two weeks without a word when my cellphone rings and an iraqi number shows up on the display i say a silent prayer before answering my life has always been marked by saddam husseins wars born to sunni parents my mother a homemaker my father a mechanic i grew up in a brick house in a poor baghdad neighborhood where sunnis and shias lived together war with neighboring iran dominated my early childhood many nights iranian jet fighters roared overhead most afternoons we would watch "sowar min al marakah" "pictures from the battle" a propaganda show featuring battlefield footage and the mangled corpses of iranian soldiers my parents once gave me medication to fight a recurring nightmare of being squashed under an iranian tank i was in primary school in when operation desert storm kicked off after saddam husseins invasion of kuwait once a u s missile hit a spice factory near our home we smelled the spices thought it was a chemical attack and covered our mouths with wet towels during most of my teens we lived under u n sanctions on government issued rations of staple foods there were happy times too some of my fondest childhood memories are of the celebrations surrounding the muslim religious holiday of eid during the festival my father used to take me my sisters and my brother to the park for amusement rides to eat kebab and to walk at night by the tigris river i always wanted to be a journalist but under saddam studying journalism was pointless since all newspapers were run and rigorously monitored by the government in middle school i started teaching myself english practicing with translation texts and old american newsmagazines left in our basement by a relative i used to spend hours memorizing vocabulary lists and looking up new words in an outdated dictionary i dreamed of going to school in a western country of traveling the world and writing about it by at the time of the u s invasion of iraq we were already used to war my family evacuated to the countryside with the exception of my father who said that if he had to die he would rather die at home we returned several weeks later after saddam was toppled my father welcomed us back but he appeared broken a secular sunni and fervent patriot he had been against the american invasion and never thought it would happen now he had become pessimistic about the future of his country the looting in the aftermath of the invasion disgusted him "they stole everything from the government buildings around us " he said as we walked in the door "tvs computers and even water pipes " but life continued my father went back to work my younger sister and brother went to high school and my older sister who had graduated with a degree in english helped my mother around the house i found a job as a journalist for a new local english language paper i reported stories on bombings reconstruction projects and other news from all over iraq the violence increased i had been on the job less than one year when the editor an iraqi american left the country afraid that his life was in danger along with three other journalists i kept the publication alive on the web posting news items from an internet cafe in downtown baghdad before he left the editor got me in touch with columbia university in the u s which shortly afterward offered me a scholarship to study journalism my parents said i should accept i did and four months later i took off the morning i left my brother insisted on carrying my big suitcase to the cab my mother splashed a pitcher of water behind me an iraqi tradition wishing a traveler a safe return home with &# in my pocket i took a hour cab ride to jordan and a plane to new york from there by august i settled in new york enjoying the life of a newcomer in his s i started to take classes and learned new things from buckling my seat belt in a plane to working out in a gym from using a washing machine to eating sushi and tandoori dishes later i landed an internship and then a reporting job with this newspaper but as i was getting used to my comfortable new life i was also regularly pulled back into iraq where things were getting worse a few months after my arrival in new york i was chatting with a friend in baghdad on my cellphone when he told me that an acquaintance had died in a roadside bomb attack i became afraid of getting calls from iraq sometimes not answering them i considered changing my phone number so no one could call me with bad news but i could still call people back home when i felt like it other times i became obsessed with fear and would call to check on my family and friends burning through a minute calling card in a weekend when al askaris famous gold domed shiite mosque was bombed last february violence erupted throughout iraq suddenly i couldnt get in touch with anyone back home i didnt know whether my family members were dead or alive whether they were taken by gunmen for ethnic reasons or if it was just that their phone line was down i stopped eating stopped going to work i tried calling at three different times every day to no avail they surfaced two weeks later safe and sound after having fled to the countryside to stay with distant relatives in an effort to escape violence or retaliation against sunnis during an instant message conversation with a friend in iraq the war dealt me its first massive blow haider al maliki a friend from university in baghdad who had come to visit me in new york the year before was found dead his body riddled with bullets he was stopped by unknown gunmen while in a cab in the southern city of amarah and shot on the spot other friends began going to their jobs at the government and in the green zone in disguise trying to avoid haiders fate one friend poses as a student while another takes a roundabout route to work for fear of being followed meanwhile my sister seeing that ethnic violence was increasing near our neighborhood asked me if the family should buy a gun "ask the neighbors what they are doing " i told her not knowing what to do when we talked a week later my family had opted against it my father kept going to work every day despite the rising violence it was one way of staying sane then in december he went missing and i got my brothers frantic call i told my brother to calm down and said that i was here to help that i left the country to help the family "you are there with air conditioning entertaining yourself while we are here in hell " he retorted i tried to ignore the comments i had heard them from him before and told him to focus on the matter at hand he did after dad left he said there was a huge bombing near the central station where he was supposed to transfer to another bus dad never showed up at work and never came back home i told him to go to the area of the bombing a busy marketplace in central baghdad to see where the wounded were taken i also called three of my old friends in baghdad to ask them to accompany him my brother had already asked some of our cousins to visit police stations to see if my father had been taken into custody a few hours later we talked again by that time my brother had visited a local hospital where most victims were taken he said that my father wasnt on the hospitals official list of the dead so he walked around to see if he could recognize him among the wounded he described a scene of chaos and carnage blood was everywhere people were weeping in the halls hospital staff were running back and forth but my father was nowhere to be found two days after the bombing i called my friend ala and asked him to go to the hospital morgue to see if my father might be among the unidentified dead victims who werent carrying ids or were burned beyond recognition ala went and checked three charred bodies but concluded they were not my father one was too fat he said another had hair while my father is bald and the last one was too young and short to be my father my cousin went to a nearby police station a mini fortress surrounded by barbed wire and sandbags to see if my father was mistakenly being held he told the lieutenant that he was looking for his uncle and gave him the name he wasnt there a week passed and my father still hadnt been found on the phone my mother sounded faint and sick but kept saying she was all right she told me to take care of myself and that my father would come back she insisted that my father was fine her proof he was not at the morgue my older sister couldnt keep up appearances she stopped eating stopped taking showers and descended into a depression my younger sister said she hadnt been well for more than a year ever since several cars exploded near her on a market square back then the sight of a childs charred body had sent her into shock for days all she could do was hug her knees and murmur over and over "poor girl they killed her animals " she recalled running through streets awash with blood and sewage packed with civilians pushing flat wooden carts on which they piled the wounded and the dead her condition improved only after she got antidepressants but after my father went missing she spiraled back into a severe depression medical assistance proved elusive this time with violence deterring nurses from visiting on my way to the gym one recent day i got a call from my brother with more bad news a mortar shell hit near my house and damaged the already fragile bedroom walls "do you know that your mother and sisters are sleeping in the hallway shivering in this cold winter " my brother said i told him i would send money exasperated he said that even with money they wouldnt be able to fix the room and that they would sleep in my old bedroom from now on i feel responsible for my family but at the same time helpless i am not a u s citizen or a permanent resident my guest status here prevents me from being able to bring my family to join me i ask them to stay strong and take care and stay indoors i try to give them hope although i know it could be a false hope sometimes i stop calling them for a few weeks to avoid listening to all this ive considered going back many times mostly because i miss my family and i havent seen them for more than two years but that is risky both because of the growing violence and because its not certain that i could leave the u s and return my mother says i should stay here "dont even think of coming back " she told me on the phone a few weeks ago "people are leaving not coming " these days my mother and sisters dont go outside the house at all none of them have traveled before they dont have passports and they dont have the money it takes to buy tickets taxi rides hotel rooms they say there are no guarantees of finding a way to make a living in neighboring countries like jordan i seek consolation in small things that remind me of home i keep three envelopes with my mothers recipes scribbled on them lentil soup tomato sauce with beans and iraqi style biryani next to my bed when bad things happen back home i cook them my laptop is stocked with songs about baghdad i search the internet for pictures of iraq before the u s invasion pictures of the tigris river of bustling baghdad streets of the past that is no longer occasionally i talk to the few iraqis i know in the u s a friend in michigan another in massachusetts a small iraqi flag key chain hangs on a nail sticking out of my wall bombings in the news send me scurrying to my computer for information about the exact time and location of the explosions i lay curled under my green comforter going over in my mind where my family members and friends might have been at the time new friends keep me company while civil war raged in iraq i attended parties celebrating thanksgiving christmas and new years at christmas break i went to the home of a friends aunt in connecticut i shopped for gifts books a t shirt a scarf a tie and we ate a big dinner i dont tell my friends in america too much about what is happening with my family in iraq i try to avoid talking about the war because its so far removed from the worid of restaurants coffee shops and polite conversations i worry people wont understand or dont want to be bothered during a recent dinner in new yorks chinatown a friend asked "hows your family " when i told her about my father she was shocked she offered condolences and said i shouldnt hesitate to ask her for help i felt grateful but a little awkward because i knew that neither she nor anyone else who means well can really change things for my family sometimes my family becomes hopeless and says my father must be dead otherwise he would have returned by now other days they are more optimistic saying that he may have been taken by kidnappers and he will be released the last time we talked my younger sister pleaded with me to help her find a way out of baghdad she said she would cook and clean for me if i could just figure out a way to get her out of there it made my heart sink trying to check on the fate of my father i called my brother on his cellphone the only phone in my familys possession late last month that day bombs had gone off on a shiite market where he likes to shop for dvds and cds press reports said there were more than dead he did not pick up his phone not the next day either i recently reached a friend in iraq who said he had seen my brother but im still waiting for him to call back
