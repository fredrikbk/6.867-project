apple coup how steve jobs played hardball in iphone birth in deal with cingular he called the shots flirting with verizon during a visit to las vegas last december for a rodeo event cingular wireless chief executive stan sigman received a welcome guest steve jobs the apple inc chief stopped by mr sigmans four seasons hotel suite to show off the iphone a sleek cellphone designed to surf the web and double as an ipod music player the phone had been in development by apple and cingular for two years and was weeks away from being revealed to the world and yet this was the first time mr sigman got to see it for three hours mr jobs played with the device with its touch screen that allows users to view contacts dial numbers and flip through photos with the swipe of a finger mr sigman looked on in awe according to a person familiar with the meeting behind the scenes in the making of the iphone apple bucked the rules of the cellphone industry by wresting control away from the normally powerful wireless carriers these service providers usually hold enormous sway over how phones are developed and marketed controlling every detail from processing power to the various features that come with the phone not so with apple and cingular only three executives at the carrier which is now the wireless unit of at&amp t inc got to see the iphone before it was announced cingular agreed to leave its brand off the body of the phone upsetting some cingular insiders it also abandoned its usual insistence that phone makers carry its software for web surfing ringtones and other services the deal also calls for cingular to share with apple a portion of the monthly revenues from subscribers a person familiar with the matter says in another break with standard practice the iphone will have an exclusive retail network the partners are making it available only through cingular and apple stores as well as both companies web sites mr jobs once referred to telecom operators as "orifices" that other companies including phone makers must go through to reach consumers while meeting with cingular and other wireless operators he often reminded them of his view dismissing them as commodities and telling them that they would never understand the web and entertainment industry the way apple did a person familiar with the talks says mr jobs flirted with other titans of the wireless industry but not everyone wanted to play ball talks with verizon wireless fell through mr sigman and other top cingular executives were willing to cede control to mr jobs and tolerate his digs at cellphone carriers all for the privilege of being the exclusive u s provider of one of the most highly anticipated consumer electronics devices in years and to deny rivals a chance to do the same according to people with knowledge of the situation cingular and apple declined to make executives available to comment for this story mr jobs is famous for making a splash with new products that upend industry models several years ago he personally lobbied music industry executives and obtained licenses for songs that gave apple the flexibility to build its successful itunes store apple eyed the cellphone market as both an opportunity to expand its ipod business and if ignored a potential threat to the company people familiar with its strategy say cellphones are gradually offering more sophisticated capabilities and features including increased storage capacity and entertainment functions that stands to make them more competitive with ipods over time already music phones like samsung electronics co s blackjack sony ericssons walkman models and lg electronic inc s chocolate are edging onto apples turf the iphone is apples second attempt to bring a music phone to market in motorola and apple announced they would launch a phone that could play itunes songs motorola even said it would put itunes software on all of motorolas mass market phones but the motorola rokr released in the fall of and carried exclusively by cingular was a huge disappointment for apple executives as design aficionados they werent impressed with the shape of the phone and felt the interface was clunky according to people familiar with apples thinking apple shifted gears in by then executives were convinced that the company would have to build a handset on its own if it was serious about the cellphone market according to people familiar with the matter though apple backed the motorola phone through its launch it had already begun exploring other options motorola spokesman alan buddendeck says the companys partnership with apple was a "good learning experience" for the handset maker motorola still sells some models with itunes software in early mr jobs called mr sigman to pitch the initial concept of the iphone the two executives later met in new york and agreed to pursue the idea mr sigman is a texan who wears cowboy boots and business suits while mr jobs is a former hippie who sports black turtlenecks and jeans despite their vastly different styles the two executives found common ground over the next year and a half the two sides negotiated to reach an agreement that would make sense for both of them glenn lurie cingulars president of national distribution and apples eddy cue who runs itunes and had experience on the rokr project spoke and exchanged emails daily cingulars chief operating officer at the time ralph de la vega who is now an at&amp t executive also weighed in heavily mr jobs played hardball he pointed to statistics showing that carriers traditional voice revenues were declining but he also made a compelling argument he said that apple could help cingular capitalize on the internet people familiar with the discussions say early on both sides determined it would be a bad idea for apple to offer its own cellphone service leasing access to cingulars network even though virgin mobile usa and other startup cellphone operators were using that method with some success mr jobs was cautious he viewed the cellphone business as an unforgiving one where carriers are blamed for network problems and overwhelmed by customer complaints instead he wanted to focus on building a good handset cingular realizing that motorolas device "didnt feel like an apple phone " according to one executive involved in handset decisions was willing to give mr jobs room to come up with something apple assembled a development team to build the iphone that quickly mushroomed into hundreds of people mr jobs worked closely with jonathan ive the design guru at apple who was responsible for the look of the ipod and other products to come up with a head turning design for the iphone mr jobs was adamant from the start that the centerpiece should be a touch sensitive screen he deplored the keyboards on portable email devices like research in motion ltd s blackberry and palm inc s treo since they hogged up much so much surface area a large touch screen on the other hand would free up space to view movies and photos at one point mr jobs got a call from one of the iphone engineers with an idea why not allow iphone users to navigate through both song collections and contacts stored on the device by simply flicking their fingers up and down across the surface of the touch screen the engineer gave mr jobs a demonstration of the technology and the apple chief executive signed off on it immediately according to a person familiar with the process while mr jobs considered cingular a logical choice as a partner to carry the device its gsm technology is the prevailing standard in much of the world apple continued to shop its ideas to other carriers mr jobs reached out to verizon wireless chief executive denny strigl in the middle of and proposed a partnership with the carrier a joint venture of verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc the companies held a few discussions over the next year but the talks eventually soured there were a few sticking points verizon balked at the notion of cutting out its big retail partners like circuit city who would not be allowed to sell the phone and the companys chief marketing officer john stratton was firm that verizon wouldnt give up its ability to sell content like music and videos through its proprietary v cast service people familiar with the discussions say a verizon spokesman declined to comment with verizon out of the picture apples talks with cingular accelerated in july the two companies finalized a deal after hours of negotiations over two days a person familiar with the discussions says this person adds that for mr lurie and mr cue who drew up the final agreement it was an anticlimactic moment plans for the iphone would have to be kept secret for another six months usually carriers catch more than a glimpse of the products their handset partners are working on they get to provide input on what applications or features might make the device more marketable not this time several small teams within cingular worked on the project but each handled its own specific task without knowing what the other teams were up to employees had code names for the project to avoid mentioning apple by name says a person familiar with the matter cingular sent a team of technical personnel to apples offices to test the device making it sure it would work on the carriers network that rigorous process is normal for the release of any phone but this time technicians werent allowed to handle or see the actual phone instead they were given access to a dummy version that would only allow them to do the necessary network tests in january mr jobs finally unveiled the phone at macworld the conference he has used to launch such key products as the ipod mini since then the two companies have continued to test the iphone at an undisclosed facility a person familiar with the matter said the handful of cingular people who have access to the sample phones at the companys headquarters were required to sign confidentiality agreements a person familiar with matter says meanwhile competitors already are responding samsung and lg both have announced phones in recent weeks with designs that look similar to the iphone apple has said it intends to sell million of the devices by with price tags for two different versions set steeply at &# and &# cingular which has more than million customers hopes the iphone will give it a lift when it hits stores in june at a time when attracting new subscribers is getting more difficult for all operators
