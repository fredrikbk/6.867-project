pursuits food hows your drink ripe for improvement it was the summer of and lawmakers in steamy washington were debating the pure food and drug act and proclaiming themselves aghast at the routine adulteration of foodstuffs coffee stretched with "a large mixture of sawdust and bread crumbs" rancid meat masked with "sulphite of soda" "machinery oil" in cans labeled as the virgin pressings of italian olives glucose passed off for honey and on top of it all many canned goods were short of the weight of food promised one is reminded of the catskills chestnut about the restaurant with horrible food and small portions but of all the horror stories introduced to a shocked congress perhaps none was so scandalous as the tale of the humble cocktail cherry illinois republican james robert mann later of "mann act" fame stood in front of the speakers desk where tables had been set to resemble the shelves of a small town grocery then he held up a jar whose brilliantly colored contents were labeled "maraschino cherries " the luscious ripe red cherries were not what they appeared mann tut tutted they had been plucked while still green "to preserve their solidity " how did they get red first the congressman said the phony things were bleached with acids before getting bathed in dye derived from coal tar an industrial waste in a venerable gesture of incitement mann waved a scarlet handkerchief "this cloth was colored with the same dye " feigning an unlikely innocence a helpful colleague played the straight man "what are these cherries used for " "i understand " mann said the congressional record does not specify whether he said it with a wink a nod or both "they are used one at a time in a well known drink " the honorable gentlemen of the house erupted into laughter the drink to which mann referred was probably the manhattan whiskey and sweet vermouth garnished with a cherry dalmatian "marasca" cherries packed in an italian cherry liqueur called maraschino started coming into the u s after the civil war at first the luxury cherries were a society rage soon they became a cocktail staple so much so that disdain for cherries became a handy stand in for antialcohol opinions and this disdain was made all too easy by the flood of faux maraschinos on the market "the cherry in the seductive beverage is commonly looked upon as an added temptation for the one who imbibes " the cleveland plain dealer declared a month before manns grocery shtick "the cherry is even advanced as the prime reason for partaking of the liquid if the partaker be of the gentler sex " the paper warned readers that the food police in pennsylvania had seized stocks of "chemical maraschinos" reputed to be bleached dyed and then embalmed in formaldehyde "few persons who have been reasonably well bred and choose their edibles and drinkables with some regard for hygienic laws know much if anything about the cocktail cherry " the new york times intoned in an editorial in "it is a tasteless indigestible thing originally to be sure a fruit of the cherry tree but toughened and reduced to the semblance of a formless gummy lump by long imprisonment in a bottle filled with so called maraschino " declaring that "the cocktail cherry should be suppressed " the times went on to denounce cocktails in general attributing the puritan fathers loss of "high thinking" to their dalliance with "gin and tansy " dry cocktails werent so bad suggested the editorialist but sweetish drinks should go and the garnish they rode in on "the cocktail cherry is an abomination of comparatively recent origin and now that its utter unfitness has been manifested we trust that it will disappear " the maraschino cherry did not disappear it was once a matter of truth in labeling to declare that cocktail cherries not actually soaked in maraschino liqueur must be specified as "imitation " but now no one expects the impossibly bright cherries called maraschinos to be anything other than imitation they are a triumph of food science and the enduring appeal of corn syrup and red dye gbp but there are alternatives that promise an improved manhattan or old fashioned the silver palate people and williams sonoma both sell jars of maraschino cherries that are made and taste not unlike their gaudy cousins but they have the virtue of being colored with natural substances that give them a more sophisticated cabernet hue makers mark markets a traditional day glo cherry that is distinguished by being flavored with bourbon but frankly i dont see the point of putting a bourbon flavored cherry in a whiskey cocktail far and away the best cocktail cherries in a jar are the ones made in italy by luxardo the company famous for its maraschino liqueur their dark marasca cherries come in a thick sugary syrup of the same cherries the fruit is firm but not phony the only place i have been able to find the luxardo cherries is at the dean &amp deluca chain of gourmet grocers and unfortunately it doesnt currently make them available on its web site which means your best bet may just be to make your own maraschinos hard core cocktail geeks have been trading recipes for years and i tried several to see which delivered decent results they were all pretty good but i give the nod to the "frankies brandied cherries" recipe in the recent book "the art of the bar " by jeff hollinger and rob schwartz simmer fresh pitted sweet cherries in a syrup of sugar water lemon juice and cinnamon then add brandy to the mix when you put the cherries in the refrigerator where they will keep for a couple of weeks fresh cherries are the rare and tricky fruit that is still relatively seasonal in stores so i also tried the recipe with canned bing cherries they turned out well and no coal tar dyes were necessary email me at eric felten wsj com frankies brandied cherries dark sweet cherries pitted cup sugar cup water cup fresh lemon juice cinnamon sticks cups brandy put water sugar lemon juice and cinnamon sticks in a saucepan and bring to a boil reduce heat and add cherries if you cant find and pit fresh cherries a can of pitted bing cherries in syrup isnt bad simmer for five minutes remove from heat toss the cinnamon and stir in the brandy will keep in the fridge for a week or two from "the art of the bar " by jeff hollinger and rob schwartz
