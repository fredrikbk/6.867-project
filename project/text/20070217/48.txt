pursuits books seven prisoners four powers tales from spandau by norman j w goda cambridge pages &# the nuremberg trials following world war ii were meant to inter the nazi era by bringing german war criminals to justice indeed many of those convicted were executed but seven including albert speer adolf hitlers favorite architect and the nazi armaments minister and rudolf hess hitlers former deputy were sentenced to long term incarceration in spandau prison in west berlin the knotty administrative challenge that this arrangement presented for the four power authorities the u s britain france and the soviet union slowly transformed spandau into a symbol less of postwar justice than of cold war stalemate as norman goda makes clear in his absorbing and sometimes eloquent "tales from spandau " the western allies often disagreed over what to do with the prisoners how to handle their medical needs as they grew older and even how to arrange burial if one were to die in prison and the soviet union was adamant that each man should serve out his assigned sentence under austere conditions the books most compelling sections involve speer and hess with painstaking research and a reliable moral compass mr goda shows how speer began from the outset of his imprisonment to "rehabilitate" himself angling for an early release from his year sentence he failed leaving spandau on schedule in he died in at age for mr goda speers famous memoirs and his public posturing of moral seriousness were a charade to conceal his complicity in atrocities and his overriding desire to regain his liberty as for hess who remained spandaus lone occupant for two decades until his suicide in at age mr goda regards his death as the "capstone of allied incompetence in dealing with the legacy of nuremberg " whether or not hess should have been sent home after decades of imprisonment the clumsy arrangements of his jailing and the cost of sustaining an entire prison to hold one feeble old man made it all the easier for neo nazis and holocaust deniers to make him into a martyr hess was unrepentant to the end if the allies had figured out a better way of holding him mr goda says perhaps hesss sympathizers would have been limited to "his galling son his churlish attorney and a small collection of bigoted cranks " mr goda concludes with the sobering reminder "the bar of international justice can never be strong enough to punish men whose crimes are of historic proportions " mr rubenstein the northeast regional director of amnesty international usa is the author of "the kgb file of andrei sakharov "
