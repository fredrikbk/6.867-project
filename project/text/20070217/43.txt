pursuits books book review the dark side of charisma in his last book a renowned sociologist explores the words history and meaning charisma by philip rieff pantheon pages &# what do angelina jolie and barack obama have in common theyve got charisma ms jolies charismatic qualities are celebrated far and wide from time magazine "movie star charisma" to the korea times "sexy charisma" sen obama even rates the word in headlines whether on washingtonpost com "the democrats charisma doctor" or in the chicago tribune "obama banks on credentials charisma" "charisma" is a word so carelessly tossed about nowadays that we hardly pause to reflect on what it means or what its common use and abuse may say about us thus the arrival of philip rieffs "charisma " which takes this single word as a touchstone of our society and what ails it is a welcome event rieff who died in july at age was one of the countrys most distinguished sociologists in his best known work "the triumph of the therapeutic " published in he described how freudian and therapeutic approaches had supplanted older understandings of society and man much to our loss and detriment and he questioned whether such a society could long sustain itself his next book would have been "charisma " but he abandoned the project in and not until just before his death did he return to it overseeing the final editing and authorizing the books publication it must be acknowledged that "charisma" has a certain retro s feel rieff denounces the "transgressive forms" of sex drugs and rock n roll and he laments the appearance of "the organization man " he declares that "behind the flower children of haight ashbury were the cycle gangs " but if the cultural references are somewhat dated the central concerns of the book are as alive today as they were when rieff began work on it some years ago "charisma" falls into the jeremiad category and it bears some comparison to allan blooms best selling "the closing of the american mind" like bloom rieff was a prodigiously learned scholar and his work bristles with references to freud socrates and nietzsche as well as german sociologist max weber french anthropologist emile durkheim danish philosopher soren kierkegaard and others like bloom rieff puts forward a compelling critique of modernity focusing in his case on webers reworking of the religious notion of charisma into a secular "neutral" category and thus emptying it of religious significance in judaism and christianity "charisma" had a very specific meaning the greek root suggests "divine favor " the quality might even be accompanied by miracle making but the key to its power was renunciation in judaism as rieff explains charisma was tied to the notion of the jewish covenant with god a covenant that required its adherents to resist their more natural or animal instincts and obey certain laws and prohibitions the same with some modifications could be said of "charisma" in christian understanding as such charisma was not a rare possession attached to a few lucky people but a quality open to all who obeyed divine commands in particular the prohibitive "thou shalt nots" that make genuine culture and human inwardness possible by restricting mans self destructive impulses this profound religious notion of charisma did not fare so well at the hands of max weber who recast it merely as the "exceptional powers or qualities" of certain unique individuals or in the words of rieff weber redefined charisma as "spectacular performance by a recognized deviant " thus today we marvel less at the charisma of the jewish prophets and jesus or of pious church goers than at the charisma of ms jolie and sen obama not to mention in charismas most sinister mode that of hitler and osama bin laden weber claimed to be only describing a certain social type but as rieff argues he had in fact launched a furious attack on the wests religious roots what rieff called "this fundamental faith guilt order " charismas renunciatory teaching implied a strict moral division it acknowledged a waywardness in man that could only be overcome by divine guidance and an effort of will guilt was the emblem of failure to lose the true meaning of "charisma " rieff warned was to lose something fundamental about man and his place in the order of things rieff saw the effect of webers secular redefinition everywhere including the rule of law having done away with "interdicts " he noted modern thinkers are unable to reconcile themselves to the moral imperatives of criminal law "punishment gives way to rehabilitation " rieff explained and "rehabilitation gives way to decriminalization " the upshot "men will kill for no reason at all and be acquitted because there will be no reason to convict them " this is strong stuff to say the least and in "charisma" rieff foresees the apocalypse coming fast upon us he warns against "the true savage god who is now taking power in our society" and declares that "evil angels have all but seized control of the world " he pronounces that "our culture is dying" and that our "society now truly shakes at its foundations " "nothing now is too dangerous " he darkly intimates "we are the horror " it was certainly possible to feel this way in the social chaos of the late s and early s and it is still possible even today a senseless verdict an outrageous scandal or a coarse public display can make it appear as if indeed our culture has lost its moorings but for all the persuasiveness of rieffs analysis and for all his efforts to undo the damage caused by webers science rieff seems to have yielded to an unwarranted despair in every nook and cranny of the liberal order the modern commercial democratic world that has grown up in the west since the enlightenment rieff detected a loss of meaning in the soul of every modern liberal he found a dangerous relativism verging on nihilism and in the end no escape from the iron cage of instrumental rationality the enlightenment bred hubris that elevated utility and scientific "progress" above faith and god given law by the time he wrote "charisma " rieff had seen more than enough charismatic "deviants" to persuade him that a solution if there is one must come not from politics but from religion and indeed he says that his aim in writing the book was "to resurrect a theology from within modern sociology" one that would allow for the reconstruction of "a creedal culture even a deeper and more beautifully constraining one than any we have experienced before in our history " this is a tall order indeed an impossible one it is hard to imagine any kind of effort in the discipline of sociology or in the social sciences in general ever improving on or leading back to the wisdom of abraham moses and jesus and the moral universe they inhabited and defined but rieffs hope is probably best understood as an expression of extremity he saw civilization nearing a terrible end and was looking for a remedy is it right to despair so totally of americas and the wests liberal order to see it as almost unredeemably decadent and nihilistic however troubled we may feel few of us will think so especially now that the liberal order is under terrorist assault from without still philip rieffs "charisma" offers a compelling diagnosis of our condition even if we will resist its final note of alarm and apocalypse mr wolfson is a visiting assistant professor in the claremont mckenna college washington program
