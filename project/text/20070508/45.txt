drill bit the bush administration has introduced a new plan for offshore drilling for oil and natural gas which it touts as a "major initiative " predictably enough the environmentalists are in hysterics but its hard to tell what the fuss is about either way the interior department is required every five years to lay out its proposals for domestic energy leasing along the outer continental shelf the new interior program recommends opening an additional million acres to drilling including sites in the gulf of mexico eight in alaskan waters and one miles off the coast of virginia if all the projects go forward they have the potential to yield billion barrels of oil and trillion cubic feet of natural gas over years this is a step toward greater domestic energy production but only a small one the continental shelf is estimated to contain trillion cubic feet of undiscovered natural gas and billion barrels of oil of its billion acres over remains off limits this is only a preliminary tentative program and all leases are subject to stringent environmental and commercial reviews it will be years before any of the new sites begin producing if they ever do offshore drilling has been blocked for decades by two separate moratoria which are the political residue of the cheaper energy era one ban comes from congress which has folded it into the budget every year since the other is an executive order dating back to the bush administration could eliminate it tomorrow but so far has demurred in all but a few cases congress lifted its ban for the new alaskan and gulf sites in and respectively but until now they remained under the presidential prohibition the virginia case is more interesting the state legislature has twice endorsed drilling and democratic governor tim kaine supports it however any progress must negotiate the two federal bans the new proposal allows only for the exploration of gas fields with modern seismic equipment and even that has been blocked for years an interior spokesman cautioned us against even using the term "exploration " because nothing at all invasive is allowed better she said to call it "testing to determine resources " whoopee virginias enthusiasm is motivated in part by the prospect of state royalty sharing the gulf states that allow drilling in federal waters louisiana texas mississippi and alabama currently receive of royalties generated by offshore energy production if such a plan were expanded and instituted on a large scale requiring congressional legislation it could change the politics of drilling by generating significant state revenues and weakening opposition which is why in part the environmentalists are so furious at even this baby step assuming at least partial success it could lead to more domestic exploration new jersey democratic senator frank lautenberg warned that it "starts us down the slippery slope that could lead us to drilling off new jerseys coast " anything but that all of these objections are from the same people who claim that the u s must urgently become "energy independent " yet the u s is one of the few nations in the world that chooses to lock up its natural resources cuba believe it or not is planning to drill in waters off florida that are off limits to u s oil companies perhaps senator chris dodd will ring up his friend fidel castro and work out a revenue sharing deal the new plan is progress of a sort though its too bad interior secretary dirk kempthorne was so timid the bush administration will be savaged for any environmental choice it makes so it might as well force the "energy independence" crowd to confront its own contradictions see related letter "letters to the editor the screams are shrill until the checks arrive" wsj may
