politics &amp economics medicares growing pains alternative plans sales tactics subsidies draw ire washington a decade ago the national right to life committee began worrying that managed care health plans expanding role in medicare might mean some seniors would be denied costly life prolonging treatments to save money to protect against such rationing the antiabortion group pressed congress to approve a new breed of private medicare plans that would provide as much care as patients wanted to pay for the plans called private fee for service plans or pffs are surging in popularity among seniors who want the freedom to choose their doctors and avoid the restrictions of managed care plans in little more than a year enrollment has increased fivefold to million though that is still a small slice of the total million medicare beneficiaries the plans are coming under increasing fire medicare officials are worried about tactics used to market them some democratic lawmakers are taking aim at what they describe as exorbitant government payments to the plans arguing that the program benefits insurance companies more than seniors some health policy experts fault the plans for doing little to restrain costs or coordinate care a person eligible for medicare the federal entitlement that provides health coverage to people aged and over and the disabled has a couple of choices there is the basic government run program a fee for service approach with government set deductibles co payments and payments to doctors and hospitals for things medicare doesnt cover there are private medigap insurance policies or a person can opt for a government subsidized private insurance plan known as medicare advantage which combines benefits of both basic medicare and some features of medigap plans these come in two flavors managed care plans with limits on the choice of providers and the pffs an open access option with few restrictions "what medicare doesnt need is a medicare look alike whose only purpose seems to be to get extra money to private insurers which has the potential to undermine the traditional medicare program " says robert berenson a medicare official during the clinton administration and now a senior fellow at the urban institute a washington think tank insurers defend the plans "this is all about choices for beneficiaries " said gary jacobs senior vice president of universal american financial corp an insurer in rye brook n y which has seniors enrolled in its pffs plans reining in the plans wont be easy pffs plans often offer extra benefits with lower out of pocket costs to seniors and in some rural areas they are the only private medicare plans available that makes lawmakers of both parties including montana democrat max baucus the chairman of the senate finance committee wary of doing anything that might prompt the plans to drop out of rural markets "a cut in private fee for service is a cut in rural health " says dan mendelson a budget official during the clinton administration and now president of avalere health llc a washington consulting firm that issued a detailed paper on these plans the national right to life committee among the strongest advocates for their creation remains a staunch backer "our position is that people shouldnt be denied the right to live " says burke j balch the groups director of medical ethics he adds that the group doesnt lobby congress on specific payment rates about of all seniors enrolled in medicare advantage plans are in pffs as of february humana inc had of the enrollees while blue cross blue shield of michigan had according to an avalere analysis for the kaiser family foundation in recent months medicare officials have started warning about the sales tactics employed by some brokers to recruit people into pffs plans "what we are particularly concerned about is some brokers dont make clear" that pffs plans dont work like traditional medicare says abby block director of medicares center for beneficiary choices for example while most doctors accept patients who are in the traditional program some have declined to treat patients in pffs plans these physicians have little experience with these new plans and are concerned that they may not be adequately or quickly paid to try to remedy the problem medicare says it will require pffs plans next year to call all new enrollees to make sure they understand what pffs plans are the government also will use a "secret shopper" to try to police marketing practices and require insurance companies to train brokers about how pffs plans work vic shaner who is years old signed up for a pffs plan when it was introduced in grants pass ore earlier this year the plan sold by sterling life insurance co charged &# a month for additional benefits such as preventive care that was in addition to medicares regular monthly premiums for physician and outpatient services mr shaner soon discovered that his doctor wouldnt accept pffs payments though and that no other internists were available in his area so before the end of the day trial period he switched back to traditional medicare he says he would consider a pffs plan if he could see the doctors he wants adding "id like to save a couple of grand " debbie j ahl president of sterling life in chicago says the insurer tries to educate patients and providers but that doctors dont always know that pffs plans pay the same rates as medicare and sometimes turn away patients sometimes doctors "might confuse us with an hmo " she says though pffs plans were created in they were bolstered substantially by prescription drug legislation that increased payment rates to private plans the rates vary across the country but on average the government spends more on patients in medicare advantage plans than on people in traditional medicare and more on enrollees in pffs plans according to the medicare payment advisory commission which advises congress on medicare issues the panel recommended the government cut payments to all advantage plans including pffs to the same level as those for traditional medicare the proposed cuts are being championed by some democrats including california rep pete stark chairman of the house ways and means health subcommittee "we are now losing money for every person who enrolls in a private plan " he said adding that the money saved could be used to soften scheduled payment cuts to doctors improve benefits for seniors or help cover uninsured children insurers argue that they need the higher government subsidies to cover the rising costs of providing care in rural areas in a recent analysis for blue cross and blue shield association researchers kenneth thorpe and adam atherly of atlantas emory university said cutting medicare payments to private plans to the same level as those paid to traditional medicare "would effectively eliminate pffs as a plan offering " those kinds of gloomy predictions some analysts say will help private medicare plans including pffs fend off big payment cuts
