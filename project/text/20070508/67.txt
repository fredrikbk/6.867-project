home &amp family best of the juggle excerpts from wsj coms work &amp family blog this past winter i came in late several times due to a spate of school related events and doctor visits for my daughter i always told my supervisors why i was tardy was that wise several readers said they keep mum if they need time off for child related issues one wrote "as a woman i go to great lengths to never let my manager know why i am coming in late or requesting time off i dont want him or my almost all male team to think that i am always out of the office because of child care issues " in my case the work environment is family friendly and many of my bosses are working parents moreover ive always believed it is better to give a specific explanation rather than having a boss make assumptions figuring out how much personal information to share though is always a delicate issue whats your policy readers say "disclose nothing if you want your boss to see you as a person who is in control of things at home and work " "making friends at work is vital and disclosing information can be a bonding tool both with co workers and management " looking for mentors from juggle contributor and wsj editor tom weber mothers day is mainly a chance to honor and thank the moms in our lives but its also inspired me to reflect on how to be a better parent good role models and mentors can help for most of us our own parents are the starting point but for working couples our parents may not be enough i grew up in suburban michigan in the s my father worked at a traditional office job and my mother stayed at home my situation is much different my wife and i both work and were raising our kids in new york city the world has changed for professional workers too work demands on our time are different than what my dad faced a few years before my older daughter was born i worked closely and become friends with a colleague who was a talented and accomplished editor and a terrific mom too she and her husband who also worked were raising a young boy in new york many times i said to myself "if we can be the kind of parents they are ill be thankful " apart from your own parents who are your mentors and role models readers say "i had a co worker who was able to manage the transition back to work really well she told me how she avoided mommy guilt by not rethinking decisions she was very good at managing her time " "i have a few role models but i usually just see children with behavior i admire and see what the parents do to elicit that " time for the community many working parents feel that any extra time should be devoted to their kids still i fear becoming too self involved and myopic helping others can bring a better perspective to relatively minor hassles we might otherwise see as crises say car trouble or a mistake at work readers how important is it that working parents make time for volunteer work readers say "i think when the kids are young and if you are working and commuting the focus should be on spending free time with the kids " "even as a full time working mother i try to make community service as much a part of our family activities as sports and tv watching i just make a concerted effort to focus on those activities that involve my children "
