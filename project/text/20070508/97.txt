on the prowl as deal barriers fall takeover bids multiply regulators and size pose less of a problem nobody is off limits one after another the longstanding barriers that protected companies from takeovers are dissolving the result an unprecedented wave of deal making in which it seems few companies are entirely safe national borders and size used to be obstacles but three banks from across europe have assembled a nearly &# billion offer to dismember dutch bank abn amro holding nv it used to be unworkable for leveraged buyout firms to buy finance companies and load them up with debt private equity firms and banks broke through that roadblock when they proposed a &# billion takeover plan for student lender sallie mae family controlled companies especially those with a special class of super voting stock were thought to be untouchable but that hasnt stopped rupert murdochs news corp from offering &# billion for dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal even the biggest barrier the u s government doesnt seem insurmountable exhibit a alcoa inc which yesterday made a &# billion unsolicited offer for canadas alcan inc that deal would recreate an aluminum giant that the u s government spent nearly years trying to break up "other than the biggest or companies in the world nobody is off limits " says scott barshay a partner at the law firm cravath swaine &amp moore "the debt financing is out there the equity financing is out there and the willingness of private equity firms to make bets is out there " investors are bracing for still more combinations in the year ahead across wall street theres a feeling that now is the time to strike while stock valuations are buoyant funding is freely available and democrats in congress have yet to change laws in ways that would make deal making harder executives are often happy to do deals because they can get big payouts under change of control clauses in their contracts the most important engine remains the stock market which continues to hit all time highs higher stock prices give chief executives the confidence and currency to pursue bigger targets the value of mergers in has already topped &# trillion higher than the level for all of and some greater than the same period of u s volume is up year over year according to data provider dealogic the trend could quickly turn around if interest rates rise increasing the cost of funds for acquirers or if the u s and european economies turn south many of the acquisitions rely on optimistic growth projections that would be hard to justify in a slowing economy "there is a part of you that wants to ask how long it can keep going " says robert hotz co chairman at investment bank houlihan lokey howard &amp zukin "what you worry about is some external event that impacts the credit markets which i think could derail the buyout train " the euphoria could leave a hangover if it turns out that buyers took on too much debt some private equity firms could find themselves in bankruptcy causing ripple effects in the broader economy the cost cutting needed to pay off the debt could mean more layoffs at companies caught up in the excitement companies are more likely to overextend themselves thats apparent from the last merger boom time warner inc is still dealing with the fallout of its merger with america online for the moment shareholders are generally blessing acquirers proposals especially when they put together businesses with significant cost savings shares in thomson corp dropped just cents after revelations last week that the financial information company was mounting a &# billion offer for reuters group plc and both alcan and alcoa shares jumped yesterday in part because of investor expectations that a merged company could achieve some &# billion in cost savings in the past an acquirer often saw its stock price drop sharply because investors feared an expensive acquisition would hurt its finances some of deals this year have some sort of cost savings built into the transaction according to standard &amp poors corp the highest level in years deal prices are at their highest level since according to factset mergerstat a provider of data on mergers on average buyers this year are spending about times a targets cash flow compared to times during and times in both corporations and private equity firms are being lured to the negotiating table by hundreds of billions of dollars in financing available at cheap rates with few restrictive terms "your head is constantly spinning every single industry is being restructured " says howard wiesenfeld a portfolio manager at dkr ibex a merger arbitrage fund who has been waking at a m to start trading on stocks of companies that are part of european deals the deal for sallie mae known formally as slm corp suggests how the environment has changed when a leveraged buyout firm acquires a company it usually loads its target up with debt to finance the transaction historically that made leveraged buyouts of financial services companies difficult because these companies already have a lot of debt and their financial soundness is subject to regulation yet two private equity firms jc flowers &amp co and friedman fleischer &amp lowe llc plowed ahead in the sallie mae deal backed by &# billion worth of lending capacity from j p morgan chase &amp co and bank of america corp the reasoning sallie mae can package its student loans into bonds to sell to eager investors so the company isnt dependent on raising money in the credit markets even with sallie maes debt rating heading toward junk territory the company said it would have "no need to access capital markets during this time " during the first quarter of companies and private equity firms issued &# billion in new debt according to standard &amp poors the volume was nearly greater than in the fourth quarter of and nearly four times the rate of banks big institutions and hedge funds are willing to provide the financing for deals because the returns for safer investments such as u s government bonds are low private equity firms have been able to raise huge sums in a matter of weeks often casting around for deals almost randomly just three weeks after abandoning its &# billion bid for j sainsbury plc cvc capital partners of luxembourg approached cigarette maker altadis sa of spain with a &# billion proposal for a few weeks kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co was involved as a partner with cvc in the sainsbury bid and at the same time pursued a &# billion deal for alliance boots plc "its kind of like the wild west " says mr hotz the investment banker "were seeing much higher levels of leverage " beyond the abundance of cheap deal funding economists and antitrust lawyers cite significantly eased merger enforcement standards in the bush administration "nows the time " says carl shapiro a former justice department economist now at the berkeleys haas school of business "the line has clearly shifted in favor of big mergers between competitors deals that would have been blocked" in earlier administrations the bush justice departments rate of merger challenges between and was the lowest of the past years according to a new study by mr shapiro and jonathan baker a former federal trade commission economist thomas barnett the bush administrations antitrust chief says merger review standards havent changed and the justice department remains vigilant "we filed more complaints challenging mergers in the last fiscal year than in any year since the end of the merger wave in " he said in an interview yesterday the department brought formal challenges in deals last year he said though none were blocked outright "our approach is to aggressively protect consumer welfare and the competitive process " mr barnett said "that may sometimes mean blocking an entire transaction but may also mean attaining more targeted relief that allows the beneficial aspects of a transaction to proceed " wall street has benefited from the administrations light touch on taxes with democrats now in control of congress senior lawmakers are discussing taxing private equity gains at a higher rate prompting some financiers to try to rush to get deals done while taxes are lower in an interview last week sen max baucus the montana democrat who chairs the finance committee said his committee is examining whether fund managers should pay higher taxes on the profits their funds generate for them committee aides have questioned whether it is appropriate that much of the managers pay the cut of profits known as "carried interest" is taxed at the long term capital gains rate instead of ordinary income tax rates of as much as the prospect of changes by a democratic controlled congress and a possible democratic victory in the next presidential election could affect the thinking of some sellers as well the bancroft family that controls dow jones is examining how an increase in capital gains or dividend taxes might affect its decision on news corp s offer according to people close to some members of the family the maximum tax rate on capital gains and dividends is now but will rise in to and respectively unless congress acts democrats are showing some resistance to president bushs proposal to extend the lower rates that could make it more lucrative for the bancrofts to cut a deal now in europe governments take a more interventionist approach in corporate affairs but that too seems to be fueling merger activity as officials seek to turn deals to their countries advantage spain and italy joined forces in defending electricity company endesa sa from germanys e on ag and a series of deals linking spanish and italian companies are in the works undergirding all of the activity is a deeper shift within corporate boardrooms boards are increasingly unwilling to resist demands from shareholders to spin off or sell businesses such resistance was common years ago when veteran merger lawyer martin lipton would counsel clients that they could use the "nancy reagan defense" of just saying no to takeover offers following a series of corporate scandals earlier in the decade shareholders have been pushing harder to exercise their rights of ownership even in europe where the activist investor is a relatively recent arrival in february a london based hedge fund sent a letter demanding a breakup or sale of dutch bank abn amro abn at first thought the letter sent by childrens investment fund management uk llp would have only a limited effect but the banks shares rose as other hedge funds piled in expecting the bank would be forced into a deal chief executive rijkman groenink realized the long term shareholders he had counted on in the past were abandoning him mr groenink decided to sell his bank in a friendly transaction to barclays plc for &# billion including a sale of abns lasalle bank division to bank of america for &# billion shareholders likened it to a "crown jewel defense" because to protect a friendly deal with barclays abn decided to sell lasalle a premier asset hearing the shareholder complaints three european banks teamed up to bid about &# billion to wrest the deal away from barclays the three royal bank of scotland group plc dutch belgian fortis nv and banco santander central hispano sa of spain plan to break up the sprawling abn the consortiums move is even more audacious because it has completed limited due diligence the group has spent just days poring over financial information and hours posing questions to a handful of top abn executives its bid is valued &# billion higher than barclays even though barclays spent five weeks doing in depth due diligence with abn on a friendly basis the arrival of activist investors also makes management more willing to complete deals earlier this winter american financier nelson peltz who made a name for himself in the s using junk bonds to buy aluminum can companies bought a stake in venerable cadbury schweppes plc before he had even begun to agitate for change the company announced a plan to break itself in two "this is an environment where people are open to deals " says kenneth jacobs chief executive of lazard north america "theres a clear sense that if someone makes a compelling offer that the just say no approach isnt going to work " one reason for the openness executives stand to make millions when theres a change of control as their stock options gain value and other payments kick in "its all about incentives managements and boards of directors do well when companies go private " says william ackman who runs investment fund pershing square capital management "they get change of control payments their stock and options become fully vested and they often get equity in the newly private company managements are using shareholder activists as an excuse to go sell the company " but beneath the surface some worry the merger boom cant sustain itself with sardonic asides wall street bankers joke about getting deals done before the music stops wall street has embraced exotic structures that in years past would have been dismissed out of hand chief among these was the buyout of publishing giant tribune corp which relied on a highly leveraged employee ownership plan to buy the company from its shareholders
