the venture capital tangle start ups rapid evolution creates conflicts for financiers when venture capitalist peter rip put money into two young internet companies he thought he was buying into two entirely different businesses riya inc was a digital photo sharing site while vast com inc was an online classified ad site that made money by generating leads for online advertisers the next year in riya changed course and now mr rip wonders if he has a conflict of interest on his hands late last year riya launched a comparison shopping web site that makes money by producing sales leads for online retailers "i thought i had invested in two totally different start ups " says mr rip a general partner at crosslink capital in san francisco "but all of a sudden im sitting on the boards of two companies that are both doing lead generation " unlike during the dot com boom of the late s more internet start ups today are under pressure to speedily generate revenue that means some firms are quickly changing business models or going after new markets if their original business plans dont work out that can cause potential problems for venture capitalists who are finding that one morphing internet company can end up overlapping or even competing with another firm in their investment portfolios another factor leading to potential conflicts venture capital investors who put money into start ups with the hope of cashing out later when the companies get sold or go public are hanging onto their investments longer that is because it is more difficult to take a young company public than during the dot com boom in start ups took a median time of three years to go public from the time a company first got financing that wait has now doubled to more than six years according to ventureone a venture capital research firm owned by dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal the increased time raises the odds that one start up ends up vying with another in a venture capitalists portfolio all of this is problematic because venture capitalists are typically active investors whose funding buys them a board seat on a start up many become intimately involved in all aspects of a start ups business the venture capitalists ability to effectively serve a company can thus become compromised if he or she winds up on the boards of two competing firms so far fund raising by venture funds doesnt appear to be affected because of the huge amount of cash that institutional investors such as pension funds continue to need to put to work venture fund raising has remained relatively steady over the past two years with u s venture funds raising &# billion in and &# billion in according to ventureone while conflict of interest issues arent new venture investors say the chances of such run ins have increased in the current internet boom "given how quickly products are introduced now and how important it is to find consumer demand internet companies today are more nimble and agile in pursuing those opportunities " says jim breyer a partner at accel partners a palo alto calif venture firm "so overlaps occur more and they occur earlier than even five or years ago " mr breyer says the conflicts are pushing some venture capitalists to remove themselves from certain board seats sequoia capital venture capitalist michael moritz who invested in google inc in and who continued to serve as a director of the mountain view calif company after its initial public offering of stock left googles board in march according to a person familiar with the situation part of the reason for mr moritzs departure was related to a potential conflict of interest googles broadening reach on the internet was making it difficult for mr moritz to invest in new web start ups that didnt compete with the search giant mr moritz declined to comment as did a spokesman for google some venture capitalists are taking preventative steps to avoid such conflicts promod haque a managing partner at norwest venture partners says his palo alto firm is starting to include conflicts of interest clauses in the contracts it signs with some entrepreneurs norwest has long had an unofficial policy under which its partners wont serve on the boards of two companies that compete if one of its investments changes and intersects with another investment by the same venture capitalist then norwest encourages the venture capitalist to hand over one investment to a colleague mr haque says "we dont want to put ourselves in the situation" where theres a clash mr haque says "thats like shooting yourself in the head " venture funded companies also are adopting conflicts of interest policies for their boards of directors mark stevens an attorney at fenwick &amp west llp who represents silicon valley start ups and venture capitalists says he has seen several venture funded firms implement formal conflict of interest guidelines for their board in the past months mobitv inc a mobile tv and audio services start up is one of the companies taking a proactive stance on the issue the emeryville calif company which is funded by redpoint ventures and menlo ventures among others introduced a formal conflict of interest policy for its employees and board late last year andy missan mobitvs general counsel says the company was "very specific" about making sure the policy applied to its board members who include several venture investors as for crosslink capitals mr rip he decided to remain on the boards of both riya and vast com but he says he wont talk to one company about the others business if he feels one of the start ups has a good idea that might benefit the other then mr rip says he tells the founders of riya and vast com to get together on their own and swap stories "you have to be as transparent as you can " mr rip says so far the arrangement appears to be working out naval ravikant vast coms founder says mr rip "bends over backwards" to disclose any overlaps whats more while vast com and riya both rely on lead generation for revenue they have focused on different markets says riyas chief executive munjal shah vast com generates sales leads mostly for auto and property companies while riya produces leads largely for online apparel accessories and home decor companies kevin j delaney contributed to this article
