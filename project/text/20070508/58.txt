energy chinas latest global push oil field services firms drawing on vast labor pool gain toeholds around world but technology gap persists china aims to become a global powerhouse in auto making aerospace and other sophisticated industries its latest push the lucrative business of providing equipment and know how in the oil patch long confined to the domestic market by subpar technology and a lack of experience chinas oil field service companies are gaining toeholds from russia to texas executives with two of the largest say they plan to triple the portion of their revenue earned outside china within the next few years the oil field service units of several major chinese oil producers put in a big appearance at last weeks offshore technology conference in houston arguing that chinas vast labor pool and industrial capacity could fit the needs of an industry that is straining to find enough personnel and material to keep the worlds oil fields pumping but the barriers to providing the most sophisticated and most profitable products and services are daunting already some in the industry say efforts by chinese companies cant yet meet more advanced requirements the gap underscores chinas limitations as well as its possibilities as it leverages its industrial capacity and vast labor pool to compete with long established western companies in a host of industries the oil field service industry provides everything from drilling rigs and metal tubes to software and engineering skills that are crucial to tapping new supplies the industry has boomed since the price of oil began its three year surge the number of oil and natural gas drilling rigs operating world wide has increased steadily since hitting a year high of rigs in february according to baker hughes inc an oil field service company that conducts a monthly census activity is expected to grow lehman brothers estimates world wide exploration and production spending will rise this year to &# billion figures that dont include big spending plans by state owned oil companies in the middle east and africa chinas oil field service campaign comes as the country continues to escalate its presence on the international oil scene establishing ventures to produce oil from venezuela to ethiopia to quench its fast growing thirst for energy having a sure supply of oil field equipment and workers is especially helpful in countries such as iran sudan and myanmar where western companies face pressure and sometimes legal restrictions against providing services because oil field work is often done in hazardous places chinese oil field workers have recently become targets for kidnapping and violence incidents in places like ethiopia and nigeria have been heavily covered in chinas state controlled media while there appears to be no public backlash to chinas involvement in high risk locations publicity could make it difficult in the future a handful of chinese companies are already well known in the services world bgp inc a unit of oil producer china national petroleum corp provides seismic technology which is used to explore reserves other sectors such as rig building have existed since the s but have taken off in the past few years baoji oilfield machinery co also a unit of china national petroleum is the oldest and largest rig manufacturer in china by production building more than rigs a year the year old company has long exported rigs abroad but it cracked the u s market only in honghua co is chinas second largest rig producer and is able to build rigs a year the company built its first rig in and began deliveries to the u s in both companies say they expect future growth to come from outside china chinese companies have been most active in africa the middle east and asia in the first chinese rig arrived in the u s sparking an uproar from local politicians who compared chinese crews drilling on american soil to outsourcing a worsening equipment shortage trumped political opposition however and orders for chinese built rigs have been delivered to u s companies "their expansion is most welcome " said bernard duroc danner chief executive of weatherford international ltd the fourth largest services company by market capitalization "theres a shortage of people equipment just about everything " jiang xizhao president of offshore oil engineering co a unit of chinese oil producer cnooc ltd said the company hopes to increase international business from of revenue in to between and by last year it posted profit of million yuan &# million up it posted revenue of billion yuan up china oilfield services ltd another cnooc unit in nearly doubled the percentage of its billion yuan in revenue from overseas to from the company said it wants of revenue to come from outside china in overall it posted a profit of billion yuan up from and revenue grew from but for all the enthusiasm the chinese oil field service campaign faces some challenges its industry is still known more for its cheap and quick construction than its technological prowess "we have had to spend a fair amount of our own time money and effort adapting the rigs we received particularly for the ones from china to make them workable to our standards " said gene isenberg chief executive of bermuda based rig operator nabors industries ltd which began receiving chinese built rigs last year he said nabors will rely less on chinese vendors in the future chinas labor force has a growing base of engineers but relatively few specializing in niche fields needed to make chinese companies truly competitive internationally mr jiang said "the market is not fully developed in china to meet basic requirements " he said at the houston conference mr jiang noted that chinese built rigs are rated to work in waters as deep as feet compared with feet in the late s but new reserves are increasingly being found in waters feet deep or deeper china oilfield services is in the early stages of building a deep water drill ship capable of operating in water feet deep delivery is scheduled for the looming concern for the industry mr jiang said in his speech last week at the houston conference is that labor costs will rise to international levels before chinese companies can close the technology gap
