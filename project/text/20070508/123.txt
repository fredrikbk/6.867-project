the evening wrap not much mileage online edition in green crazy washington attracting legislators to a package of fuel efficiency reforms ought to be no more complicated than drawing flies to a recycling bin but a proposal for new gasoline guidelines isnt finding many friends the senate commerce committee passed a bill requiring auto makers to boost the average fuel efficiency of their car and light truck fleets to miles a gallon by under current rules auto fleets need to average miles a gallon for cars and miles a gallon for light trucks for the model year but even if the measure gives the appearance that lawmakers are taking action at a time when everyone is buzzing about global warming and rising gas prices there were few who seemed satisfied with the proposed steps sen daniel inouye the committee chairman and hawaii democrat agreed that the bill wasnt perfect "but i think we have reached a stage where most parties would say this is fair " auto makers have cried that the miles benchmark is the stuff of fantasy and is simply too expensive for them to meet detroits auto behemoths all three of whom are consumed with massive restructuring efforts say the extensive retooling that would be needed to meet the bills requirements would almost certainly lead to even more financial pain with such pleas in mind industry allies in the senate succeeded in constructing "off ramps" that would give the administration the right to slow down the pace of mandated efficiency gains if they were found to be too costly but the off ramps are two way streets the white house would also have the ability to speed up the annual goals and auto makers may have a very good reason to worry that a future administration would try to slam the pedal to the metal on efficiency sen barack obama the democratic presidential candidate told the detroit economic club that the financial mess the citys auto leaders have found themselves in is to some extent their own fault and that he wants to see annual increases in mileage standards he also said that protests by the big three that such efficiency improvements are costly wont wash saying yesterday that "expensive to do is no longer an excuse for failure to do " the transportation department has estimated that annual increases in fuel efficiency would cost the auto giants &# billion between and despite the green wave now washing over washington the measure appears to face a very tough road as key legislators from both sides of the aisle made their objections plain sen trent lott the mississippi republican decried the bill as unfair and missouri democrat claire mccaskill said she wouldnt support it as currently constituted "as we move forward i hope my colleagues will not lose sight of those thousands of jobs" that could be at risk she said but others said they didnt think the bill went far enough sen bill nelson the democrat from florida wants to push the target to miles a gallon the measure should come to the floor in june and the broader debate will play out as beach weather again brings a big increase in gas prices the energy information administration said it was revising its forecast for peak pump prices this summer to &# a gallon cents higher than the agencys forecast of last month some analysts believe that such views are overheated since higher prices give refiners the incentive to produce more gas but whatever the case theres no shortage of fuel to keep the debate in washington running at full speed with fed on tap stocks flatten a mixed bag of earnings news and tomorrows impending
