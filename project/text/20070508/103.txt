politics &amp economics senates mixed message on drug imports washington the senate voted to allow americans to import drugs from other countries but bowing to a presidential veto threat added a condition that makes the change unlikely to ever take effect the votes enable senators to proceed with work on broader legislation that would change the way the food and drug administration regulates medications in the u s by giving the agency significant new power over how drugs are used and promoted after they go on the market the white house promised a veto of that underlying bill if it included a drug importation amendment without significant conditions the fda bill offered by sens edward kennedy d mass and michael enzi r wyo is considered vital legislation because if it isnt passed by this fall the agency will lose a substantial portion of its funding which comes from fees charged to the pharmaceutical and medical device industries various lawmakers worked to attach pet provisions to ensure their passage including north dakota democratic sen byron dorgans amendment to legalize importation of drugs from canada and a number of other countries mr dorgan and other supporters of legalized drug importation are expected to try again to pass their measure but it is unlikely to become part of the broader fda bill the house hasnt yet passed a companion fda bill drug importation is an issue that has been pushed for years by lawmakers such as mr dorgan who argue that cheaper medications from abroad could save money for u s consumers opponents including the drug industry argue that large scale imports could create serious safety issues including a risk of counterfeit medicines mr dorgan said in a statement that yesterdays vote was "a setback to be sure it is not the end of our effort were going to keep fighting " yesterday mr dorgans amendment was approved in a voice vote but by a vote of lawmakers voted in favor of an amendment from sen thad cochran r miss that required assent from the secretary of health and human services for the provision to go into effect that condition is seen as unlikely to be met various bills legalizing importation have won support and sometimes votes only to be watered down before they become law last year the senate passed a different importation plan but the final legislation only legalized imports of medications that consumers could personally carry across the border ultimately the broader fda bill is expected to win approval if it becomes law the agency will be able to require new studies restrict distribution and change drug labels among other moves to deal with safety concerns after a drug is on the market mr kennedy has said that when senate lawmakers go into conference with house leaders to craft a final version he will add yet to be decided provisions that would create a pathway for the fda to approve generic versions of biotechnology drugs
