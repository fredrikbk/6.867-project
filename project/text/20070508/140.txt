why bank loan funds shine higher yields lure flock of investors returns near late in economic cycles investors often try to lock in long term yields before slowing growth and falling demand for credit pull rates downward but this cycle hasnt been usual yields remain low and there is uncertainty about where they are headed that is stoking demand for mutual funds that buy floating rate corporate loans made by banks such funds pay nearly well above the benchmark year treasury yield their yields are higher because the borrowers have sub investment grade credit ratings such loans offer more protection than similarly rated bonds loans rank above bonds in the corporate finance hierarchy so loanholders get repaid ahead of bondholders in debt restructurings but unlike the coupons of fixed rate bonds loan coupons can drop they are pegged to a short term floating benchmark such as the london interbank offered rate or libor that would seem to make loans and loan funds less attractive when rates might be headed lower still loan funds merit a permanent home in portfolios some argue they reason that at current relatively low levels fixed coupon bond yields which move inversely to their prices have little room to drop barring a much worse than expected u s downturn that means fixed coupon bonds dont have potential for much price appreciation "theres a low probability that bonds or bond funds are going to deliver returns in excess of their coupons " says scott page who co manages the eaton vance floating rate fund floating rate securities also could be a better bet if rates rise fixed coupon issues would lose value at least on paper but while coupons of floating rate securities would increase their prices would remain steady investors have flocked to loan funds in the first four months of this year their assets grew to more than &# billion according to amg data services arcata calif early last year the riversource investments unit of ameriprise financial inc minneapolis launched a floating rate fund since then more than &# million has flooded in even though the firm more actively marketed another fund says colin lundgren a senior fixed income manager the two year old &# billion hartford floating rate fund has seen similarly strong growth investors not only like its yield says co manager michael bacevich but they also "take comfort in the fact that net asset value has been virtually steady since inception " the fund is part of the hartford financial services group inc in connecticut mr bacevich and others caution that investors need to be careful when deciding whether to buy a bank loan fund as elsewhere in the financial world strong demand for yield has helped erode credit standards in the loan market bank loans are made with restrictions or covenants that are intended to prevent borrowers from taking actions that might hurt their credit standing but restrictions have grown looser in recent years loan specialists say investors shouldnt opt for the fund with the highest yield they add a lower yield may mean a fund is making more prudent investment decisions at eaton vance mr page and co manager payson swaffield are selective about the types of loans they buy and also limit the size of positions in each "we dont see any reason to take a big bet on a company or an industry because we dont get paid to take those bets " says mr page alcoa alcan tie up risks junk rating credit rating firms standard &amp poors and moodys investors service warned that should alcoa inc acquire competitor alcan inc for &# billion the combined entity could fall below investment grade and face much higher financing costs standard &amp poors which rates both companies three notches above speculative grade or junk at bbb plus placed the ratings on creditwatch with negative implications "without a meaningful equity offering or asset divestiture program that reduces debt on the balance sheet it is highly unlikely the combined corporate credit rating will retain an investment grade rating which would represent at least a three notch downgrade for alcoas and alcans existing corporate ratings " standard &amp poors said it expressed concerns over the potential combined entitys "very aggressive debt levels and the ability to reduce debt to more appropriate levels within a reasonable time " moodys placed alcoas a senior unsecured rating which is two notches above s&amp ps rating of alcoa and alcans baa equivalent to s&amp ps bbb plus under review for a possible downgrade it also warned about the possibility of a junk rated combined entity regulatory hurdles are expected according to s&amp p given alcoa and alcans combined market position in the aluminum sector "it is quite possible other suitors could enter the mix resulting in more aggressive competing bids " it added alcoas bonds due were percentage point wider at percentage point according to marketaxess an electronic trading platform for corporate bonds the cost of protecting &# million
