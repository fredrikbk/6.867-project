success in renegotiating orders it won for an earlier version of the a two of those contracts with us airways group inc for between and as and with qatar airways for as many as are viewed as critical

deliver the a by as promised us airways has asked airbus officials to come back with a proposal that would include financial penalties if it fails to deliver john leahy airbuss chief operating officer

drawings mr mcconnell said airbus is working to "take risk out of the program " he said customers have been clamoring for more information since presenting an overview of the jetliner in july airbus has shown customers a variety of plans but it has yet to commit to a firm configuration customers say john plueger president and chief operating officer of american international group inc unit international lease finance corp said the los angeles leasing giant isnt ready to order "we do need to see the final definition so we can make some determinations about whether it appeals to the largest number of airlines " he said some customers have been pushing airbus to offer abreast seating in economy class to match that on boeings long range but airbus officials say they believe the a will be able to compete effectively with the offering the more comfortable option of up to nine seats in each row "weve made our decision " said mr mcconnell mr mcconnell said airbus after listening to customers has moved the planned crew rest areas on the plane into the rounded area of the fuselage above the passenger cabin previous plans called for private bunks and seats to be located below the deck in an area that the airlines would rather use for hauling lucrative cargo other customers have said they are staying on the sidelines while airbus tries to reach a deal with general electric

directly with the boeing ge has said it is in talks with airbus about providing engines for the planned a and a which will be comparable in size to the boeing but the engine maker has refused to supply them for the larger a because that airplane is aimed directly at competing with the largest boeing s which are powered by ges biggest engine a ge spokesman said it hopes to have a resolution by the paris air show britains rolls royce plc has said it will make engines for all versions of the plane but customers prefer to have a choice because the competition results in better pricing andrew
