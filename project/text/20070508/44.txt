dow jones ex chief praises familys stance peter kann the recently retired chairman of dow jones &amp co sent a letter to members of the bancroft family applauding them for their opposition to selling the company to rupert murdochs news corp for &# billion saying he admired them "for doing what is right " mr kann who expressed his own distaste for the deal in a statement sunday provided a kind of pep talk for the family which isnt completely unanimous about the decision the bancrofts are geographically spread out and peopled by more than three dozen adults plus numerous children all linked by a complicated set of trust agreements the family through the boston law firm that oversees many of the trusts said last week that about of its voting power is against accepting the offer comprising about of the total voting shares of the company a spokesman for news corp declined to comment mr kanns self described "personal letter from a recent retiree" declared "great admiration for and appreciation to so many of you who continue to protect the independence of the company and to view your ownership of it as a public trust " it was sent over the weekend to a trustee for the family a senior family member not on the dow jones board and to james ottaway jr a former board member and dow jones executive who also criticized the offer sunday "there is a higher calling to what the people of dow jones do each day " mr kann wrote "they are not merely producing and selling products like corn flakes or computer chips " rather he said they are producing products that "empower the citizens of free societies " mr kanns missive alluded to the long relationship he has had with the bancroft family and the respect that the elder generations of the family had for the independence of dow jones "i have been privileged to know four generations of your family starting with jane cook and jesse cox over all those generations family values and company values have been one and the same and in that we have been extraordinarily fortunate " noting that they would be walking away from a &# per share offer for shares which lately have traded below &# he made the case for enduring the sacrifice "i clearly can understand that in rejecting a takeover offer you are forgoing some financial benefit " he wrote "to that i can only say that you are not alone in seeing other and even higher priorities there are many people in our larger society who make career and other decisions that do not always maximize financial benefit " then in a nod to the newsroom another constituency to which both mr murdoch and his opponents would like to appeal he wrote "just consider for example the many talented reporters and editors who have worked for the journal over so many years and how many of them could have made so much more money working in law or banking or public relations rather they devoted their careers and they still do to something more important " mr kann is a pulitzer prize winning former wall street journal reporter who became chief executive officer in and yielded to rich zannino early last year remaining as chairman until last month his ties with many family members remain closer than those of current management and he is attempting to use his influence with them to encourage them to stay the course the family endured a sluggish stock price for most of his tenure although the prestige of the companys products didnt suffer explaining his decision to write the letter mr kann said in an interview "i thought it is important for some of us who believe in the independence of the company to thank the bancrofts and the ottaways for what they are doing and maybe to try to provide some more support for the positions they are taking " mr murdochs argument aside from the premium he is offering to shareholders is that dow jones would be able to expand globally and on digital platforms if it could access the deep pockets of a large media company he has said that reports that he would interfere with the editorial workings of the paper for business personal or political reasons are overblown
