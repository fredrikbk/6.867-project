investors mine for more deals in commodities global demand boom drives consolidation next target alcoa investors have been betting that the deal making in commodities which is leaving a few key players dominant in certain markets isnt through yesterday they got the most significant sign yet of the rapid consolidation among commodities producers with alcoa inc s &# billion unsolicited offer for rival alcan inc the rapid consolidation of companies in aluminum steel mining and other commodities also illustrates the need for heft as companies increasingly compete globally something that investors predict could spur still more deals among those that could at some point receive takeover offers lonmin plc of london u s steel of pittsburgh first quantum minerals of vancouver and even alcoa itself rather than a sign of the top for commodity prices some investors say the deal making could help put a lid on supply and put even more pressure on a host of commodity prices helping the profits of a number of these companies "i think this is going to continue " says john ing chief executive of maison placements in toronto "this has really snowballed to where no company is immune " montreal based alcans shares rose &# or nearly to &# yesterday on the new york stock exchange above the takeover offer a sign that traders expect the offer to be sweetened or that another suitor will emerge shares of pittsburgh based alcoa rose &# to &# gaining underscoring that investors welcome the continuing consolidation like many recent deals a purchase of alcan is expected to add to earnings of its suitor in just a few years and lead to cost cutting possibilities just as important investors are betting that the news also could make large players think of alcoa as a takeover target the aluminum sector is viewed as particularly ripe for deals because demand for the metal is strong and the number of prized assets available to buy is limited demand for aluminum is expected to double in the next years takeover activity has surged in nearly all commodity sectors from steel and silver to copper and uranium in the past two years mittal steel co bought arcelor sa for &# billion phelps dodge was acquired by freeport mcmoran copper &amp gold inc for &# billion and cia vale do rio doce sa bought inco ltd for &# billion one reason deals are coming fast and furious it is easier to pull off a transaction in some of these markets than in other businesses a copper mine for instance is easily traded from one producer to another while a deal for an investment bank or chain of stores can be hard to integrate smoothly bears say that the deals may come back to haunt the acquirers as their name implies a commodity product can lose value quickly when production rises and supply surges but the supply of many commodities is still catching up to the surging demand sparked by growth in china india and elsewhere and because many companies arent pushing new production it is holding down supply and ensuring that prices dont collapse some investors say indeed companies often prefer to buy their rivals rather than spend heavily on new mines which can be time consuming and risky that is in part because most of the targets arent at expensive levels relative to their cash flow and earnings and the acquirer and the target often have little debt the origin of buyers has also changed the global commodity business was long dominated by giants from the u s canada and other industrialized countries but over the past year a new crop of consolidators are coming from the emerging markets that is partly because mining and resource companies in emerging markets are flush with cash from the commodity boom which they are now able to deploy to win global bidding wars last week for instance russias oao gmk norilsk nickel offered &# billion for toronto based lionore mining international ltd oao gmk is one of the worlds largest producers of nickel palladium platinum and copper not that there arent plenty of cash heavy players coming out of the more traditional markets last week u s based coeur dalene mines corp agreed to buy australian miner bolnisi gold nl and bolnisis majority owned unit canadian miner palmarejo silver &amp gold corp in a mostly stock transaction that coeur dalene valued at &# billion as for possible targets investment bankers and traders often name u s steel as a prime target in the rapidly consolidating steel business while first quantum is prized for its copper assets in the democratic republic of congo lonmin the worlds third largest platinum producer has seen strong recent free cash flow growth should global growth slow a slump in demand would put a damper on commodity prices and consolidation burning some recent acquirers that were counting on prices holding up and there are fewer sizable companies available to be purchased on the heels of all the recent transactions adding urgency to the suitors that are wooing targets in a conference call with investors last month don lindsay chief executive of teck cominco ltd in vancouver noted that his company has been searching for acquisitions in niches such as nickel uranium and iron ore teck cominco is a producer of zinc copper and metallurgical coal but in the case of nickel a sector that has seen heavy consolidation over the past year he said there were few targets "its a reasonably small industry " he said but jeffrey christian managing director of cpm group a new york based commodities research company says consolidation could go on a while longer "because there are always births deaths marriages and divorces" of these companies he notes that while annual gold production more than doubled to million ounces between and almost all of the growth came from companies that either didnt exist or which didnt do any gold mining in "new companies are constantly coming up doing exploration finding new projects " mr christian says
