trouble in turkey istanbul there is a perfectly logical temptation to take the position of much of the non native press on the current political crisis in turkey the argument goes something like this prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his "mildly islamic" justice and development party akp are good for the country they proposed foreign minister abdullah gul for president under the current constitution parliament elects the president thus the akp has a freely elected majority in parliament and represents the will of the people therefore mr gul should be president the rest observers argue is just loud noise such as the two massive demonstrations in days in ankara and istanbul the latter of a million or more people in tandem with grim warnings by the military against any akp violation of secularist principles akp the argument goes has played by the rules and democracy is all about due process which produces stability over time turkey must accept that it is culturally eastern but politically western otherwise the eu will never take it foreign investment will dry up and the country will remain excluded from the western world so goes the argument in favor of mr erdogan as well as mr gul who withdrew his candidacy on sunday there are a number of critical flaws in this argument the first being that such a country will ultimately neither belong to an eastern nor a western club it might serve distantly as an example to other muslim countries but the eu will certainly not accept it because the eu considers itself as much a civilization as a political alliance the pro akp argument suffers from other critical flaws mr erdogans party won only of the vote but under a constitution rigged to create a two party system akp has of parliamentary seats besides even that derived in part from voters disgusted by the corrupt incompetence of the secular parties not from pro muslim sentiment the results in no way suggest that a majority of the country regards itself as politically islamic or nonsecular and under such conditions akp has no mandate for foisting a partisan figure onto the presidency an office that is supposed to rise above party dogma and represent the country and constitution this is why most nominees for the presidency rarely survive the painstaking but necessary business of consultation and compromise between parties its a somewhat uncodified process but it works to ensure a unifying rather than divisive outcome mr erdogan did the exact opposite he pushed the systems limits for his own ends until it gave way at the seams he didnt select a compromise candidate but tried to impose his choice on the country through his technical parliamentary majority in the event the other parties simply didnt turn up for the vote on mr guls confirmation they then appealed to the constitutional court which held that without them the numbers would be inquorate leaving mr gul unelected the court intentionally sent the country to a june or july national election which is surely the best place to settle the entire matter mr erdogan has responded with predictable acuity proposing new parliamentary term lengths and direct elections for presidency thus offering his akp as the party that most trusts in the ballot box if he wins he simply rewinds to the beginning with prime minister president and house speaker all akp figures he can make such structural changes as to shift the national polity for a several generations so what some say mr erdogan is hardly a fundamentalist sure he and mr gul have said hair raising things in the past an old gul remark made in the s that "the republic is over" recently surfaced in the press but politicians become pragmatic once in power what have he and mr gul done concretely in the last four years to be alarmed about one hears this question particularly from foreign observers who dont understand or cant credit the islamic concept of "takkiye " meaning dissimulation the answer of course is that they have palpably tried to influence the army universities and the constitution itself only to have their efforts stymied by those same institutions even so disturbing incidents abound in the city of van a university dean is sacked because he resisted the request of a fully veiled female student for a go between to deal with male teachers he is later reinstated in istanbuls uskudar district the municipality treats beer bars like a red light zone and you can barely get alcohol anywhere the national newspaper sabah is taken over by state officials and soon the political commentators are being told what to write yasin el kadi a saudi sought by the u s for financial links to terrorism is publicly supported by mr erdogan everywhere barely qualified madrassa graduates replace more qualified secular technocrats in the civil service but the headscarf controversy and the bogeyman of military intervention eclipse such incremental dangers mr erdogan knows how to play the symbols and polarize for political ends one side effect no doubt unintended but predictable is the spike in islamic political violence the murder of a catholic nun near the black sea of protestant missionaries in the town of malatya and so on pulled on either side by europe and the middle east both turkey and turkish identity are as constantly in flux as its institutions are in danger of drifting out of control that this never quite happens is in part due to the military threatening to step in periodically to restore democracy a very turkish paradox a military coup is always a disastrous option but without past coups would there even be a turkey today one need only look at iraq a democracy without an effective army or indeed lebanon to imagine the possibilities turkeys democratic history shows that politicians can too easily lead the country whether by drift or design to such dangerous political extremes as to threaten national stability its wise to judge the merit of a turkish politician by asking where his policies will ultimately lead does mr erdogans populism suggest stability or a hidden drift to extremes the voters will decide soon enough they have got it wrong before with such leaders who can blame them mr kaylan is an istanbul born writer living in new york see related letter "letters to the editor under akp turks may beat their wives lightly" wsj
