face the music a new british invasion amy winehouses rise may say more about the pervasive influence of american music online edition singer songwriter amy winehouse was born on british soil but raised on american music listeners may find that her songs have a haunting familiarity about them most are originals but they sometimes sound like remixes of radio classics from the motown era listen to ms winehouse singing "me &amp mr jones" real windows media is ms winehouses music an echo of the past or a sign of things to come critics have embraced her as both and as the face of what some see as a new trans atlantic trend though one could argue that given her influences ms winehouses ascension isnt really evidence of the rise of a new british musical empire but more proof of the pervasive influence american music and culture have around the world every few years someone in the american media like some pop music paul revere announces that the british are coming back in the s the first supposed british invasion was led by the beatles the rolling stones the kinks and dusty springfield listen to ms springfield singing "son of a preacher man" real windows media a second so called invasion was launched in the late s with the sex pistols the clash and elvis costello over the last few years and increasingly in the last couple months a fresh crop of brits including ms winehouse has come to the fore many in the new group are female singers and several have made an impact on the upper reaches of the u s music charts including lily allen listen to ms allen singing "smile" real windows media the grammy nominated corinne bailey rae listen to her singing "put your records on" real windows media and the grammy winning musical prodigy joss stone listen to her singing "fell in love with a boy" real windows media but please dont call it an invasion first off there is no truly distinct new sound shared by the newest crop of performers the individual styles of the singers actually vary quite widely from polite pop ms rae to cheeky ska lite ms allen and retro soul ms stone in fact the latest group of british performers may not even be all that british i was struck when i talked to ms stone a few months ago that she cited mostly american performers not european ones as her main influences in addition an american r&amp b performer producer raphael saadiq produced her last cd all of which brings us back to ms winehouse her album "back to black" is a bestseller and her single "rehab" is a hit listen real windows media i interviewed her not long ago and found her accent was much thicker talking on the phone than it is when shes singing making me even more conscious of how the american music she loves may have shaped her vocal delivery when she talked about the music her family used to listen to when she was a child almost every act she listed frank sinatra thelonious monk charlie parker michael jackson was american i dont think she was simply catering to me because im an american she was blunt about the american artists she didnt care for such as nina simone indeed ms winehouses music owes much more to america than it does to the u k on "back to black " her songs make lyrical reference to donny hathaway and ray charles her song "tears dry on their own" features an interpolation of "aint no mountain high enough" by american singer songwriters nickolas ashford and valerie simpson listen to ms winehouse singing "tears" real windows media a bonus remix of the song "you know im no good" features ms winehouse dueting with american rapper ghostface killah now of course if one is willing to argue that the newest british influx led by ms winehouse isnt really british and therefore isnt really an invasion then one could also contend that there really never has been a british invasion not now not in the s and not even in the s to say that british invasions arent real isnt to say the acts involved in them arent important obviously the beatles are one of the greatest pop acts of all time and today many critics are embracing ms winehouses music as something serious and noteworthy instead of british invasions what if we said "british echoes" american listeners occasionally seem to need to hear foreign voices singing american music back at them if only to remind them or in some cases show them for the first time the worth of some of the musical forms that have been developed on these shores when americans hear brits singing their music it sends the signal that the music has real value or why would a country with such a rich cultural history be embracing it it would be better if americans didnt need such outside reinforcement of their musical opinions but such reinforcement has been part of pop music for decades in the s and s british acts including eric clapton displayed a devotion for the blues that outstripped that of many americans and helped win the form new respect and listeners in the country that invented it and certainly beatlemania in the s elevated rock in the american pop culture pantheon to a place it had never been before in the late s i remember going with some of my college classmates to see a hot new british singer named terence trent darby he was getting raves in the press and play on the radio and my friends were duly impressed by his live show as it turned out mr darby was originally from new york city and had lived abroad but his british connection helped give his import soul a leg up in the american market mr darby has since changed his name to sananda maitreya hearing american echoes from abroad can offer some fresh insights theres been quite a lot of talk recently about what some see as the vulgar and misogynist content in some hip hop lyrics with voices across the political spectrum condemning the use of racist and sexist language in rap but one thing that isnt discussed enough is that hip hop culture has also given rise to a wave of female vocalists melding hip hop with soul including lauryn hill erykah badu jill scott beyonce and alicia keys and these singer songwriters have created songs that celebrate the strength and resilience of women listen to ms hill singing "selah" real windows media the new wave of british singers coming to american shores were deeply impacted by the sounds of these american singers as well as female american performers from previous generations such as diana ross the links between u s hip hop and soul and the new british vocalists are varied and deep ms hill makes a cameo on ms stones new cd and ms winehouses cd was produced in part by salaam remi who has worked with ms blige and ms hill in my interview with ms winehouse she cited ms hills debut album as having a major impact on her when she was younger trends come and go but artists with talent outlast the musical movements that initially brought them to the publics attention ms winehouse has made the rounds of american talk shows she recently appeared on "the tonight show" and is now on a u s tour she has a rough outspoken personality thats won her loads of press coverage not all of the media attention has been welcome no doubt but she seems to be solidifying her hold on lasting fame the british arent coming theyre already here and they may be staying for a while listen to ms winehouse singing "just friends" real windows media write to christopher john farley
