how to slow down a ferrari buy it more sales in china mean a longer wait in the u s for a new trophy car maranello italy how long should the worlds super rich have to wait before they can buy a ferrari the answer has as much to do with how luxury goods companies create an aura of exclusivity as it does with the global economys shifting winds minting more millionaires in places like china russia and the middle east for years ferrari spa a division of italys fiat spa had a standard month waiting list for a new car that was long enough to make prospective ferrari owners drool with anticipation but not too long to drive them toward competitors such as porsche ag or volkswagen ags lamborghini where waiting times are usually shorter the year long waiting period also allowed ferrari to achieve a rare feat in the automobile industry the resale value of its cars pushed up by loyal collectors and dealers rarely depreciated so confident was ferrari chairman luca cordero di montezemolo of this system that in he boasted the company would never make more than cars a year at the time it was making slightly more than and most of its customers were in three markets north america italy and germany since then however the math and the market logic underlying ferraris approach have been thrown out the window the escalating desire to own a ferrari among the newly rich of asia the middle east and russia has yanked the companys clubby ways out of whack ferrari made cars last year and the number this year will crest above even so average waiting times in hong kong the united states australia and england have soared to around months or more in italy and germany the wait hovers around months ferraris currently retail from &# for a f to &# for a gtb fiorano "we realized a few years ago that we needed to rethink this " says andrea bozzoli ferraris commercial and marketing director "we started to consider months ideal but now we cant even keep up with that " what changed ferrari executives say was a surge in demand in emerging markets the company now sells more than cars annually in the united arab emirates and more than in china two markets where sales were virtually nonexistent only a decade ago ferrari will ship cars to russia this year only three years after opening its first dealership there michael mastrangelo a ferrari dealer in spring valley n y since the s says that in the new york area in recent years the wait has averaged three years for a new ferrari last year when wall street bankers were earning record piles of cash mr mastrangelo couldnt reap the benefits since ferraris headquarters imposes strict limits on how many cars it ships to each dealer mr mastrangelos suburban new york city dealership couldnt sate the demand especially as repeat customers always come first "its very hard to come into a dealership right now and put in a new order if you are not already a customer " he says "when i get a young person what i say is lets start with a used car its kind of like getting into a club " satisfying the desires of these wealthy new consumers goes beyond a hot set of wheels high end fashion and jewelry brands such as gucci group nv and watchmaker patek philippe sa are also retooling product lines and rethinking marketing while in mature markets the target consumers are women men are heavier spenders in many emerging markets so fashion brands have adjusted their message ferrari has always been skittish about making too many cars afraid that even a modest boost in volume could damage its refined image and aspirational appeal even this years increase of above last years cars will strain its one factory all of its cars are customized and its specialized work force spends years in training before joining the assembly line porsche by contrast makes around cars a year for a customized car customers must wait between three and six months according to ferrari now coping with the sudden demand from new quarters is proving awkward "if you go to some arab countries where customers want a car or more than one immediately it can get sticky " says ferraris mr bozzoli ferrari he says tries to make special accommodations for members of royal families and tries to get used cars to tide over important customers until they can get a new one still there is a "feeling of mistrust about the waiting list " says mostyn heard the president of the ferrari owners club of the united arab emirates "people think that you might get moved up or down on the list depending on whether you are a v vip very very important person or merely a successful manager " says mr heard who manages properties for the ruler of dubai sheikh mohammed bin rashid al maktoum and expects to wait three years before his new model will be delivered ferrari admits that there was at least one such case of waiting list tampering but that this no longer occurs there is another problem with multi year waiting lists though they can foster a gray market in which a person who takes delivery of a new ferrari immediately flips it to an even hungrier buyer for sometimes double the price that weakens ferraris ability to control its pricing and resale value and keep track of its coveted customers its a similar problem that has plagued high end fashion labels for years designs that hit stores in paris or milan first would be snapped up by dealers who resold them in boutiques in asia big luxury goods conglomerates from gucci to lvmh moet hennessy louis vuitton sa have since tightened their supply chains to ensure new lines hit their global store network at the same time and when possible at the same price of the roughly ferrari fs circulating in the uae only about three were sold through the local dealership estimates mr heard the rest were bought off mostly europeans for what is often a substantial premium ferrari is trying to stem the problem by policing waiting lists from dealers world wide getting on the list usually requires fronting a portion of the cars sales price and providing proof of sufficient funds to cover the rest moreover ferrari tries to weed out duplicate names or people it thinks might be posing as a front for another buyer says amedeo felisa ferraris general manager meanwhile ferrari is trying to keep up with the demands of its new consumers at the shanghai auto show in april ferrari
