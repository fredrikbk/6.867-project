independent directors tackling b fee group to write guidelines on duties in assessing key distribution charge mutual fund directors have long voiced concern about their responsibility to review a key distribution fee paid out of fund assets called the b fee now an association of independent directors has prepared guidelines to help fund directors assess the fee the report to be released today follows an announcement earlier this year by top officers of the securities and exchange commission that they will review the eponymous b rule that allows this fee "independent directors are very uncomfortable with the system as it is now " says david smith executive vice president of the mutual fund directors forum its report aims to provide directors a guide to fulfill their fiduciary duty says mr smith rule b was adopted in the s when mutual funds were facing net redemptions and it allowed the use of fund assets to pay for distribution and thus help funds grow over the years however the use of this fee has changed and it is now primarily used either as an alternative to front end loads to compensate intermediaries like brokers or for payment of services like administration and shareholder services the rule requires that a majority of the funds independent directors assess and approve the funds b plan every year with a goal to ensure that the money ultimately benefits fund shareholders but directors say its tough to discern these benefits because for one thing the money is often bundled together to pay for several services it can be difficult to assess what proportion of the fee is going to which service says mr smith directors also are limited in their say of how much b fee should be paid for instance once the fund adviser chooses a particular distribution channel such as a broker dealer the b fee to be paid is either decided by the broker or the marketplace "we sort of have no control over that " says john a hill an independent trustee at mutual fund giant putnam funds the sec had originally listed some factors that a board may consider while considering this fee but experts say those factors arent very relevant in todays industry environment "how does a director fulfill the responsibility to fund shareholders with vague outdated guidance " says jay baris a lawyer at kramer levin naftalis &amp frankel llp the forums report aims to help provide some best practices among its various recommendations the report advises that directors carefully assess the funds overall distribution plan and understand where b plan fits into that they should also look at factors such as the funds share class structure and whether the costs associated with the funds distribution are justified by competitive conditions the forum next plans to prepare recommendations for the sec on how to improve the b rule mr smith says there have been a range of proposals to tackle this such as taking directors out of the b review process altogether to merging it with management fees some like mr hill would prefer to eliminate it totally "i dont think its the right way to finance distribution because its not clear and it lacks transparency " says mr hill
