enterprise the benefits of plugging a big companys products appearing in ads gives small firms marketing without any costs in mid february verizon communications inc emailed its small business customers in philadelphia to ask if they would like to be featured in a radio ad campaign in hours the telecom giant received emails one came from jill gizzio founder of dogtoys com a web retailer and wholesaler of pet products based in west chester pa last month her story that of a seven employee business that has used verizons broadband technology for the past years was showcased with two other local entrepreneurs in a regional promotion that brought significant attention to her tiny company "it was the easiest thing ive ever done" in terms of marketing dogtoys com says the year old ms gizzio companies that provide products and services directly to small businesses such as banks credit card companies and package delivery firms have for years used ads featuring entrepreneurs but other big companies are increasingly realizing that using real people with real businesses in their ad campaigns lends credibility to their efforts and provides a cheap and effective way to target niche audiences be it the african american latino or other communities environmentally conscious consumers or even pet enthusiasts for their part small businesses featured in these ads get the kind of marketing and recognition that might take them years to get on their own and they do so with very little effort and on someone elses tab the one thing small businesses have to be willing to do of course is promote somebody elses product gloria barczak marketing professor at northeastern university in boston says small business owners want to be careful not to appear in ads in which the sponsor company may be going through a difficult time or whose image doesnt fit with the one theyre trying to create "you want to be connected with brands that are saying something similar to what youre trying to say " ms barczak says in the email that was conveyed in the commercial ms gizzio told of how important her verizon internet connection has been since she started her online business and she says she has no qualms about promoting another companys product "the verizon commercial is helping to brand my company " she says although the commercial didnt result in an immediate sales increase she says the ad helped her business reach a higher level of credibility she says a contact from a local retailer that she had been courting for a year and a half to do consulting work finally returned her call and set up a meeting after hearing the commercial ms gizzio says that at the meeting the retailer wanted to know "how i managed to have that happen " referring to the verizon ad another small

his name and company with the blackberry mr lowry wanted to know about rims green efforts he says he was satisfied with the answers he received so rim flew mr lowry to new york for a minute photo and video shoot the blackberry ads featuring method which began in december and are still running appear online in magazines and in videos displayed in office elevators "theyre a big brand and well respected " says mr lowry "and to have the method name associated with them is probably not a bad thing " he says its hard to know what the impact of the blackberry promotion has been so far but the company has received lots of calls and emails from customers about the ad method which has employees generated &# million in revenue last year some other small businesses have gotten a boost from
