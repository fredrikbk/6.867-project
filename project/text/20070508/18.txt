alcoas pursuit of alcan faces several hurdles rivals governments could thwart an offer valued at &# billion alcoa inc s audacious &# billion bid for rival alcan inc escalates the buyout frenzy in the commodity world where buyers are running out of prime assets to acquire it also raises tough questions for antitrust regulators about how big is too big in an increasingly global market alcoa said that if it succeeds its cross border offer for the canadian company which has rejected previous overtures from alcoa would create an aluminum giant with annual revenue of about &# billion and employees together the companies would own mines alumina refineries and aluminum smelters on six continents and would be able to produce million metric tons of aluminum a year about of global capacity the offer comes as aluminum ingots which are heated and rolled into aluminum sheets bars and other products are selling for about &# a metric ton on the london metal exchange though down from their record in july prices remain at historically high levels partly due to strong demand from emerging markets and are double what they were a few years ago a merger of alcoa and alcan would reunite two companies that were split up decades ago because of antitrust concerns which alcoa says it will allay this time around by divesting certain assets most likely plants that make aluminum plate and other products for the aerospace industry alcoa may face other challenges too including rival bids for alcan from mining companies such as bhp billiton ltd and rio tinto plc or it might itself become a target of those companies alcan shares were up &# or nearly at &# in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange as market watchers speculated that competing offers for the montreal based company could be in the works in defending his companys bid alcoa chairman and chief executive alain belda said the competitive landscape had changed drastically since when alcoa had to sell off alcan he said he expects antitrust regulators to consider the fact that new and bigger aluminum producers are emerging in russia china and the middle east and becoming formidable global competitors he said alcoa has already discussed some antitrust concerns with regulators "im confident the measure will be approved " said mr belda who added that alcoa and alcan had been discussing a merger for two years alcoas offer is whats known as a "bear hug " falling short of a hostile bid but ratcheting up the pressure on the target company by taking an offer directly to its shareholders in a statement alcan said its board will consider alcoas proposal company officials declined to comment an official at canadas competition bureau said the agency expects to make a speedy review of the takeover bid to succeed alcoa which is based in pittsburgh and new york has to win over canadian officials the government pension fund is a large shareholder and alcan has ownership stakes in some of canadas government sponsored hydropower projects moreover there is an element of national pride with alcan representing canadas leadership in the global marketplace "its a bad day for canada " john mccallum a liberal member of the canadian parliament and critic on finance issues said yesterday in an interview with dow jones newswires alcoas mr belda sought to soothe such sentiments meeting with the media in montreal yesterday he said the combined company would maintain its executive offices in montreal and new york and would be a bigger company in canada than it is today he said the company would consider divesting certain assets most likely aerospace related businesses to satisfy concerns that the combined company would control too much of that market for the most part however the big users of aluminum plate in the aerospace industry have long term purchasing contracts that would severely limit how much alcoa could raise their prices moreover aluminum makers have had to keep price increases in check or risk losing business to makers of such alternative materials as carbon fiber composites and titanium john douglass president and chief executive of the aerospace industries association a trade group that represents the aerospace industry said manufacturers will be watching closely to see what happens with pricing "if this runs the price of aluminum up it will accelerate the industrys efforts to replace aluminum with other materials such as carbon fiber composites " he said both boeing and airbus are using lightweight carbon fiber plastic for about of their newest wide body planes most notably to replace traditionally aluminum wings and fuselage skins an airbus spokeswoman said large scale consolidation among existing metal businesses was something to be wary of and that airbus will keep a close eye on the situation mr belda contends size is critical in the aluminum market "bigger is better in this business because of the types of risks we have to take on to go to politically risky places you have to be bigger than the hole you can fall in " he said yesterday at a news conference a spokeswoman for the u s justice department said yesterday that the agency would be likely to take a hard look at any deal however the offer comes at an auspicious time for mergers in the u s of the deals the justice department formally challenged last year none of them were blocked outright despite their size in each of them justice department staffers found ways to modify the transaction to allow it to proceed while protecting consumers they said antitrust lawyers yesterday were predicting a similar outcome for any alcoa alcan deal even so a merger review could take more than six months and result in substantial changes to reflect the concerns of big customers such as auto makers and aircraft manufacturers some aluminum industry analysts suggest that alcoa and alcan might have to divest the ravenswood plant in west virginia or another facility that makes aerospace products "i really cant see why regulators would be upset " stewart spector a long time aluminum consultant and analyst "there is no monopoly today they dont control the price of aluminum ingot " charles bradford a new york based metals analyst with bradford research soleil said antitrust concerns would probably not come into play for bauxite or alumina because they are commodity products bauxite is the mined raw material that is refined into alumina the white powdery substance that is then smelted into aluminum mr belda first broached a buyout of alcan in april during a series of meetings with outgoing alcan ceo travis engen who rejected the idea according to a source familiar with the talks mr belda then courted alcans current ceo richard evans with dozens of phone calls and meetings which began in march by september the two men had agreed on the logic and possibility of a merger of equals with equal board and executive representation in the combined company according to a person familiar with the matter the executives agreed that mr belda would be executive chairman of the combined company until his retirement in and mr evans would be ceo and that each company would get five board seats the talks ran into problems over confidentiality and standstill agreements but the two sides continued to try to iron out those issues in october and november on dec alcans mr evans told mr belda by phone that the board had met and concluded that "alcan was not ready to move ahead with the transaction regardless of the issues on the standstill agreement " according to a person familiar with the talks during that period alcoas stock languished while alcans rose alcoa decided to step back until march when its board agreed to take the takeover offer directly to alcans shareholders but time may be running out for big commodity companies to find partners in march russian companies oao rusal and sual merged with the alumina arm of switzerland based glencore ag in a three way deal that created united co rusal with its expansion plans the new company could rival alcoa as the worlds no aluminum producer by output meanwhile aluminum corp of china ltd better known as chalco has been rapidly consolidating in china and looking to produce aluminum abroad several low cost smelters are being built in the middle east and there have been a number of smaller takeover deals in the sector indias hindalco industries ltd agreed in february to acquire novelis inc a maker of rolled aluminum used in products such as beer cans and cars for &# billion plus debt novelis was spun off from alcan inc in after alcans acquisition of french aluminum producer pechiney many of alcoas fastest growing competitors have significant access to cheap and abundant natural gas a crucial energy source for aluminum production with alcan alcoa would gain access to low cost canadian hydropower alcoa has already been shifting production to energy rich locations like iceland and trinidad and closing smelters in north america "this is the only way the company will compete against the russians or the chinese " said mr spector the industry consultant "the russians are very low cost producers because of their hydro powered assets in siberia " alcoas cash and stock bid values each share of alcan at &# a premium to alcans closing price friday on the nyse of &# a record for the stock the offer includes &# a share in cash and of an alcoa share alcoa said the combined company would realize at least &# billion in pretax cost savings annually from a merger starting in the third year after the deal closes "from an economic point of view its a perfect match now the only thing alcoa has to worry about is that someone bigger doesnt come along and try to take over both of them " mr spector said speculation has been building in recent months that bhp billiton or rio tinto or another mining titan could bid to buy alcoa or alcan doing so would enable them to consolidate their position in aluminum while preventing competitors from snatching up the few remaining blue chip players in the sector rumors heated up in february after the times of london reported bhp and rio tinto had both "drawn up plans" for a &# billion takeover of alcoa rio tinto and bhp declined to comment on the speculation and alcoa officials at the time played down the report other interested companies could include glencore controlled xstrata plc or brazilian mining giant cia vale do rio doce or cvrd two weeks ago alcoa said it was looking at spinning off or selling all or part of its underperforming consumer packaging and automobile components businesses analysts said at the time that such a move could make alcoa an attractive takeover target j lynn lunsford john r
