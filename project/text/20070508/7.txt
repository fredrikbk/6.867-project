abc cox bar ad skipping in video on demand big tv hits espn football will be available free but no zapping commercials walt disney cos two big tv networks abc and espn have struck a deal with cable operator cox communications inc to offer hit shows and football games on demand but with the unusual condition that cox disables the fast forward feature that allows viewers to skip ads the agreement only applies to programs available on coxs video on demand menu so it doesnt affect viewers using digital video recorders to fast forward through ads nevertheless it sets a valuable precedent for broadcasters tv networks have been struggling as audiences erode and ad sales drop because new technology including rapidly growing video on demand services allows viewers to avoid commercials altogether the deal expected to be announced today at the national cable television associations annual convention in las vegas could make it easier for the major networks to make their most popular shows available on demand for free because networks have found it difficult to sell advertising for on demand broadcasts most offered only a few shows and viewers usually have had to pay a fee of cents per episode to watch those broadcasters have been eager to include advertising however because they see it as more lucrative than charging for each episode abc and other networks are also loath to allow viewers access to shows without any advertising component because they worry it will train them to expect that type of viewing experience all the time "advertising is critical to the financial health of our business and this agreement marks the first time one of our cable operator partners is acknowledging that " says anne sweeney president of the disney abc television group the agreement could also provide broadcast networks a way to give viewers an alternative to the convenience offered by digital video recorders without allowing them to avoid the ads with dvrs now in almost of u s households the number of people watching television when it is broadcast has dipped noticeably so far this season thats a contentious issue for broadcasters and advertisers cox the nations third largest cable operator was willing to nix fast forwarding to gain access to popular abc and espn content on demand programming aggressively rolled out by cable operators over the past three years provides cable operators a competitive edge over satellite tv providers such as directv group inc in the race for subscribers video on demand is a huge and growing business media research firm convergence consulting predicts vod revenue will total &# billion this year with the business growing to &# billion by more than million households have access to vod and usage has been growing quickly the total number of views of on demand programming in totaled billion according to research firm rentrak ondemand essentials up from billion in most of the programming available on vod until now has been movies and shows from various cable networks under the disney cox distribution deal viewers will be able to watch episodes of the hit series "greys anatomy " "desperate housewives " "lost " and "ugly betty" for free whenever they choose starting in the fall episodes will be available hours after they premiere on abc espn will chip in a package of college football games the amount of advertising incorporated into the on demand offerings is still under negotiation according to george bodenheimer president of espn and abc sports viewers wont necessarily see the same number of commercials watching an episode of "ugly betty" on demand as they would if they watched the broadcast version for instance cox will likely get one second commercial per episode to pitch its own products the remainder of the spots will be a mix of national ads sold by the disney abc television group and local ads sold by abcs affiliated stations in an important component of the deal the two companies will also test technology that will place ads in shows based on zip codes and geographic area cox and disney will also test a system to place fresh commercials in available episodes every few days so that ads dont grow stale a viewer who decides to watch an episode of "greys anatomy" in october for instance wont see an ad for a movie that opened in september the test will start in orange county calif where cox has about subscribers ms sweeney says she expects it to be quickly rolled out to additional cox markets however cox has about six million subscribers across the country whether viewers will swallow non skippable commercials in on demand content is a major question particularly since they are already accustomed to being able to zoom past ads using their dvr remotes the exploding use of digital video recorders also diminishes the impact of coxs agreement to disable the fast forward feature on its on demand offerings users who have a dvr could simply record the same shows as they air live and skip the ads using that device cox president pat esser says research indicates that subscribers would rather have access to programming on demand than the ability to skip commercials "people want their content and they want it for free but i think they realize that there is a business model to keep intact for them to get it that way " he says still cox isnt planning to disable the fast forward feature on the dvrs it rents to customers "thats not something we would do " he says the feature is so popular on dvrs that such a move would likely send customers fleeing to satellite operators who also offer dvrs broadcasters have long resisted efforts by cable operators to offer on demand viewing of popular tv shows worrying that it could cannibalize their existing businesses by eroding their ability to sell advertising for programs and reap lucrative profit by selling reruns but interest in watching shows through routes that dont include the living room tv set has surged over the past year and networks are scrambling to figure out ways to meet demand without ripping up their business model most of the networks are now offering at least some of their prime time shows on the web cbs corp s cbs and nbc a unit of general electric co s nbc universal broke a longtime industry taboo about offering shows on demand in late by making hit prime time shows available on directv and cable systems operated by comcast corp ad notes publicis and droga team up to create honeyshed publicis groupe sa and droga llc a small new york ad boutique run by former publicis executive david droga will announce today plans to launch a web site for so called branded entertainment but unlike other examples of the genre movies and tv shows created by marketers
