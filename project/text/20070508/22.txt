business technology talking tech computers should be taught to let certain memories go the ability of computers to store information forever is usually seen as one of their selling points but viktor mayer schoenberger a professor at harvards kennedy school of government wonders if we might be getting that wrong human beings he said werent designed to remember everything we ever learned and sometimes are better off when we forget computers he adds should as a result be taught to let some memories go q how have computers changed our ideas about memory a for humans remembering has always been very hard while we have developed tools over time to help ourselves remember like writing things down it still takes time and effort but now in the digital age this has switched now the default is remembering storing and retaining all the data we collect and deleting is really hard it really takes an extra effort to delete we are biologically hard wired to selectively remember but in moving into a digital age we are now surrounding ourselves with tools that have inversed that q how does this make life different a in the pre digital age we might have called someone who knew a person we were interested in learning about got them to tell us about the person and we would get a quick picture but not a complete and comprehensive picture of each and every piece of communication or behavior that the person did over the past years i think we have lost something by moving from that sort of short encapsulation toward a complete picture that provides us with all the details the sort that over time we as a society and as human beings tend to forget q but whats the problem with that a things that happened or years ago might have happened to a different person therefore we should put less weight on what we did years ago than we would do now in the past our brains did this automatically for us by forgetting it but we havent been able to develop another evolutionary method another method by which we can weigh things that happened further in the past differently from those that happened more recently q so what do we do a my proposal is that we have a law that mandates that software coders build into software a better ability for people to let their digital tools forget if they so wish right now both windows as well as mac os have a huge amount of meta data that they keep track of for each file that we use "date created " "owner " and so on so i suggest that we add another type of meta data "expiration date " q doesnt that go against the whole modern legal approach to record keeping a i am primarily interested in personal information about people rather than corporate records i have no problem with a law saying that certain kinds of records need to be kept for five years or years or years though i do question the rationale for keeping things forever
