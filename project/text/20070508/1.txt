a less invasive test for down syndrome can the thickness of a fetuss neck be a sign of down syndrome an ultrasound test called nuchal translucency combined with a blood test reliably alerts early in pregnancy if a baby is likely to be born with down syndrome proponents say doctors say the test is an excellent screening tool but caution that riskier invasive tests are needed for a definite answer nuchal translucency done in the first to weeks of pregnancy is a test in which a highly trained sonographer views a fetus and measures its size and neck thickness down syndrome the most common chromosome abnormality that leads to mental retardation causes fluid buildup in the back of the neck nuchal translucency or nt has grown in popularity in recent years particularly when used with a blood test for two proteins earlier this year the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists said the combined test was effective and recommended that all women not just those over be offered down syndrome screening the combined screen involves first a blood test and then about a week later an ultrasound the ultrasound takes anywhere from minutes to a half hour or more if there is a wait for the fetus to move face up there isnt a simple yes or no answer but rather a personalized risk assessment perkinelmer inc s ntd laboratories unit one of the nations largest providers of first trimester screening says it gives results ranging from "greater than in " risk of having a baby with down syndrome to "less than in " in general in of live babies is born with down syndrome based on the result a woman can decide whether to get an invasive test such as chorionic villus sampling or an amniocentesis both tests detect nearly all cases of down syndrome but carry an increased risk of miscarriage to calculate the accuracy of the nt and blood test combination scientists often take an arbitrary risk level such as in and count that as a positive result with that definition a person study published in in the new england journal of medicine found that when combined testing was done at weeks of down syndrome cases were detected that is compared with for a second trimester screening of four blood proteins which until recently had been the standard moreover accuracy declined with every week women waited to take the combined test at weeks only of cases were detected "earlier is better weve definitively proven that " says mary e dalton the studys senior author and chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at columbia university college of physicians and surgeons the downside is that of the women tested had a false alarm which means some miscarriages were caused by invasive testing if a woman is willing to wait longer for results she can choose to get the first trimester screen with nt and the second trimester screen raising the detection rate to as much as because skill level dramatically affects accuracy look for a doctor credentialed by a group such as the washington d c based nuchal translucency quality review program www ntqr org email aches wsj com
