real id revolt back in when republicans ran congress and were convinced that bashing immigration would help the party retain its majority president bush signed the real id act sold as a homeland security measure the law requires the states to issue federally approved drivers licenses and link their identification databases two years later a growing number of states are telling congress what it can do with its de facto national id card decree so far seven states have enacted statutes or resolutions opposing the implementation of real id and oklahoma is on the verge of becoming the eighth oklahoma city and tulsa arent known as liberal hotbeds anti real id measures have passed at least one chamber of legislatures in states and been introduced in others costs and privacy concerns explain much of the opposition a study released last year by the national governors association which opposes the law put the implementation price tag at &# billion but an analysis by the department of homeland security released in march concedes that the costs will be at least double that amount under real id which is scheduled to go into effect next year all million current license holders in the u s are required to head down to the local department of motor vehicles with certified source documents such as a birth certificate or social security card to apply for the new standardized national id and people from states that dont play ball wont be able to use their licenses to board planes or enter federal buildings in california today where a nation high million licenses are issued residents can renew by mail real id requires that you appear in person so americans can be grateful that dmvs nationwide are known as models of hassle free efficiency be sure to book a free afternoon americans are rational and in a post world they are willing to trade some freedom and convenience for more security but its not at all clear that real id will make us safer deputizing motor vehicle office clerks who would be entrusted with sensitive information and access to a national databank also entails considerable privacy risk fraud and security lapses at dmvs today are hardly uncommon just last month a dmv official in north carolina was arrested in connection with issuing fraudulent drivers licenses and if the goal is to stop the next mohammed atta its worth noting that even under real id people would be permitted to fly with identification other than licenses real id was always more about harassing mexican illegals than stopping islamic terrorists its true that the commission urged the federal government to "set standards for the issuance of sources of identification such as drivers licenses " thats why the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of included tougher identity security provisions the law also directed the departments of transportation and homeland security to work with state officials technology experts and privacy groups to come up with standards that balance security and civil liberties but in an effort to placate noisy anti immigration conservatives amid the gops poll driven election panic then house judiciary chairman james sensenbrenner gutted those provisions and replaced them with the expensive and intrusive real id for unexplained reasons immigration restrictionists are convinced that preventing illegal aliens from obtaining drivers licenses will result in fewer illegal aliens rather than merely more unlicensed and uninsured motorists mr sensenbrenner attached real id to a must past military spending bill without hearings or much debate and mr bush made the mistake of signing it in addition to the revolt in the states legislation co sponsored by john sununu r n h and daniel akaka d hawaii has been introduced in the senate their bill would repeal the real id act and return to the negotiated rulemaking process laid out in the intelligence reform bill senate judiciary chairman pat leahy has scheduled a hearing for today on real id the kind of session that usually takes place before something becomes law perhaps mr sensenbrenner should be invited to explain the national revolt against his handiwork
