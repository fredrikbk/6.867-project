lvmh books passage to india for vuitton dior fendi celine new delhi when the french fashion house hermes tried to rent space for a boutique in new delhis new high end shopping mall recently there were no good locations left lvmh moet hennessy louis vuitton sa had already taken all the best spots "when they arrive with their brands they push everyone else out " says christian blanckaert hermess executive vice president who visited new delhi in march to scope out locations for the brands first stores in india since its biggest brand leather goods maker louis vuitton entered india in lvmh has been pushing aggressively to bring its other labels into the growing new market italian fashion house fendi watchmaker tag heuer and dior perfumes and makeup all part of lvmhs portfolio of over brands have already opened up shop and kenzo and the makeup and perfume chain sephora could arrive soon now lvmh has become enough of a mass presence in india to call the shots in negotiations over real estate and advertising space it is also using its clout to prod the countrys government to change restrictive laws particularly on high import tariffs at the emporio shopping mall in new delhi lvmh has hogged two of the best locations by reserving boutique space for louis vuitton and dior and it is considering opening shops for other brands including fendi and celine the shopping center is scheduled to open by the end of the year in india the rush for good space is key to cementing a presence in one of the worlds hottest emerging luxury goods markets until now nearly all of the luxury boutiques were confined to high end hotels and competition is fierce for the few new retail locations that are suitable with the september launch of vogue india lvmh will have more opportunities to tap synergies alex kuruvilla the managing director for conde nast india which publishes vogue says lvmh will be buying bulk ad space for its brands at discounted rates "lvmh is in a better position than other small individual brands " says hsbc luxury goods analyst antoine belge the clout lvmh yields in india is a reminder of one of the key drivers behind the multibrand strategy in the luxury goods industry the worlds major fashion groups embarked on major acquisitions in the late s with lvmh snapping up small family owned brands such as fendi and pucci that were having trouble competing in the global marketplace the goal was threefold having a portfolio of brands to offset the risk of fashion cycles pooling sourcing and manufacturing to reduce costs and negotiating top positions and discounts when buying bulk advertising and retail space the first two drivers havent worked as well as expected many of the small brands that lvmh and other groups including ppr sas gucci group and compagnie financiere richemont sa bought in the s still arent making money executives at individual fashion brands wanted to hold onto images that were distinct from the other labels under the same umbrella rendering production synergies difficult but the third aspect of the multibrand strategy getting prime retail and advertising space has reaped results in tokyos omotesando neighborhood for example one of the most coveted shopping addresses in the world lvmh has bagged boutiques for fendi and celine that are right next to each other so far lvmh is the only luxury goods conglomerate to build up a group presence in india italian brand gucci the anchor of gucci group is leaning on its local distributor the murjani group instead of leveraging its multibrand structure "scale does help " says mohan murjani the companys chairman who is also launching brands like jimmy choo and lingerie maker la perla in india as lvmhs most powerful brand louis vuitton has helped pave the way for the groups other labels in india it opened its first store in the lobby of new delhis oberoi hotel in after persuading the hotels owner to convert his office into a boutique last year it helped sister label dior snag the space across the corridor similarly at the historic taj mahal palace hotel in mumbai where louis vuitton opened a store three years ago the french brands reputation benefited fendi which unveiled its first indian store there at the end of last year "it becomes easier to deal with a company were familiar with " says farhat jamal general manager of the taj mahal hotel mr jamal says he chose fendi over competing luxury brands for the five year lease and one of the display windows in the taj mahal palaces main hallway recently featured another lvmh brand dom perignon champagne lvmhs sway in india is becoming even more important with the development of new luxury malls emporio is still months from completion metal rods stick out of concrete blocks at the work site in the south of new delhi but its already clear that vuitton and dior will have the most prominent locations facing onto the main road moreover while many retail projects languish in india because of delays in signing deals and development lvmhs local expertise could help sephora get off to a running start local lvmh executives have scouted space for sephora at the mass market mall under construction adjacent to emporio says tikka shatrujit singh an adviser to louis vuitton in india "everything is based on strategic relationships and that takes time " he says indian mall developers now organize trips to paris to consult with lvmh on architecture and design before breaking ground on a new project mr singh says in addition to locating store sites and negotiating ad deals lvmh executives spend a lot of time lobbying the government while they support the efforts of u s and european union policy makers to lower indias high import tariffs on products like champagne and cognac lvmh officials are also trying to press their case before indian government officials themselves its not the first time lvmh has become involved in public policy issues to further its business interests in china the french company works actively with government authorities to help crack down on counterfeiting louis vuitton chief executive yves carcelle says he has visited indias minister of commerce and industry kamal nath several times over the past few years to press another issue the right of foreign brands to own the local retail operations through which their labels are sold in india owning the stores rather than running them via a local partner would give foreign brands more flexibility and authority in deciding how to market and sell their products mr carcelle says his endeavors are starting to pay off last summer louis vuitton and fendi were two of the first foreign brands permitted to take a stake in their local distributors "the ultimate goal " said mr carcelle during a visit to india in march "is to be able to own "
