in keeping shareholder resentment at bay ahead of a shareholder vote yet to be scheduled abns relationship with shareholders has been contentious throughout the battle to complete what would be the

fund called for the firing of abn chief executive rijkman groenink the consortium led by royal bank of scotland group plc also could return with a hostile bid for abn or new bidders still could emerge

chicago operation to bank of america for &# billion the consortium led by rbs chief executive fred goodwin said its bid was "materially greater" than bank of americas and would have led to a public

martinez and mr groenink friday night at dinner abns executives were surprised according to people familiar with the situation on saturday the consortium submitted a proposal it would bid &# billion

sides had lost valuable time working through those issues sunday abn tried to persuade the consortium to separate its bid for all of abn from its bid for lasalle mr martinez told the group several times the board would accept any lasalle bid alone that was &# higher than bank of americas people familiar with the matter said the consortium wouldnt budge according to people close to the matter by
