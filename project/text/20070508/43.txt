do a majority of americans really support partial birth decision kirsten powers suggests that anyone critical of the supreme courts recent gonzales v carhart abortion decision is "at odds" with a majority of americans who "applauded the decision " citing polls showing widespread opposition to "late term abortions except to save the life of the mother" "out of the mainstream " editorial page may leaving aside that the federal statute upheld in carhart contains no such medical exception this apparent equation of a judicial decision with its immediate perceived result reflects a double standard for judging judges courts today are doggedly scrutinized and criticized for any hint of "result oriented" or "activist" decision making but measures of popular opinion about court decisions invariably focus only on result not on reasoning or precedent so negative personal views of late term abortion presumably easy to elicit with poll questions are rendered as support for a legal decision upholding a particular statutory ban a conflation of preference and analysis precisely of the kind we mean to prohibit judges from committing of course there are innumerable ways to probe opinions of the merits of the carhart decision including "do you think congress should be able to dictate abortion law to all the states " or "is congress or a pregnant womans physician better able to identify and resolve any medical threats to her life or health " is there a single polling question that would yield a fair evaluation of the court michael g bosko newport beach calif ms powers aptly points out the gross inconsistency of those in the democratic party who claim they stand for the weak and the voiceless but vigorously support partial birth abortion in fact when the argument is made that a woman has the right to make decisions regarding her own body it leaves out the body that is being destroyed via partial birth abortions to his credit for bucking his partys leaders and mantra rep james p morans d va statement is right on point "its not about a womans right to choose its about a babys right to life " maybe it would be easier to understand the sincerity of those making the pro partial birth argument even when not agreeing with it if the flip side of lifes cycle were looked at in the same manner dr kevorkian is in prison for helping individuals with horrific and fatal diseases have a dignified and peaceful death at their request reading the description of partial birth abortions one could certainly never use the words dignified or peaceful the individuals dr kevorkian assisted wanted control of their bodies and their lives just as those wanting a partial birth abortion claim to want and their doctors are free and thriving while dr kevorkian is in prison thus as it now stands a woman wanting control over her body is said to have "rights " but a person with a fatal and horrific disease is denied the same "rights " and lets not forget that overriding all of this is the haunting statement rep moran made about the one person in these debates who has no voice or rights at all in his or her fate larry stewart vienna va in regard to john yoos april editorial page commentary "partial birth bigotry" if playing the religious identification card is unfair in gonzales v carhart then playing the religious doctrine as coercive law card against recognized religious practice is even more so for some the issue with any abortion is about the life of the fetus alone the possibly fatal or personally injurious damage to the mother in childbirth is secondary to such beliefs this is not the religious conviction of most jews nor is it true of many protestants it is entirely possible to resolve the conflict of the two lives the fetus and its mother in favor of the mother the coercive application of law in favor of one religions beliefs about beginning and end of life issues against the religious practices of another is an arbitrary abrogation of the first amendments establishment clause mr yoos invocation of john f kennedys houston speech in which kennedy openly refused to place his religious beliefs over his civic duty is the legal opposite of the kennedy majoritys intention in gonzales what ought to stand out for mr yoo is that the jewish and protestant justices are not coercing their religious point of view on a majority of the american people who feel that conservatives have gone too far that the senate tactics committed to secure conservative appellate and supreme court positions were untraditional and extreme and that this recent court decision was an undemocratic religious judgment that stemmed from the earlier confirmation overreach rather there is an amazing coincidence that five catholic justices happen to support the doctrine of the catholic church ben burrows elkins park pa
