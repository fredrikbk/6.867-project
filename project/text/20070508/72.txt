in the fray what would mrs newcomb do today the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal will hear oral arguments in howard v tulane the latest round of a fight between tulane university and the supporters of newcomb college a womens school within the university the outcome of this controversy may have implications that reach far beyond hurricane ravaged new orleans to the future of philanthropy in higher education in the only daughter of josephine louise lemonnier newcomb wife of a wealthy kentucky merchant died of diphtheria at age to honor sophies memory mrs newcomb donated &# the equivalent of &# million today to tulane "to be used in establishing the h sophie newcomb memorial college for the higher education of white girls and young women i further request that the education given shall look to the practical side of life as well as to literary excellence " in newcomb became the first degree granting coordinate college for women while under the universitys auspices newcomb held separate classes and had separate residences from the men of tulane and gave students its own degree when years later jordan lamfers applied to newcomb she was still expecting a distinctive sort of education her grandmother had graduated from newcomb and ms lamfers now a junior tells me "i wanted the same experience that i had heard about from her a girls college inside of a larger university " but over the years newcombs arrangements changed in the s classes went co ed and black students were admitted in the s a single curriculum was adopted for tulane men and newcomb women and in the s the faculties of tulane and newcomb merged in taking these steps newcomb was hardly unique but according to lynn gordon author of "gender and higher education in the progressive era " there was another factor at newcomb pushing it in this direction as early as world war i the tulane administration was "trying to get rid of the colleges independence even though they didnt want to admit women they wanted to control the finances " certainly ms gordon notes newcomb had a lot of money for an independent womens college this allowed it to offer many programs she suspects tulane would not have otherwise funded she cites the schools well known pottery studio this was important because according to ms gordon mrs newcomb "expected the school to give women students not only a good liberal arts education " she was also "open to the idea of empowering women to work if they needed to " despite the social and financial pressures the women of newcomb continued to have their own academic advising administrators diplomas student government and some extracurricular activities for decades after its classes and residences were integrated with tulanes a popular program called intensive newcomb combines womens studies classes with hands on leadership experience for women but in august the university was thrown into disarray by hurricane katrina and had to shut down after suffering an estimated &# million in property damage with no students on campus who was paying tuition with no tuition how could they keep the professors with so many homes destroyed where would everyone live but the school did manage to reopen in january with of its student body returning as a condition for reopening the administration set forth a "plan for renewal " which reorganized and pared down the school its seven undergraduate colleges of which newcomb was one were reduced to five according to yvette jones tulanes ceo the university had to get rid of about &# million a year in expenses and figure out how to attract students to an area less desirable and safe than two years ago newcomb college was replaced by the newcomb institute which would have no dean no degrees no campus and no student body ms jones acknowledges that tulane didnt save any money by eliminating the college it had only one administrative position and so does the institute she says the university thought that newcomb programs should continue but be open to other women undergraduates at tulane tulane had tried this before and newcomb students and alumnae were convinced that katrina was a convenient excuse so ms lamfers joined a lawsuit with other students and alumnae in federal court last year charging that the school was not acting in their best interests or those of its founding donor that suit was dismissed on the ground that the group did not have any standing to object to tulanes actions just as that decision was handed down though the group found josephine newcombs heirs her sisters great granddaughters the two women parma matthis howard and jane matthis smith now elderly themselves filed their own lawsuit this time in louisiana state court where mrs newcombs will had been filed their request for a permanent injunction against tulane is being heard today ms howard describes a long family tradition of support for single sex education "i think the concentration is better " she tells me "and i think some girls just blossom in that situation " ms howard has always admired newcomb "when all this came to light " she recalls "i was just appalled this little lady lost a daughter who died at and established this school in her name and all of a sudden the powers that be at tulane decided to dissolve this school " shawn holahan the sisters lawyer and a newcomb alum says their case "has to do with donor intent it goes to heart of planned giving of any institution " if someone leaves money in a will with certain conditions she explains you must adhere to those conditions if youre going to take the money renee seblatnigg another alumna is president of the future of newcomb college a nonprofit organization devoted to stopping tulane from subsuming newcomb she claims the administration presented the plan for renewal to the board of trustees as an "all or nothing deal " and truth be told there is something a little fishy in the administrations logic did the college really need to be closed to offer the same programs to tulane women not enrolled in newcomb doesnt doing so cost even more money ms gordon notes that when radcliffe college was turned into an "institute" a few years ago the harvard administration promised it would still be devoted to women and womens scholarship but that mission has been largely abandoned fearing a similar outcome ms seblatniggs organization launched not just a legal assault but a public relations campaign with "save newcomb college" yard signs appearing all over the city the group has also found support among people concerned that "donors intent" is increasingly ignored by institutions across the country for years this has been more of a conservative issue than a liberal one it was the big liberal foundations like ford and macarthur whose missions were turned away from the intent of the original donors it has been conservative philanthropists whose money was taken by universities and diverted for other purposes but all of this misspending might make people on both sides of the political spectrum think twice about giving away money true determining a donors intent is not always easy when the children of donors are alive they can generally be reliable stewards of their parents money but after that who knows when several decades have passed circumstances may make it difficult to imagine what a donor would have wanted in those cases the courts will have to make a determination which brings us back to josephine newcomb would she roll over in her grave if she knew how her money is now being spent she tried to establish a college for women and the institute is not that but newcomb college itself had not been that for some time ms howard and her sister could perhaps should have filed their lawsuit when the schools classes went co ed or the campuses were merged or the separate dormitories eliminated or the faculties joined for those were more significant shifts in the schools mission than the one tulane is attempting now mrs newcomb could hardly have anticipated that within a few decades of her death women would have the same educational opportunities as men nor that it would one day be illegal to bar black students but let us imagine for a moment that mrs newcomb is with us again she goes back to campus picks up a copy of the universitys student newspaper the hullaballoo and finds an article that mentions intensive newcomb cited to me by several students and alumnae as essential to the colleges identity this program is being continued by the institute at least for now according to the hullaballoo intensive newcomb hosted a screening of "white lightning" last month the film is described as "full of natural bodies and authentic female orgasms " it was produced by vca productions a subsidiary of hustler video so is this presentation aiding women with "literary excellence" or is this "the practical side of life" either way mrs newcomb probably isnt resting in peace ms riley is deputy editor of the journals taste page
