business technology cutting files down to size new approaches tackle surplus of data two years ago oil company chevron corp noticed an alarming trend employees were creating digital files such as emails so quickly that the amount of such data was growing at a year the explosion of these office documents not including the technical data that chevron gets from its refineries produced several ill effects besides the cost of buying new storage systems chevrons employees were spending between to three days a month just searching for the correct information they needed to do their jobs taking a toll on productivity the company found "we havent adequately managed all our information " says lynn chou chevrons general manager of global technology and strategy adding that the person company processes one million emails a day "theres been a digital tidal wave " to date the san ramon calif company estimates it has amassed terabytes of corporate office data such as emails word processing documents spreadsheets photos and video files each terabyte is equivalent to the data of one million books so it has launched a massive effort to reduce the flood using a combination of technology tools and changes in employee work habits chevron isnt alone according to a recent study by research firm idc that was sponsored by storage company emc corp information that is being created captured and replicated in a digital form is growing at a year rather than simply expanding their digital repositories companies are experimenting with ways to cut down on the amount of data they store they also are adopting new approaches to make the mounds of information more searchable and accessible for their employees "were an information business so data management is core " says tom sanzone the chief information officer for credit suisse group one response is to adopt stricter policies for what emails and data files are stored and for how long says kenneth chin an analyst at research firm gartner inc these policies can vary by industry and company since some companies are subject to special legal requirements about what information is gathered and how it must be retained in some cases files that arent needed often can be shifted to less expensive storage systems such as those that use tape rather than disk drives or deleted altogether credit suisse for example began categorizing its data into different "tiers" of importance in with critical information such as stock trading information classified as tier one data while personal spreadsheets might be classified as less important tier three data tier one data can be accessed at all times and also more quickly than tier three data "in recognition of the fact that not all data is created equal " says a credit suisse spokeswoman software also can be part of the solution many workers now send documents to multiple colleagues such as presentations made with microsoft corp s powerpoint program for example and each saves a copy of the same document on their personal computers in effect duplicating each other but another microsoft product called sharepoint allows workers to more easily work on the same document at the same time requiring just one copy to be stored chevrons data overhaul plan came together last october after the company melded two other projects to improve its technology infrastructure the company will roll out roughly new personal computers equipped with new software that includes sharepoint it also plans to replace many of its server systems and associated storage devices at four chevron tech hubs in san ramon houston singapore and london the effort will cost roughly of the companys overall information technology budget between and chevron wouldnt provide dollar figures but says its annual it spending is in the hundreds of millions of dollars by prioritizing what documents are saved the company expects to slow the growth in data stored and retire some older storage systems ms chou said using microsoft search tools employees will also be able to search across files and emails for the information they need more easily she says but the project could face some resistance under the new system employees will be asked to alter their work habits in terms of how they store and interact with documents chevrons system will require new office documents to be tagged according to their type and importance such as noting whether the document is confidential classified or just informational as a result the company expects to delete some documents of lesser importance as soon as days after creation employees will also be encouraged to work using sharepoint rather than simply the microsoft office applications that theyre used to making such a wholesale change to the storing and management of data is unusual say analysts since most companies typically take a more piecemeal approach norm judah microsofts chief technology officer of world wide services who is working with chevron to craft and rollout the changes calls the oil company "the canary in the coal mine on this " the effort to begin next february will require a team of staffers and nearly two years much of the emphasis will be on training users before deploying the new system employees will fill out questionnaires that will help categorize whether they are "basic " "general" or "power" users of chevrons computer systems then each employee will receive a shorter or longer number of hours in training on the new system based on their profile "half the battle will be changing peoples behavior " says ms chou "that makes this project bigger and more complex because of the human side "
