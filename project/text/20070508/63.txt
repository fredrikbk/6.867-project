green market pricey paintings new to the auction block as the big spring art sales kick off tonight a host of paintings that have never been offered at auction before go on the block many from prominent sellers the chance to strike it rich or rather richer in this booming market has coaxed people who dont part with art publicly to sell from director oliver stone to david geffen to david rockefeller to heirs of uber dealer leo castelli how will they fare expect some fireworks the art market like an ancient potentate values virgins of good family this seasons two week slate of impressionist modern and contemporary art at sothebys christies and phillips de pury could top &# billion in sales hard on the heels of another record &# billion last fall sothebys alone claims it is selling five postwar period "masterpieces" in a single night next tuesday most of them expected to bring more than &# million and some far more in contrast at auctions years ago this month the top selling artwork fetched &# million but as the sales begin the talk is less of perfect art than of perfect market timing "theres a lot of head smacking and regrets" among sellers who sold too soon underestimating the longevity of the markets climb says chelsea contemporary art dealer robert goff a shock for many was the sale in london earlier this year of a painting by british artist peter doig whose works were changing hands at about &# each as recently at in november the museum of modern art put one on display this february a doig sold for &# million "people who sold doigs at &# arent selling art now " says mr goff one reason theres very little st century art in these sales a giddy market poised for a fall inevitably but perhaps not yet in the still sizzling postwar art sector sales of impressionist and modern art which run tonight through friday are likely to be stodgier after all a pollock doesnt come along every day and theres a dense dynamic one formerly owned by peggy guggenheim for sale at a suggested &# million to &# million expected bidders at the sales are the usual suspects casino magnate steve wynn los angeles billionaire turned almost newspaperman eli broad software developer peter norton hong kong real estate developer joseph lau along with hedge fund king steve cohen probably the single most active trophy hunter in the art market today last but not least a handful of russian and ukrainian oligarchs their fortunes made in oil banking metals and vodka have become just in this century among the most active buyers at auctions world wide expect "a bevy of russians" to bid says david norman sothebys world wide chairman of impressionist and modern art and with record high prices coaxing pretty good art off the walls its both a "buyers and sellers market " he adds which group is smarter art history will decide here a look at some of the highlights of the sales andy warhols "green car crash" christies is giving this rare color painting from warhols "death and disaster" series the hard sell and it may be one at &# million to &# million its suggested price is nearly twice his existing record it isnt one of the artists iconic celebrity images theres a fine lemony "marilyn" for &# million though and it wasnt included in the landmark museum of modern art warhol retrospective plus the subject is grisly it reproduces over and over a newsweek photograph of a man thrown from his burning car as he hangs impaled on a telephone pole still alive while a bystander strolls by art experts dub the suburban scene warhols acidic homage to th century landscape painting since it uses similar points of composition and layout but heres the bottom line is this painting worth twice as much as the &# million "orange marilyn" portrait that s i newhouse and mr wynn fought a bidding war over in or is it just that warhol collectors have twice as much money today pablo picassos "young harlequin" after a quarter century boom in the art market most of the good impressionist and modern artists are taken so sothebys is trumpeting this gorgeous delicate but small rose period portrait of a young boy as if it were in the same league as his seminal "les demoiselles davignon" helping its case with buyers a bigger than usual "picasso" signature in the corner its being offered at about &# million as its stars rival christies has a great work by the other great spanish cubist pioneer juan gris in the same price range and a pointillist paul signac at about half as much if it soars expect a lot of signacs to be taken off living room walls and shipped off to auction when christies set a record for another french painter of the same period gustav caillebotte in several works by him surfaced at auction shortly afterward cecily browns "pyjama game" this is the year that some of the rising young stars of the s turn at least as far as being famous is concerned ms brown burst on the art scene with great provenance daughter of the late british art critic david sylvester she was first shown by star maker jeffrey deitch who sold this painting out of his grand street gallery for a few thousand dollars larry gagosian then showed her work and by he was limiting collectors like mike ovitz to one brown apiece her frenzied voluptuous strokes of paint at first look abstract but then coalesce into vivid sex scenes a madcap comedy of an artwork "pyjama game" is what it would look like "if doris day had had orgies " says christies contemporary art expert amy cappellazzo its estimated at &# to &# neo rauchs "kamin fireplace " never heard of him you will a retrospective of this german superstar opens at the metropolitan museum of art on may head of the "leipzig school " mr rauch has an of the moment popularity that comes from his works heady mix of surrealism and pop art plus a perfect storm of other factors theres a booming gallery scene in berlin a new vogue for painting and he enjoys the patronage of buyers like charles saatchi and the miami beach collecting family the rubells eyebrows rose when phillips de pury which is offering this one may set a record for rauch of &# in last spring in london another rauch soared to &# says mr goff "when rauschenbergs are selling for less than rauches you know the market is out of whack " mark rothkos "white center yellow pink and lavender on rose " rothko once said that an artist sometimes had to "be a thief and steal a place for yourself on the rich mans wall " he would have liked the fuss over "white center " david rockefellers contribution hes donating the proceeds to charity to the spring sales its price estimate is a staggering &# million even though rothko didnt crack &# million at auction until when goldman sachs partner turned art dealer bob mnuchin bought one but some fans think this hypnotic pretty wall eater painted just at the halfway mark of the th century may be one of the artists best veteran art dealer andre emmerich who knew rothko and would visit him in his east th street carriage house studio calls the painting "an ideal rothko " done before depression prompted the abstract expressionist artist to move to darker hues mr rockefeller isnt risking much in putting the work on the block hes negotiated a secret guaranteed minimum price from sothebys even if no one raises a paddle tonight look for this artwork to become one of the most expensive in the world ms peers writes on art and culture for the journal
