act one growing apart from old buddies online edition when we were students if a friend got bad grades or couldnt master super mario bros it wasnt a deal breaker but when youre done with college and the game is real life it can be hard to keep playing with those friends who arent moving in the same direction "i love him dearly but he still lives with college kids " says ryan day years old of an old friend "when he invites me over i know there are going to be year olds there and im gonna feel uncomfortable " mr day of seattle is in high gear working full time at a public relations company and getting an m b a at night he gets invited to parties that involve risque themes and "beer bongs" on weeknights he usually declines mr day says he has tried to encourage his friend to get a better paying job with no luck "its awkward because you dont want to give him advice and act like you know what youre talking about cause you dont " he says "youre doing your best just trying to figure out what your own story is " before we have families of our own our friends comprise a sort of tribe they influence our beliefs career ambitions and networks they set us up on dates exercise with us travel with us and take us to their parents houses on holidays when we cant make it home but after we graduate we may find ourselves on vastly different trajectories from those of old friends differences in class and education now rear their heads that friend who never finished school may be struggling with a dead end job the one with the family country club membership you used to benefit from on sunday afternoons may now work for a magnate father to an extent that proverbial "side of the tracks" we came from beckons until we establish our own status brandon harris always knew his old friend came from the leisure class but it didnt bother mr harris a self described "middle class striver " until recently a year out of college the two men have starkly different lives mr harris works at a film magazine and also writes and directs his own movies his friend is less focused career wise "he is more interested in becoming a very talented knowledgeable musician than a successful musician and having a ubiquitous knowledge of literature rather than being a professor or a book publisher two things i think he would be very good at " mr harris says of his friend they have tapered off their interaction "i am constantly discussing my career and what im doing constantly meeting different people about projects and discussing rumors about new projects there isnt an analogous situation for him to talk about really i can only ask how was your day " he says jonathan kaplan admits that he has chosen isolation over friendship since he graduated from college the valley stream n y resident is involved with his hobby improv comedy and his high school teaching job he says he pays as much money as he can every month to student loans and lives with his parents because it helps him be frugal one friend was a kindred spirit but he smoked pot got arrested and "acted a little crazy when he drank " despite their shared love of music nature and documentary films mr kaplan couldnt put up with his friends lifestyle "at that time i needed to be doing something else and i couldnt even give up a friday night to hang out " he says "everyones traveling through life and we all have individual paths " hunkering down may seem in the mind of the focused individual like a positive course of action it seems natural after all to leave nearly two decades of school resolved to hunt and gather and build a sturdy life but others are using this time to explore and experience again friendships can diverge "he doesnt seem to want to do anything " says jaime marconette of a friend who no longer socializes with him and has been living at his parents house for the past three years "he actually seems genuinely afraid of life come on living at his parents directly after graduating with no thoughts of moving " mr marconette says that his friend is saving up money for a life with his current girlfriend and future wife mr marconette has known his friend since grade school "hes a really cool guy " he says "hes been saving up money but in doing so has sacrificed so much ive gone off and done things and taken trips to other countries " if we love our friends we probably aspire for them but visions of progress diverge after we graduate from simple rating systems like grades and tae kwon do belt colors life isnt like playing super mario brothers or is it write to emily meehan at actone wsj com
