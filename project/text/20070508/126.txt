the realignment of america in when i was in kindergarten in detroit the city had a population of rounded off today the latest census estimate for detroit is less than half as many in the population of the u s was million today the latest census estimate for the nation is million more than twice as many people in america move around but not just randomly it has become a commonplace to say that population has been flowing from the snow belt to the sun belt from an industrially ailing east and midwest to an economically vibrant west and south but the actual picture of recent growth as measured by the census and the census estimates for is more complicated recently i looked at the census estimates for metropolitan areas with more than one million people in where of americans live i cheated a bit on definitions adding durham to raleigh and combining san francisco and san jose what i found is that you can separate them into four different categories with different degrees and different sources of population growth or decline and i found some interesting surprises start with the coastal megalopolises new york los angeles san francisco san diego chicago on the coast of lake michigan miami washington and boston here is a pattern you dont find in other big cities americans moving out and immigrants moving in in very large numbers with low overall population growth los angeles defined by the census bureau as los angeles and orange counties had a domestic outflow of of population in six years balanced by an immigrant inflow of the numbers are the same for these eight metro areas as a whole there are some variations new york had a domestic outflow of and an immigrant inflow of san francisco a whopping domestic outflow of the bursting of the tech bubble hurt and an immigrant inflow of miami and washington had domestic outflows of only overshadowed by immigrant inflows of and respectively this is something few would have predicted years ago americans are now moving out of not into coastal california and south florida and in very large numbers theyre moving out of our largest metro areas theyre fleeing hip boston and san francisco and after eight decades of moving to washington theyre moving out the domestic outflow from these metro areas is million people a year high housing costs high taxes a distaste in some cases for the burgeoning immigrant populations these are driving many americans elsewhere the result is that these coastal megalopolises are increasingly a two tiered society with large affluent populations happily contemplating at least until recently their rapidly rising housing values and a large mostly immigrant working class working at low wages and struggling to move up the economic ladder the economic divide in new york and los angeles is starting to look like the economic divide in mexico city and sao paulo democratic politicians like to decry what they describe as a widening economic gap in the nation but the part of the nation where it is widening most visibly is their home turf the place where they win their biggest margins these metro areas voted for john kerry and where in exquisitely decorated park avenue apartments and beverly hills mansions with immigrant servants passing the hors doeuvres they raise most of their money the bad news for them is that the coastal megalopolises grew only in while the nation grew coastal megalopolitan states new york new jersey massachusetts illinois are projected to lose five house seats in the census while california which has gained seats in every census since it was admitted to the union in is projected to pick up none you see an entirely different picture in the metro areas i call the interior boomtowns none touches the atlantic or pacific coasts their population has grown in six years theyve had considerable immigrant inflow but with the exceptions of dallas and houston this immigrant inflow has been dwarfed by a much larger domestic inflow three million to million overall domestic inflow has been a whopping in las vegas in the inland empire californias riverside and san bernardino counties where much of the outflow from los angeles has gone in orlando and charlotte in phoenix in tampa in jacksonville domestic inflow was over in the inland empire phoenix atlanta las vegas and orlando these are economic dynamos that are driving much of americas growth theres much less economic polarization here than in the coastal megalopolises and a higher percentage of traditional families natural increase the excess of births over deaths in the interior boomtowns is well above the in the coastal megalopolises the nations center of gravity is shifting dallas is now larger than san francisco houston is now larger than detroit atlanta is now larger than boston charlotte is now larger than milwaukee state capitals that were just medium sized cities dominated by government employees in the s sacramento austin raleigh nashville richmond are now booming centers of high tech and other growing private sector businesses san antonio has more domestic than immigrant inflow even though the border is only three hours drive away the interior boomtowns generated of the nations population growth in this is another political world from the coastal megalopolises the interior boomtowns voted for george w bush in texas arizona florida georgia and nevada states dominated by interior boomtowns are projected to pick up house seats in the census what about the old rust belt which suffered so in the s the six metro areas here detroit pittsburgh cleveland milwaukee buffalo rochester have lost population since their domestic outflow of has been only partially offset by an immigrant inflow of if the outflow seems smaller than in the s its because so many young people have already left natural increase is only lower than in orlando or jacksonville in supposedly elderly florida their economies are ailing more of a drag on than an engine for the nation theyre not the source of dynamism they were or years ago they continue to vote democratic but their for john kerry was much lower than the coastal megalopoliss their states are projected to lose six house seats in the census the fourth category is what i call the static cities these are metropolitan areas with immigrant inflow between zero and with domestic inflow up to and domestic outflow no higher than they seem to be holding their own economically but are not surging ahead and some are in danger of falling back philadelphia makes the list and so do baltimore hartford and providence in the east surprisingly some western cities that boomed in the s are in this category too seattle the tech bust again denver portland in the midwest minneapolis st louis cincinnati kansas city columbus and indianapolis are doing better than their rust belt neighbors and make the list in the south norfolk memphis louisville oklahoma city and birmingham are lagging enough behind the interior boomtowns to do so overall the static cities had a domestic inflow of just people and an immigrant inflow of politically theyre a mixed bag a bit more democratic than the nation as a whole for kerry for bush i have left two atypical metro areas out because they stand alone one is new orleans with a domestic outflow it was already losing population and attracting almost no immigrants before katrina the other is salt lake city which demographically looks a lot like the america of the s in its population grew a robust but it had a domestic outflow of young mormons going off on their missions balanced by an immigrant inflow of the chief driver of population growth there is kids salt lake citys natural increase was the largest of any of our metro areas hugely greater than san franciscos or pittsburghs minus politically new orleans was split down the middle in with bush leading to while salt lake city the least republican part of utah was still for bush what of the rest of the nation you can find a few smaller metro areas that look like the coastal megalopolises santa barbara university towns like iowa city many that resemble the interior boomtowns fort myers tucson and the rust belt canton muncie you can find rural counties that are losing population as are most counties in north dakota and even amid them towns that have solid growth fargo bismarck but overall the nation beyond these metro areas looks like the static cities domestic inflow immigrant inflow population growth but politically it is more republican taking in as it does large swathes of the south great plains and rocky mountains and in line with the historical record of non metropolitan areas being less democratic than metro areas for bush for kerry twenty years ago political analysts grasped the implications of the vast movement from rust belt to sun belt a tilting of the table on balance toward republicans but with california leaning heavily to democrats that paradigm seems obsolete whats now in store is a shifting of political weight from a small rust belt which leans democratic and from the much larger coastal megalopolises where both secular top earners and immigrant low earners vote heavily democratic toward the interior megalopolises where most voters are private sector religious republicans but where significant immigrant populations lean to the democrats house seats and electoral votes will shift from new york new jersey and illinois to texas florida georgia arizona and nevada within california house seats will shift from the democratic coast to the republican inland empire and central valley demography is destiny when i was in kindergarten in detroit was the nations fifth largest metro area with people now it ranks th and is soon to be overtaken by phoenix which had people in in the close election in which electoral votes were based on the census michigan cast votes for john kennedy and arizona cast four votes for richard nixon new york cast votes for kennedy and florida cast votes for nixon in michigan will likely have electoral votes and arizona new york will have votes and florida thats the kind of political change demographics makes over the years mr barone is a senior writer at u s news &amp world report and author of "our first revolution the remarkable british upheaval that inspired americas founding fathers
