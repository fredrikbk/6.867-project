new europe paris for over a quarter of a century two men dominated frances political life francois mitterrand who lost two elections before becoming president in and jacques chirac who replaced him in after serving twice as prime minister now the french have a new president nicolas sarkozy the plain spoken son of a hungarian immigrant who convincingly defeated an unmarried woman with four children segolene royal on sunday no wonder voters came out en masse as if the two lead candidates had liberated them from boredom but with the choice made voters remain apprehensive of their new president no less than of their own condition at home and in the world yet the atmosphere of renewal that accompanied mr sarkozys triumph and reinforced by ms royals honorable showing will soon be tested the millions who voted for "anyone except sarkozy" will not be easily seduced first there is the matter of france herself as was the case with mr chiracs first and last prime ministers alain juppe in the fall of and dominique de villepin last year mr sarkozys commitment to reform will face considerable opposition indeed unrest in the streets of paris this fall is all but certain paradoxically france is a centrist republic that hungers for extreme solutions to its societal problems of identity prosperity and security enter what might be called the thatcher factor mr sarkozy is expected to act forcefully for that he will need a mandate so success in next months legislative elections will be vital to his presidency with the left in disarray and the center hurt by francois bayrous muted endorsement of ms royal such a majority is within reach second with regard to europe his will to act suits german chancellor angela merkel with whom mr sarkozy will work closely to address an urgent institutional agenda that has been stalled since the death of the eu constitutional treaty two years ago mr sarkozy hopes for a "mini treaty" that can relaunch the eu without any "constitutional" claim or a need for another referendum next months eu summit offers an opportunity to test the new franco german duo before the arrival of gordon brown britains premier in waiting a shrewd politician mr sarkozy is fully aware that the french have become increasingly euro skeptical prosperity is the key here recent opinion polls show that only of frenchmen think they "live better" thanks to the eu while disagree much of that skepticism has to do with enlargement and mr sarkozys opposition to turkeys membership is especially firm on the whole however frances eu partners will find mr sarkozy easier to work with than most of his predecessors as he will not make every issue a theological test of vision finally there is frances troubled relationship with the u s or "our american friends " as mr sarkozy said in his victory speech the passion that mr sarkozy feels for both america and americans is real it clearly surpasses his compatriots ambivalence about either that could also have been said of mr chirac in if not of mitterrand in thus mr sarkozys passion for what america is should not be mistaken for a blanket endorsement of what america does he has praised mr chiracs opposition to the iraq war still over such issues as the spread of nuclear weapons and the clash with iran france and the u s are often closer to each other than they are respectively to germany and britain mr sarkozy may also be more of a team player in the trans atlantic alliance including on issues such as nato enlargement and relations with iran russia and china the french presidential election is one in a series of elections over the past few years that add up to a complete political turnover in four key eu countries there was also such a changing of the guard in when elections produced a revolution of sorts in each country from left to right in britain margaret thatcher in and germany helmut kohl in and from right to left in france mitterrand in and spain felipe gonzalez in these changes eased a renewal of the atlantic alliance inspired by ms thatcher and ronald reagan himself elected in and of the european community with mitterrand and mr kohl at the helm these forceful leaders were all individuals of conviction who did not embrace everyone elses ideas but who respected each other together they won the cold war with a cohesive alliance and a dynamic european union today france appears ready to "reunderstand" its inability to go it alone at home within europe and in the world the new french president comes into office eager to make france right so to speak and to settle the societal problems that obstruct the making of a renewed france in a new europe among the just elected or coming new leaders in europe mr sarkozy appears especially well prepared to attend to this agenda of transition and urgency transition for the country he will now be leading and for the union and the alliance his predecessors helped fashion during the cold war and urgency because after a year presidential pas de deux there is much to do on all these accounts mr serfaty a fellow at the center for strategic and international studies is author of "vital partnership power and order" rowman &amp littlefield
