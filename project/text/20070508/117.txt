study links destruction of coral to global warming a six year study suggests that the warming of oceans induced by global warming is spurring a mysterious disease that has killed large sections of coral in australias great barrier reef and elsewhere the research adds to evidence linking climate change with decimation of tropical coral reefs these reefs have been hurt by various factors including pollutants and fishing techniques but warmer sea temperatures have emerged as a major culprit for example higher ocean temperatures are believed to contribute to coral "bleaching " a form of environmental stress that can weaken and kill the marine creatures in the latest study researchers confirmed another such link "warmer water exacerbates coral disease and makes an outbreak spread faster " said john bruno assistant professor of marine ecology and conservation at the university of north carolina chapel hill n c and lead author of the paper the study appears in public library of science biology an online publication australias reefs are being affected by a rapidly spreading disease called white syndrome which causes coral tissue to decay and potentially die it is unclear whether the problem is caused by a virus bacteria or other microbe in the s a similar coral disease wiped out a chunk of caribbean reefs the death of corals tiny creatures whose slow growing colonies support large underwater ecosystems has become a big worry in the past four decades or so about half of the worlds reef building coral have died according to prof bruno the rate of coral reef loss which accelerated in the mid s has been about a year since then in many countries the reefs are a significant source of revenue for both local tourist business and commercial and recreational fishing prof bruno and his colleagues evaluated data on sea temperatures and the health of australian reefs between and they found that outbreaks of white syndrome were more likely to occur when the water temperature was abnormally high they suspect the warmer water may help the disease causing pathogen to thrive it also may weaken the corals immune system the scientists also discovered that white syndrome was more devastating when the coral colonies were healthy and in close proximity under such circumstances the microbe might find it easier to infect additional colonies just as infectious diseases on land are transmitted more widely in densely populated areas coral reefs have recovered from tough periods before and may do so again in the late s the reefs in palau an island nation in the pacific were devastated by warm sea temperatures triggered by el nino in the decade since they have largely recovered "the good news is that the coral population can recover when major disturbances occur " said prof bruno "the bad news is that these major disturbances seem to be occurring more frequently and more intensely "
