paging dr mom the role mothers play in health care ive seen a number of doctors for various medical complaints over the years but the medical expert who knew me best was my mother my mother never went to medical school but like most moms she managed the health care in our home making the doctor appointments getting prescriptions filled and making sure we took our pills my mom had four kids and a husband to keep track of but she was uniquely tuned in to all of us one morning when my brother was he was headed out the door for a drivers ed class my mom stopped him because she thought he looked pale my brother insisted that he felt fine but my mom held her ground and my brother stayed home a few hours later he had been diagnosed with acute appendicitis and was headed for emergency surgery "a mother knows her kids " she often told me mothers are the unsung heroes of the health care system in a survey of families the kaiser family foundation reported in that of mothers assume the major role in choosing the family doctor and taking children to appointments doctors say that wives often make their husbands appointments as well and accompany them on the visit the reasons mothers shoulder so much of the health care burden are complex women tend to manage the household child care and mealtime so it makes sense they would also manage family health and women are bigger users of health care than men and are far more likely to have a personal physician themselves clearly fathers make important contributions to their families but in most families women shoulder the larger share of parenting duties whether a mother has an instinctive advantage when it comes to the health of her kids is a matter of debate one study suggests that motherhood may permanently alter the brains memory and learning centers according to a november report in nature in rat studies rat mothers did a better job finding food and navigating mazes than rats who hadnt given birth the theory is that the hormones of pregnancy as well as the powerful sensory events of motherhood such as childbirth and breast feeding may permanently alter the brain equipping mothers with enhanced cognitive abilities that help them care for their young the brain benefits also showed up in "foster" rat moms who cared for litters but hadnt given birth suggesting that adoptive moms and possibly fathers who are primary caregivers also experience changes that help them raise children "perhaps human mothers uncanny abilities to juggle and to problem solve are not a coincidence " notes alan greene a danville calif pediatrician and founder of www drgreene com harvard physician jerome groopman says one of his earliest experiences with mothers instinct involved his own wife the couple was traveling with their month old son who was fussy and feverish a local pediatrician reassured them it was just a virus and offered tylenol his wife wasnt convinced in part because the diaper smelled slightly different than usual she kept a close eye on her son and a few hours later went back to the emergency room he was suffering from an intestinal obstruction and emergency surgery saved the childs life in researching his book "how doctors think " dr groopman says he came across other tales of mothers instinct one story involved a mother who spent months trying to convince her doctor that her year old wasnt suffering from tension headaches she finally demanded a brain scan and a tumor was diagnosed to be sure there are countless stories where mothers were wrong "but the really good pediatricians ive met they take the mothers very seriously " says dr groopman its notable that after my own mother was diagnosed with a deadly cancer she was still worrying about our health in her final days she made my dad promise to schedule a routine checkup and reminded me to have my eyesight checked email healthjournal wsj com
