wolfowitzs fate grows dimmer bank panel finds chief ran afoul of ethics rules senior adviser will leave washington wrapping up a month long inquiry a special world bank panel found that paul wolfowitz ran afoul of ethics rules when he used his position as president to secure a generous compensation package for his girlfriend increasing chances that the banks board might reprimand mr wolfowitz or even call for his ouster the determination to be put before the banks full board as early as today is part of a larger confidential report on the pay and promotion package that mr wolfowitz helped arrange for shaha riza a longtime bank employee shortly after he assumed the title of president in june u s officials said they believe the report could also cast some blame on the boards ethics committee and other bank managers over how they handled the riza matter how the report balances that blame they said could go a long way toward determining mr wolfowitzs fate the report came as a senior adviser to mr wolfowitz kevin kellems announced he will step down in a move that underscored mr wolfowitzs increasingly tenuous hold on the top job of the global poverty fighting institution mr kellems suggested that the controversy which has grown into a broader debate about mr wolfowitzs leadership has become a major distraction and compromised his ability to do his job "given the current environment surrounding the leadership of the world bank group it is very difficult to be effective in helping to advance the mission of the institution " mr kellems said after he notified senior management of his resignation "therefore i have decided to leave for other opportunities " mr kellems joined the bank in june when mr wolfowitz a former deputy u s secretary of defense took over as president a onetime adviser to vice president dick cheney mr kellems was among a cluster of aides with ties to the bush political establishment who were brought into the bank by mr wolfowitz from his earliest days in office mr wolfowitz rankled the banks professional staff often shunning its advice in favor of that offered by his confidants mr kellems became symbolic of the cultural divide between mr wolfowitz and the broader institution he was trying to lead mr kellems said he has "tremendous respect and admiration for the bank staff and management " and will "treasure the many friendships" he is leaving behind his resignation is effective next week the tenor of his parting words belied the broader tensions roiling the bank as mr wolfowitz fights to keep his job which was put in jeopardy this spring with public disclosures that mr wolfowitz had intervened on behalf of ms riza the revelations prompted the board to launch an inquiry into mr wolfowitzs actions and provoked a cascade of calls from the banks staff association from several current and former bank executives and the european parliament for him to step down and avoid any further erosion of the banks global credibility the special world bank panel investigating mr wolfowitz is made up of seven board members and is led by herman wijffels the boards representative from the netherlands several bank officials said the panel delivered a strongly worded report to mr wolfowitz yesterday the intention was to give mr wolfowitz a chance to comment on its findings before the full board meets as early as today to debate what action to take on the case mr wolfowitzs attorney robert bennett didnt return calls for comment at issue is mr wolfowitzs personal relationship with ms riza to avoid any conflict of interest mr wolfowitz initially proposed to recuse himself from personnel matters regarding her the boards ethics committee rejected that proposal in favor of an arrangement under which ms riza was detailed to work at the state department as part of the bureaucratic give and take over the transfer mr wolfowitz dictated the terms of her compensation including pay increases and promotions mr wolfowitz has said he acted in good faith after the boards ethics committee had asked him to deal with ms rizas job situation critics say mr wolfowitz should have left the final details of the transfer to others late yesterday the special panel continued to wrestle with details of the case bank officials said there were several considerations at issue including whether any effort to discipline mr wolfowitz should prompt a reopening of ms rizas employment contract and whether the hiring of other wolfowitz aides such as former bush white house analyst robin cleveland should be examined by the board even before the panels recommendations there was wide concern on the board over mr wolfowitzs conduct and its impact on the banks credibility in recent weeks as the investigation has played out the full board has debated a range of potential penalties including placing him on administrative leave president bush has voiced support for mr wolfowitz and bush administration officials said they havent begun to draw up lists for potential replacements for mr wolfowitz should he be ousted in an effort to save his job mr wolfowitz has vowed to shake up his management team and to better connect with the banks career staffers mr kellemss departure has been in the works for more than a week and represents a step in that direction in another sign of mr wolfowitzs intention to make changes another top aide ms cleveland was moved out of her office on the th floor executive suite and into a smaller room down the hall bank officials said ms cleveland has been a lightning rod for criticism of mr wolfowitz who gave her free rein to roam across issues in the bank "it sends a big message to staff " said a senior bank official who suggested that ms clevelands portfolio could be cut back if mr wolfowitz survives "shes no longer allowed to ride into every meeting in the bank "
