the daily fix quite a sports day for detroit pistons win red wings advance online edition monday was quite a day for detroit the pistons took a series lead over the chicago bulls with a convincing victory in the nbas eastern conference semifinals and the red wings beat the san jose sharks to move on to the nhls western conference finals the pistons win followed a point blowout in game and has detroit columnists looking ahead "if you want to know why the pistons beat chicago by points monday here is your answer officiating " writes michael rosenberg in the detroit free press "if it had been better the pistons would have won by a lot more the pistons won by and the bulls attempted more free throws has that ever happened at this stage of the playoffs rasheed wallace played of a possible minutes in the first three quarters because of foul trouble and it didnt even matter after wallace was whistled for an offensive foul while posting up andres nocioni he complained and barked he cant stop me no he cant they cant this is a clinic and the bulls are orange traffic cones in game the pistons had the better point guard shooting guard small forward power forward and center and unfortunately for the bulls there are no other positions " sticking with the free press drew sharp notes that "basketball perfection is unattainable but the pistons are flirting with a degree of execution thats perilously close theyre showing no blemishes right now blending the proper ingredients of offensive balance and defensive suffocation the pistons have led for all of but seconds in this second round series out of a total of minutes theyve held a double digit advantage over the bulls for almost six quarters of basketball thats not taking an opponent to school thats locking it in detention in the principals office in perpetuity " mr sharp says that near perfection is actually a compliment to a young bulls team "during the long wait for this series one team executive told me he was happier the pistons had the bulls instead of miami why wouldnt you want the heat theyre aging unathletic and ailing the exec told me that if the pistons faced the heat their focus would fade in and out making the series much closer than necessary because there were no doubts that the pistons were the better team he wanted the bulls in round because he knew full mental concentration wouldnt be an issue with the pistons " while its hard to single out one cylinder when theyre all firing the detroit newss rob parker praises the play of chris webber points for from the field seven rebounds three assists "some thought pistons president joe dumars was making a mistake bringing webber home some believed he wouldnt be able to help that his best days were behind him " mr parker writes "thats why the ers wrote webber a check for &# million to go away they couldnt have been more wrong almost from day webber came here and proved that he was not only healthy but that he wanted to win badly and was willing to do whatever he could to make it happen it showed with his unselfish play and the way he passed the ball webber the best passing big man in the league got the pistons to join in " in chicago all eyes are on ben wallace yesterday the former piston got the business from the free presss mr rosenberg who noted that mr wallace seems more comfortable with his old teammates than his new ones and posed this incendiary question "does ben wallace think his team is supposed to win of course he wants to win but does he expect it or is his admiration for the pistons too great " in the chicago sun times john jackson has some questions of his own "exactly what is it going to take for wallace the veteran leader of the bulls to get angry i mean his rants following pistons playoff losses the last few years were legendary in detroit hed be brutally honest in his assessment of his teams play and no one was immune to criticism even himself but monday night wallace was as passive in his postgame comments as he was in his minutes on the court there was absolutely no trace of anger frankly i was stunned how in the world was he not upset after all the slights hurled his way monday " and now to hockey the red wings sent the sharks home with the highlight a desperate save by defenseman nicklas lidstrom dominik hasek came out of net to play the puck but gave it away to san joses mike grier who went behind the net and was ready to complete a wrap around goal except mr lidstrom threw his stick against the left post to somehow rescue his goalie and keep momentum on the wings side on offense it was all mikael samuelsson leading the free presss mitch albom to note that "monday night he was the nordic nuke the scandinavian slayer the go to goteburger his two goals in less than five minutes continued a streak of swedish successes that have finally finally given the red wings two things they desperately wanted a return to the western conference finals for the first time in five years and a day off swedeness and light " in the san jose mercury news mark purdy serves as the sharks coroner looking for a common thread in the sharks disappointing playoff losses in and "their basic game plan the past few seasons frequently voiced by coach ron wilson has been to force other teams to take penalties then punish them by scoring on power plays " he writes "it works swell from october through early april but in the playoffs not so much the sharks invariably run into the very best penalty killing teams that scout them well detroit scout and former coach scotty bowman was at every game of the sharks nashville series and can stifle the power plays and do so what then what is plan b answer the sharks still do not have one " on the negative side for detroit the idle tigers learned flamethrowing reliever joel zumaya will miss three months with a ruptured finger tendon and the lions were undoubtedly doing something stupid you cant have everything ousting the dallas mavericks meant the golden state warriors donned the cinderella gown but last night they opened the western conference semis and ran into a wicked stepsister called the utah jazz "losing game on the road isnt too bad if you learn something and the warriors learned quite a bit monday night " bruce jenkins writes in the san francisco chronicle "they discovered they cant live by the three point shot especially when it comes at the expense of a baron davis power move to the basket they learned that as much as they can fluster and disturb carlos boozer utahs high scoring forward they have to finish the job and they found out that their biggest concern in this series isnt boozer or a title hungry home crowd but a relentless point guard named deron williams " utahs mr williams did a fine job harassing mr davis but mr jenkins is more worried about all those treys "the warriors acted like a team that lives and dies by the three point shot when things really mattered and thats a shame because its not the essence of their game " he writes "they have their moments and heaven knows they brought down the house in oakland with a flood of deep shots in the dallas series but their game is flow a quick tempo a full evening of attack " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well consider your find for inclusion in
