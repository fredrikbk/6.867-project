universal health insurance in a private market dont bet on it i agree with david hendersons analysis of "terminatorcare" editorial page jan insofar as it goes but i think he and others who write on medical reform from a market perspective miss one grand point many americans perhaps most accept the ethical view that everyone is morally entitled to and should receive the best medical care regardless of ability to pay now of course this is not possible and will not happen regardless of the "reforms " but i believe the politics are that the illusion of care according to need and not ability to pay must and will be maintained therefore what is "needed" is a complex government financed and regulated system that will ration care according to some bureaucratic principles of distribution which ultimately no one can fathom but nevertheless allow politicians and the american people to maintain their illusions mario j rizzo professor of economics new york university new york mr hendersons theory that deregulation of health insurance would "achieve some increase in the number of insured" represents more of the misguided policies that have led us to the current health care crisis where of the roughly million uninsured are only intermittently uninsured if we could just get them to plan their expensive illnesses to occur during periods of employment we will have temporarily solved roughly half the problem broad deregulation of health insurance would turn back the clock years to a time when health insurers routinely refused coverage to those with pre existing conditions and dropped people from coverage when they need it most it is true that without the coverage mandates mr henderson derides health insurance might cost less in the short term however it would also exacerbate the problem of the underinsured in pursuit of higher profits and greater shareholder value insurance companies would be compelled to begin a race to the bottom offering less expensive coverage that excluded far more than treatment for drug and alcohol addiction and chiropractic care they would also offer policies that capped or excluded coverage for more catastrophic conditions like cancer heart disease transplants aids etc this would lead to a continuation of the problems our physicians and hospitals face with growing tabs for unreimbursed health care it is high time we recognized that human life is a priceless commodity that should not be left to the law of supply and demand to determine whether it is profitable to treat the sick and dying dan cavanaugh laguna beach calif mr henderson warns of the democratic health policy "trifecta" of regulations government spending and taxes in his critique of gov schwarzeneggers proposal for broad coverage in california instead he opts for the free market "daily double" of deregulating at the state level and creating federal markets if you share his stated goal of "solving the problem of the uninsured " dont make this bet toiling for near universal insurance in a voluntary private market is a fools errand some fools will elect to take the risk and go without coverage no matter how low we set the regulatory barriers in insurance industries where universality is not deemed necessary such as life and casualty we are comfortable with that where universality is a social or economic necessity such as auto workers compensation and home insurances many are not so comfortable enter mr hendersons pesky regulators the situation is exacerbated in medical care where something even peskier than regulators our moral conscience is troubled by unequal access to health care we can live with some people taking the bus and some their bentley but we want everybody to get the immunizations and intensive care unit treatments they need unlike with life insurance most of the public mr henderson and his arguments against guaranteed issue rules notwithstanding blanches at the prospect of charging elderly people the full costs of their medical care that means helping poor and elderly people pay for that medical care hello government again significant and consistent government rule making financial subsidization and risk pooling are the only ways universal insurance will be achieved even if they cause modest discomfiture to the many who benefit from the current non system and are threatened by the prospect of change who knows this best the insurance consumers in their s and s i talk to who are praying to hang on to whatever they can cobble together until they qualify for medicare thats a safe bet christopher f koller health insurance commissioner state of rhode island providence r i
