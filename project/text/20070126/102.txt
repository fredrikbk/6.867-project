trading shots sos for fofs funds of hedge funds under fire for fees risks and low returns can managers survive a dry spell the wall street journal online if its a good idea to put your money in one hedge fund then it must be a really good idea to put it in more than one hedge fund that in a wildly generalized nutshell is the theory behind funds of funds investment vehicles in which one money manager takes your cash and uses it to buy stakes in two or more hedge funds there are also funds of mutual funds but theyre a different less controversial animal one major advantage of this investment vehicle the theory goes is diversification you get access to all the supposed genius of various hedge fund managers without having to lay awake at night fretting that one will pull an amaranth and eradicate your entire investment the very wealthy of course dont need middlemen to diversify they can simply buy their way directly into all the hedge funds they want but the poor souls who have just enough net worth &# million according to current securities and exchange commission policy or annual income &# or &# with a spouse to invest in just one hedge fund dont have that luxury funds of funds pull the higher branches of the hedge fund industry down to their level fund of funds managers also promise to carefully vet the hedge funds in which they invest potentially offering a layer of confidence to investors nervous about dealing directly with a hedge fund hedge funds pools of capital for institutions and the wealthy that supposedly protect investors against broad market downturns became hot properties when the popping of the dot com bubble threw a wet blanket on long only stock investment hedge funds controlled more than &# trillion in assets at the end of more than they had under management at the end of according to hedge fund research inc a private firm in chicago the fund of funds industrys rise has been even more parabolic its assets under management jumped from &# billion in to &# billion in a increase according to hfr pension funds seeking steady returns outside the broader market have played a big role in fueling the boom but critics warn this is good money being thrown after bad not all fund of funds managers do their homework for one thing many failed to spot the looming meltdown at amaranth for example and yet investment comes at a steep price a fund of funds manager charges clients her own set of fees typically in addition to the fees of the hedge funds in which she invests when times are good for these funds investors dont much mind losing all these various pounds of flesh but when times are not so good it starts to get more than a little grating and times have not been so good lately funds of hedge funds returned just in net of fees according to an hfr composite index compared with for the standard &amp poors stock index if you throw in dividends of course funds invest in all manner of assets not just stocks so its not fair to compare them only to the s&amp p many funds probably left bond funds in the dust last year for example and many funds of funds will tell you theyre not built to outperform in a rising stock market anyway theyre built for the long haul but the combination of high fees and low returns has made investors restless and banks such as goldman sachs and merrill lynch have recently launched vehicles that supposedly mimic hedge fund returns but charge lower fees does this spell trouble for the fund of funds industry we asked a fund of funds manager and a traditional money manager their thoughts after you read their views share your own mark gongloff george feiger writes recent blowups in the hedge fund industry suggest the role of the hedge fund of funds has increased dramatically in importance after all isnt its ability to provide diversification and increased due diligence the way to reduce risk and negate the impact of any one funds meltdown well yes and no yes that is the right strategy but no fund of funds providers arent well suited today to provide either one of these services though you might think so at first this has important implications for fund of funds investors a little history over the past year industry trends have conspired against fund of funds managers the heyday of hedge fund investments saw fund of funds managers virtually explode in popularity this was not because they offered sophisticated risk management rather it was because they provided access to hedge funds a fund of funds was of tremendous value to those who were wealthy enough to invest in a hedge fund or two initial investments are typically in the range of &# million to &# million but not able to meet the expenses of creating a well diversified pool of hedge fund investments strong returns across the board initially justified this approach it is not too difficult for a manager to justify taking out the typical of assets and of profits with the fund of funds manager earning the same when a pool is returning or even however when returns fall into the single digits the benefit of this access to hedge fund investments starts to look inferior to bank cds thats exactly where we are today returns to hedge funds are being compressed by competition institutional investors such as pension funds have discovered they are "underfunded" and need to earn extraordinary returns so a tidal wave of money is pouring into a business that had been largely the province of a modest number of wealthy families hedge fund managers and mollusks both discover that when there are more competitors for food pickings get slimmer so there are two choices for hedge fund managers cut fees or reach for yield by taking bigger risks guess which one theyre choosing this puts the fund of funds managers in a tough spot they cannot charge their high fees simply to provide access anymore given that returns are compressed and risk is increasing yet as providers of due diligence they are sadly undermanned and poorly equipped brett duval fromson writes predictions about the future of hedge funds of funds fofs are as reliable as predictions about the stock market not very you do not have to be a seer however to know that the key to the survival of fofs will be superior long term performance net of all fees and expenses charging high fees for mediocre performance will not cut it i agree that a shakeout is coming fees are generally too high and will be competed downward nonetheless the future is not universally bleak for fofs some of them will out perform net of all fees and expenses if they have superior managers they will offer partners a valuable investment service a team of all stars otherwise unavailable to investors that has been my experience overseeing two funds of funds for over four years now our managers who have mainly been closed to new investors for years have handily beaten the market they continue to do so in both absolute and relative terms posting returns per annum for the past four years and typically beating the market averages by to percentage points a year net of all fees and expenses i do not see the compression of returns george cites and i doubt we are alone in this some investment managers over the course of a career are simply better than others going forward fofs that can find such managers and have the guts to stick with them over the long haul will justify their fees and incentive allocations mr feiger writes risk management by diversification was effective during the boom years because most decent managers made reasonable returns in an uncrowded market this is now insufficient true risk control requires highly skilled personnel who understand and can monitor hedge funds investment strategies as well as the infrastructure to model risks and set boundaries for action no small order this can triple or quadruple the cost base of a fund of funds these costs come at a time when as weve discussed returns are falling and typically when net returns fall below a certain level fund of funds managers have to give up their of profits the lions share of their fees and receive only the of assets under management this is not nearly enough to generate the astronomical incomes we are hearing about these days and barely enough to sustain their now more substantial infrastructure this means many fund of funds managers will be forced to close their doors others will seek to adjust to this new reality most likely by seeking higher returns via less diversification with the increased risk this brings recall initially one of the advantages fund of funds managers provided was diversification itself mr fromson writes george also raises the important issue of risk management i think about it a lot especially as i have my entire liquid financial net worth invested in my partnerships i think of "risk" as the probability of permanent loss of capital it is the kiss of death for any investors long term performance i try to manage this risk first i only allocate capital to managers who follow a "value approach " which when properly executed offers us a margin of safety there is nothing like buying an asset cheaply to help ensure a profitable exit they hold cash when asset prices are high which is one reason they avoided the wipeouts of the collapse of the stock market bubble and had firepower to buy stocks when most people hated them second i only invest with managers ive known for years in some cases for more than it gives me a qualitative understanding of them that no consultant or software program can provide we have avoided the amaranths of the world so far and i see no reason why we and other fofs cannot do so in the future this is less a question of throwing high priced analytical talent at the problem than it is being extremely careful about whom you go into business with i would also note that most of the investors in amaranth were among the most sophisticated institutions and individuals on wall street this was the case with long term capital management too mr feiger writes taken together the environment we are seeing and the impact it has having on fund of funds managers have serious consequences for investors first it is no longer advisable to place total faith in the fund of funds manager to police individual funds investors must request more information and do more with it than they have before of course few investors possess these skills themselves so fund of funds investing now requires an adviser who is skilled in the hedge fund business overall the riskiness of this entire investment approach has increased so fund of funds investments are only worthwhile if they provide higher returns the ultimate direction for investors is clear this whole problem arose because of the declining returns hedge fund managers are able to produce amid the tidal wave of institutional money the answer is to push for fee reductions which fund of funds managers will fight refuse to invest at the typical and terms in the end this pressure will force fees downward until they are at a reasonable level given the risks and potential returns mr fromson writes a far greater threat to the future of fofs is the tendency of many to focus on asset gathering instead of performance managers sprinkle money to say young hedge funds see who puts big points up on the board within two years and promote the heck out of these short term winners in whom the fof managers likely have a piece of the action via the general partnership unfortunately many of the most successful long term records have been compiled by managers who got off to slow starts and many rookies of the year flame out the late bill ruane of ruane cunnif and the sequoia funds was an example of a slow starter who went on to great success managers should not be treated like playing cards luckily the markets have a way of sorting things out poor performing high fee fofs will fall by the wayside hucksters will be weeded out but fofs that provide access to superior managers will always be in demand what do you think will happen to funds of funds join the
