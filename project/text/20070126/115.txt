weekend journal review tv mission possible in june of soviet forces blockaded berlins western sector effectively cutting off all incoming supplies of food and coal the step had been devised as encouragement to the western occupying powers to get out of berlin in response to this act threatening starvation for two and a half million residents of the city the americans conceived of a plan to get food and supplies to west berliners which they carried through in concert with the british against overwhelming odds "the berlin airlift " an american experience documentary monday p m est on pbs check local listings revisits this undertaking in a film of astonishing power this is after all a well known story at least in general outline hollywoods own fictionalized version "the big lift" starring montgomery clift still shows up on turner classic movies what filmmakers peter adler alexander berkel and stefan mausbach offer in this documentary exceeds anything fiction can offer here is the footage of the event as it unfolded the pilots the planes the picture of the determined harry truman who ordered the airlift and declared "we stay in berlin period " the americans were to find a way in league with the british to transport enough food and fuel to sustain the west berlin population the british who knew plenty about food rationing did the calculations nor is there much in fiction likely to equal the memories of those who took part in this history whether those of the airmen who dropped food from the skies or those who waited below to catch it the recollections of the latter imprinted in childhood and preserved throughout their lives suggests that treasured nourishment other than food came down in those packages mercedes wild a german woman cites the letter she sent as a child to air force pilot gail halvorsen whose name had become widely known when he began dropping candy to the waiting children at tempelhof airport the letter which began "dear chocolate uncle " brought a quantity of chocolate but also something much more important "he had written back i had written to him so i was waiting for an answer and i still have that letter it was wonderful " uncle she might call him but as she explains she thought of the pilot as a father come to protect her as the number of cargo planes increased along with the number of plane accidents it became clear that the chaotic flight scheduling required major improvement the job went to gen william turner who reorganized the system which had previously managed to transport only tons a day far too little to feed the city under his direction pilots would soon be delivering tons daily more than enough the generals governing rule was rhythm "a beat as constant as jungle drums " gen turners resoundingly successful overhaul agitated the soviets who responded with east german propaganda films exhorting germans to remember the bombs those big allied planes used to drop the british retorted that those planes now served life and freedom the americans answer was to deliver via radio lots of jazz country and other music banned during the nazi years this film could hardly have come along at a riper time in an era in which it is possible to hear the united states reviled regularly declared the worlds leading enemy of humanity a view propounded by the fashionable left here and abroad long before george w bush became president this film offers among its other attractions a powerful reminder of what this "enemy of humanity" has meant to the world "friends of god a road trip with alexandra pelosi" thursday p m est on hbo does something relatively rare for documentaries of this kind it means to take viewers on a tour and allow them to see what there is to see without a lot of interference from the tour guide who is in this case the filmmaker daughter of nancy pelosi speaker of the house and this is happily just what this disarming film manages to do in what is to be sure a special tour visits with american evangelical christians of all sorts that would include every group from cruisers for christ a car club and the christian wrestling federation to well known evangelicals like joel osteen and not least pastor ted haggard the film begins with a warning that one of its chief participants pastor haggard had recently been forced to resign as president of the national association of evangelicals the largest such group in the country on grounds of sexually immoral conduct made before the revelations about his personal life the film made extensive and profitable use of the pastor a man aglow with assurance and given to a degree of sharing that will seem a trifle startling he asks two evangelicals to testify to the number of times a day they make love to their wives every day sometimes twice a day comes the sober answer next question how often do their wives achieve sexual climax absolutely every time ms pelosi a marvel of calm acceptance doesnt push for more she just notes affably this sounds like a good church to join and hers is a very good film to watch a work free of snideness rich in atmosphere she captures the electric quality
