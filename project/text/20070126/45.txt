feds view steady but set to boost upward bias gives leeway if economy gets too hot investors ahead of curve washington surprisingly solid economic growth hasnt only persuaded investors that the fed wont cut interest rates it also has prompted some to predict that an overheating economy will trigger rate increases before long fed officials dont appear to share that view at least not yet they believe the housing downturn has yet to show its full impact on the economy as it does they expect growth to remain slow and unemployment to rise hastening the recent downtrend in inflation which is now running roughly from to excluding food and energy indeed officials are more comfortable about inflation than they were two months ago in spite of that the fed at the end of its policy meeting wednesday is likely to reaffirm its "bias" toward raising rates rather than lowering them citing inflation concerns it is almost certain to leave its target for short term interest rates unchanged at the fed has maintained that target and its "tightening bias" since june there are several reasons the fed is likely to signal inflation concerns for at least one more meeting some officials believe that even if underlying inflation is coming down it is still unacceptably high because they are uncertain how much further it will fall they believe the fed to keep the public from expecting higher inflation should be biased toward raising rates the second and potentially more important reason is that the job market unlike the rest of the economy is stronger than expected the longer unemployment stays low the greater the likelihood that fear of accelerating wages and prices will prompt officials to contemplate an interest rate increase janet yellen president of the federal reserve bank of san francisco said in a speech this week that there is "an emerging puzzle in the data why is the labor market apparently going gangbusters while growth has turned in only a middling performance on average in recent quarters " her puzzlement is shared by some of her colleagues when the economy grows at its long term "potential" rate which is thought to be a little under it creates just enough jobs to employ new entrants to the labor market and the unemployment rate is steady but last year as growth fell below in the spring the unemployment rate declined steadily from in the first quarter to in the fourth ms yellen said one worrisome explanation may be that either the economys potential growth rate is notably slower than or that growth is stronger than the official data now show in either case the economy could face tighter capacity constraints than first thought stoking inflation pressure ms yellen said a likelier explanation is that the job market has simply lagged behind the overall economy and unemployment will soon move higher other officials agree noting in particular that construction employment seems bound to decline more in early december economists thought the economy would grow at an annual rate of in the fourth quarter according to a survey by forecasting company macroeconomic advisers llc following growth rates of in the third quarter and in the second many analysts said the fed could shift to a "neutral" bias that is saying rates were equally likely to go up or down at next weeks meeting futures markets expected three to four quarter percentage point rate cuts this year since december however trade housing starts employment and manufacturing activity all have proved stronger than expected and growth is now thought to have hit in the fourth quarter while the consensus forecast is for first quarter growth of around that too is rising morgan stanley expects housing remains a drag on the economy but trade and consumer spending fueled by job growth and lower oil prices have compensated some economists predict that presages more rate increases michael feroli economist at j p morgan chase says sub growth in mid shows "the fed nailed the soft landing " but the point of the soft landing "is to get some increase in unemployment and that didnt happen the clock is ticking to see if it happens at all " his firm expects the fed to start raising rates again in october fed officials dont appear ready to go with that forecast yet they still think the economy is slowing they believe further declines in construction are necessary just to bring supply in line with current home sales moreover flat or falling home prices are expected to make consumers feel less wealthy damping their spending later this year inflation is also ebbing excluding food energy and shelter it was just at an annual rate in the past six months shelter is heavily influenced by rents which face downward pressure as owners of unsold homes put them up for rent but just in case a continued bias toward raising rates would keep the fed and the markets prepared in case they are wrong
