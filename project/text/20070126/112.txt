weekend journal review books the rebel who never was john osborne the many lives of the angry young man by john heilpern knopf pages &# john james osborne the original angry young man lies in his purple turnbull and asser velvet smoking jacket in st georges churchyard in the shropshire hills whats he doing in a place like this the profane playwright who created the belligerent jimmy porter how did the author of the reviled rant "damn you england " come to be a christian blimp defending englands threatened values in the years of fame between "look back in anger" and the sequel "deja vu" osborne wrote a score of plays notably "the entertainer" "luther" "inadmissible evidence" "the hotel in amsterdam" and the screenplays for "tom jones" and "the charge of the light brigade " he remained an angry man with a marvelous command of the language honed from endless reading of the dictionary but otherwise his life seemed consistent only in its contradictions he was a radical who hated change a working class enemy of class privilege who despised the sweating proletariat he was a "sweet and gentle" friend but a son who mocked his mother a husband who mocked his fourth wifes suicide a father who threw out a daughter for behaving like a teenager and never spoke to her again he was anti establishment but loved england with the passion of george orwell loved it for its customs its liturgy its music and above all its language and heritage not one copy but whole shelves of the king james bible are in his library a well thumbed copy of "hamlet" is in the grave with him in the pocket of his smoking jacket in a masterly and entertaining biography john heilpern resolves with wit and rare discernment most of the apparent paradoxes of osbornes life and work he pulls back the curtain on an arrogant iconoclast so consumed with a secret staggering self loathing and guilt that the last sentence he ever wrote scribbled on a cigarette pack that his wife found by his deathbed consisted of the three words "i have sinned " the book is a terrific story and powerful corrective mr heilpern the authoritative theater critic for the new york observer tracks how osbornes ground breaking "look back in anger" was misperceived when audiences first saw it half a century ago the story of a pinched claustrophic household and an unhappy marriage the play was taken at the time as a cry against englands oppressive class system and a lament for thwarted lives the play got osborne labeled as a radical socialist embraced and rejected according to where you stood and thereafter all his work was a hostage to that image but mr heilpern argues convincingly that osborne wasnt political at all he was an unrelenting individualist faithful only to his own self and then ever ready to gouge his own ego of "damn you england " a protest not against england but against those who would pollute its sacred soil with nuclear weapons he said later that it was "a slovenly melodramatic misuse of my so called gift of rhetoric " as for "look back in anger " it was not a tract its significance was in linking a jaundiced public view of englands postwar malaise to the private angst of a marriage between social classes his own short lived first marriage at to actress pamela lane whose middle class parents were outraged that she should marry the son of a barmaid osbornes exposure of the raw emotions in class and gender warfare smashed the china in the tea party of english theater half dead from gentility if not asphixiated by the corsets of the lord chamberlains censors this was an england it is hard to believe where in the middle of the "swinging s " the lord chamberlains court office would not permit any discussion of homosexuality then still a crime or any murmur of criticism of crown or church of government leaders and pillars of society dead or alive unless as mr heilpern remarks "they were from unfriendly nations which for a time excluded hitler until he became less friendly " the working class appeared in west end plays only as "lovable" characters mostly servants through the door opened by osborne and the royal court theatre came playwrights concerned with social justice like david hare trevor griffith david edgar arnold wesker howard brenton and caryl churchill osborne created a movement all right it was one that he didnt join himself he was just not in the business of social amelioration yes he sat down in trafalgar square in with thousands of ban the bomb campaigners and spent a night in a police cell but he despised the politically correct left and the ineffectual labour party as much as the conservative party mr heilpern tells us that he hated "peoplespeak " the bribes and pious promises of labour and the thug smoothness of the tories politicians abused what he held most sacred words the attitude of osbornes anti hero jimmy porter in "look back" "there arent any good brave causes left" was a fair representation of the disillusioned s but it is often cited to suggest that osborne was not important after all mr heilpern is astringent in his defense "osborne knew all about causes but to demand that his alter ego jimmy porter swap his despair for a handy check list of whats wrong with the world is like thinking you can solve the inability of chekhovs three sisters to get to moscow by buying them a railway ticket " zealous biographers go to great lengths to ransack memories mr heilpern stepped into the dead mans boots the widow an old friend suggested that mr heilpern put them on when he went for a walk in the rain so the biographer wandered out with two affectionate labradors just as osborne was wont to do when he strode out for his daily walk in the hills the playwright would sing and shout to the music on his walkman marching bands to get up the slopes handel at the peak and elgar on the way down i still find it hard to understand let alone excuse how such a man could inflict a raft of petty cruelties on so many people in his life but mr heilpern who knew osborne personally has written an appealing rollicking portrait of osborne and his time "john osborne the many lives of the angry young man" is prodigiously researched spiced with revelation and gossip without ever losing a genial authority and often emotionally moving this is the best literary biography i have read in a long time sir harold evans is the former editor in london of the sunday times and the times
