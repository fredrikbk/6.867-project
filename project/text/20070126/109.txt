weekend journal catalog critic back to basic cardigans a good sweater is hard to find that goes for cardigans too sometimes the arms are too tight the knit might start unraveling as soon as you put it on or the fabric is fine and everything seems to be well proportioned until you try to close up the buttons hello stretchy buttonholes this called for a test we hit online retailers looking for simple womens cardigans in cashmere as an added winter challenge and ordered five to judge the fit we had two women try them on we ordered all for a size which was either an extra small or a small depending on the item tamara albu a director of fashion studies at parsons the new school for design in new york helped to evaluate their quality she had several general tips for sweater shopping first inspect the seams on the sides and sleeves "if its nicely sewn the seam wont be showing " she said another good sign is invisible seams on the underside of any ribbing at the cuffs and hem if you see any threads sticking out put the sweater down and try stretching out the ribbing if it springs back like a rubber band it should hold its shape well over time ms albu also recommended hand washing then drying on a flat surface for any basic cashmere sweater the chemicals from repeated dry cleaning can degrade the yarn over time she said she recommends dry cleaning for sweaters that are hand knit or have stitched on details since washing could ruin any delicate sewing the biggest surprise in our test the sweaters four had a crew neckline the fifth had more of a scoop neck were all pretty good however the entries from neiman marcus and lands end were the favorites in fit and quality each had slightly different styling so were naming them both best overall how we shopped shopping comparison

semisheer material won ms albus vote for fluffiest yarn the bad lightweight material was more suited to warmer weather and the expert cautioned that the horizontal ribbing down the buttonholes could be hard to align properly with the vertical knit for drying "this will stretch one way and this will stretch another " she said buttoned up the sweater fit a little tight on both testers the shopping
