weekend journal review theater the very best we have new york the only time i dont think brian friel is the best living playwright is immediately after ive seen a play by tom stoppard that both men should be represented on broadway this season is a boon and though mr stoppards "coast of utopia" trilogy being both new and spectacular will likely get most of the ink the manhattan theatre clubs revival of "translations " directed by garry hynes deserves equal time this production of mr friels play among the greatest written in the th century is so comprehensively masterful that no critic however enthusiastic can do more than suggest its manifold virtues instead of reviewing it i wish i could simply send you a ticket "translations" is set in ballybeg the imaginary irish town that is to mr friel what yoknapatawpha county was to william faulkner the time is on the eve of the dreaded potato famine that would kill a million people and force another million to emigrate ballybeg is still a peasant village whose barefoot residents live in dirt floored huts and speak gaelic though a growing number of them long to learn english and plunge themselves into the churning turmoil of modern life change in short is in the air and it is embodied in the fateful encounter of two men headed in opposite directions owen alan cox is an angry young english speaking irishman who wants nothing more than to put ballybeg behind him forever lt yolland chandler williams is a hopelessly romantic british soldier who has fallen in love with its ancient unexpectedly fragile ways "i had moved into a consciousness that wasnt striving nor agitated but at its ease and with its own conviction and assurance " mr friel is rightly compared to chekhov but "translations" also reminds me of august wilson in whose unhurried near plotless plays the inner life of a tight knit ethnic community is no less closely and lovingly observed like wilson mr friel has a pitch perfect ear for the verbal music of everyday speech and the ability to place his characters in political situations without turning them into cartoonish symbols in "translations " the coming of modernity to rural ireland and the emergence of irish nationalism are portrayed with the open eyed clarity accessible only to an artist imbued with the tragic sense of life "to remember everything is a form of madness " owens disillusioned father niall buggy warns him at plays end and you catch your breath as he utters those simple yet prophetic words knowing that they foreshadow the terrible consequences of historical memory run amok be it in ballybeg baghdad or the balkans ms hynes the founder of irelands druid theatre company bowled over new york theatergoers last summer with "druidsynge " her day long marathon presentation of the complete plays of john millington synge this revival of "translations " first seen in october at princetons mccarter theater center is very much in the style of that plain looking yet deeply poetic production even the unit set designed by francis oconnor is strikingly similar to the one he created for "druidsynge " the cast of "translations" is beyond praise they act as though theyd grown up together and i came away feeling that i had seen not a production but the play itself stripped of all exterior trappings and reduced to its purest essence i feel the same way about "translations" that i felt about last years equally impressive broadway revival of mr friels "faith healer " like all great art it has the miraculous power to reveal us to one another bridging the yawning gap that separates soul from soul a power that garry hynes and her collaborators have made manifest in this exemplary production no artist can do more arlington va "into the woods " in which cinderella rapunzel little red riding hood and jack the one who chopped down the beanstalk meet in a forest and get into big trouble together is one of stephen sondheims most frequently performed musicals not because its the best but because its the most audience friendly right down to the reasonably happy ending perhaps signature theatre a regional company whose imaginative sondheim stagings have given it a national reputation had that in mind when it picked mr sondheims fractured fairy tale to open its new two theater complex located in an upscale suburban shopping mall not far from downtown washington whatever the reason this new production is as engaging and smartly designed as the handsome building that houses it robert perdziolas set is a big part of what makes signatures "into the woods" so delightful you enter the max theatre a seat black box through the back of a fireplace and stroll into the middle of what appears to be a three dimensional edward gorey drawing with an ominous looking castle tucked into one corner and a piece orchestra perched just above it in the balcony the three quarter round seating puts you startlingly close to the actors so close that no amplification of any kind is needed which is a blessing eric schaeffers staging makes the best possible use of this intimate setting as do the members of his fine ensemble cast of whom lauren williams is especially vivid as little red riding hood the show itself alas is as mixed a bag as ever mainly because of the defects of james lapines book the first half is bulletproof the second sentimental and didactic though mr schaeffer and his cast comport themselves as though both were equally good the result is a production strong enough to trick the skeptical viewer into thinking that "into the woods" lives up to the promise of its bewitchingly well made first act it doesnt but its still a pleasure to see and hear mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts
