structure of distillers bottlers and distributors stemming from rules passed in the wake of prohibition in the s this "three tier system" was long viewed as a hurdle to efficiency but it also creates easy points of entry for unknown small brands the result anyone with a name a marketing pitch and some cash can launch a vodka and outsource everything else in fact while few of the new vodkas are expected to make it big many distillers bottlers and distributors are profiting handsomely from selling their expertise to the flood of entrepreneurs florida distillers owned by v&amp s vin &amp sprit ab of sweden recently dedicated several production lines to making new brands one of them a caffeine infused vodka called p i n k is the brainchild of david mandell a lawyer who recently quit his job

mr ottley says "we got overloaded " before he stopped taking new vodkas mr ottley agreed to make hendrix mr dieffenbach explained that he and other investors were willing to sink about &# million to get the vodka off the ground so far mr dieffenbach has committed to spend about &# million he paid distilled resources to make the vodka and french glassmaker saverglass to produce a purple glow in the dark bottle over eight months last year mr dieffenbach spent &# million on events and marketing before the vodka was even for sale one event was an oscar party in march attended by philip seymour hoffman that years best actor winner mr dieffenbach also hired roger baer who has worked in liquor sales and marketing for more than years in april at a major liquor convention mr baer spent two days pitching hendrix to distributors one who listened was steve matthas the general manager for nevada for southern wine &amp spirits of america inc the countrys biggest liquor distributor mr matthas was skeptical about what seemed to be just another celebrity product but mr baer argued that hendrix vodka was different because jimi hendrix appealed to such a broad group of consumers he emphasized how much mr dieffenbach was already spending on marketing to get key bars and restaurants interested in the vodka "you have to trust me on this one " mr baer told him "this is something that transcends generations it has legs " the southern executive agreed to distribute the vodka southern confirmed mr baers accounts for the past few months mr baer and mr dieffenbach have been pushing to get hendrix vodka into the big las vegas hotels and bars mr dieffenbach bought a six bedroom house there partly to throw parties to promote the brand last november the entrepreneur also convinced the flamingo hotel to let hendrix sponsor its outdoor lounge for several weekends during those weekends hendrix cocktails were served and a foot long purple stretch hendrix hummer was parked outside since hendrix vodka went on sale in august it has sold cases a decent amount but not enough to be considered a clear success yet so far the proliferation of new niche vodkas has had only a negligible impact on sales of the big brands such as smirnoff and stolichnaya which sell millions of cases a year small vodka producers in contrast often sell no more than a few thousand but big companies are taking note of the trend launching their own niche products and in rare instances buying smaller brands several years ago london based diageo plc launched a grape based boutique brand called ciroc pernod ricard sa the worlds second largest spirits maker has elit a &# a bottle vodka launched in many of the new vodka entrepreneurs lack the deep pockets of mr dieffenbach or a major liquor concern joe miller who runs a dive shop in the florida keys came up with the idea for a key lime vodka one day in when his boats were idled due to high winds he and his boat captain spent about &# to launch palm cay vodka that october mr miller found a couple hundred unused bottles left over from another liquor brand that had been discontinued he opted for stick on labels rather than ones stenciled onto the bottle mr miller is now making the rounds to local bars and restaurants offering to host cocktail competitions to drum up interest in palm cay vodka so far he has sold cases "we hope that one of the big boys will come by and offer to buy the brand " mr miller says in the s a marketing executive named ronne bonder dreamed up the idea of setting up his own vodka still in the hamptons on long island in new york where he often vacationed setting up a distillery proved to be too difficult so mr bonder decided to have the vodka made in the midwest in when he launched hamptons vodka mr bonder hoped to sell cases within five years instead he peaked at about cases in then his distributor in california which represented half of his sales started to push a rival vodka instead of his mr bonder devised cherry vanilla and chocolate raspberry flavors he ordered slimmer bottles that fit better into the slots where bartenders keep liquor bottles behind the bar the efforts didnt work and his sales fell to just cases in with money tight mr bonder fired his two salespeople but he hasnt given up dipping into the income he makes from other business activities mr bonder who will only say he is over the age of flies around the country to make sales calls himself often bunking with friends "its been hard for him because theres a lot of competition " says leonard phillips owner of ambassador liquors in new york which sells hamptons vodka mr bonder "has to do a lot more marketing and he cant really afford it " last year mr bonder signed on with a new california distributor he contacted nearly bars and restaurants in california to talk them into restocking hamptons vodka in mr bonder sold cases nonetheless hes still optimistic "i had a five year plan to get to cases but now its become a seven year plan " he says "i believe that its going to do tremendously well "
