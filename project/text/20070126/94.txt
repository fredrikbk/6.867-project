the evening wrap fresh paint shaky foundation the housing market just suffered through one of its worst years in recent times and as welcome as a year end sales rebound was some may liken it to a stainless steel fridge being plopped into a tin roofed shack for a second consecutive month demand for new homes actually climbed the commerce department said sales jumped in december after rising an even more impressive in november a reading that was revised sharply higher from the gain first estimated much ink has been spilled over the atrophy of the formerly muscle bound housing market so whats going on low interest rates have helped to wind a tourniquet around home sales by keeping mortgages relatively cheap mortgage applications have been strong lately a sign that some buyers are still ready to wade in for the right deal less sky high prices in a number of markets have also lured those who might have been priced out at the booms height but much like when cherry blossoms popped out in central park this winter warm weather seems to have messed with the seasonals some economists say that far from showing housing is getting up off the mat todays numbers simply hint that those topsy turvy temperatures poached activity from the spring more the new homes data dont get adjusted for cancellations and builders have been telling anyone who will listen that those are mushrooming even with the late year uptick in sales was by any reckoning a miserable year for housing sales plummeted to million units for the year the most harrowing descent since when the economy was in recession new homes werent alone in languishing on the market as sales of previously owned houses also got filleted declining by the sharpest percentage since price gains have meanwhile cooled and builders have been getting torched as a result a stream of construction companies have lined up to warn investors that profits will fall short of expectations a good many have taken expensive write downs on their vast real estate holdings and been forced to romance prospective buyers with costly sales incentives and just ask the big three how great that strategy has worked out down the line builders say they see no sign things are getting better one ray of light inventories of unsold homes at least are getting pared down economists at morgan stanley pointed out that stocks dwindled to near a one year low in december homes woes have also played a role in tripping up manufacturers as plants that once were cranking out lots of showers and storm doors have slowed but there was some good news on the factory front today as durables goods orders saw a climb during december robust aircraft orders had plenty to do with that but boeing wasnt the along company seeing decent business last month and a gauge of corporate investment in the report saw a comfy rise if housing does find its equilibrium and factories keep on humming at a respectable level most ordinary people will cheer but economist bernard baumohl wrote in a note that if the economy starts looking too hot an initial read on fourth quarter growth is due next week that could mean that a rate increase from the federal reserve will be back on the table the fed will discuss rates for the first time this year next week and while an increase doesnt look imminent the bank could remind the masses that its bias on borrowing costs

when it concerns troop levels in iraq saying he "picked the plan that i think is most likely to succeed " earlier this week a senate panel passed a nonbinding resolution challenging mr bushs plan to send more than more soldiers in baghdad and al anbar province in an effort to get the sectarian fighting roiling iraq under control critics claim that the plan doesnt provide enough troops to achieve that objective and some have called for more diplomacy with iraqs neighbors and a redeployment of u s forces away from the worst sectarian strife "i know there is skepticism and pessimism and that some are condemning a plan before its even had a chance to work " mr bush said "they have an obligation and a serious responsibility therefore to put up their own plan as to what would work " meanwhile mr bush has authorized u s forces in iraq to take whatever actions are necessary to counter iranian agents deemed a threat to american troops or the public "it makes sense that if somebodys
