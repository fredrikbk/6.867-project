weekend journal the green house effect after years on the fringe energy saving building techniques are moving into the mainstream jim carlton on the mixed benefits of living in a million dollar home built out of straw suzanne johnson relishes the view from the living room of her &# million home nestled in the sierra nevada mountains but its not just the sight of snowcapped peaks she enjoys her custom built energy efficient house produces so much of its own electricity that the monthly energy bill runs under &# compared with as much as &# for neighbors using gas heating "i get great enjoyment watching the propane trucks going up and down the hill this time of year " ms johnson says the energy saving technology in the retired intel corp executives square foot home includes photovoltaic solar panels that cover a third of the galvanized aluminum roof laminated glass flooring in one area provides natural light to a downstairs room outside foot by foot solar thermal panels sit on a terrace helping supply hot water for the house while the nearby square foot guest home features plants growing out of the sod on the "living roof " after years on the fringe green homes with solar panels tankless water heaters and walls insulated with straw are increasingly moving to the mainstream they are even becoming fixtures in new housing developments not just in custom built houses in vermont officials say a third of the new homes built there every year over the past few years have voluntarily adhered to rigorous energy efficiency standards as set by the national energy star program in california gov arnold schwarzeneggers plan to help fund solar rooftops on a million new homes was approved by the states public utilities commission last year industry officials project as many as solar homes a year will be built in the state by compared with about projected for this year accounting for roughly a quarter of californias annual rate of new home construction north carolina is using loans and rebates to help subsidize solar systems on homes by nationally green homes are projected to increase to between and of u s housing starts by from in according to a report last june by the national association of home builders and mcgraw hill construction that would equate to a market value of new home green building of between &# billion and &# billion versus &# billion in according to the report it still remains a fraction of total residential construction an estimated million homes were built last year with a total value of about &# billion according to the census bureau the growing popularity of energy saving construction comes amid a flurry of new interest in combating climate change reducing dependence on foreign oil and developing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar in his state of the union speech on tuesday president bush laid out ambitious plans to expand use of alternative fuels environmentally friendly buildings generally take two factors into account energy saving features and renewable resources the most widely regarded benchmark is the leadership in energy and environmental design rating system or leed from the u s green building council by its definition a green home uses less energy water and resources and creates less waste like greenhouse gas emissions a home can qualify if it meets minimum criteria under a points system with credit given for features such as energy efficient water heaters and insulation water efficient toilets and fixtures and use of materials like nonrare wood and long lasting siding higher end green homes tend to be the most energy efficient since some of the latest technologies can be pricey solar hot water heaters use the sun to warm up the water a solar panel runs from about &# to &# and a standard water heater is generally needed for backup rooftop catchment systems collect rainwater for toilet bathing and irrigation purposes though they can be as simple as a used barrel more extensive systems run &# to &# its still not easy to go green in architect phil bernstein set out to expand his familys square foot home in new haven conn by another square feet mr bernstein and his wife wanted to use green design like double pane windows and expanding foam insulation as much as possible but ran into problems they had a hard time finding kitchen countertops made of recycled material for one "we found some in seattle but we decided it would defeat the purpose to have a truck spewing carbon emissions bringing them all the way here " mr bernstein says the couple also wanted to use an alternative to mahogany for their cabinets that didnt come from endangered forests they found one called lyptus a hybrid of two species of eucalyptus trees but when the cabinets arrived they were pink mr bernstein worked with his builder for three months to find the right dye for the wood the project is now months behind schedule and has cost &# so far &# over budget in part because of the complications in going green thats far more than mr bernstein who is also a vice president at software maker autodesk inc would expect to recoup on a home he values at about &# "if we sold this house we would lose our shirts " he says "its like one homeowner against the world " experts say green features generally add anywhere from to to the total cost of a new home project a photovoltaic roofing system easily runs &# or more on a large house although government subsidies can halve that cost the payback in energy savings can take as long as a decade yet the cost benefit aspect of installing green technology is improving a decade ago a similar photovoltaic system cost &# a tankless heater recently installed at a low income home in dallas cost &# versus &# for a standard tank type model but the tankless heater uses kilowatt hours less electricity annually than the tank one resulting in power savings of &# a year under local rates according to an analysis by the partnership for advancing technology in housing a venture of industry and federal officials thats a payback on the investment within years according to the analysis on a larger scale in san jose calif a developer called first community housing built low income apartments in the projects cost of &# million included an extra &# or for green features such as low flow plumbing fixtures and engineered wood made from glued together wood fragments so fewer trees have to be chopped down the complexs energy savings are expected to total at least &# over years according to a study by new ecology inc and the tellus institute but there are potential downsides to green building some homeowners have had to tear out their poorly installed straw insulated walls after the straw became wet and began to rot builders are also working to solve ventilation problems that arise when walls and windows are too well insulated putting occupants at risk of toxic exposure to chemical fumes emitted by carpet paint and other materials most reputable builders now make sure green homes allow a healthy inflow and outflow of air green trends have come and gone over the years and some skeptics wonder how long lasting this one will prove solar energy was a big promise in the s but failed to take off after oil prices fell again in the s with green materials like alternatives to wood and solar rooftop panels in short supply builders faced spending as much as more to use green designs instead of conventional ones this time around proponents say the economics have changed as energy costs have spiraled and the cost of green technology has dropped consumers are increasingly eager to embrace new techniques that over time can save them money today heating and cooling of homes accounts for about of u s energy use according to federal estimates and the movement towards greener homes is likely to help curb the countrys emission of greenhouse gases experts say and a survey last year by mcgraw hill construction found that for the first time a majority of u s builders said they planned to use green features in at least of their homes by in what nahb officials call "a tipping point" in builders going green but many consumers remain unwilling to make a fundamental sacrifice size "the biggest thing people could do to be green is not to build a square foot house but a square foot house " says tim hermach executive director of the native forest council an environmental group in eugene ore green products are increasingly showing up in real estate developments in maui hawaii developer dowling co is set to break ground in april on a gated home complex featuring solar power low flush toilets native landscaping and low emitting paints and carpets homes in the maluaka development about two miles down the beach from upscale hotels along the wailea coast will range from square feet to square feet with prices expected to range from &# million to &# million many of the new green developments are more affordable in seattle work is half completed on the home high point development city officials say its being built so efficiently that it will use the same amount of energy and less water than the former housing project on the site which had half as many units prices range from between &# and &# for flats to between &# and &# for single family homes commercial developers are even further along than residential developers in part because cities and states have been pushing for greener construction in chicago city officials have retrofitted million square feet of public buildings an area the size of three sears towers with more efficient equipment for cooling heating lighting and ventilation officials also planted a lawn and shrubbery atop the chicago city hall which has reduced air conditioning use by because the roof now reaches only degrees on the hottest summer days compared with degrees on neighboring rooftops in all chicago has some three million square feet of its municipal rooftops carpeted with the cooling gardens and trees newark n j has planted trees in strategic areas around the city with the shade from each tree designed to reduce heating and cooling costs in adjoining buildings by as much as berkeley calif has used an educational approach anyone who applies for a building permit there is assigned a city staffer who gives recommendations on how green materials and designs can be used on the project few places have as high a concentration of green building as burlington vt a leafy college town of about people on the shores of lake champlain lake champlain chocolates for example built a packaging and distribution warehouse to vastly exceed energy efficiency standards of the local utility the waterfront in vermonts largest city is also adorned with a green aquarium green office building and a green high rise apartment complex at the university of vermont school officials have invested &# million in green building over the past five years that effort has made an impact power consumption in burlington has stayed roughly flat since even though the population and number of businesses have grown over the same time says chris burns an energy specialist with burlington electric the citys utility "had we done nothing we would be paying &# million more a year for electricity " mr burns says for a unit apartment building on the burlington waterfront the &# million development was financed by a combination of low income housing tax credits and loans and grants from state utilities power consumption in the four story building is tightly restricted while an on premises treatment plant was built to clean any storm water off the property before it runs into lake champlain the residents of the affordable living complex say they like the fact that their electricity bills run only about &# a month less than half the rate for comparably sized apartments that arent built green all that efficiency can have a downside gail
