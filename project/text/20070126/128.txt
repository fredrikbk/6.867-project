why nonprofits fund for profit companies doing drug research science has made paralyzed rats walk cured mice of cancer and eliminated alzheimers in more lab rodents than you can count human patients not so much "theres frustration that developments from academic labs dont get picked up by drug and biotech companies " says dayton coles as a board member of the juvenile diabetes research foundation he has seen promising discovery after promising discovery emerge from the university labs that jdrf has funded but none has turned into a cure for type diabetes which his daughter has fed up with breakthroughs that fill journals rather than medicine chests private foundations and charities that have traditionally funded academic scientists have started doing the once unthinkable writing checks for millions of dollars to for profit companies its a sign of desperation one reason there have been so few drug breakthroughs lately is that the profit motive actually works against the development of new pharmaceuticals drug companies suffer from blockbuster itis the belief that only billion dollar almost sure things need apply for development as a result even the most brilliant discovery may not be translated into a drug unless it has figure sales potential also short time horizons on the part of venture capitalists who generally want to see their biotech bets pay off in three years dont mesh well with the lengthy drug development process enter the charities earlier this month jdrf announced that it was giving &# million to macrogenics inc a rockville md biotech for a phase clinical trial of an antibody that might slow progression of type diabetes the antibody basically puts an immune system cell called cd in a headlock preventing it from orchestrating an immune attack on cells that produce insulin destruction of those cells causes type diabetes macrogenics acquired the rights to the antibody in after a major pharmaceutical company got it through safety tests with flying colors but then dropped it for financial reasons says scott koenig macrogenics president and ceo "only" million people in the u s have type diabetes so anti cd therapy will never ring up lipitor like profits blockbuster itis had struck again the macrogenics deal follows three others jdrf unveiled in in october it announced that it would pay up to &# million to sangamo biosciences inc richmond calif for a phase trial of a protein drug that shows promise against diabetic neuropathy in which nerve damage due to diabetes causes numbness pain and eventually loss of motor function it is also funding a phase trial by transition therapeutics inc toronto of a drug that might make insulin producing cells regenerate and a phase trial by tolerrx inc cambridge mass of an antibody that like macrogenics might protect insulin making cells transition therapeuticss big pharma partner for its clinical trial bowed out in so the trial "would have come to a halt " says jdrfs richard insel vice president for research "we wanted to see this go forward which meant moving beyond our traditional support for academic research " in every case the companies are also sinking their own or investors money into the trials but they say the jdrf check makes a difference "we were locked and loaded for our phase trial but the jdrf funding will let us look more closely" at how the drug works says sangamo ceo edward lamphier parents of kids with diabetes arent the only ones fed up with the slow pace of translational research this week the michael j fox foundation announced that it had awarded sangamo &# to apply its gene regulation research to slowing parkinsons disease in march families of spinal muscular atrophy founded by parents of children with this rare disease ponied up &# to help paratek pharmaceuticals inc boston develop a drug for the disease "with sma patients in the u s the market is too small for companies to see this disease as a worthwhile bet unless we help them take a compound past the initial stages " says kenneth hobby executive director of the charity "if that means funding a company we have no problem with that " at the myelin repair foundation "we decided we have to break the mold to bridge the translational research gap which is getting bigger and bigger " says the foundations chief operating officer russell bromley that means paying companies to conduct validation research in which scientists test how a compound works in the body given how few bright ideas turn into fda approved drugs fewer than one in according to the pharmaceutical industry companies want compounds "de risked" for them translation get someone else to do or pay for this step charities realize that writing checks to for profits might not be what their donors had in mind "we debated whether it was right for our money to go to a company that might make a profit " says jdrf board member michael white "were not unconcerned about that but weve invested so much in discovery what we need now is to take these things to market were taking on the role of venture philanthropists " you can email me at sciencejournal wsj com
