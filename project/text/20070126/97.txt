for the e mail here there was awe but little shock in the release of ford motors fourth quarter and total results yesterday numbers that underlined the now familiar plight of detroits big three fords quarterly loss came to &# billion bringing the annual aggregate to &# billion of red ink that made for the worst year in company history ford hasnt been in the black since early and the reasons behind the companys downturn have been evident since before that sales of its most profitable products pickups and suvs slumped amid high gas prices as the los angeles times notes toyota motor and other foreign rivals are producing more desirable cars and like many traditional bastions of american industry the auto makers are weighed down by costly health and pension costs for retired employees who vastly outnumber the current streamlined work force as the detroit news says "there are no easy fixes" for these problems and wall street seemed to give new chief executive alan mulally credit for trying ford shares closed up two cents or about a quarter of a percent but can mr mulally deliver with the companys way forward plan to do so he must deliver cars and trucks consumers want to buy convince union workers to give up many of the benefits their predecessors fought to get and "revolutionize a corporate culture that has put personal ambition ahead of company success for too long " the news says a strike more unanticipated shifts in consumer tastes and problems with new vehicles are all potential hazards that could derail mr mulallys plans he acknowledges to the detroit free press that "we are at the bottom " but he sets out a timetable wall street will probably hold him to "for the next few quarters its going to be worse year over year but at the year end overall it will be better " mr mulally says "and we will be back on our plan towards profitable growth in " the hiring of mr mulally formerly a star at boeing marked the first time one of the big three sought a leader outside the industry and the new york times notes the message hes now sending is indeed a new one for the industry he "has signaled that the bigger is better worldview that has defined ford for decades is being replaced with a new approach less is more " the times says "instead of insisting that ford reverse its slide mr mulally says that ford will become much smaller " with forecasts that show it may fall from being no in north america to being no behind general motors toyota and daimlerchryslers chrysler division ford isnt the only troubled american in those rankings but it may be the only one willing to shrink gm also struggling to achieve that ultimate conventional wisdom feat a turnaround is even having trouble getting its results right gm said yesterday that it would delay release of its fourth quarter numbers to correct five years of reporting errors though it promised record revenue and "significantly" improved results as bloomberg reports last year gm had to restate results back to and the new accounting trouble is just the latest "hiccup" in gm ceo rick wagoners plan to earn back investor trust bloomberg says what neither mr mulally nor mr wagoner has yet been able to do is resolve their companies heavy labor and legacy cost burdens "their real challenge is how to stop burning cash in futile efforts to manage decline " the wall street journal says "they can no longer rely on the cost cutting and sales boosting strategies of the past such as squeezing parts suppliers for discounts pressuring dealers to accept excess inventory and demanding higher prices from consumers " mr mulally apparently still feels the need to make clear he understands that he said of his priorities to the n y times "at the top of the list i would put dealing with reality " bushs iraq plan in washington and baghdad turnaround timetables and benchmarks also seem to be at the heart of efforts by a handful of senate republicans to come up with a way to head off the looming congressional rebuke of president bushs new way forward plan for iraq sen john mccain who has staked his presidential ambitions on support for sending more troops to iraq said hes interested in drafting a new resolution calling for benchmarks that could gauge the effectiveness of mr bushs troop increase the los angeles times reports sen john cornyn who has backed nearly all of mr bushs plans for iraq has said he might introduce a similar piece of legislation the aim of either a mccain or cornyn resolution would be to draw support away from the bipartisan measures currently in the works that condemn outright mr bushs plans mr bushs plans rely on the ability of iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki to make his government truly one of national unity but he didnt seem to be making much progress on that front yesterday mr maliki and sunni lawmakers "hurled insults at one another during a raucous session of parliament " the new york times reports "with the prime minister threatening a sunni lawmaker with arrest and the sunni speaker of parliament threatening to quit " meanwhile government and counterterrorism officials tell the washington post that "the bush administration has authorized the u s military to kill or capture iranian operatives inside iraq as part of an aggressive new strategy to weaken tehrans influence across the middle east and compel it to give up its nuclear program " new virgin ventures in macau umbilical blood sir richard branson whose virgin empire already boasts airlines cellphone service and popular media among it ventures is in advanced talk
