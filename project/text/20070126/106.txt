vietnam and the vatican the vatican has been home to many miracles but yesterdays was especially striking vietnamese prime minister nguyen tan dung became the first communist head of state to visit the holy see diplomatic relations may soon follow vietnams catholics and the church would celebrate such a reconciliation so would chinas catholics to whom such a move might lend hope the prime ministers visit comes at a time when hanois "doi moi" policies of economic reform are bearing great fruit double digit economic growth will receive a boost from the countrys recent accession to the world trade organization opening up to the world hasnt been without bumps but the direction is clear so too with religious freedom crackdowns on protestants while still far too common are starting to ease vietnams six million catholics can celebrate mass attend religious classes and do community service without harassment in an informal arrangement the holy see nominates bishops and the government almost always approves them the vatican also maintains a regular dialogue with hanoi we hope beijing is watching after a brief period of reconciliation last year chinas official church reverted to unofficial ordinations and severe crackdowns saying it didnt want the vatican interfering in its "internal affairs " chinas catholics know that "internal affairs" are those of the soul not the state how wonderful dare we say miraculous that hanoi is moving in that direction
