weekend journal sports by the numbers federer faces the future in this weekends australian open finals roger federer hopes to take another step in his quest for tennis history if he can win the tournament for the third time in four years it will be his th grand slam singles title tying the great bill tilden it will also make him only the sixth man to break into double figures in grand slam wins but the really historic number that mr federer is aiming for is pete samprass record number of major wins as one way of handicapping mr federers odds of achieving that goal well use slam average sa slam average measures the ability to win the big ones by taking a players career slam wins and dividing it by the number of slams he entered this stat looks at a players accomplishments the way history does where a tough semifinal loss really doesnt mean more than a lackluster first round exit viewed from a distance winning is indeed everything and mr federer has done that winning nine slams in tries for a slam average among players who played their entire careers after tenniss open era began in mr federer trails only bjorn borg the swedish champ who won out of slams for a sa but mr federer took his time breaking through playing slams before his first major victory at wimbledon in since then hes captured eight majors in only tries including three of four last year hes also keeping pace with mr sampras after slams mr sampras had eight wins and would win his ninth slam in his st major since federer is years old the same age that mr sampras was after slams he would seem to be a good bet to break mr samprass record but history suggests that its hardly a given while is young in a sport like baseball or basketball its middle aged in mens tennis recent history shows just what a young mans game tennis is of the players with four or more grand slam singles titles who played entirely in the open era not including mr federer six won their last slam before their th birthday that includes jim courier who was finished at age mats wilander and bjorn borg who won their last slam titles at age john mcenroe who was done at and stefan edberg and guillermo vilas whose last major titles came at age these players won slams in total and of them or came before their th birthdays in short mr federers best days could well be behind him federer fans can point to the example of two recent american champions mr sampras and andre agassi who won majors after their th birthdays however mr federer faces an obstacle that they were able to avoid a great young rival tennis is largely a game of rivalries and by their mid s players invariably start losing to younger rivals mr mcenroe got the best of mr borg and ivan lendl in turn figured out how to beat mr mcenroe messrs sampras and agassi took advantage of a relative power vacuum in the game around the turn of the millennium as the flaws in feisty lleyton hewitts game were quickly exposed and the supremely talented marat safin suffered with injuries and a lack of focus mr federer however has a more than worthy foe in year old rafael nadal despite his loss in the quarterfinals of the australian open to fernando gonzalez of chile mr nadal has won back to back french opens beating mr federer in paris en route both times and he has shown a versatility in his game he gave mr federer a serious scare in last years wimbledon finals thats reminiscent of mr borg plus he owns a career edge over mr federer so if mr federer wants to replace mr sampras as the most prolific winner in mens tennis hes going to have to make the most of his opportunities while hes near his peak and before mr nadal reaches his for all mr federers greatness hes facing another rival father time who simply wont be vanquished holding court among male players of the open era roger federer trails only bjorn borg in slam average a players winning percentage when he enters one of tenniss four major championships a potential concern for the year old mr federer as he pursues mr samprass record of career grand slam wins is that many top players stopped winning majors at a very young age name slams won slams entered slam avg age at last slam win bjorn borg roger federer pete sampras mats wilander john mcenroe
