weekend journal taste de gustibus jack bauers dilemmas and ours the current season of foxs television series "" began with a dilemma that will be familiar to long time devotees of the program a mans wife and child have been taken hostage by a terrorist if the man does not help him carry out his plans his family will be killed yes such a dilemma propels the shows pace and intensifies the dramatic ordeal but it also points toward difficult ethical puzzles with profound implications for our current real world moment you dont need to watch "" as a kind of primer on moral philosophy but you probably should this seasons opening predicament echoes the one into which the shows star jack bauer was thrust in the series first season six years ago back then the bad guys tried to compel bauer played by kiefer sutherland to assist in the assassination of a presidential candidate as a result he was forced both to play along with the terrorists and seek a way to free his family he succeeded at least temporarily in saving both the target of the assassination and his family in a variety of forms the sticky situation with which the series began has formed the heart of the show ever since terrorist threats place american civilians and government officials in a position in which they must choose between conflicting loyalties it is the shows genius and the key to its enduring appeal that its writers almost never lapse into thinking that these choices are simple this is not to say that there are no right and wrong answers but right and wrong are often only clear especially to the characters but even to the viewer in retrospect this season the kidnapping plot line is reprised only this time it is the proverbial man on the street who is coerced and he chooses compliance with the terrorists in the vain hope that if he upholds his end of the bargain they will too he does so oblivious to the consequences of abetting a terrorist plot that as it turns out results in the detonation of a nuclear bomb in the middle of los angeles fittingly the father who made this possible is consumed by the blast his son meanwhile only escapes because the familys mother refuses to rely on the terrorists goodwill and instead calls in the authorities the lesson here is not only that appeasing terrorists is a mugs game the fathers feeling of duty to his family blinds him to the competing claims of his country and his neighbors he acts out of simplistic loyalty to family without due consideration of the effects it is natural to try to save ones family under these circumstances it would be monstrous not to but it is not merely a question of choosing between family and a greater good or in other contexts that crop up repeatedly on the show between civil liberties and national security or between torture and human rights it is a failing of our politics that these kinds of questions in the real world are presented by both sides as either easy to answer or unnecessary to choose between or both it is one achievement of "" that it treats these tradeoffs as both real and difficult they are questions that depend on the circumstances in which they are asked which is not to say that the characters in the show always see things as difficult it would stretch credulity if every character had a knack for moral subtlety the shows characters good bad and in between can be judged by the extent to which they are able to weigh these countervailing demands the reputation of jack bauer the counterterrorism officer extraordinaire has survived episodes in which he threatened to cut out the eye of a presidential aide or shot bad guys in the knees because he never seems to lose sight of the larger goal of saving the country or of resolving the apparent contradictions into which he is sometimes forced in that quest one of the presidents aides by contrast reacts to the nuclear blast by suggesting that its a good opportunity to round up muslims en masse the callousness of the idea as much as its content exposes him as morally obtuse and thus sinister in another difficult moment from last week bauer was forced to choose between saving the life of a known terrorist and murderer and taking the life of a federal agent and friend if history is any guide viewers of the show will presumably be given reason to question whether jack made the correct decision before this season is out but the contrast between bauer and the agent he had to kill to save the terrorist lies in the ethical realm much as he hates to save the bad guy he knows that the terrorist may be the only hope of preventing even more murders down the road the agent he kills by contrast is motivated purely by the desire for personal revenge all these episodes help the show to maintain a realistic moral tone an enemy that rejects everything we hold dear about our civil society will inevitably force us to make compromises between competing principles and loyalties the most interesting complications that ensue as a season of "" unfolds are the moral ones and the shows great virtue is that it never pretends that these dilemmas are simple or false mr carney is a member of the journals editorial board
