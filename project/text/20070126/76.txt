politics &amp economics the daily davos updates from the world economic forum where pollyanna can feel at home if youre wondering about that bubbling sound that little gurgle you hear when you discover that seven of the eight people at the dinner table are newly employed in private equity be assured that their optimism is also shared by many big institutions and many big name economists at the world economic forums davos gathering this year in fact pollyanna might feel right at home and why not when was the last time the global economy fired on virtually all cylinders for so extended a period all engines are chugging along the u s europe japan china even erratic emerging markets a world awash in cash is sloshing a lot of it into places like asia where small economies sometimes have outsized reactions and right behind the cash come the armies of investment bankers derivatives traders wealth management advisers and most certainly newly minted private equity bloodhounds in search of a hot acquisition like many investment banks with operations in asia lehman brothers is racing to keep up with the new opportunities companies in china and india are looking to tap the capital markets in japan the worlds second largest national economy corporations are back from a year coma brought on by the crash of the japanese real estate and stock markets in the early s theyre keen to avoid the same mistakes again and theyre "more sophisticated " says jasjit s bhattal who runs lehmans asia operations and so they are more willing to browse through lehmans catalog of structured products this is a very good time to be looking for work in investment banking in asia mr bhattal who like many bankers is attending the davos conference says his hong kong staff has tripled in size in recent years and the number of lehman employees in tokyo has doubled similar trends have been evident throughout the financial industry in asia where bankers have tied on their running shoes to keep pace with the uptick in japans corporate health the slow but steady liberalization of chinas and indias financial systems and stock markets that are on a tear dont mind that bubbling sound maybe it is different this time john bussey the new trade gap u s trade negotiator susan schwab gets sympathy but no cigar from her fellow trade ministers more than of whom have gathered in davos for what has become an annual ritual egyptian trade minister rachid rachid is one of the key players in the doha round of global trade talks where he represents of the countries at the table "susan has a hard job " he said explaining why he expected the davos meeting to produce enthusiasm but none of the new proposals needed to revive the stalled talks "its hard for her to persuade the rest of the group that she can make any changes " with president bushs trade negotiating authority about to expire and a new democratic majority running congress there is broad skepticism that ms schwab can deliver further cuts in u s farm subsidies to help unblock negotiations in the european union too trade commissioner peter mandelson faces a tall order to persuade france to accept further cuts in farm subsidies in mr rachids view no one should be surprised if it takes years more to get an agreement in part thats because doha is so complicated that very few politicians understand its details and consequences well enough to be able to take it to their voters back home and explain why they should make sacrifices for it a second reason is that these trade talks are unlike any before this time its the developed world being asked to open up its markets "we are seeing a huge shift in the global economy with the rise of china and india and growing trade flows outside the west and the trade talks just havent caught up " he said "nowadays you have more protectionist spirit in the west than in developing countries thats a big change " marc champion competitive spirit productivity and competitiveness have become catchwords for the european central bank which is worried about slippage in some euro zone countries that doesnt seem to have lit any fires under two of the chief sources of the ecbs concern though not one government or business official from italy or spain whose economies have posted negative productivity growth according to the organization for economic cooperation and development showed up at a world economic forum workshop on productivity instead the nordics were out in force led by president tarja halonen of finland and a slew of norwegians but those countries are considered poster children for the effort to boost productivity and all five of the regions countries are posting economic growth and labor productivity rates far above the skimpy euro zone average ms halonen made clear that nordic leaders remain cautious in the wake of the meltdown their economies experienced in the s when their large paper and metal industries were pounded by cheaper competition theres no desire to repeat the experience ms halonen reckons its easier for countries like finland with million people to respond to the call for productivity as their domestic markets are too small to sustain traditionally high wages but she didnt quite let the club med nations off the hook "finland is small and all the nordic countries together are small but when you think of india and china even the entire european union including germany is small " she said chris emsden the davos disconnect conversations in this swiss village take place at a meta level as if the high altitude was forcing everyone to engage on an equally lofty intellectual plane this year theres a meta disconnect between the conversations on economic issues and those on political and social issues on the economic front there is remarkable optimism the u s seems to be weathering its housing bust well europe is strengthening and china india and much of the rest of the developing world are providing a raft of new consumers and new business opportunities risk has been priced out of financial markets capital is available to anyone who wants it including the most questionable emerging markets and most debt burdened companies testament to that is the omnipresence here of hyper successful financiers lloyd blankfein of goldman sachs david rubinstein of carlyle glenn hutchins of silver lake stephen schwarzman of blackstone they are this years davos rock stars much as the internet entrepreneurs were in but when the conversation turns to political and social issues the storm clouds gather risk which has been all but banished from the economic and financial conversation is suddenly everywhere there is a lack of political leadership as the u s and europe prepare for a new generation of leaders globalization the source of so much of the economic optimism becomes the subject of a brooding pessimism a cause of discontent among the middle class the unhappiness of the muslim world the continuing threat from terrorism the possibility of a global pandemic all hang heavily over the discussions which of these views of the worlds future is the correct one thats a question unlikely to be answered in this snowy resort alan murray
