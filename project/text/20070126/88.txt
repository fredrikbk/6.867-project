company wednesday plans to finally set a firm date for spinning off its stake in kraft foods inc but unexpected legal obstacles still could emerge to delay the restructuring the kraft spinoff expected to be set for april is likely to be the first phase of a bigger restructuring of altria if all goes as planned it will likely be followed early next year by a breaking of the u s and international tobacco operations into two parts in altria then known as philip morris cos sold million shares of kraft in an initial public offering before that philip morris owned of kraft for kraft the worlds second biggest food company by sales after nestle sa of switzerland the spinoff comes as changes in the packaged food industry have hurt its growth the spinoff is likely to remove a layer of oversight and let kraft to move faster to shake up its business mix dumping slower growth businesses in favor of areas with more growth potential such as health and ethnic food investors also hope the spinoff will enable kraft whose products include oreo cookies oscar mayer meats and velveeta cheese to trade on the stock market without being weighed down by uncertainty over the long term prospects for the tobacco business altria shareholders are expecting to get about kraft share for each share of altria they now hold "its true in this case that the sum of the parts is worth more than the whole " said david dreman of dreman value management which owned about million altria shares as of sept in philip morris cos first acknowledged publicly it was considering breaking up its food and tobacco empire it quickly put the idea on hold because the philip morris usa unit faced numerous massive legal claims it worried that smokers with pending lawsuits could try to block any move to separate tobacco from kraft arguing to the court that without the food business altria might not be able to pay out significant legal claims against it recent victories in big antitobacco lawsuits have made altria whose cigarette units market the marlboro and virginia slims brands among others more optimistic altria lawyers and chief executive louis camilleri recently have said they believe the litigation environment has improved still potential legal hurdles remain at least one plaintiffs lawyer washington d c attorney michael d hausfeld is contemplating action to block altrias attempt to cut kraft loose "we may try to stop it " mr hausfeld said in an interview his national class action lawsuit in the u s representing an estimated million to million smokers of "light" cigarettes is pending before a federal appeals court with oral arguments scheduled for as soon as march alleging that the big cigarette companies fraudulently marketed light cigarettes as safer than regular smokes he estimates potential claims of "hundreds of billions of dollars " philip morris sells more than one out of every two cigarettes in the u s and could be liable for a big chunk of any judgment "the matter is under investigation within the firm and we have to make the decision whether we feel that this spinoff would undermine an ability to effect a recovery " mr hausfeld said altria says it will continue to defend itself in the lights case and the spinoff "we have no intention of settling the cigarette case even in the face of such a threat " said william s ohlemeyer altria associate general counsel any serious challenge to the spinoff would cost the plaintiffs as much as &# million in legal costs estimates analyst david adelman of morgan stanley and prospects for success are uncertain altrias lawyers already have spent "tens of millions of dollars" to prepare themselves for a challenge to the spinoff said mr adelman who has an "overweight" rating on altria shares such court battles could delay the spinoff by a couple of months indeed not every plaintiffs lawyer sees a problem thomas v urmy jr of boston who in filed what is known as the aspinall class action lawsuit on behalf of all purchasers of marlboro light cigarettes in massachusetts says his case is moving forward "if we get a judgment against altria down the line they are going to pay it " mr urmy said to lessen the chance of further interference from plaintiffs lawyers altria and its board arent expected to say much if anything on wednesday or in the weeks that follow about the second phase of its makeover the separation of philip morris usa of richmond va and philip morris international based in lausanne switzerland altria had net income of &# billion and revenue of &# billion in the quarter ended
