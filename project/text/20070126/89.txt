stealthy maneuver the cia captures an a blackbird spy plane was on display in an air guard museum minnesota is up in arms the central intelligence agency is closing in on a high value landscaping target a s spy plane called the a blackbird the cia plans to mount the once secret foot long supersonic plane on a pole at its langley va headquarters in time for the agencys th anniversary in september the jet chosen for the mission is a particularly well preserved specimen that has been at the minnesota air guard museum next to the minneapolis st paul airport since even though a moving crew began the day process of dismantling the spy plane this week volunteers who painstakingly restored it at their own expense are continuing to oppose what they consider a hijacking their pleas for mercy backed by the governor and entire minnesota congressional delegation have fallen on deaf ears "possession is nine tenths of the law so until they drag it away with me screaming we have a chance " said james goodall an aviation buff and retired minnesota national guardsman who salvaged the plane and led efforts to preserve it the a blackbird retired in was the forerunner to the better known sr blackbird the stealthy a is one of the fastest aircraft ever made capable of flying at more than three times the speed of sound and at the edge of space the plane originated as part of a cia program code named "oxcart " of the a s built by lockheed martin corp s famed skunk works advanced projects unit nine remain one is on display at an air force base and the others are at museums around the country mr goodall and his supporters dont question the right of the air force which controls these decommissioned warplanes to reclaim an a and lend it to the cia as an oversize lawn ornament inside the agency compound instead their two month dogfight has been aimed at getting the air force to justify removing the minnesota museums crown jewel while three a s sit in alabama including one that has been neglected since suffering hurricane damage another is parked on the uss intrepid aircraft carrier a floating manhattan museum that will be closed until late next year because of renovation work across the hudson river the cia whose headquarters isnt open to the public had no role in selecting which plane it would receive the air force says the minnesota air national guard doesnt have a historical connection to the a and though the minnesotans have taken good care of their a the volunteer run museum doesnt meet the air forces current legal requirements for its museums for one thing it doesnt have a salaried director after reviewing all nine a s "the only one that didnt have a legitimate rationale for its location was minnesotas " said terry aitken senior curator at the national museum of the u s air force that logic outrages mr goodall years old who spent years in the minnesota air national guard and his entire adult life smitten with the a he says he became an "airplane nut" at age when he saw a squadron of b bombers flying over san francisco bay he first glimpsed a blackbird as an year old air force recruit at edwards air force base in california it was march and "it affected me forever " he says over the years mr goodall became an expert writing five books on the supersonic plane he built a rapport with ben rich who developed the blackbird for lockheed and eventually ran skunk works mr goodall says he got a tip from mr rich in that the blackbird program would be canceled "if anyone can scrounge one you can " he says the late mr rich told him at the time mr goodall was the staff historian for the rd airlift wing of the minnesota air national guard he hatched a scheme to rescue an a from the scrapheap in palmdale calif in minnesotas congressional delegation backed the air guard museums request citing the fact that companies in minnesota supplied key blackbird components and that some blackbird pilots hailed from the state the air force was happy to unload the a to avoid a costly process of destroying the asbestos packed plane once the air force museum agreed to the loan mr goodall arranged for two massive cargo planes from the new york air national guard to haul the blackbird in pieces from california he persuaded a local hotel to put up the flight and moving crews free of charge for days "the air force estimated the move would cost &# i got it done for &# that makes me the deal of the century guy " mr goodall says back in st paul he marshaled volunteers and corporate donations for restoration work he then spent years and thousands of his own dollars he says scrounging for cockpit instruments at one point swapping a prized ejection seat from his private collection to get a supersonic speedometer known as a mach meter all was well until last november when the museum got a letter from mr aitken the air force museum curator invoking a provision of the loan agreement that allows the air force to reclaim its plane by giving days notice the only reason mr aitken cited for the decision was the need to "satisfy current exhibit requirements " distressed local air guard commanders appealed to save the a calling it a "labor of love " mr aitken replied that the plane didnt conform to the air parks primary mission which is to commemorate the state guard wings history and said it would be better suited at the cia mr goodall who is now retired in seattle but returns to the twin cities occasionally to visit his beloved blackbird energized the opposition movement by urging guardsmen and the museums civilian nonprofit foundation to enlist minnesota and national politicians he also mobilized support from former a pilots mr goodalls plea if the air force wants a plane to commemorate the cias pioneering past it should take one that actually flew in combat minnesotas plane never saw action the a in birmingham ala on the other hand photographed north vietnamese surface to air missile sites in later sustained flak damage and flew over north korea on a spy mission in after the north koreans captured the uss pueblo claiming the navy ship had strayed into its territorial waters some minnesotans are upset that the air force gave short notice and didnt offer to discuss its a plans "this is a museum a community not a war game " said mark ness vice chairman of the museum foundation and a retired air national guard brigadier general mr goodall knew the odds were long the air force has plucked other planes despite local resistance including a b bomber taken from fort worth texas and the celebrated world war ii b the memphis belle from its namesake city in tennessee even as another joint appeal from minnesotas congressional delegation was delivered to the air force secretary friday the air force museum told guardsmen in minneapolis st paul to prepare for the movers the minnesota museums supporters have retained a former state supreme court justice as their lawyer but as the moving crew continued to unbolt the a s wings yesterday they had yet to decide whether to seek a court injunction against the move mr goodall who refers to the plane as "my a " has made his own unilateral sortie he has removed some cockpit instruments he had donated "no one will see them anyway if the plane is on a pole " he says "ill be damned if the cia will get their hands on these "
