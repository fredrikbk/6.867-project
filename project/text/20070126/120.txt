condition and received rave reviews from our guests " recalled mr whaley who also may open two other cherished bottles next month long held gifts from appreciative friends a stags leap wine cellars

to italy together many years ago long before we wrote about wine we visited the piedmont region and through a series of happy accidents were virtually adopted for a week by the cerettos one of italys legendary winemaking families when we were leaving with tears all around they handed us a signed bottle of grappa the distilled firewater we dont often drink serious alcohol and we had never even tasted grappa but the next year on a very cold day we opened it and we each took a sip one sip was enough for the whole winter winter after winter we took a sip of that grappa usually while standing knee deep in snow in central park or outside our country cabin until inevitably we have come to the last few sips on open that bottle night finally we will finish the grappa and remember the hills and fog of piedmont and the generosity of strangers and yes of course well open a special bottle of wine too but which one part of the fun is figuring that out so we dont know yet mr represas also is trying to decide what wine he will bring to the whaleys home even though he said bringing wine into the u s from mexico city "is a real nightmare " a few years ago he was on a flight from bogota to mexico city that experienced hydraulic failure and had to fly in circles to burn up fuel before attempting to make an emergency landing "it was a good opportunity to review my life " mr represas said "it was comfortable to find out that i was pleased with most of the things id done and the way i left things the wills the properties but the one thing that i was really upset about was all of those bottles of wine that i had left in the cellar that i would never drink and didnt know who would eventually do it "it was a tough landing all of the tires of the airplane blew out the pilot did a really fantastic job " he recalled adding that he had to drink "a couple scotches before i could even call home " so when the whaleys whom he had met on a barge trip through burgundy told him about otbn "i knew this was something i must do it is a way to commemorate the importance of not leaving this world without enjoying what you have in this world " if you plan to participate in open that bottle night here are some tips to help you make the most of it  choose the wine this is the all important first step you dont necessarily want to open your "best" wine or your most impressive wine but the wine that means the most to you the one that you would simply never open otherwise maybe its grandpas garlic wine youre looking for a bottle full of memories on the other hand if you have say a lafite thats just sitting there we certainly couldnt argue with that  stand older wine up away from light and heat of course for a few days before you plan to open it say on wednesday this will allow the sediment if there is some to sink to the bottom  both reds and whites are often better closer to cellar temperature around degrees than todays room temperature dont overchill the white and think about putting the red in the refrigerator for an hour or two before opening it if youve been keeping it in a degree house  with an older bottle the cork may break easily the best opener for a cork like that is one with two prongs but it requires some skill you have some time to practice using one be prepared for the possibility that a fragile cork may fall apart with a regular corkscrew if that happens have a carafe and a coffee filter handy just pour enough through the coffee filter to catch the cork  otherwise do not decant were assuming these are old and fragile wines air could quickly dispel whats left of them if the wine does need to breathe you should have plenty of time for that throughout the evening  have a backup wine ready for your special meal in case your old wine really has gone bad  if you are having an otbn party ask everyone to say a few words about the significance of the wine they brought this really is what otbn is all about sharing  serve dinner open the wine and immediately take a sip if its truly irretrievably bad we mean vinegar you will know it right away but even if the wine doesnt taste good at first dont rush to the sink to pour it out every year we hear from people who were amazed how a wine pulled itself together and became delicious as the night wore on  enjoy the wine for what it is not what it might someday be or might once have been  drop us a note at wine wsj com about your evening be sure to include your name city and phone number in case we need to contact you so that we can share your account with other readers
