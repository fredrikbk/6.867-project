financial worlds version of a super bowl over a takeover attempt aiming to crush a competing offer for equity office properties trust blackstone yesterday increased its bid for the real estate company by a surprising the tussle represents a rare event in the private equity deal world a pitched auction after a deal had been signed the sharply increased bid from the private equity giant comes after a group led by vornado realty trust trumped blackstones initial bid last week at &# a share the all cash blackstone bid values equity office at &# billion according to dealogic blackstones head steve schwarzman has told associates that he is determined to keep the slugfest for eop from becoming an rjr nabisco situation the iconic battle in where prices rose so high for the company that kohlberg kravis roberts the ultimate winner never made great returns from its prize with &# billion in debt added to the deal the &# billion total value of the transaction would be the biggest private equity buyout ever on a combined debt and equity basis a common industry yardstick for deals the previous record by this measure came when bain capital kkr and merrill lynch paid &# billion and assumed &# billion in debt to acquire hospital operator hca inc in the biggest private equity deal based on traditional measures remains kkrs &# billion purchase of rjr which included &# billion in debt private equity firms using money raised from pension funds and other big investors invest in companies with the plan to improve them and cash out by reselling them or selling shares the vornado group is widely expected to increase its preliminary offer of &# a share made up of in cash and in stock according to people familiar with the situation those tracking the deal believe the vornado group because it has a heavy share component would have to take its offer to &# a share to move back in front of blackstone jim corl chief investment officer at cohen &amp steers real estate funds believes vornado is willing to go higher than its original bid "these guys are master deal makers " mr corl said "its like a game of chess if youre a good chess player youve got your next three moves thought out " the revised blackstone offer comes in the midst of an intense fact finding or "due diligence " period equity office has granted the vornado group ending jan equity offices shareholders vote on the blackstone offer feb a statement from equity office noted that the revised blackstone terms "would not preclude a revised proposal from the third party group or a proposal from any other potential bidder " while the game is likely to continue blackstone has one significant advantage it has the right to match any competitors bid blackstone also negotiated a higher though still modest breakup fee of &# million should equity office opt for a rival bid the previous breakup fee was &# million both the timing of the increased bid and the substantial jump in price were clearly meant to deal a definitive blow to any other rival bids the revised offer also suggests that potential buyers for some of the properties blackstone later plans to sell down are offering extremely favorable prices blackstones real estate group has bought out eight public real estate companies in the past months in the u s and has never before had to deal with a competing offer after the deal was signed "we wanted to put an all cash deal on the table that shareholders could feel good about and which was sufficiently compelling to keep us on track for a shareholder vote on february th and closing on february th " a spokesman for blackstone said "our offer is clearly superior on price timing form of consideration and certainty " a vornado spokeswoman said "vornado is continuing to conduct its due diligence and will respond at the appropriate time " the culture of private equity giants like blackstone is built on two competing foundations the reluctance to lose any deal particularly one as big as this and an equal unwillingness to pay too much for any deal "the biggest risk today in private equity is high prices " blackstones mr schwarzman told a wharton school conference a week ago before jetting off to the middle east for a whirlwind fund raising tour "if you lose discipline and do stupid deals you get washed away " both sides in the battle earlier miscalculated the intentions of the other vornado entered into unsuccessful talks with eop months before blackstone ever appeared on the scene at a potential price far cheaper than the figures being thrown about today as securities and exchange commission filings show meanwhile blackstone executives never expected the vornado group to launch a rival bid according to people familiar with the matter now blackstone one of the worlds largest private equity firms must decide how desperately it wants the office buildings in the equity office portfolio the largest in the country the calculation comes at a time when office property values have never been higher contributing to the fraught nature of the bidding process blackstones real estate group headed by jonathan gray has grown up in the shadow of its much larger corporate buyout group the first fund was raised in the early s with a mere &# million when distressed properties could be bought at bargain prices from banks and other sellers since that time it has produced returns of about each year on an annualized basis according to stephen myers the retired chief investment officer of the south dakota investment council which has been an investor since the beginning mr myers notes that the blackstone fund has outperformed all others in the south dakota property portfolio mr gray has to convince the board of equity office that his all cash offer is far better than an offer that involves a large chunk of vornado stock most boards factor in a discount of anywhere from to when gauging bids that involve shares though vornados stock has risen a lot more than that in the past year mr grays offer for a quick and nearly certain close also favors blackstone in addition he has the luxury of having to talk with only eop while the rival group by contrast has to work out an agreement among three partners which include starwood capital group global llc and walton street capital llc each with different interests before sitting down with the equity office board blackstone has walked away from deals in recent months such as univision and clear channel when mr schwarzman and tony james president of blackstone decided that the price became unacceptably high but mr schwarzman hasnt built blackstone into the powerhouse it is today challenging the venerable kkr and other large private equity funds by drawing the line in the sand too conservatively last year when a kkr group jumped into the bidding for semiconductor firm freescale late in the game blackstone had no problem paying &# million more to keep the prize one of blackstones advantages in bidding against a group with less powerful connections than its private equity rivals is the strength of its financing it has signed up most of the financial heavyweights with the notable exception of j p morgan chase to its deal and while they all are barred from dealing exclusively with blackstone virtually all say privately that the chances they would help a rival group in this situation are virtually nil thanks to &# billion in various fees that blackstone dispenses to the banks annually blackstone is expected to put about &# billion of its own equity in the deal ryan chittum contributed
