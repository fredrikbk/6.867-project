weekend journal review film smokin aces is a thriller full of cheap tricks gore trumps drama seraphim falls runs dry in a vivid west when someone says in "smokin aces " that a las vegas mob boss wants a snitchs heart it is not a figure of speech that heart beating in the chest of a sleazy magician named buddy "aces" israel figures heavily in an otherwise heartless and ultimately brainless action thriller but calling joe carnahans movie heartless implies that this auteur of affectless anarchy might have meant to invest it with detectable human feelings and failed better to call it heart free and acknowledge the wisdom of mr carnahans self promoting semiliterate web site in which he says "dont let those douchebag critics scare you off i promise on the souls of my ancestors you will come out of that movie with at least one scene that youll never forget " possibly more than one the splatter of mutual snuffery in an elevator the grisly ventriloquism of a killer manipulating his dead victims face a monstrous child gone off his ritalin the souls of the filmmakers ancestors may be safer than our own for "smokin aces" is a vision nightmarish but far from unthinkable of a movie genre in which drama and character fuhgetabout character development have been banished by extravagant freakery cheerful degeneracy mind numbing logorrhea lip jerk profanity and serial spasms of murderous violence all framed in the sort of striking hollow images pioneered by fashion photography and music videos mr carnahan came to prominence four years ago with a darkly efficient little cop thriller called "narc " to give him his due on "smokin aces" the first word of the title is a gerund he applies lavish amounts of manic energy and perverse humor to an outwardly simple premise all sorts of unpleasant people want to kill buddy israel before the fbi whisks him away to protective custody the plot comes equipped with some intricate twists but they arent really dramatized rather theyre discussed and simultaneously illustrated in fragmentary music video style first to let us know what were going to see and at the finish to explain what weve seen this technique could suggest another failure if joe carnahan were actually interested in being a dramatist but the evidence of our eyes and besieged ears says otherwise hes a piler onner just as his web site contends he creates discrete though hardly discreet scenes for maximum impact then piles them on to build a movie his borrowings start most obviously with quentin tarantino and then a string of black british gangster comedy dramas but without the brits sharp wit and polished performances not that his performers couldnt deliver wit or polish if asked to the cast includes ray liotta alicia keys peter berg ben affleck jeremy piven andy garcia the rapper common and ryan reynolds only mr reynolds as an fbi agent named messner gets to play a character with an extra dimension it isnt heart but messner does bring a rationalists sensibility to the hopeless task of comprehending the chaos that surrounds him seraphim falls for a substantial chunk of its running time "seraphim falls" is a model albeit a bloody one of what filmmakers can do with modest resources the setting is classic western spectacular heavy snows in high altitude mountain forests the excellent cinematographer john toll shot this part of the story near taos new mexico at elevations of to feet and the plot is classic revenge drama stripped to its essentials gideon a desperate fugitive played impressively by pierce brosnan is being pursued by the pitiless carver liam neeson stone faced plus an ad hoc posse of carvers hired hands before long though things take a turn from simplicity to sententiousness then to surreal silliness and finally to a mano a mano contest on a parched desert floor over which man gets the best close ups the film is a debut feature by david von ancken who directed from a script that he wrote with abby everett jaques mr von anckens first claim to fame was "bullet in the brain " a poetic eerily elegiac short that streamed as original content on a video web site the central narrative device of this film is a clever one more than clever its an interesting investigation of moral ambiguity but not enough to sustain a whole story at the same time theres a too muchness of brutality though ive never seen pain and suffering portrayed more convincingly than when gideon uses a bowie knife to remove a bullet from his arm and cauterize the wound youre almost grateful for the silliness when anjelica huston shows up as a snake oil peddler whose nostrum according to the sign on the side of her wagon "cleanses the blood" and "exonerates the bowels " catch and release susannah grant who wrote "erin brockovitch " has directed as well as written her first feature "catch and release " this romantic comedy stars jennifer garner as gray wheeler a woman struggling to recover from the sudden death of grady her fiance the setting is a rocky mountain high boulder and its environs and the title refers both to fly fishing one of gradys passions and to grays predicament how to free herself from her love which must remain unrequited for a man about whom gray discovers she knew little but the drama is cluttered with not so comic housemates played blandly by kevin smith and sam jaeger and the film suffers from a style that settles for pleasant or touching at the cost of spontaneous or impassioned too bad because ms garner is a genuinely pleasing presence so is timothy olyphant as fritz an interesting option whos there for the taking juliette lewis plays a new age floozy and the film contains a running commercial for celestial seasonings teas dvd tip guy ritchie turned "lock stock and two smoking barrels" into a violent roundelay that throbs with scary energy startling characters almost all male and marvelous scabrous language the marginally fathomable plot involves an epic crooked card game a hunt for cannabis and large amounts of cash that keep changing hands the movie isnt nice but it certainly is nasty fun
