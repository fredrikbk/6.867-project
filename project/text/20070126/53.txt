judgment day jerusalem the israeli presidency is largely a ceremonial position and has only one real purpose to uphold the honor of the jewish state yet over the last six months as accusations of sexual crimes accumulated against him president moshe katsav resisted demands to resign insisting on his right to remain in office until being formally charged even though by tainting the presidency with scandal he has betrayed the jobs core requirement now with impending charges that include rape sexual harassment obstruction of justice and fraud he is being dragged out of office yesterday the knesset approved the presidents temporary suspension but not before mr katsav called a hysterical press conference in which he blamed the media the police and the attorney general for hounding him for israelis this is a time of near despair a former justice minister is on trial for sexual harassment leading tax authority officials have been arrested for fraud the finance minister is under investigation and any of a half dozen alleged financial scandals could topple prime minister ehud olmert "there is no judgment and no judge " israelis tell each other quoting a talmudic phrase with the looming threat of a nuclear iran and jihadist hamas and hezbollah pressing against its borders israel faces an internal challenge that is no less daunting than the external ones to recreate a society that is worth fighting for never before has israel faced greater dangers and never before has it been so bereft of trustworthy leaders the roots of israels ethical crisis go back ironically to the heroic founders of the state personally stoic the leaders of mapai the socialist party that led the state in its formative years created a culture of cronyism possession of a "red card " marking mapai membership was often a precondition for securing scarce employment cronyism was coupled with frontier recklessness under constant siege and overwhelmed with impoverished refugees israel created a culture of improvisation a bending of the rules with the countrys survival constantly in the balance israelis indulged the sexual improprieties of their military heroes prime minister david ben gurion defended the philandering general moshe dayan by noting that king david was also an adulterer but they knew their leaders were devoted to the nation the same can hardly be said about todays politicians who absorbed the wiles of the founders but not their self sacrifice perhaps the greatest threat to the political system today is a corruption of the spirit of leadership in refusing to accept responsibility for sullying the presidency mr katsav represents a new class of israeli leaders who reject accountability for failure though last summers war didnt achieve any of its objectives none of the architects of israels first military defeat admitted responsibility mr olmert continues to insist that israel won even though hezbollah has rearmed and israeli deterrence has been weakened by the very war that was intended to restore it true the army chief of staff dan halutz did resign last week but only to pre empt a call for his dismissal from a commission of inquiry investigating the war and without any admission of failure on his part it used to be different when avraham ofer housing minister in the first government of yitzhak rabin during the mid s was accused of corruption he shot himself leaving behind a note that insisted on his innocence while adding that he couldnt bear the shame and when the wife of prime minister yitzhak rabin was found to have kept a bank account in washington in violation of the law at the time forbidding israelis to hold foreign currency rabin took personal responsibility and resigned incomprehensible by todays standards corruption among israels leadership is arguably no worse than anywhere else but a nation facing immediate existential threats needs leaders who can inspire no citizen in the west makes the kind of sacrifices from compulsory military reserve duty to punishingly high taxes that israelis routinely endure to a large extent they endure those hardships willingly teenagers vie for every slot in elite combat units at times of national emergency even reservists who havent been called up volunteer for service israelis deserve a leadership worthy of their sacrifices the founders of zionism hoped to turn the jews into a "normal" people a nation like all other nations they envisioned a country maintaining normal international relations while creating an admirable society externally normalized internally exceptional given israels precarious status and the current state of its political culture that vision seems to have been reversed but the good news is that change is coming mr katsav after all is being brought to trial the plethora of sex related accusations against prominent israelis is an indication of a maturing society no longer indulging the excesses of its leaders with lt gen halutz gone mr peretz will almost certainly soon have to follow he will be forced to resign either by the commission of inquiry into the lebanon war or by a rebellion within the labor party which he currently heads finally mr olmerts own day before the commission of inquiry is approaching and so is a decision by the attorney general about whether to pursue criminal charges against him for financial improprieties there is judgment and judge after all mr klein halevi is a senior fellow at the shalem center and a contributing editor to the new republic
