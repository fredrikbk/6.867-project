politics &amp economics bushs budget will detail plans to slow spending on medicare treasury secretary says congress must step up nothing is off the table washington treasury secretary henry paulson said the bush administration will offer specific proposals to significantly slow growth in medicare spending in its new budget but that there is little he or the president can do to jump start the stalled effort to fix social security until republicans and democrats in congress are ready in an interview yesterday mr paulson said the budget for fiscal which begins oct will include a number of "incremental changes" to government health programs including some aimed at slowing the projected annual growth in medicare spending the budget is to be released on feb mr paulson wouldnt discuss details others say the savings expected to add up to &# billion over five years are expected to come mainly from squeezing health providers though some beneficiaries would be affected directly "when the budget goes up you will see a number of changes relating to medicare which are aimed at slowing the growth of these liabilities slowing the trajectory " mr paulson said mr paulson who took office six months ago said he is spending much of his time talking to members of congress about the urgency of restraining health costs and reducing the nations reliance on foreign oil restraining the costs of the medicare health insurance program for the elderly will help the white house show a budget that is balanced by the program cost about &# billion last year about of all federal spending without any changes the congressional budget office estimates it will cost &# billion by the proposals to save the government money on medicare complement president bushs plan to change the tax law to make employer provided health insurance taxable as income and to exclude &# of that income per family to encourage people to choose cheaper health insurance plans mr paulson said calling the proposal "a big idea " he said it is intended to advance the national conversation about health care and make americans better consumers of health care and thus restrain cost increases over time on social security mr paulson acknowledged that it may be hard to meet the presidents goal of fixing the long term finances of the governments retirement program given the "significant political differences and policy differences on what steps are to be taken " in his state of the union address mr bush said failure to put medicare medicaid and social security on strong financial footing "will one day leave our children with three bad options huge tax increases huge deficits or huge and immediate cuts in benefits " mr paulson said he has been reaching out to democrats and republicans in congress to start a discussion without any "preconditions " mr bush has pushed the notion of creating private accounts as part of a social security fix democrats have resisted mr paulson insisted nothing is off the table refusing for instance to rule out discussion of changes to the payroll tax "the key thing is to come together without preconditions " he said "its only fair that if youre going to have a bipartisan discussion you cant tell someone were not going to let you talk about your idea " in a fox news interview last week vice president dick cheney sounded a different tone saying that the president wants a discussion without "preconditions" but that "we dont believe a tax increase is necessary " those comments drew fire from democrats asked about mr cheneys remarks mr paulson said "the president has been very clear hed like people to come together without preconditions " cant force something mr paulson said even creating a path for his successor to solve the social security problem would be progress "we cant force something " he said "if we get fortunate there will be enough momentum and the leaders in both bodies of congress will work together and well craft a solution but if we dont hopefully if i do my job right if others do the things theyre doing well make progress well depoliticize this and it will be easier for someone sometime in the future to solve " the secretary an active environmentalist before coming to washington also emphasized the urgency of taking action to reduce the nations dependence on oil saying "one of the significant risks to our economy is imported oil" and said the solution lies primarily in reducing the reliance of automobiles on gasoline mr bush has called for a cut in gasoline consumption over the next years and would achieve that through new auto fuel economy standards and a mandate to use more ethanol and other alternative energy "this is aggressive " mr paulson said "by putting a mandate of that size out there i believe that is going to spur and i know the president does huge technological advances in investment " he said adding "if we can have of our transport fuel not come from oil that will make a big difference "
