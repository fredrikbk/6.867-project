if the cap fits washington this week officially welcomed the newest industry on the hunt for financial and regulatory favors big carboncap may have the same dollar sign agenda as big oil or big pharma but dont expect nancy pelosi to admit to it democrats want to flog the global warming theme through and theyll take what help they can get even if it means cozying up to executives whose goal is to enrich their firms right now the corporate giants calling for a mandatory carbon cap serve too useful a political purpose for anyone to delve into their baser motives the climate action partnership a group of major companies that made headlines this week with its call for a national limit on carbon dioxide emissions would surely feign shock at such an accusation after all their plea was carefully timed to coincide with president bushs state of the union capitulation on global warming and it had the desired pr effect the media dutifully declared that "even" business now recognized the climate threat sen barbara boxer who begins marathon hearings on warming next week lauded the corporate angels for thinking of the "common good " there was a time when the financial press understood that companies exist to make money and it happens that the cap and trade climate program these jolly green giants are now calling for is a regulatory device designed to financially reward companies that reduce co emissions and punish those that dont four of the affiliates duke pg&amp e fpl and pnm resources are utilities that have made big bets on wind hydroelectric and nuclear power so a kyoto program would reward them for simply enacting their business plan and simultaneously sock it to their competitors duke also owns cinergy which relies heavily on dirty co emitting coal plants but cinergy will soon have to replace those plants with cleaner equipment under a kyoto itll get paid for its trouble dupont has been plunging into biofuels the use of which would soar under a cap somebody has to cobble together all these complex trading deals so say hello to lehman brothers caterpillar has invested heavily in new engines that generate "clean energy " british petroleum is mostly doing public penance for its dirty oil habit but also gets a plug for its own biofuels venture finally theres general electric whose ceo jeffrey immelt these days spends as much time in washington as connecticut ge makes all the solar equipment and wind turbines at &# million a pop that utilities would have to buy under a climate regime ges revenue from environmental products long ago passed the &# billion mark and it doesnt take much "ecomagination" to see why mr immelt is leading the pack of climate profiteers ceos are quick learners and even those who would get smacked by a carbon cap are now devising ways to make warming work to their political advantage the "most creative" prize goes to steel giant nucor steven rowlan the companys environmental director doesnt want carbon caps in the u s oh no the smarter answer he explains would be for the u s to impose trade restrictions on foreign firms that arent environmentally clean global warming as foil for trade protectionism chuck schumers dream what makes this lobby worse than the usual k street crowd is that it offers no upside at least when big pharma self interestedly asks for fewer regulations the economy benefits theres nothing capitalist about lobbying for a program that foists its debilitating costs on taxpayers and consumers while redistributing the wealth to a few corporate players this is what comes from washington steadily backstepping energy policy into the interventionist s picking winners and losers in ethanol in biodiesel in wind farms success isnt a function of supply or demand the champs are the ones that coax out of washington the best subsidies and regulations global warming is simply the biggest trough yet both republicans and democrats understand this debate is increasingly about home state economics even as they publicly joust about environmental rights or wrongs the softening republican stance on a mandatory program is one result new mexicos pete domenici appeared to undergo an epiphany about global warming in voting for a senate resolution supporting caps the switch might have more to do with remembering that his state is nuclear power central and will win big under a new program just ask his fellow new mexican jeff bingaman who introduced the resolution economic interests also motivate those democrats who wont play nice the senators who have voted against previous bills represent those industries that will suffer most under mr immelts agenda louisianas mary landrieu oil montanas max baucus coal west virginias robert byrd ditto house energy &amp commerce chair john dingell remains a skeptic since the last thing his michigan auto makers need is yet another reason for people to not buy their cars which is fine with ms pelosi the democratic leadership ran out of the winners circle last november promising to tackle climate and much was made this week of madam speakers decision to wrest control of the debate away from mr dingells purview handing it instead to a new "select" committee on climate change but read the fine print the new vaunted committee will have no legislative authority but exists solely to hold hearings and to "communicate with the american people " ms pelosi and harry reid want to talk about this issue and talk and talk and talk but not necessarily anything more thats because democrats want global warming as an issue through with al gore getting his oscar nod theyve got a "problem" that captures the public imagination as well as an endless supply of cash from thrilled environmental groups no need to spoil it with a solution and a democratic president in would be more open to any ultimate legislation best yet theyve got the "support" of the business community or at least the savvier elements of it welcome big carboncap were likely to be hearing a lot from you we reintroduce today the weekly potomac watch column from washington it will appear on fridays and be written by
