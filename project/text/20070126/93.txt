the daily fix federer demolishes roddick williams sharapova to face off ouch roger federer beat andy roddick yesterday or wednesday or saturday or whatever the heck day it was in australia to advance to the finals of the australian open thats the headline the story its that federer destroyed mr roddick a brutal minute beatdown even federer used the d word and mr roddick agreed as these comments from his postmatch news conference make clear "it was frustrating it sucked it was terrible besides that it was fine " asked by some kindly reporter how hed sleep mr roddick replied "it depends on how much i drink " "if federer has ever played better it is hard to imagine and from late in the first set until early in the third he was simply breathtaking winning of points and straight games " writes linda pearce in the guardian adding that "roddick was hurt early by the quality of his approach shots volleyed horribly and could not compete from the baseline even his serve was punished indeed it was all so ugly for roddick that he threw his racquet in semi accidental rage and berated himself on court where was the hole a shovel please someone anyone certainly roddicks racquet was of no use " "maybe lynette federer told her little boy be sure and be home before dark roger " suggests bud collins in the boston globe adding that "federer confronted roddick and made him disappear ran him out of town while yesterday evenings sky was yet azure in broad daylight of what was billed as a night semifinal federer was the darkness that fell on his american rival like a shroud " sunday evenings mens final will pit federer against th seeded fernando gonzalez who got there by unleashing a little destruction of his own on tommy haas mr gonzalez has been playing sublime tennis but hell need to find yet another level in his game this weekend meanwhile tomorrows womens final will see serena williams battle maria sharapova a rematch of the australian open semifinal won by ms williams in a grueling battle in the international herald tribune christopher clarey writes that the st ranked ms williams is "enjoying the sharpest turn for the better in a career full of switchbacks there have been dark moments aplenty in the decade since she became the second member of her family to become a tennis star the divorce of her parents the murder of her half sister yetunde price the trials both literal and figurative that have helped take her eye off the ball and the games most prestigious trophies she concedes without offering details that she has had to wrestle her way through depression during the two years since she won the australian open in " now shes back fighting and mr clarey writes that "over the last days she has given the tennis world a six round reminder of what made her one of the most dominant figures in the history of the sport " sharapova williams may offer drama but si coms justin gimelstob says that will mask a serious problem "im going to take some heat for saying this but i cant be sensitive and ignore the truth womens tennis is in a very weak and desperate state " he writes "exhibit a serena williams will be competing for the australian open championship at a significantly compromised fitness level i dont mean to demean or belittle a courageous effort by serena its a tremendous personal accomplishment to find a way to advance to a grand slam final without any match preparation heading into the event however what is a credit to serena personally shouldnt be the standard of excellence for the wta tour " whats happened mr gimelstob writes that "the wta seems to be confronting a perfect storm of challenges the combination of injuries indifference and biological clocks going off all at the same time has created a power vacuum at the top of the game " last weekend the minnesota whitecaps of the western womens hockey league defeated the british columbia breakers in an impressive display of hockey by a team that includes three u s olympians and three others with national team experience then the whitecaps gathered to sign autographs for the fans feel good story right well kind of "so whats wrong with this picture " asks pat borzi in the new york times "the professionals part none of the women earned a dime for playing on the contrary whitecaps players paid up to &# each to play this season and they also had to pay for their equipment no one in the organization from general manager rick albrecht to the players to the team doctor draws a salary the team never practices because there is no money in the budget for the ice time players bunk four to a room on the road many have full time jobs and the coaches never know from night to night who will show up " if youre a woman this is what you have to do to play high level hockey after college olympian kristin king who hopes to play in the olympics tells mr borzi that if not for the whitecaps shed be playing pickup mens hockey in columbus ohio but there are rewards beyond getting to play and staying sharp "many preteenage girls in hockey uniforms who got in free as part of a promotion leaned over the glass and high fived players entering and leaving the ice between periods " mr borzi writes "those girls are why amber hegland a year old physical education teacher and the girls hockey coach at suburban wayzata high school skipped dinner and came to play saturday night the main reason is for the kids she said were trying to create something so they have an opportunity to play past high school and past college an opportunity that perhaps one day they will not have to pay for " on wednesday the nhl held an all star game for the first time in a long time s game was erased by labor strife while s was cancelled so players could take part in the winter olympics the western conference won thanks to six goals in the second period consolation for the east the buffalo sabres daniel briere was named mvp if youre a hockey diehard you already knew all that if you arent "there were goals scored in wednesdays nhl all star game " muses michael rosenberg in the detroit free press "i wonder how many were scored before most americans could figure out which channel the game was on my guess the all star game was on versus thats a cable network or so im told " the nhls post lockout troubles reaching a national audience in the u s are well known but mr rosenberg has a different complaint hockeys unbalanced schedule and its effect on local audiences like the detroit red wings "even hockey diehards who are as loyal as any fans in sports dont want to see the blue jackets twice in a week " he writes adding that "if the league cares only about todays buck it can stick with the unbalanced schedule which cuts travel costs and works well in certain markets like the northeast but that hurts tomorrows audience you cant sell young fans on the wonders of sidney crosby and alexander ovechkin if those fans never see crosby and ovechkin " at least they
