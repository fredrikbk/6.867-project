politics &amp economics energy mandates fuel a rift bushs proposal pits coal interests against environmentalists washington raising the federal mandate for using renewable and alternative energy sources may mean bigger government incentives for efforts to turn coal into diesel engine fuel but president bushs push for domestic alternatives to imported oil has ignited a battle between coal interests and environmentalists and underscored tension between the goals of increasing u s energy security and curbing global warming greater use of liquid fuels made from coal the nations most plentiful energy source would reduce reliance on imported oil but making the liquid fuels and burning them in automobile engines would release additional carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas thought to accelerate climate change environmentalists say the presidents proposal described in his state of the union address would require blenders of gasoline to include billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels by the energy law includes incentives for renewable fuels such as ethanol but not for alternatives such as coal based fuel james connaughton who heads the white house council on environmental quality says the presidents proposal is designed to "to create an opportunity for a variety of other approaches " which he said could include such fuels as methanol and diesel oil made from coal the goal he says is to create a technological horse race that will make it easier for promising ideas for alternative fuel to find investors currently there are no commercial size coal liquefaction plants in the u s while administration officials have assured coal industry lobbyists that coal to liquid fuels are embraced in the presidents proposal mr bush has kept the focus on more environmentally popular options such as corn based ethanol and ethanol produced from farm wastes including corn stalks but even before mr bushs speech leaders of environmental groups wrote lawmakers last week that they would oppose "any effort to support coal based transportation fuels " "the more you scratch this the dirtier it gets " says anna aurilio director of the washington office of the u s public interest research group she worries that oil made from abundant shale formations in colorado and utah might also get support environmentalists are backed by the ethanol industry which doesnt want the coal industry muscling in on a fuel mandate that ethanol producers now have to themselves the divergence over the fuel mandate opens up gaps that some politicians may find difficult to straddle sen barack obama an illinois democrat and white house hopeful is a sponsor of the coal to liquid fuel promotion act which provides more tax incentives and federal loan guarantees for companies interested in making coal based fuels mr obama also supports ethanol subsidies he has said that the nations continued use of fossil fuels such as coal is "condemning future generations to global catastrophe" posed by climate change tommy vietor a spokesman for the senator says mr obamas "vision" is that "any coal to liquids production would have to operate within the framework of a bipartisan senate proposal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across all major sectors of the u s economy " rep rick boucher a virginia democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee that will put together the package of fuel incentives says "i think coal to liquids should be a part of the mix of alternatives going forward " mr boucher who represents a coal mining area says that a process of deriving diesel oil from coal was used by both germany and japan during world war ii to make up for shortages of imported oil and may be the most proven alternative to gasoline coal companies say that problems for makers of ethanol based fuels render coal based fuels more competitive they see an annual production ceiling on corn based ethanol of about billion gallons annually above that point food experts say demand for corn will raise food and meat prices to unacceptable levels coal industry spokesmen also say that the technology to make ethanol from farm wastes called cellulosic ethanol hasnt been proven commercially vic svec a senior vice president for peabody energy corp the nations largest coal producer says the company already is scouting for sites to build a coal to liquid plants "we are very encouraged by the bipartisan support thats been expressed on this from president bush to senator obama " says mr svec who notes that governors and officials from southern states also support new incentives for coal based liquids bob dinneen president of the renewable fuels association which represents ethanol manufacturers says his group will fight to keep such alternative fuels out of any new federal mandate for renewable fuels "doing this ecumenical approach of all alternative fuels i think will just confuse the investment community " he says it isnt clear who will win the competition to produce new domestic fuels ethanol industry experts predict that at least two companies will commit to building cellulosic ethanol plants this year but dkrw energy llc of houston already has the permits and partners for a plant that makes diesel oil from coal that could begin production by robert kelley dkrws chairman says the facility will be built near medicine bow wyo and will produce barrels a day dkrw has two partners in the project arch coal inc which owns a nearby mine and sinclair oil corp which will market the diesel fuel mr kelley says the diesel oil produced wont harm the environment because the production turns the coal into a gas from which carbon dioxide will be removed and sold to oil companies and the oil companies will inject the carbon dioxide generated in the process back into the ground to produce more oil david hawkins a climate change expert for the natural resources defense council says the diesel fuel still contains carbon dioxide which will be released into the air when it is burned in the engines of cars and trucks "this issue is the classic example of why you need to have an integrated policy on both global warming and energy " he says
