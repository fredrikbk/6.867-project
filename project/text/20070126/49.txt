there is a glut of homes for sale prices are falling in some areas and demand has waned to make matters worse a large supply of condominiums is expected to hit the market within the year so naturally it raised eyebrows on wall street when carl icahn increased his stake in wci communities inc a home builder focused heavily on the sunshine state mr icahn the well known activist investor disclosed in a securities and exchange commission filing that he beneficially owns or million shares of the bonita springs fla company mr icahn also said in the jan filing that he intends to contact wci to discuss how to "unlock the inherent value" of its shares mr icahn isnt the only big name buying up shares or looking to improve wci a relatively small builder with a market value of about &# million which is known for its luxurious high rise condominiums the bill &amp melinda gates foundation disclosed in a sec filing on nov that it had bought a sizable number of shares this month hotchkis &amp wiley capital management llc a los angeles investment firm with more than &# billion under management disclosed in an sec filing that it owned of wci shares the firm said it wants to have "constructive

of for the dow jones u s home construction index which includes many large home builders at the end of its third quarter wci had a book value of about &# a share which is a rough measure of what the company would be worth if liquidated making it enticingly inexpensive so far many analysts who follow the company arent jumping on the wci bandwagon in fact most have "sell" or "neutral" ratings on the stock believing that wci will continue to be hurt by the oversupply of condos in florida and is more vulnerable than many other builders because of its relatively high debt level "when you get a guy like carl shaking the tree it cant hurt " said ubs analyst margaret whelan who is generally bullish on home builders but has a sell rating on wci "regardless you still have a lousy condo business because of the inventory overhang " ms whelan whose firm does business with wci doesnt own shares of the company nonetheless it is difficult to bet against an investor with a track record such as mr icahns his investment in the company is worth considering mr icahn couldnt be reached for comment but other investors said their investments in wci are largely driven by a belief the companys land has significant value such value could be realized if wci is sold for a premium or when the florida housing market improves wci said it purchased of its land between and which is before property prices skyrocketed wcis "land in southwest florida is irreplaceable " said josh spencer an analyst at t rowe price group inc which owns about shares of wci "it doesnt matter that the housing market is weak now if you have waterfront property in naples fla its like having office space in midtown manhattan " mr spencer has a "buy" rating on wci other analysts question the embedded value of wcis land even

could suffer a painful fate if a mass of buyers who put down deposits on condos several years ago decide to back out of their contracts at closing time wci warned that the number of defaults in the

defaults of condos and cancellations of typical single family homes which it also builds exceeded the total number of orders wci received for homes in the fourth quarter long term investors in wci believe that the companys defaults while increasing are still relatively low wci also required buyers of condos that are now under construction to put down an average deposit of about on units with an average sale price of &# million if a buyer walks wci typically keeps the deposit which helps minimize the companys losses and puts the unit back on the market "if things go well with the condo closings over the next six to nine months there is possibility for some upside " said jmp securities analyst alex barron who has downgraded his rating on wci to the equivalent of sell from hold "but that is a big if "
