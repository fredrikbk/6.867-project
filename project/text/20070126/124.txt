weekend journal the home front the chill at luxurys low end in &# million house sector sales tumble prices are flat fancy backsplashes lure few as the national housing market continues to weaken prices of homes in the &# million range are slumping in many parts of the country in once golden sunbelt cities like miami and santa barbara calif as well as in major midwestern cities like st louis and chicago prices fell in the fourth quarter of from a year earlier in some places by as much as in other areas prices rose slightly but appreciation was sluggish with gains of or less still analysts say the category is holding up better than the overall market which declined during the same period these are some of the results of an exclusive report done for the wall street journal by the national association of home builders "the million dollar market is slowing down " says nahbs director of research gopal ahluwalia who conducted the analysis using information from first american real estate solutions a santa ana calif data provider the report looked at sales of new and existing single family homes costing between &# and &# million in the nations top metro areas in s fourth quarter metro markets had or more sales in that price range a year later that figure had dropped by more than half to and appreciation was generally lackluster nearly half of those markets saw prices in this "starter luxury" market flatten or decline during the fourth quarter over the same period a year earlier in some areas by as much as overall the median price of these markets rose a modest to &# nationally median home prices during the same period fell to &# from &# the study showed the national association of realtors which tracks existing home prices only and will release its fourth quarter report feb is projecting that overall median prices will drop just to &# in the fourth quarter of nahb says its figures differ from those of nar because they use different geographical boundaries for their metropolitan areas and include data from both new and existing homes analysts say that the million dollar market is doing better than the overall market because it wasnt quite as overrun with investors during the boom "there were more buyers trying to move up rather than make a killing " mr ahluwalia says because investors make their money by reselling properties quickly theyre more likely to cut their losses and their prices as soon as they detect a market slowdown to be sure a million dollars today doesnt go as far as it did even a few years ago before residential real estate in many cities experienced double digit price increases during the boom michael patterson a sothebys real estate broker in santa barbara calif says that as recently as &# million would get you an oceanfront estate now it will get you a remodeled two bedroom house built more than a half century ago in dallas meanwhile it will buy a brand new four bedroom lakefront home it used to seem like a lot of money mr patterson says the entry point to luxury "it doesnt have the mystique that it used to " he says nor are todays million dollar home customers the same as those of five or six years ago then they tended to be cash rich buyers who were mostly immune to mortgage interest rate fluctuations but during the run up as more ordinary homes were pushed into the million dollar range those wealthy buyers moved up too to the "super luxury" level of &# million and above they were replaced by middle income buyers some of whom were hoping to cash in on the boom and who stretched to trade up using creative financing like option adjustable rate mortgages which allow borrowers to decide how much theyre going to pay each month and interest only loans now many are "stuck" with homes whose prices are flat or declining according to university of maryland business professor peter morici the sunbelt cities that attracted droves of buyers and builders during the boom have fared poorly overheated and overbuilt markets finally slowed down by the end of prices fell to &# in miami and flattened in phoenix at &# and in charleston s c at &# some midwestern markets also performed badly prices were down in chicago due in part to the loss of manufacturing jobs there things were even worse in st louis which lost jobs in the year ending november second nationally only to detroit prices in st louis were down the largest decline in the survey starter luxury homes are doing best in coastal cities where strong local economies support the incomes needed to buy them the studys highest price increase was in the santa ana anaheim irvine area of california which has seen a steady rise in employment over the past year particularly in the professional and financial services sectors and the highest wage increases in three years on the east coast fat year end bonuses at many wall street firms fed a buying spree in the suburbs of new york where prices increased almost as much to overall the survey showed a return to a buyers market in the million dollar range but in some places like san francisco where prices have remained high for years the overall median is &# compared with the median price of &# in the citys "million dollar" category buyers arent rushing in fatigued by years of fruitless house hunting they "cant quite believe" that the market has finally turned in their favor according to broker linda harrison vienna va housing economist tom lawler says buyer hesitation is also being fueled by the change in mentality from a speculative market to one based more on need during the boom many buyers bought the biggest house that they could because they saw that as a way to increase their investment in real estate without buying rental property but now that the market is softening that strategy no longer makes much sense lawyer beth joffe and her husband a physician recently sold their three bedroom chicago home for &# and have moved to a much smaller two bedroom condo in madison wis that they bought for &# though both are far from retirement age neither wants the hassle or added expense of a bigger place "we dont need that any more " ms joffe says agents say that in many cities the shifting psychology is causing sellers to reverse their tactics during the run up sellers usually priced their homes slightly above the market knowing that someone would buy them even if the price tag later had to be lowered somewhat now sellers are trying to undercut the market to sell while their listings are still fresh thats especially true in relatively new "semi custom" subdivisions where many homes though chock full of amenities like built in wine racks and tumbled stoned backsplashes tend to look alike in st louis steve shadrach has just listed his five bedroom brick and stone front home with a swimming pool which he bought more than two years ago for &# for &# if he finds a buyer at that price hell make a substantial profit but his asking price is nearly &# less than a nearby neighbor is asking for a nearly identical property and about &# less than what his builder is charging to build the same house "id like to price it higher but i have to compete with them " says mr shadrach a plastics salesman who wants to move closer to his grandchildren indeed a surfeit of new homes in central new jersey is partly responsible for the significant price declines in edison where prices of starter luxury houses fell in the fourth quarter from the year earlier coldwell banker has a &# listing of a "new" five bedroom brick house that was actually built in but interested buyers are few "people are going for less house " says joe thomas an agent with coldwell banker "theyre not stretching any more " in many parts of southern california prices are still on the upswing although analysts such as celia chen director of housing economics at moodys investor services economy com says the area is at "high risk" for a fall although the local economy is strong incomes havent kept pace with the sizzling double digit price increases these markets experienced from to and with federal regulators pressuring lenders to cut back on creative financing fewer buyers are able to stretch their incomes to buy million dollar homes thats what banker david jaffe discovered when he put his five bedroom stucco home in ventura calif on the market months ago for &# venturas prices are still rising they increased from to the study showed and mr jaffe attracted an offer close to his asking price soon after he listed it but the deal fell apart in escrow when the buyer couldnt qualify for the loan mr jaffe bought the place in april for &# in a bidding war and still hopes to find someone who will meet his asking price but he doesnt expect to see lines forming at his door especially since homes in his price range are affordable to fewer people and no longer have quite the cachet that they once did "the market is changing " he says "its definitely a buyers
