accident victims face grab for legal winnings wal mart paid bills for mrs shank then sued for money back jackson mo a collision with a semi trailer truck seven years ago left year old deborah shank permanently brain damaged and in a wheelchair her husband jim and three sons found a small source of solace a &# accident settlement from the trucking company involved after legal fees and other expenses the remaining &# was put in a special trust it was to be used for mrs shanks care instead all of it is now slated to go to mrs shanks former employer wal mart stores inc two years ago the retail giants health plan sued the shanks for the &# it had spent on her medical care a federal judge ruled last year in wal marts favor backed by an appeals court decision in august now her family has to rely on medicaid and mrs shanks social security payments to keep up her round the clock care "i dont understand why they need to do this " says mr shank on a recent visit to the nursing home between shifts as a maintenance worker and running a tanning salon "this girl needs the money more than they do " mrs shank who needs help with eating and other basic tasks spends more time alone since mr shank had to let her private caregiver go at some point he says she may have to be moved from a private to a semi private room in the nursing home where she lives the reason is a clause in wal marts health plan that mrs shank didnt notice when she started stocking shelves at a nearby store eight years ago like most company health plans wal marts reserves the right to recoup the medical expenses it paid for someones treatment if the person also collects damages in an injury suit until recently many employers didnt vigilantly enforce the provision and some states and federal courts didnt think the claim held water but as the cost of covering workers continues to escalate employers and health plans are getting more aggressive about going after the money a supreme court ruling last year also has given them a clearer legal map to suing employees and winning in insurance circles the recovery practice is called "subrogation " employers and insurers say its necessary to ensure that medical expenses arent paid twice by recovering those costs from someone whos been compensated elsewhere they argue theyre saving money for everyone on the plan sharon weber a spokeswoman for wal mart declined to discuss the details of the shanks case but said the company was obliged to act in the interest of the health benefits of its employees as a whole "while the case involves a tragic situation our responsibility is to follow the provisions of the company health plan which governs the health benefits of our associates " she said "employers are trying to make sure these plans run as efficiently as possible " says jay kirschbaum a senior vice president at global insurance broker willis group holdings "they also have a fiduciary duty to the plan and the entire group of employees that are covered by it " already the recovery practice is one of the variables that plaintiffs lawyers are considering as they decide whether its in their clients interests to participate in the &# billion offered by merck &amp co to settle lawsuits over its painkiller vioxx health plans recovered sizable amounts for medical expenses from other big product liability settlements such as for the "fen phen" diet drug combination and sulzer orthopedics hip implants many insurers and the employer plans they administer are expected to pursue a piece of the vioxx settlement in cases like the shanks where injuries and medical costs are catastrophic accident victims sometimes can be left with little or none of the money they fought for in court health plans are increasingly adopting language such as wal marts which dictates that it is to be paid first out of any settlement regardless of what remains for the injured person moreover the victim is responsible for all legal costs in pursuing the suit "its especially in the catastrophic cases that people are almost never fully compensated " says roger baron a professor of law at the university of south dakota and a specialist in health plan law "and then their health plan thats been collecting premiums from them all this time wants to take it away " such recoveries represent a tempting savings for insurers employers and union administered plans the american benefits council and americas health insurance plans the health insurer lobby estimate health plans recoup some &# billion a year in medical claims from accident settlements and other third parties a cottage industry of auditing firms benefit recovery specialists and subrogation lawyers help them they estimate that between and of health care spending is potentially recoverable from such claims "in the past employers used to think of this as an afterthought " says tom lawrence chief executive of memphis based benefit recovery inc whose clients include southwest airlines co and hospital chain hca inc hca says it saw annual savings from recouped claims rise to &# million in from just under &# in after hiring the firm benefit recovery contracts directly with employers it says its able to recover between &# and &# per health plan member a year up to &# million for a big plan with members by recovering medical expenses from injury suit settlements until recently employers and insurers generally didnt go after small claims but more sophisticated claims tracking has made it easier recovery companies systematically search claims for certain medical codes say a sprained ankle or head trauma that flag a potential accident claims examiners then mail a questionnaire and often follow up with calls if the injured person confirms it was an accident the firm tracks whether the patient files an injury suit if there is a lawsuit settlement employers may seek to recoup money they paid for medical expenses in many cases its relatively cut and dried often medical expenses are just a portion of the overall damages award or the accident victims attorney reaches a compromise with the health plan ahead of any settlement some plans are taking a further step refusing to pay claims in the first place unless the person filing the claim signs an additional form promising to reimburse the plan from settlement proceeds don burgett an engineer on an offshore oil drilling ship from texas has been waiting for his health plan to pay &# in medical claims since his daughters accident two years ago magan burgett then was thrown from the back of an all terrain vehicle in october tearing her liver breaking her jaw and fracturing her back soon after magans parents submitted the bills for her two week stay in an intensive care unit her fathers health plan the maryland based meba medical and benefits plan mailed him a reimbursement agreement that restated the plans rights to a potential settlement "to consider claims related to your accident " it said mr burgett had to sign it first when he didnt meba stopped paying claims after reimbursing several hundred dollars in magans medical expenses neal korval mebas outside counsel says that asking a plan member to sign a reimbursement agreement in such cases is standard procedure and a policy outlined in its health plan rules it helps prevent accident victims and their attorneys from trying to "freeze out" the plan from a potential settlement he says and also reminds or advises the plan member of his or her obligations in september the u s district court for the eastern district of texas sided with the burgetts ruling that mebas health plan summary which it considered the prevailing document didnt stipulate such conditions to pay a claim the burgetts attorney says they secured a &# accident settlement a net of &# after legal expenses though that isnt enough to cover magans medical expenses mr korval says meba has recently reached a settlement with the family over the unpaid medical claims but declined to disclose terms how much power health plans have to enforce subrogation is based on a hodgepodge of federal and state law still being tackled in the courts a pivotal supreme court ruling last year gave health plans a leg up in that case a maryland couple joel and marlene sereboff were injured in an accident while returning a rental car to an airport in they required &# in medical care the couple later received a settlement of &# from various parties related to the accident mid atlantic medical services now owned by unitedhealth group inc administered the health plan of mrs sereboffs employer and sued the couple when they refused to pay the company out of their settlement in a unanimous decision the court upheld that mid atlantic had the right to enforce its claim in large part because it could point to the settlement money set aside in an easily identifiable fund the couple had placed the money in a separate account when the issue went to court the decision has made it easier for plans to go after settlements legal experts say few such cases have attracted as much attention in legal circles as the shanks mrs shank took a job in stocking shelves at a wal mart store in cape girardieu mo she jumped at the shift from p m to a m so that she could spend days at home with her three sons mr shank says after a probation period she qualified for benefits under the wal mart health plan in february one day about three months later as she and a girlfriend were touring local yard sales a semi trailer truck plowed into the drivers side of her minivan her friends injuries were minor but mrs shank suffered major brain trauma and spent the next several weeks in intensive care she drifted in and out of a coma and the hospital for months "one doctor didnt give her any chance " says mr shank a maintenance worker at southeast missouri state university her medical bills climbed past &# the health plan paid them promptly "they were terrific in that respect " he says it also sent mr shank several notices that he was to inform wal marts health plan before he settled any suit in the shanks did sue and won a settlement from g e m transportation inc owner of the truck the firm had only &# million in liability coverage though for his own losses mr shank received &# of which &# remained after legal expenses he says he spent most of it toward a one story house fitted with ramps and wider doors which is more accessible than the familys previous three level home mrs shanks own settlement was &# after legal expenses and attorney fees the remaining &# was placed in a court created special trust designed specifically for mrs shanks future care the shanks lawyer maurice graham wrote the wal mart health plan informing them mrs shank had received no funds directly he said and therefore had nothing to pay wal mart back nearly three years went by mr shank says before they heard again from wal mart mrs shank struggled a year rotating in and out of the hospital and rehabilitation programs she could no longer use her right arm or three fingers on her left hand because of neurological damage she couldnt feed or dress herself and conversations with her family were limited to all but simple questions eventually her husband moved her to a nursing home for around the clock care medicare and medicaid pay for the nursing home mr shank used some of the trusts proceeds to continue paying a private aide to care for her there "we wanted her to have a decent quality of life and we still had the money " he says he hoped he could also use it to pay the roughly &# in bills for mrs shanks rehabilitation and a return hospital visit after her coverage expired but in august wal mart re emerged with a lawsuit against the shanks demanding repayment for &# in medical costs out of their settlement it charged that the shanks had violated the terms of the health plan by not reimbursing it the company also demanded payment of legal fees and interest for the cost of suing the shanks for the money mr graham the shanks attorney says he approached wal marts attorneys about negotiating a compromise but was told the health plan wanted to proceed with the lawsuit "were not contending that wal mart isnt entitled to a payment were saying theyre entitled to one based on equity " he says since mrs shank wasnt fully compensated for her damages in the first place he argues wal mart should also expect only partial reimbursement administrators of employer financed health plans "have an obligation to participants to be impartial " the wal mart spokeswoman says "virtually all health plans include subrogation provisions as a way to control health plan costs " in august last year u s district judge lewis blanton sided with wal mart ruling that when mrs shank signed on to wal marts health plan she was obligated to abide by its terms the ruling came six days before the shanks year old son jeremy was killed in september last year in iraq shortly after he arrived in the u s armys th infantry division "i wanted to give up at that point tell wal mart they won " mr shank says but his lawyer mr graham said hed continue with appeals mrs shank went to jeremys funeral but because of memory problems due to her injuries she gets confused about what happened on a recent morning she cried several times and asked what had happened to her middle son mr shank says that he obtained a divorce from mrs shank this year partly because of advice from a health care administrator that she might be more eligible for public aid as a single woman mrs shank who has been declared incompetent by a court hasnt been informed of the divorce by her family the shanks lost an appeal before a three judge panel in the th circuit court of appeals in august and last month were denied a request for a hearing before the entire court they plan to appeal to the u s supreme court though only a small percentage of cases are chosen to be heard "sometimes i want to tell wal mart ok you won on the principle but just let us keep the money " mr shank says
