deep six the law of the sea the law of the sea treaty which awaits a ratification vote in the u s senate declares most of the earths vast ocean floor to be "the common heritage of mankind" and places it under united nations ownership "for the benefit of mankind as a whole " this treaty has been bobbing in the legislative ocean for the past years after president ronald reagan refused to sign it in repeated attempts at ratification have failed last month however the senate foreign relations committee voted to send it to the full senate where a two thirds majority is required to ratify whats at stake are trillions of tons of vital minerals such as manganese nickel copper zinc gold and silver enough to supply current needs for thousands of years spread over vast seabeds constituting of the planets area senate ratification would signify u s agreement that the international seabed authority a u n agency based in jamaica should own these resources in perpetuity why should we agree to this like any other hard to reach resources these undersea minerals are completely valueless where they now rest what is it that makes such resources actually valuable it is the thinking and action of inventors engineers explorers and entrepreneurs who devote their mental energy to the task of finding and retrieving them these undersea pioneers dont just find wealth they create wealth by bringing a portion of natures bounty under human control despite the treatys allusion to seabeds as the "common heritage of mankind " mankind as a whole has done exactly nothing to create value in the deep ocean which is a remote wilderness virtually unexploited under the proposed treaty however the ocean mining companies whose science exploration technology and entrepreneurship are being counted on to gather otherwise inaccessible riches are treated as mere servants of a world collective in practice under the treatys explicitly socialist approach mining companies operate as mere licensees who must render hefty application fees as well as continuing payments read taxes and obtain prior approval at every stage of work under regulations that emerge sluggishly from multinational committees licensees must also enrich a u n operated competitor called spookily enough "the enterprise " for every square mile of ocean bottom a licensee explores half must be relinquished to the enterprise free of charge and the enterprise gets to pick the better half licensees must also make available on so called reasonable commercial terms their technology and know how and even train this giant competitors personnel at the end of the day profits from the enterprise along with taxes from licensees are distributed to u n member nations such as cuba uganda and venezuela who contribute nothing to the productive process the treaty simply assumes as a self evident truth that wealth sharing is the moral duty of the haves toward the have nots and that the worlds needy nations have a moral claim on the wealth created by undersea miners but we should pause to challenge both that moral assumption and its legal implications morally undersea mining operations are entitled to own outright those portions of the ocean floor they exploit by virtue of the productive effort they expend producers in general are morally entitled to live and work for their own sake keeping the wealth they create without any moral debt to those who didnt create it because nature requires us to be productive in order to live the businessmans pursuit of profit is properly regarded as a virtue not a vice indebting him to a hungry planet legally this viewpoint is embodied in the american ideals of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness secured by private property rights a historical example of the proper principle in action is the homestead act of farmers acquired property rights i e private deeds to million acres of fertile midwest prairie land by the productive act of farming it parcel by parcel suppose instead that the u s government had issued only licenses not deeds for the acreage those farmers carved out of wild prairie land then suppose the government had transferred half that hard won acreage to "the farm " a giant government owned competitor whose field hands the farmers would be expected to equip and train of course such a travesty would have been unthinkable in the relatively capitalistic th century governments today have legitimate options regarding how to deal with undersea explorers need to establish property rights in the deep ocean but it would be totally improper for america to declare eternal hostility to private property in the ocean floor by ratifying a treaty dedicated on principle to denying such rights mr bowden a former attorney and law school instructor is an analyst focusing on legal issues at the ayn rand institute see related letter "letters to the editor environmental peril posed by law of the sea treaty" wsj november
