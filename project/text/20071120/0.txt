a cultural conversation with ian mcewan hes not macabre any longer new york for a man whose many novels have explored violence obsession sexual deviance and devastating loss ian mcewan turns out to be a pleasant low key fellow off the page at least thats how he appeared on a recent visit to manhattan dressed in a casual charcoal gray jacket and rumpled slacks he slumps a bit in his hotel room chair as he responds to questions answering each one reflectively frequently quoting the likes of seneca henry james and wallace stevens as he finishes his thoughts his voice tails off until its almost inaudible he waits patiently for the next query sometimes glancing away perhaps mr mcewan has mellowed since "atonement " his historical novel published here in his works have been far less dark or perhaps considering that a teacher once described him as "hopelessly shy " he has actually grown in exuberance however limited it remains either way mr mcewan has reason to be in a great mood at age he ranks among the greatest writers of his generation probably the best of the british contenders he was a heavy favorite this year for the booker prize for fiction for "on chesil beach " a slim novel that quickly climbed the best seller lists last summer and narrowly missed repeating his win in for "amsterdam " "atonement " commonly considered to be his masterpiece is now a movie starring keira knightley and james macavoy he recently completed the libretto for an opera by his friend michael berkeley called "for you " which centers on a year old composer whos fading both professionally and sexually mr mcewans angular face and wispy hair are familiar to readers though he says "the rare people who come up to me are very tentative and extraordinarily polite and they say they just want to tell me what a wonderful book ive written and theyre gone " when "atonement" opens here on dec his audience is sure to expand thats what happened after the film debuted in britain in september "it went to no " mr mcewan says expressing astonishment probably because movies of his earlier works "the cement garden " "enduring love " "the innocent" and "the comfort of strangers" were smaller affairs and somewhat disappointing unlike many literary authors who shudder at the damage moviemakers can do to a book mr mcewan has made his peace with film "atonement " he says is "visually splendid " "well cast and beautifully performed " and "in no way an affront to the book " but he adds "this is a very interior novel and thats one thing movies cant do " mr mcewan has written screenplays including one for "the innocent " but films are controlled by the director not the author he says so hed rather spend the three years it takes to do a movie writing a novel for "atonement " he took the title of executive producer had "endless meetings" with scriptwriter christopher hampton director joe wright and producer tim bevan and made a few visits to the set especially for the world war ii scenes at dunkirk then he went back to his work about which lets clear up a few things he dislikes the "ian macabre" tag bestowed on him for his early works "it went on for long after it was relevant " he feels "and the awful thing was that each writer thought he had discovered it " he concedes that "it was reasonably well earned at the time those stories were very dark and im not sure where they came from " then he continues "they were a young mans extravagant pessimism which can be delicious the world is so fresh and solid and you think it could use a bit of shaking up im part of the generation that grew up in prosperity our parents were desperate for ordinary lives because theyd seen the chaos whereas we saw nothing but advances in personal wealth and freedom so we could imagine the worst things " in any case his writing had the desired effect "it was a young mans insistence on being noticed " he says but soon critics started using another bit of somewhat irritating shorthand to describe mr mcewans widely varied writing the notion that each of his works hinges on a single moment that changes everything "atonement " for example pivots on a young girls misperception of and subsequent testimony about a crime "saturday " his post novel turns on the accidental run in between a neurosurgeon and a thug "on chesil beach" revolves around a dysfunctional honeymoon night "all it really says is that in my novels something happens " mr mcewan tells me "it got said and then it got into the loop its a truism really its true of any novel " mr mcewan believes in the power of literature to wreak change and cites as one example not only the life of salman rushdie but also the violence and deaths his works spawned "and i remember going to eastern europe during communism how important literature was in peoples lives and to the regimes to suppress it " on a lighter note mr mcewan says that at one appearance in a rome bookshop he had four couples come up to him with their seven children in tow to say theyd met because of his books "a guy on a bus would see a girl reading enduring love and go up to her " he says "great i thought im providing brilliant pickup lines " though mr mcewan declined to do an american book tour for "on chesil beach" visiting only new york and is doing little to promote the "atonement" movie he accepts many public demands on his time on this trip to the u s he visited princeton university for a public reading participated in the new yorker festival and taped an interview for borders books "i wont do this all the time " he says "i find it impossible to simultaneously occupy public space and private space its fine to talk and i like to give readings and the students at princeton more than engaged me but being in public is contrary to the currents necessary to generate writing i do feel desperate after a while desperate to reclaim some silent core to myself " no wonder given the past few years mr mcewans messy divorce in from his first wife which caused continued custody problems and led to a court ordered gag order on her made headlines for years in belittling his reputation for meticulous research londons evening standard noted a "howler" of a mistake in "saturday" it mentioned a mercedes s with a fourth gear but the cars strictly an automatic "then the tabloids erected a feeble case of plagiarism " mr mcewan continues charging him with borrowing too heavily for "atonement" from a wartime memoir he had already noted in his acknowledgments early this year when word broke that he had an unknown brother who was given up for adoption six years before mr mcewan was born the headlines blared again so far the celebrity culture hasnt had much effect on his writing "though one could write a comic novel about it " he says "its so fitful and omnivorous one minute its on you and then its gone and its on someone else " and it does bring readers mr mcewan believes that "more literary fiction is being read now than it used to be" even if mainstream culture is "stupid and gross and hysterical " when he started people thought literary fiction was for a distinct minority of people he says rather like "trout fishing or barn raising " he credits the booker prize as one factor that changed that mr mcewan proclaims himself to be a "great lover" of american culture "but i only take away little bits of it " he says "im not great on pop culture " rather in tune with his lifelong love of music he plays the flute when he visits the u s he frequently spends his evenings at jazz or blues joints his taste runs to john coltrane miles davis bebop and music through the early s including rock n roll for all his range mr mcewan has never set a novel in the u s "i might do it one day " he muses probably set around new york "theres something positive that appeals to me about american culture " he says launching into a story about a visit he and his wife made last november on veterans day to revolutionary war sites in lexington and concord with john updike and his wife "there were hundreds if not thousands of people about and i noticed how many muslims there were " he says "thats something weve not achieved in britain or the rest of europe i tip my hat to that part of american culture " ms dobrzynski based in new york writes frequently about arts and culture
