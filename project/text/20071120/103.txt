the morning brief asset manager vs lobbyist a fight over information online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here an asset management company is suing a washington lobbying firm over the defection of a key employee in a case that underscores the high value of good information the problem began when katie simons pahner who worked for asset manager marwood group left to work for health policy source as the hill reports marwood advises hedge funds mutual funds and institutional investors health policy source carries out the capitol hill agendas of the american medical group association the american society for anesthesiologists and their ilk that includes the more obvious duties of influencing legislation and legislators but another key lobbyist duty these days is the gathering of inside information something the hill notes is the "currency of washington " marwood co owned by edward kennedy jr son of the senator and brother of rep patrick kennedy clearly valued the services of ms pahner who had previously worked at the centers for medicare and medicaid services she had become a vice president at marwood though she had worked there for roughly one year and it was only her second employer after graduate school so marwood sued claiming ms pahners hiring by health policy source violated the two year non compete and non disclosure clauses of her contract it seeks &# million and punitive damages health policy source responding to federal suits filed in both washington and new york argues its lobbying activities dont compete with marwoods investment advising and thats where the story gets interesting the marwood cases "rest on its assertion that pahners activities collecting information about pending healthcare legislation and regulation for marwoods clients is materially the same as the work she performs for her new employer " as the hill explains federal regulations can significantly affect business and even news of disputed legislation can move markets whatever a bills chances of making it to the presidents desk marwoods work for its investors and health policy sources toil for lobbying clients can in theory make them rivals in the realm of political intelligence health policy source says they share no clients an assertion difficult to verify since marwood unlike a lobbying firm doesnt have to disclose its clientele and as the hill points out one health policy source client the stanford washington research group does compete with marwood the hill emphasizes what the dispute says about the legal gray area of non compete clauses in this environment but the case also shows how valuable authoritative news gathering is at a transformative time for another industry the news media as the traditional media compete with bloggers and countless other sources of online news for readers attention and as their corporate parents and wall street try to figure out the best way to sell and price journalism its something to think about a turning point in pakistan pervez musharraf imposed the state of emergency on pakistan ahead of what seemed a possible supreme court invalidation of his reelection as president while he was also heading the military now that a newly recomposed court has confirmed his election and in light of the critical response his antidemocratic actions brought from the international community he may be switching tactics the interior ministry today said more than people detained under emergency rule including lawyers human rights activists and members of the opposition party led by benazir bhutto have been released it wasnt clear how many remained in custody or whether ousted supreme court judges were still under house arrest later however police detained about journalists after clashing with them during a protest over press restrictions in karachi and detained journalists after they tried to hold a rally in the southern city of hyderabad the associated press reports gen musharraf also left the country nominally on a trip to saudi arabia which has played a quiet but important allied role for the general since he seized power in a bloodless coup in most prominently it took in ousted prime minister nawaz sharif and let him live there in palatial comfort twice the presence of mr sharif most recently deported again this fall prompted speculation that mr musharrafs visit was aimed at meeting with one of his most recalcitrant political opponents both men denied this the political damage wrought by the state of emergency makes it even harder for gen musharraf to find common ground with almost all pakistani factions beyond the military and the fact that he left the country at so momentous a stage in events there suggest he at least feels comfortable that the military remains loyal to him sympathetic gazprom slams liberalization gazprom the russian gas monopoly is worried about european consumers gazprom chief executive alexander medvedev told reporters today that the european unions plans to open up the continents market for natural gas could lead to sharply higher prices the wall street journal reports "liberalization doesnt work in such infrastructural industries as power generation and especially gas " he said dismissing the eu proposals as "very raw like sashimi " at a time when russia has played an increasingly dominant role in european energy supply gas pipelines and pricing have become a major source of contention with its neighbors to the west but not the only one also today president vladimir putin suggested nato has been increasingly aggressive near the russian border though it wasnt clear what he meant and that the kremlin wouldnt take such aggression lying down "in violation of previous agreements military resources of nato members are being built up next to our borders of course we cannot allow ourselves to remain indifferent to this obvious muscle flexing " mr putin told a meeting of top military officials itar tass reports via the associated press nationalist rhetoric in russia has been on the rise ahead of parliamentary elections and mr putin was also quoted as saying russia would increase the combat readiness of its strategic nuclear forces to ensure a "swift and adequate response to any aggressor "
