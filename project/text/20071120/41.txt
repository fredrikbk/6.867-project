court where united rentals sued yesterday to compel cerberus to complete the deal the move surprised both united rentals shareholders and cerberus bankers who expected the deal to close nov cerberuss termination of the deal coupled with turmoil in some of its other investments shows how even wall streets most respected names are being battered by upheaval in the credit markets and economy at large the ordeal is a turnabout for cerberus which had spent years distancing itself from its once bare knuckle image in the summer it earned kudos for how it handled the tricky financing of its chrysler buyout its earlier purchase of general motorss financing arm gmac was a sign that it had truly arrived life in the big leagues has proved tough cerberus declines to explain why it backed away from united rentals a slate of investments related to the subprime mortgage business have proved difficult compounding matters is the fate of a &# billion sale of bank loans tied to the chrysler deal which

billion cerberus int ltd fund run by cerberuss founder mr feinberg was up about through august according to investors a lot has changed in the markets since then last year when cerberus led a consortium of investors to acquire for &# billion a stake in the gm unit the profits made by gmacs mortgage arm helped make it a solid contributor to gms bottom line soon after the closing of the deal in november the u s home loan industry went into a tailspin with home sales slowing mortgage defaults soaring and credit for lenders tightening this month gmac financial services posted the largest quarterly loss in its year history because of a &# billion third quarter loss at residential capital llc its home lending unit known as rescap investors and analysts say cerberus as well as gm would

bank lenders its failure to meet the requirements landed it in bankruptcy court according to filings aegis owes &# million to the banks including rescap that provided it with short term credit and &# million to cerberus as for the united rentals deal other buyout firms have also recently sought to pull out of transactions citing credit market turmoil or concerns about a target companys financial performance but united rentals stands out because it was negotiated after credit market problems first appeared furthermore united rentals financial results have been strong and companys last quarter
