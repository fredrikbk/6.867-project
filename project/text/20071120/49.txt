fannie mayhem chuck schumer is lucky congress ignored him were referring to the new york senators idea which he has loudly promoted for months that fannie mae and freddie mac should ride to the rescue of the housing market by buying up unwanted mortgages and guaranteeing them now those two mortgage giants are themselves under scrutiny amid concerns that theyll report big losses last week fortune magazine reported that fannie had adjusted how it reports troubled mortgages in order to better meet its own projections fannie claims the accounting change was legitimate but its explanations so far have done little to stem investor anxiety and whether you believe the new lower numbers or the old higher ones delinquencies in fannies portfolio are rising fast this matters because fannie and freddie owing to their special status as "government sponsored" mortgage securitizers operate with a relatively small capital base fannie reported earnings for the first three quarters of this year on november bringing its financial information up to date for the first time since it was hit with an accounting scandal in according to those figures fannie has a capital base of &# billion supporting a &# trillion book of business including more than &# trillion in mortgage backed securities it has guaranteed and sold to the public and over &# billion more in mortgages it is holding on its balance sheet that high degree of leverage means it would take only a small movement in the value of its assets to cause serious problems at the same time new york attorney general andrew cuomo has launched a probe into the appraisal practices of banks selling loans to fannie mae whether theres any substance to the charge that the appraisals were inflated remains to be seen and fannie has said it is cooperating with the investigation but any suggestion that fannies mortgages might be less safe than advertised is bound to cause jitters in the current environment freddie mac reports results today and one analyst has already penciled in a &# billion write down given these question marks its hardly surprising that the companies stocks have been under pressure with fannies down some from its august highs that was the period when investors began to believe their political troubles were over and that mr schumer and house financial services chairman barney frank would even expand their ability to make government subsidized profits lets hope that delusion has now passed the questions around their earnings and accounting suggest that fannie and freddie need to attend to their own problems rather than pose as white knights for housing in order to grab mortgage market share if these two mortgage giants get into trouble the people stuck with rescuing them will be the taxpayers which is what some of us have been warning about all along
