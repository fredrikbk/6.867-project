the game the deal story of will the u s get lboed china and the gulf states are hungry and theyve just sat down for an american buffet in the last few months alone state affiliated funds and companies have taken bites of american icons picking up small stakes in advanced micro devices mgm mirage nasdaq stock market blackstone group and bear stearns the deals were designed to be small enough to avoid scrutiny from the u s government this conveniently played into the hands of sellers who were able to offload pricey positions while giving virtually nothing in return such as board seats or veto rights but the mergers and acquisitions story of will be how these foreign sovereign funds sitting on an estimated &# trillion to &# trillion of reserves direct their appetites fattened by the u s s own trade imbalances and encouraged by favorable currency rates they arent likely to stay so compliant for long further down the buffet line sit entire u s companies seven sovereign funds including those of abu dhabi kuwait china singapore and russia now sit on piles greater than &# billion outside the u s these funds have proven more adventuresome with a dubai company recently moving to take ownership of the airport in auckland new zealand this foreshadows some uncomfortable economic and cultural reckonings for the u s the modern gamesmanship of corporate interests is beginning to look more like "the great game" of national interests where capital as much as armies can be deployed for strategic effect and on this field of play the u s looks caught off guard not unlike the cocksure olympic basketball squad run out of the gym by ostensibly weaker teams "when governments act in this field the motives are different " says deszo j horvath dean of the schulich school of business at canadas york university "the motives are longer term security issues which can have nothing to do with current economics " sen evan bayh captured the new concerns at a congressional hearing last wednesday "the definition of national security interest is broader than it used to be " he said "youll see the chinese going around the world acquiring what they view as strategic energy interests and it is not impossible that financial positions might be used in a similar vein " thats why this incoming wave of foreign money will reveal more about the u s than about countries initiating the deals laws overseeing foreign investments were just given a much needed overhaul but at its core the issue is as much about emotion and pride as it is about process says ivan schlager a partner in the washington d c office of skadden arps who handles cross border transactions foreign investments touch a nerve especially when so much american economic power appears at the mercy of china which holds u s treasury bills or the gulf states which have such a big say over u s energy costs for foreign buyers have accounted for of m&amp a in the u s according to dealogic the second highest level since "we have not fully grasped what is happening here and we have no counterstrategy " said patrick mulloy washington representative of the alfred p sloan foundation a group studying technology business and economics can the u s accept the foreign investments as an essential element for lubricating a dynamic economy tighter economic ties create less incentive for war and terrorism and below the radar a recent series of foreign investments have closed without incident "no one raised serious objections when sabic a state owned saudi arabian company bought ge plastics in a competitive auction are we culturally ready were a very welcoming and open society " adds mr schlager until its not already the country has proven touchy famously fretting when a japanese businessman overpaid for the pebble beach golf resort back in or when a dubai backed company looked to take over a series of u s ports in setting off a talk radio furor that squelched the deal its easy to find conspiracies in these governmental funds in part because they have such little transparency the group of seven leading nations recently called upon the international monetary fund and world bank to study ways to improve disclosure and accountability with a weak dollar and the ever enriched positions of petro based economies its inevitable that the worries will continue to stew and its inevitable that they will one day interfere with a big sovereign fund investment plan the irony is the u s is in essence funding its own potential takeover in wall street parlance they call it getting lboed "were moving to a sharecropper economy " said mr mulloy in an interview "the other guys are going to be owning and were going to be working for them " email dennis berman wsj com for a daily comprehensive look at the world of deals visit wsj com deals
