whats the matter with georgia the south caucasus the three nations of armenia azerbaijan and georgia have always been the "lands in between " between the black and caspian seas europe and asia russia and iran christianity and islam and more recently between soviet authoritarianism and european democracy in the past few years the positive gloss on the record of these post soviet countries is that with georgia taking the lead the region was shrugging off the russian yoke and making the transition toward democracy and prosperity all three have posted impressive double digit economic growth rates the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline opened last year put the region on the map and made it an important transit corridor for caspian energy resources georgias peaceful "rose revolution" was perceived to have made it a beacon of democracy and an example to its neighbors if only this region could sort out its so called "frozen conflicts " the optimists said it could become a progressive hub in the emerging greater black sea region the broken heads and tear gas canisters on the streets of georgia this month suggest a reality much bleaker far from moving forward the south caucasus is better seen as being in nowhere land bogged down in a state of semi democracy and instability which outsiders are incapable of pulling it out of georgias young president mikheil saakashvili badly tarnished his democratic image on nov when he sent in riot police to break up peaceful opposition protests with truncheons tear gas and water cannon he then pulled off the air two pro opposition television channels one of them owned by rupert murdoch and imposed a state of emergency which was lifted last friday he subsequently called early presidential elections for january the contrast to the way mr saakashvili himself came to power was painful the "rose revolution" that he led in succeeded because his predecessor eduard shevardnadze though demonized as an autocrat showed admirable restraint mr shevardnadze facing much bigger protests decided not to use force or to shut down an opposition television station and resigned with dignity despite recent events georgia is still the most democratic place in the south caucasus and it is still possible though unlikely that mr saakashvili will respond to pressure and form a more pluralistic coalition government in the new year the other nations have retreated further from democracy armenias main opposition television station a+ was closed years ago azerbaijani authorities have imprisoned numerous anti government journalists this year the latest is ganimat zahidov editor of the leading opposition newspaper azadliq he was sentenced to two months pre trial detention on unlikely charges of "hooliganism" on nov in armenia and azerbaijan everyone expects that the ruling elite will do all it can to hang on to power in next years presidential elections the polls will go ahead but the results are pre ordained leaders in the caucasus have taken to heart vyacheslav molotovs maxim "the trouble with free elections is that you stand a chance of losing them " strong economic growth figures also fail to give the full picture certain social groups in the capitals have done well while unemployment and rural poverty remain extremely high the economies of the region are heavily monopolized with politically connected cronies reaping most of the rewards billions of dollars of oil wealth are beginning to flow into azerbaijan but the benefits are so far not trickling down to society as a whole most worryingly "frozen conflicts" dating back to the chaotic days of the soviet unions collapse in are far from frozen all three countries have some of the fastest growing defense budgets in the world and stubborn intransigence to match georgia and russia are playing irresponsible brinkmanship over abkhazia and south ossetia the two breakaway regions of georgia increasingly under moscows control azerbaijan is upping the belligerent rhetoric over its lost territory of nagorno karabakh while armenia simply declares the problem solved and says that the karabakh armenians have seceded the chance of some kind of armed flare up in at least one of these conflict zones in the coming year is disturbingly high the consequences could be catastrophic at least three pockets of turbulence ahead threaten to bring new instability in december kosovo may well declare unilateral independence and be recognized by a number of foreign states whatever western governments choose to say this will strengthen the confidence of the caucasian separatist territories that time is on their side and that the facts on the ground will eventually be recognized in perpetuity in the georgian case moscow will choose to exploit this and give even greater support to abkhazia and south ossetia while tbilisi may respond foolishly georgia has become an object of detestation amongst the russian elite and two sets of elections imminent in russia will also encourage populist politicians to engage in even more aggressive georgia bashing the russian military has made at least three covert air incursions into georgia in the last year thankfully without any casualties more overt intervention to provoke the georgians could trigger a dangerous showdown between the two countries the last event on the horizon is the one that worries russia the most natos april summit in bucharest the u s has been leading the push for georgia to be given a membership action plan at the summit which could lead to its eventual accession to the alliance the georgians see nato membership as their best guarantee of independence from russia moscow wants to stop this from happening at all cost the georgia in nato issue is deeply political and needs to be handled very carefully if you tell the georgians that their country is too turbulent to deserve nato accession you virtually hand a carte blanche to russia to destabilize the situation further and prove the merits of that argument but to put georgia on a fast track into nato is equally irresponsible the alliance should not be expected to absorb a country that has two unresolved conflict zones with russian peacekeepers in them the danger is that if georgia joins nato before the conflicts are resolved those peacekeepers will simply change their helmets and be re labeled russian defenders against "nato aggression " responsible government slow public sector reform dialogue with minorities and oppositions an open media all these dull processes are needed to ensure the south caucasian states make an effective transition to stability and modernity yet western countries lack strong leverage and will to persuade the elites to pursue these goals the u s and europe have plenty of agendas in these countries energy security alliance building in the face of russia and iran tackling organized crime and terrorism the west also has tactical instruments in evidence in the last fortnight as officials flew into tbilisi to twist the georgian presidents arm to get back on democratic track but the west shows no evidence of having an overall strategy for the region or a vision for its future at best the countries in between are stuck at worst they risk slipping into turmoil let down by their leaders and the competing ambitions of the powers around them mr de waal is caucasus editor with the
