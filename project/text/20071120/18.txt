ticketing companies in china are trying to turn around the industry as china plays host to an increasing number of high profile events from the summer olympics next year to faye wong concerts and broadway musicals ticket brokers and ticketing systems companies are hoping modern ticketing technology will equalize access to tickets for consumers around the country reduce shady ticket dealings

say demand for concerts and events and the recent crashing of the online ticketing system for the olympics which has become notorious throughout the industry illustrate the need for a push for modern ticketing technology including automated ticketing services that are commonplace in the u s industry insiders said massive venues which for years have resisted hiring outside companies to help them set up ticketing systems are starting to see the value in investing in ticketing companies expertise western companies including ticketmaster and tickets com inc also are jumping in china ticketing

theaters or stadiums cityline hong kong ltd hopes to eventually distribute tickets to buyers in mainland china through text messages on their mobile phones the ticketing industry in china is making a slow turnaround from a culture in which government agencies controlled events and ticket supply for the past several years as the number of private live entertainment events has increased and management of those events has been deregulated and privatized hundreds of ticket sellers legitimate and counterfeit have sprung up but the industry still depends on manual ticketing systems even though people can reserve tickets by phone or online their purchases arent confirmed until brokers get the physical tickets and then deliver them to buyers "its the typical old archaic way of doing ticketing " said ajmal samuel general manager of cityline with paper ticketing "youd have to walk up to the box office and pick up the paper ticket so youd have long queues " in many cases because it is difficult to determine the source or authenticity when using a printing system consumers also get scammed ticketing companies are dealing with this by using special papers bar codes and technologies including radio frequency identification known as rfid the traditional system is more problematic for event holders who have no way to track inventory or get reliable sales information without information about who is buying tickets and where they are getting them it is much harder for ticketing companies to gain repeat customers or do any meaningful marketing "there is so much potential in making the ticketing process better by simply putting it on a technology platform " said china ticketing chief executive joseph chiang but there are potential limitations with online ticketing in a nation of billion where demand for some events exceeds supply beijing olympic committee officials have admitted to being unprepared for the explosion of ticket requests when they launched a round of ticketing in october the system they used buckled under too much traffic and possibly a faulty link between the web site and the beijing olympic committees ticketing system iac interactivecorps ticketmaster and its partners in china were contracted to work with beijing officials on the ticketing system but they have declined to comment mr samuel of cityline said the problem could have been avoided if beijing officials had used proper traffic control such as throttling or redirecting visitors when the system receives more traffic than it can handle a technique he said is widely used in the industry the chaos that ensued was a telling sign of how the challenge in china is more complex if only by sheer volume the olympics web site received eight million hits within the first hour after sales started with more than orders received every second before it crashed according to the official xinhua news agency beijing olympic officials have since decided to revert to a lottery process to sell the remaining domestic tickets in addition to the olympics china is playing host to high profile events including mega pop star concerts and broadway musicals mr chiang said

alan tam in he had to call in a favor to his friend in shanghai to wait in line at the box office for him because he lived in another province this year he was able to reserve tickets to a jacky cheung concert in guangzhou and pay cash for them at a pickup center his seat was just feet from the stage even without high tech ticketing he said "its very convenient to make the order online i can
