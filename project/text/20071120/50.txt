food for thought in the midst of the combustive debate over immigration reform we in agriculture have been forthright about the elephant in americas living room much of our workforce is in the country illegally as much as faced with the option of economic ruin as hundreds of millions of dollars worth of our livelihood rots in the fields or the embrace of a fatally flawed immigration system our industry and farm families opt to survive who wouldnt for those who have a day harvest window to make or break their entire business year government promises to fix the system dont work we cant wait for rules to change we need reform and we need it now western growers representing half of all the fresh fruits and vegetables grown in the u s has repeatedly called for a fix we want and expect government to enforce immigration laws we want a secure border fraud proof ids and valid social security cards despite a broken and unworkable system however congress has chosen not to act meanwhile the bush administration and the department of homeland security dhs under intense political pressure did begin to move last month a federal judge ordered an indefinite delay to the dhss "no match" program that would have forced employers to fire workers whose social security numbers did not match their names the judge said it would cause "irreparable harm to innocent workers and employers " this preliminary injunction has prevented the dhs from proceeding with the shortsighted no match program the dhs openly concedes our industrys reliance on falsely documented workers but like a physician who diagnoses an open wound but uses salt in place of sutures dhs avoided the cure in favor of additional pain the pain was in the form of the no match rules the dhs guidelines would have established purported "safe harbor" procedures for employers who received a social security administration ssa no match letter the letter notifies an employer that he has submitted employee w s with names and social security numbers that do not match employers would have had to fire employees who could not produce new documentation within days of receiving the letter or face the risk that dhs may find that the employer had knowledge that the employee was unauthorized the regulations would have put farmers in an untenable situation either terminate the majority of their existing workforce and let the crops die in the fields or disregard the rules and risk having to pay huge fines and penalties for "knowingly" employing undocumented workers this attempt by dhs to expose illegal immigrants would have done nothing to address the underlying issues or correct the problem fortunately the courts have stepped in and the bush administration now has an opportunity to fix our broken system the plaintiffs in the case argued that dhss plans would place a costly burden on employers and result in the needless firing of employees that in turn would open employers up to lawsuits and charges of discrimination civil liberties organizations pointed out the no match rules would likely lead to the violation of the rights of many legal workers who might have made a mistake they couldnt correct before deadline these valid concerns must be addressed agriculture yearns for a legal stable economical workforce we have been saying so for years and though we are relieved by the courts decision it doesnt change the fact that this industry still needs a workable solution our current guest worker program known as h a is costly and cumbersome and sets labor standards that are not competitive in the global marketplace at the bush administrations request we have suggested changes to the h a program such as expediting the application process and faxing guest worker approval notices instead of relying on "snail mail" while highly perishable crops await timely harvesters these fixes are not difficult and can in most cases be administratively applied what is the delay if the dhss no match program had gone forward americas domestic food supply would have been irreparably damaged small farm owners would have gone out of business and large operators could have taken their operations abroad taking hundreds of thousands of jobs with them our industry as well as farm worker advocates democrats and republicans alike support legislation known as agjobs this bill which was a part of the senates "grand bargain " includes a temporary guest worker program that logically matches willing farmers with willing foreign laborers agjobs provides the perfect opportunity for congress to make progress on this critically important issue americans dont raise their children to work in the fields and so we are reliant on a foreign workforce we desperately want that workforce to be legal and agjobs affords us that opportunity the bush administration does support comprehensive immigration reform and reportedly set in place the dhss draconian no match rules to force the issue still it was playing a risky game of chance with u s agriculture to the detriment of our industry our economy and american consumers we must stop playing games with our domestic food supply agriculture needs workers americans wont do the work and congress lacks the courage to pass a comprehensive immigration package it is time for congress to find its courage rise above the anger of the activists and come together to solve this problem mr nassif is president &amp ceo of western growers see related letters "letters to the editor security labor needs and law enforcement" wsj nov
