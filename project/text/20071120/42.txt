making a dent in their bottom line "we are a for profit business " says matt fleischer "but that doesnt mean that we cant benefit our company as well as develop our community through cause branding and cause marketing " large companies and entrepreneurs often make philanthropy part of the company once they have become successful but it is rarer for owners of small businesses to build a company with a philanthropic bent right from the start when resources are scant and each move made is supposed to assure that the bottom line grows while such a mission adds to the financial burden many start ups often face in the long run it may help the companys bottom line more than it hurts among other things doing good can engender loyalty among consumers as well as employees who believe in a companys mission creating higher morale and higher productivity and it can set a business apart from rivals who offer similar products without the charitable twist "if youre selling a product and youre viewed
