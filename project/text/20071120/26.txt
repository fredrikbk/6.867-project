chinas national broadcaster a package of four second spots during the closing and opening ceremonies of the games went for about million yuan &# million to domestic milk brand yili at a september auction open only to official games sponsors and when the olympics spots opened up to other companies at an auction on sunday the most expensive one title sponsorship of a nightly show called "my

second spot on prime time events during the winter olympics the network is charging about &# for the beijing games chinas marketers and media buyers say that for the olympics broadcast in august standard methods for calculating return on investment are being thrown out the window by an event that could draw hundreds of millions of viewers possibly the biggest event in chinese tv history "it is a very complicated issue but we think it is worthwhile " says red bull vitamin drinks chief executive wang rui "we think my star matches the appeal of red bulls brand " she has increased her overall ad budget for the energy drink by for cctv certainly tried to encourage exuberance at sundays event chinas version of the u s tv networks"upfront" ad sales with presiding auctioneer yu jingyu tempting advertisers to "just think how high the ratings could be during the olympics " as a prize for being a top bidder cctv presented red bulls ms wang with a uniform and shoes worn by chinese olympic hurdler and gold medalist liu xiang "if your key competitor is a sponsor you definitely want to use cctv to counter them but it should be a reasonable price " says lisa wei the china managing director of wwps groupm media buying company the clients she brought to sundays auction including unilever and nike inc were divided between those with firm limits on the amount they would bid and those who wanted to buy prime spots at almost any cost "most of the multinational clients cannot spend like crazy because they need to get budget approval from headquarters " ms wei adds some olympic sponsors which paid as much as &# million for that status have been cautious about how they spend the rest of their marketing money on high profile ads only about a dozen out of more than sponsors participated in cctvs bidding process for the top ads on cctvs prime channel media buyers say some of those sponsors could still have plans to advertise in less high profile and less expensive spots such as those on cctvs sports channel the leading sportswear brand in china nike spent million yuan for a package of at least ads during finals in the games live broadcast but it didnt try to snap up a wide number of spots to counter rival adidas which is an official games sponsor "we think cctvs auction is a good opportunity to help us to improve our overall marketing plan " says nike china marketing manager chen jianing but she says it is only one part of her strategy "the athletes in more than chinese teams will wear nike uniforms " she says emphasizing nikes strategy of sponsoring national teams rather than the whole games on sunday advertisers spent a total of million yuan on olympics ads and media buyers estimate million yuan was spent on the earlier sales open only to sponsors cctv will hold further auctions of olympics ad time in the coming months but at this years auction the increase in total spending was just hardly an olympian boom for a broadcaster that has seen to growth in the auction tally in most recent years even without the olympics in total this years auction took in billion yuan thanks in part to a jump in spending by foreign companies such as procter &amp gamble even as cctv faces increased competition it is hindered by its dual role as the countrys biggest traditional media company and an official government voice "they want to be more business oriented but they have limitations and restrictions on their programs " says michelle lau the china managing director of aegis groups carat for example during big communist party meetings tv dramas have to be related to the military even ads are open to the whims of the partys propaganda department cctvs ad department director xia hongbo says that cctv has been working to improve its shows and to get advertisers more involved in its programming "if you want to build a national brand cctv is still the best way to do it " he says "with that nationwide reach it is cheap " sue feng in
