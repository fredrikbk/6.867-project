business technology talking tech netflix aims to refine art of picking films its a case of mixing spielberg with statistics how can you use computers to guess the sorts of movies people like netflix the dvd rental outfit has a database program for using its two billion movie ratings from customers to predict what movies they will enjoy a year ago netflix offered a &# million prize to anyone who could come up with a method that was at least more accurate last week netflix said that the closest anyone had come was an improvement from an at&amp t labs team headed by yehuda koren which received a &# "progress prize" for its efforts the contest continues as jim bennett of netflix explained q why is a computer program like this important for you and how does yours work a its allowed us to tell people about a lot of really great films that otherwise might have gone unnoticed by them our system uses very straightforward statistics but there are a lot of tricks that go into making sure that the data is the best we can get for example many people rate all films with either five stars or one star well that kind of person while i am sure they are heartfelt in their ratings is not all that great statistically speaking their ratings will be extreme in one direction or another q what technique did the at&amp t team use a they actually used techniques all of them blended together in hindsight we should have anticipated that blending different techniques would have been a way of getting significant improvements since one technique will find one pattern and another will find a different pattern toward the end of the contest a number of different teams were contacting each other and saying "i wont tell you how i got my results and you dont have to tell me how you got yours but lets blend our predictions together and see if we can do better " the team that was hot on the heels of the at&amp t team did that q an improvement doesnt seem that great what with computer hardware doubling in power every year were you disappointed someone didnt come up with some form of dramatic advance a because of statistical problems you are probably going to run into an irreducible amount of noise in the rating data which will probably mean there is a limit to how effective we can get now for example our rating system only allows us to rate movies with one through five stars so you cant get fine grained predictions weve experimented with letting users give say stars but we got significantly fewer ratings when we did that because people would spend a lot more time trying to figure out their ratings its well known that ratings are slightly higher right after you see a movie than if you wait a week we allow people to rerate movies and when they do that weve seen a fairly significant trend downward q can you tell anything else just from the ratings such as what genre a movie is a it happens just tantalizingly enough that when it fails its really miserable historical dramas like "gone with the wind" and "anna karenina" will tend to get paired in ratings or youll find john wayne westerns will get paired with clint eastwood westerns but youll also find that people who like dramatic movies from the s will also like woody allen movies q what relevance do these sorts of rating systems have on other businesses a any area where consumers might have preferences and with many possible choices would be a candidate for this kind of system
