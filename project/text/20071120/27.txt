citis leadership hunt citigroup inc had a prince but now it needs a king as the bank hunts for a chief executive officer to succeed charles prince it is becoming clear that finding the right candidate to steer citigroup through financial market tumult and reinvigorate an institution that has fallen behind its rivals will be difficult and that is weighing on the stock price citigroups shares fell or &# to &# yesterday after an influential banking analyst cut his rating on the stock to "sell" from "hold " based on the banks exposure to areas of the credit markets that have come under enormous pressure "the lack of leadership at this point in citis storied history could not have come at a worse time " the analyst william tanona of goldman sachs group inc wrote in a report yesterday mr prince stepped down this month as the bank announced it was facing as much as &# billion in new losses from the credit crunch adding to a litany of recent problems at the bank the committee conducting the search includes directors richard parsons chairman and ceo of time warner inc franklin thomas a former ceo of the ford foundation alain belda ceo of alcoa inc and former treasury secretary robert rubin who was named chairman after mr prince stepped down the committee met on a telephone conference yesterday a person familiar with the matter said also the bank has hired prince goldsmith llc a boutique executive search firm that this year helped to lure american express co chief financial officer gary crittenden to take the same role at citigroup the field of potential candidates thinned last week when merrill lynch &amp co snatched john thain from nyse euronext and named him ceo he succeeded stan oneal whom merrills board ousted last month but even mr thain wasnt considered an ideal candidate to lead the largest u s bank by assets although his pedigree from goldman sachs provided him with wide knowledge of citigroups wall street operations he lacked a background in consumer banking or commercial banking two businesses central to citigroups vast global presence people familiar with the search say there is a dearth of high profile american financial industry executives who can take on such a job and a number of executive recruiters and investors are now speculating that the banks next ceo may come from overseas or even from outside the financial services industry indeed other large companies sometimes have gone outside their industries for a strong ceo in hewlett packard co named relative unknown mark hurd head of ncr corp to succeed carly fiorina and this month estee lauder named a procter &amp gamble co snacks executive to run the cosmetics company in discussing the qualifications for a citigroup ceo this month mr rubin shied away from saying the candidate needed to have a banking background instead he stressed the need for someone with a "strong international focus" that "can be related to the globalization of this institution " the new ceo "doesnt need to be everything but the critical things are oversight cost containment team building and understanding risk " says david katz chief investment officer at matrix asset advisors inc a new york money management firm that owns million citigroup shares in the banking industry most speculation now centers on a short list that includes robert willumstad the former citigroup chief operating officer was passed over for the top job in favor of mr prince mr willumstad has started a private equity firm brysam global partners and has bolstered his financial industry credentials by serving as nonexecutive chairman of insurance giant american international group inc he formerly ran citigroups consumer businesses and is highly regarded among the banks employees today but he has less experience in citigroups wall street operations furthermore naming a former citigroup executive might be viewed as a step backward for a company that could use some fresh blood mr willumstad declined to comment robert diamond jr the barclays plc president turned the banks capital markets unit into a leader in the trading and sales of credit foreign exchange commodities and interest rate products asked about the citigroup post last week he replied "were working through difficult markets right now so i am very happy where i am " josef ackermann the deutsche bank ceo has experience running a global bank having spent years at credit suisse and years at deutsche where he has been ceo since he has overhauled the firm to focus on global corporate and investment banking global asset management and european retail and private banking through a spokesman he declined to comment james dimon the j p morgan chase &amp co chairman and ceo would seem like a natural fit for the job having once been considered heir apparent to former chairman and ceo sanford weill a person familiar with the situation said mr dimon isnt interested in the citi job vikram pandit hired by citigroup this year when the bank bought his old lane hedge fund mr pandit now oversees the banks core investment bank and alternative investments businesses fred goodwin the ceo of royal bank of scotland group plc the united
