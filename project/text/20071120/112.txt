tv sellers are thinking big to avoid repeat of glut sony toshiba retailers push giant screens quality last year randy waynick watched as inch flat panel liquid crystal display televisions flooded the electronics market and brought prices crashing down more than so this holiday season the senior executive from sony electronics a unit of sony corp decided on a new strategy sell bigger tvs for the first time the japanese electronics giant is debuting inch tvs at u s retailers such as best buy co and circuit city stores inc sony has also increased the number of lcd tv models inches or larger that it sells in the u s to nearly up from in september sony began dispatching more than employees across the u s into stores to talk to shoppers about larger size tvs overall lcd tvs inches or larger will increase to of sonys tv lineup from last year one of the points sony is stressing is that its large tvs offer better quality than those from cheaper vendors "as you get into the larger screen sizes it becomes more and more noticeable the difference between us and them " says mr waynick who is based in san diego sony isnt alone for the holiday season toshiba corp lg electronics inc and philips electronics nv are also pushing tv sets measuring inches or larger moving away from the most prevalent inch size flat panel tvs the change comes in the wake of last years glut of flat panel tvs which led to heavy discounting of the products the price war partially contributed to circuit citys net loss in its fiscal third quarter after the company tried to match discounts from rivals sony reported that sales of some of its tvs also fell amid the cutthroat pricing for tv makers larger flat screens offer higher average selling prices and fatter profit margins a inch lcd tv today sells for around &# in the u s while a inch costs an average &# according to research firm isuppli corp of el segundo calif the big tv market also is relatively less competitive than the smaller sized tv market where value brands such as syntax brillian corp s olevia and closely held westinghouse digital electronics llc are crowding the market with cheap models "if more consumers step up to larger screen sizes its going to generate some extra revenue " says tim alessi lgs product development director for consumer electronics in englewood cliffs n j overall flat panel tvs are expected to remain one of the hottest selling products for the holidays "the meltdown that had already occurred in at this time last year hasnt occurred and wont occur because supply and demand is balanced " says stewart muller president of philips consumer electronics north america as americans upgrade from older tvs sales of lcd tvs in the u s are expected to jump roughly to million units according to

th spot last year this month elizabeth lawley a year old professor in rochester n y purchased a &# inch sony lcd tv from online retailer amazon com inc to replace her old inch general electric co cathode ray tube television ms lawley says she made the big tv purchase the first for her family in years after recently receiving a hefty tax refund and remodeling the family living room she adds that her family wanted to get the largest tv she could afford that still has good picture quality "if we were going to get a new one we wanted to go for a much more immersive theater experience instead of the small box " says ms lawley but going big for manufacturers isnt foolproof it costs more to make big tvs as the machines can require more expensive components and as more companies build larger tvs prices for these machines will also decline say analysts the average selling price in the u s of a to inch tv is expected to drop to &# this year from &# last year according to isuppli in contrast u s lcd tv prices overall are forecast to fall only to an average &# still most electronics makers say that the price declines for larger tvs will be less drastic than for smaller sized tvs "theres still price erosion overall but going bigger helps to offset it " says lgs mr alessi mike mohan a merchandising vice president for richfield minn retail chain best buy co says consumers appear very interested in big tvs for the holidays over the past five months best buy has increased floor space in its stores devoted to larger tvs "youll see us start to debut more and more of our holiday

reducing the screen sizes to make it easier for shoppers to get the tvs home and mounted sharp which launched an ad campaign about its tvs this month says its new inch tv can now fit in the same space as a traditional inch flat panel tv because of the smaller frames sonys efforts to go big with its tvs started in when it decided to focus on lcd technology the company now has equipment that cuts the glass into bigger sizes while wasting as little as possible mr waynick says that even though inch televisions were the biggest sellers last year he noticed sonys inch tvs were also selling well after the holiday price war mr waynick researched pricing trends and sought advice from big box retailers and consumer focus groups around late winter he and his team decided to raise the number of tv models larger than inches in the u s mr waynick has traveled to japan to work with corporate executives and factory representatives on what new technologies to fit into its larger tvs in the high end of its new line of larger bravia tvs sony decided to add screen technology that improves the appearance of fast on screen action in sports or videogames "weve done quite a bit of research over the
