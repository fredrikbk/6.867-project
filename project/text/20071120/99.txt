the annapolis fiasco henry kissinger once observed that "when enough prestige has been invested in a policy it is easier to see it fail than abandon it " at the u s naval academy in annapolis md next week the current secretary of state will illustrate her predecessors point "annapolis " as it is spoken of in diplomatic circles was conceived earlier this year by the bush administration as a landmark conference that would revive israeli palestinian peace talks and lead to a final settlement by january it was to be modeled on the madrid conference of which brought israeli leaders face to face with their arab counterparts and as it seemed at the time created a new paradigm in the affairs of the middle east back then the idea was that the iron wall between the jewish state and its neighbors could be brought down just as the berlin wall had today the operative theory is that israels neighbors fearful of irans growing regional clout have a newfound interest in putting the israeli palestinian conflict to rest nice theory if only the locals would get with the concept the egyptians are openly skeptical about the conference which they say lacks "an endgame " the saudis supposedly among the beleaguered and newly pliable sunni powers can hardly be bothered with annapolis even now its unclear whether their foreign minister will attend palestinian president mahmoud abbas has told the saudis he would rather resign than attend a conference that achieves nothing he fears palestinians would "turn to hamas after they see that annapolis did not give them anything " according to an unnamed palestinian official quoted in the jerusalem post then there are the israelis who have even better reasons than the sunnis to fear iran yossi beilin architect of the oslo accords and a political dove predicts not only that annapolis will fail but that its failure will "weaken the palestinian camp strengthen hamas and cause violence " his political opposite likud party leader benjamin netanyahu calls annapolis "dangerous" and warns that israel risks giving away everything for nothing in return few israelis take seriously the view that the creation of a palestinian state offers a solution to their concerns about iran on the contrary they fear that such a state would become yet another finger of the islamic revolution just as hezbollahstan is to their north in lebanon and hamastan is to their south in gaza no wonder then that as skepticism about annapolis grows its perceived significance shrinks what was originally billed as a conference is now being described by the state department as a "meeting " what was originally envisaged as a three day event has become a one day event there is as of this writing no firm list of participants and there are whispers the date of the meeting may be pushed back perhaps to december as for the agenda there isnt one substantive discussions have been ruled out there was some hope that israelis and palestinians would agree to a joint "declaration of principles " but they could not come up with a common text now theres talk of issuing separate declarations or doing without declarations altogether among the principles sharply in dispute is whether israel is a jewish state "we will not agree to recognize israel as a jewish state " says palestinian negotiator saeb erekat adding that "there is no country in the world where religious and national identities are intertwined " counters mr olmert "we wont have an argument with anyone in the world over the fact that israel is a state of the jewish people whoever does not accept this cannot hold any negotiations with me " one would have thought the question of israels jewishness was settled years ago by a u n partition plan that speaks of a "jewish state" some times one would have thought too that mr erekat would be mindful of his governments membership in the nation organization of the islamic conference but the question hasnt been settled because palestinians will not concede the "right" of their "refugees" currently numbering in the millions to return to their ancestral homes and farms in present day israel despite nearly years of trying there is simply no finessing these differences if israel is not a jewish state it may as well be called palestine if the existential issues of cannot be resolved there is little point in addressing the territorial issues of which are themselves almost impossible to address matters are not helped by the unusual political weakness of the key participants in the last year mr abbas has lost half his kingdom he will swiftly lose what remains of it the moment "palestine" comes into being and the israeli army isnt around to suppress hamas as an effective fighting force mr olmerts governing coalition depends on two parties the ultraorthodox shas and ultranationalist yisrael beiteinu which are opposed to any substantive concessions the prime minister faces potential criminal indictments in multiple probes connected to his previous tenure as minister of trade and industry a forthcoming official inquiry on last years war in lebanon will reportedly hold him accountable for the deaths of soldiers ariel sharon is still in a coma but its his successor whos really on life support why then hold a conference at all the short answer is that condoleezza rice demands one and she has spent countless hours over eight mostly fruitless trips to the region this year trying to arrange it but this hardly addresses the deeper mystery of why this administration has gotten itself caught in the venus flytrap of the arab israeli conflict after vowing not to do so and why it has done so with a degree of ineptitude that recalls the dimmer moments of the carter administration maybe its a matter of bureaucratic inertia or maybe its about being seen to try or maybe its the kind of fourth quarter fourth down hail mary pass that appeals to a secretary of state with a mania for football and a thin record of accomplishment then again maybe it doesnt really matter but look on the bright side annapolis may yet serve us well as an object lesson in how diplomacy the competent kind just isnt done see
