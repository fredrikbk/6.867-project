global warming inc al gore no longer needs to make claims about creating the internet because the former vice president deserves much of the credit for creating an entire new industry the global warming business and like the energy barons of an earlier age mr gore has the chance to achieve enormous wealth after being named last week as a new partner at the famously successful venture capital firm kleiner perkins no fewer than three of his new colleagues sit on the forbes list of wealthiest americans if mr gore can develop market based solutions to environmental challenges we will cheer the well deserved riches flowing his way on the other hand if he monetizes his nobel peace prize by securing permanent government subsidies for nonmarket science projects hell have earned a different judgment theres no shortage of new capital pouring into alternative energy projects these days according to the national venture capital association "clean tech" start ups attracted more than &# million in venture capital last quarter a new record whats not clear is whether these are fundamentally energy ventures or political ventures the manhattan institutes peter huber a former engineering professor at mit exaggerates only slightly when he says that "basically alternative means stuff that nobody actually uses " if that turns out to be true then alternative energy companies could struggle for market share without government assistance those doubts exist even for the companies backed by kleiner perkins after making more than a dozen "green tech" investments kleiner is still waiting for its first exit according to a kleiner spokeswoman many companies in its portfolio are "in stealth mode " the firm will "neither name nor comment on them " so its impossible to determine precisely how much the kleiner backed firms will benefit from either current federal subsidies or new provisions that are part of the house and senate versions of the stalled energy bill but we do have some hints of the portfolio companies acknowledged publicly by kleiner at least two altra and mascoma are involved in the production of ethanol which is already heavily subsidized and would get more subsides in the house bill and higher mandates in the senate version a third firm in the portfolio amyris biotechnologies is developing a biofuel that will provide "more energy than ethanol " according to its web site and should be just as eligible for government set asides two portfolio companies in the solar energy field miasole and ausra should benefit if a house provision requiring investor owned utilities to generate of their power from wind solar or geothermal sources becomes law the same is true for altarock energy a kleiner backed geothermal company lux research analyst ying wu reports that "company valuations will take a pretty big hit" in miasoles market segment if washington turns off the subsidy spigot to put it another way kleiners "risk taking" here isnt all economic when everything is going according to plan do venture capitalists normally turn to a politician filmmaker to help them cash out of engineering firms nope but then again alternative energy has never fit the usual venture model jack biddle co founder of novak biddle venture partners says theres a reason few start up companies try to build commercial jetliners "large complex systems with slow deployment cycles do not play to ventures strengths the whole idea with venture backed companies is speed speed speed " mr biddle says the size and complexity of energy systems "make s look like tinker toys you need lots of capital lots of time lots of people " mr gore seems to grasp the scale of the challenge and the need for government help telling fortune magazine "what we are going to have to put in place is a combination of the manhattan project the apollo project and the marshall plan and scale it globally " thats the kind of "green" vision that will require a lot of greenbacks well be as happy as the sierra club if one or more of these new technologies turns out to solve the secrets of cheap efficient energy but we recall the same technological promises being made in the s the last time the feds poured subsidies into alternative fuels which leads us to suspect that maybe mr gore has been hired by kleiner perkins for more than his technological knowhow investment acumen or global vision his new partners may have hired him for the more prosaic task of getting senate votes to keep those taxpayer greenbacks coming see related letters "letters to the editor priorities are as clear as the air we breathe" wsj nov
