manila citing myanmar balks at asean pact associated press singapore the philippines warned that it isnt likely to ratify a landmark southeast asian charter unless myanmar restores democracy and frees opposition leader aung san suu kyi the unexpected ultimatum by president gloria macapagal arroyo president of the philippines was a clear sign that myanmar will continue to hamper progress by the member association of southeast asian nations which touts the charter as a testament to its growing integration "the expectation of the philippines is that if myanmar signs the charter it is committed to returning to the path of democracy and releasing aung san suu kyi " ms arroyo told her myanmar counterpart lt gen thein sein during a one on one meeting in singapore "until the philippine congress sees that happen it would have extreme difficulty in ratifying the charter " ms arroyo said at the meeting held before an asean summit today she repeated the comments at an informal dinner of asean leaders who are set to sign the charter at the summit for the charter to take effect it must still be ratified by parliaments of member countries and that could take a year the charter will fail if one country fails to ratify it "the belief of the filipino people and the philippine congress as well as my own is that those who will sign the charter agree to the objective spirit and intent of establishing a human rights body the full protection of human rights within asean " ms arroyo said the long overdue asean charter is aimed at formally turning the year old organization often derided as powerless into a rule based legal entity that means asean can sue and be sued under the charter and will be held accountable for all treaties and agreements it signs it will also set up enforceable financial trade and environmental rules one of the most significant pledges in the charter is to set up a regional human rights body critics say the body would have a limited impact because it wouldnt be able to punish governments that violate the rights of their citizens negotiators have watered it down by dropping earlier recommendations to consider sanctions including expulsion in cases of serious breaches by member nations a copy of the charter seen by the associated press says breaches would be referred to asean heads of state "for decision " "im not sure if it will have teeth but it will certainly have a tongue " singapore foreign minister george yeo said referring to aseans right to criticize violators "it will certainly have moral influence if nothing else but these are details for the future " an obvious candidate for discussion under the human rights body would be myanmar whose military junta used troops and police to crush peaceful pro democracy demonstrations in late september killing at least people myanmar expressed satisfaction with the charter
