the middle seat complaints against airport security surge new numbers dont bode well for holiday fliers but tsa blames faulty counts in past complaints about transportation security administration screening at airports have surged in the past several months and the reason depends on whom you ask the often maligned tsa says the increase has occurred because it wasnt counting all the complaints before the agency concedes that until may this year it was losing customer complaints and under reporting traveler gripes but in the view of some travelers security screening remains as big a hassle as ever and screeners can be even grumpier these days sentiments that could obviously lead to additional complaints whatever the cause its bad news for anyone traveling this week the years most congested travel week security lines may be long throughout the holiday season particularly at trouble spots like las vegas atlanta and denver where most screening is centralized in giant lobbies tsa chief kip hawley says extra screeners have been deployed and the agency is prepared for the surge recent tallies of complaints about tsa service not counting baggage damage reports suggest the agency did have a difficult time keeping up with big crowds this past summer complaints to the tsa about security courtesy procedures processing time and personal property fell sharply during the first five months of the year but began climbing in june with a jump in the total number of complaints compared with june by august total service complaints were higher than a year earlier and september the most recent month reported by the government saw a increase in tsa complaints the number of actual damage claims showed a similar trend down early in the year and peaking in july with a increase in checkpoint and checked baggage damage claims mr hawley says thats largely the result of a change in may that increased the tsas capacity to receive complaints that month the agency moved its customer service department out of its headquarters to a new site adding telephone lines computer bandwidth and better software to track complaints "now were able to receive all the input everyone calls in " mr hawley says congress ordered the tsa in to report its complaint totals and the latest tsa numbers confirm what many travelers say anecdotally security screening is one of the biggest travel hassles in september the department of transportation received a total of complaints about u s and foreign airlines but the tsa tallied complaints about its service and baggage damage that same month the tsa says thats not an apples to apples comparison because airlines receive many complaints never reported to the dot mr hawley doubts the sharp increase in tsa complaints signals that a decline in service at checkpoints was afoot during the busy summer though he cant explain why some categories increased faster than others in september for example complaints about screener courtesy were up and complaints about processing time were up while screening procedure complaints were up only and complaints this year are higher even though they are compared to a horrendous month for travel last year shortly after a ban on liquids in carry on bags went into effect one thing that is clear the tsa concedes it was missing and underreporting complaints in the past with travelers either frustrated at getting busy signals on phone lines and never recording a complaint or emails tsa contactcenter dhs gov not being properly handled the numbers suggest the tsa was missing a very large chunk of complaints when complaints in categories such as courtesy and processing time more than double its likely more a result of the tsa previously underreporting complaints rather than a significant decline in service travelers have long groused that the tsa has been unresponsive to complaints and some say they havent seen much change tom zanecchia and his wife complained to the tsa in september after their year old daughter went through a checkpoint at denver international airport without removing her ipod and camera from her bag a screener began berating her as her parents watched then threw the items into a bin damaging the camera when the zanecchias called the tsa to complain a tsa representative said that the screener was out of line but that without a name the agency couldnt do anything "assuming tsa really does care about the treatment of travelers then it is important for anyone that is treated badly to get the security persons name or badge number " says mr zanecchia founder and president of a denver financial consulting firm who travels frequently the family filed a damage claim on the camera "but no response as of yet " he says many travelers say they have learned to live with the routine of airport security screening and some give the tsa better marks these days business travelers in particular rely on special lines for elite level frequent fliers and first class customers to speed up the trek through the airport "the consistency is better than the old days the customer service at the airport is better i havent filed a complaint in some time " says photographer david fauss still many hate the rushed stress filled security line experience with tsa officials loudly barking routine orders over and over callously searching travelers and inconsistently enforcing rules from one city to the next mary ann ramsey president of a florida travel agency was told by a screener in fort myers fla last week that her quart bag of bottles was "too full " the screener insisted there had to be empty space at the top of the bag a requirement never mentioned in her previous travels "it is the scolding and harassing tone that i will never understand " she says
