the new powers in college football carry old baggage as showdown looms kansas and missouri fans re fight the civil war kansas city mo as the universities of kansas and missouri prepare to play the most important football game in their year old rivalry trash talking is rampant here in a metropolis that straddles both states yet this isnt just the usual back and forth about which quarterback or defense is superior nor is it centered on the inevitable jokes about how many kansas or missouri students are needed to change a light bulb rather this trash talking is focused on which states residents behaved more abominably amid the civil war fans "go back to the history books and start calling people names for things that started years ago " says kevin worley a kansas city based documentary filmmaker who isnt immune to that tendency himself a die hard missouri fan mr worley suspects that "theres this ancestral hatred of kansas bred in me" by a lineage traceable to soldiers who marched with confederate general jo shelby to most of the nation the showdown saturday between second ranked kansas and fourth ranked missouri will most likely determine which team will play in the national championship game to reach that final the victor saturday would need to win one subsequent game but to many here on both sides of the state line the game is merely a proxy for a war that never really ended perhaps no other football rivalry in the nation pits against each other states that once fought as brutally as did kansas and missouri evidence that the feud is ongoing can be seen on the back of dave hickerson a missouri fan who this weekend chomped a cigar in a kansas city bar called the velvet dog he sported a university of missouri football jersey that bore the name not of chase daniel the teams spectacular quarterback rather it said quantrill a missouri hero and kansas villain william quantrill led a rebel guerrilla unit that in burned and pillaged lawrence home of the university of kansas in the process slaughtering about people including children "i dont think theres anything redeeming to be said about the jersey except that it" angers kansans says mr hickerson but kansans have their own t shirt that they hope will offend missourians the shirt says "kansas keeping america safe from missouri since " the shirt features a drawing of abolitionist john brown who before his famous raid on harpers ferry led murderous raids against farms and families in pro slavery missouri "theyre the slave state were the free state look who won out in the end " says heather knox a year old accountant and kansas alumna who lives in kansas city mo on the gridiron theirs is the oldest major college rivalry west of the mississippi river neither team is usually a contender for the national title their showdown more often determines third and fourth place in the six team north division of the big conference but bitterness on the football field goes back a long ways the two sides cant even agree on their series all time record missourians say the series is tied while kansans say they own a two game lead the point of contention is their meeting which the jayhawks won with ineligible players that loss killed missouris best chance at a national title and the tigers have never again reached no in the polls the game saturday will take place in a neutral site in the city arrowhead stadium home of the kansas city chiefs professional franchise but nothing about it is expected to be neutral a night time kickoff means that fans will have plenty of time to drink beforehand arrowhead officials who typically replace about of the stadiums seats following a chiefs game expect the kansas missouri brawl to leave as many as seats destroyed tickets with double digit face values are selling for &# online neither school has ever won a national football championship indeed neither team has finished atop their conference since to fans on both sides it is maddening to think that the biggest obstacle toward doing so this year is their oldest nemesis "i hate kansas more than everything " says mr hickerson on weeks when theyre not playing each other "i hate kansas so much i would rather have kansas lose than have missouri win " this hatred dates back to the s when the great plains state of kansas became a beachhead for men around the country committed to ending slavery many however hid behind that noble cause all the while killing pillaging and raping their way across the culturally southern state to the east missouri these kansas guerrillas called themselves jayhawkers supposedly a combination of two birds the jay and the hawk today it is a sore point among missouri fans that the university of kansas mascot is the jayhawk matt gaunt a development officer for missouris agriculture college concedes that his states fighters committed atrocities as well but notes that missouri never named a team after them some argue that missouris mascot the tigers are named after some pro union forces in an otherwise confederate state but the hometown of the missouri tigers columbia is still known as "little dixie " and many in missouri remain proud of their confederate past its enough to start former missouri player brandon barnes who is african american wondering whether tiger fans are "hating the jayhawkers for something i might celebrate " but then he remembers the time that jayhawk fans threw ice at him and footballs at the missouri team bus "we hate each other for a reason " he said as he sat in a kansas city bar on saturday on chat boards fans of both teams are weighing in "definition of jayhawk murderer rapist low life scum kansas fans are so stupid they think that name is something to be proud of " said a post on a kansas city star message board a university of kansas poster wrote on a fan board "the jayhawkers defended kansas against terrorists and helped make kansas a free state just before the start of the civil war " here in a city where the line between the two states is virtually invisible many missouri fans wont live in kansas and vice versa when jayme salinardi a lawyer proposed moving to a kansas suburb that offered first class public schools his wife missouri born heather refused "im not living on the kansas side " he recalls her saying he finally prevailed by finding a house that is only one block from missouri the game this saturday will provide the perfect capper to a college football season where up has been down traditional powers like notre dame have stumbled badly while upstarts like south florida have joined the tigers and jayhawks in making once unthinkable runs for the top neither kansas nor missouri was expected to win the six team big north division that crown was supposed to belong to the nebraska cornhuskers a team that is and that lost to missouri and kansas by a combined score of not everyone sees the upcoming game as bearing great historical overtones corby jones a star quarterback for the tigers in the mid s sat in a sports bar saturday watching with glee as missouri beat kansas state setting the stage for this weeks mammoth showdown with kansas an team that before the season started was expected to finish fourth in the big north division but even if missouri loses mr jones a lawyer wont be leading any campaigns against kansas or its fans "its a football game " he said "its not war " see related letters "letters to the editor rivalry bigger than civil war its football" wsj november
