green with nuclear energy power to save the world by gwyneth cravens knopf pages &# start with a novelist and former new yorker magazine fiction editor living on the east end of long island a sometime antinuclear activist remember shoreham and a determined organic vegetable gardener who spent her childhood in s new mexico having atom bomb nightmares team her with another lifelong greenie a man with a doctorate in organic chemistry who grew up on an idaho ranch without electricity and whose day job over the course of a long career has included pioneering something called probabilistic risk assessment the underpinnings of climate change analysis but thats another story send the pair off on a grand tour of the nuclear power world from dust blown uranium mines to the depths of a pilot facility for uncle sams waste deposit at nevadas yucca mountain and then wait for them to come back with the predictable diatribe against nuclear power happily youll wait in vain "power to save the world" is a picaresque flat out love song to the bad boy of the great american energy debate as good a book as were likely to get on a subject mired in political incorrectness general unfathomability and essentially limitless gut fears its also the latest plot point for one of the few unassailably positive byproducts of global warming mania the quiet emergence of pro nuke greens led by such impeccable apostates as whole earth founder stewart brand and james lovelock the british chemist best known for his earth is a living organism "gaia hypothesis " gwyneth cravens and her virgil retired sandia national labs scientist d richard "rip" anderson arguably the worlds top expert on long term disposal of nuclear waste are smart enough to steer clear of that fratricidal battlefield which features some of the worst aspects of know nothing environmentalism the books subtitle "the truth about nuclear energy" could come straight off some forlorn industry group handout thats not meant as criticism in fact its hard not to read ms cravenss book as a page indictment of the nuclear power industrys tragic comic inability to tell its own story going all the way back to three mile island and chernobyl disasters that look a lot less disastrous in retrospect as ms cravens discovers the industry has swapped missionary zeal for a hair shirt and a defensive crouch assaults by the sierra club which ironically once upon a time campaigned for "atoms not dams" and greenpeace one of whose founders patrick moore is another high profile nuclear heretic are only part of the problem worse is being the stepchild of a utility establishment happily shacked up with wretched old king coal now putting million more tons of coal a year up in smoke ms cravens ruefully notes than when she innocently planted her first organic garden in the early s with mr anderson doing running commentary "power to save the world" tours an alternative universe reactor control rooms day glo uranium "hot cells" and underground waste storage sites where people work calmly in the knowledge that an f rammed at miles an hour into a simulated concrete containment wall will make a scratch only an inch deep they also know that half the fuel in americas nuclear reactors in other words the source of of the countrys electricity far higher in shock horror super nuclear vermont comes from dismantled soviet bombs a coke can will handily contain all the uranium needed for a legendarily high powered u s lifetime of electricity the coal equivalent is tons heres a fun fact walking through grand central terminals granite corridors hits you with more radiation than a similar stroll through a nuclear power plant special for paranoids depending on where you live a third or more of your daily dose of radiation comes from your own bodys isotopes cheers there is a point to all this as the threat of atomic annihilation has seemingly receded free range post industrial phobias have rushed into the vacuum helped along by a public that has trouble distinguishing the relative risks from a lump of plutonium less than youd think and an irradiated strawberry of course nuclear powers funnest fact is zero carbon but dont hold your breath waiting for your coal wed local utility to boast about it "clean &amp green" is as far as most of them will go and so while right thinking americans fantasize about a solar powered seattle and a corn fed prius smart countries from china and india to finland are powering ahead with spectacular new st century nuclear reactors toward the close of "power to save the world " mr anderson lets ms cravens in on a wry engineering and science fiction term for magical fixes unobtanium in todays energy discourse unobtanium includes hydrogen biomass cellulosic ethanol negawatts jimmy carters cardigans and any other dream technology that someone can come up with to avoid focusing on the epic problem of keeping an ever brighter planets lights burning another cute bit of knowing jargon pops up in richard rhodess introduction to "power to save the world " it neatly encapsulates of public discourse about nuclear power "secondhand ignorance " ms cravens firsthand portrait of the devil we know wont fix that by itself but it is appropriately illuminating mr reiss writes about energy and new media for wired magazine
