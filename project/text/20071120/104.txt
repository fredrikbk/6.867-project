think very carefully about kidney sales your article "kidney shortage inspires a radical idea organ sales" page one nov leaves the false impression that the only alternative to allowing kidney sales is to stand helplessly by and let increasing numbers of people on transplant waitlists die but other measures including a system in which everyone is assumed to be willing to donate when deceased yet free to opt out of donation can dramatically reduce organ shortages as has been proven in spain in india the philippines and elsewhere it is the poor and desperate who sell their organs vendors in a regulated market in the u s would also likely be poverty stricken the poor are harmed by these transactions a recent survey of kidney vendors in pakistan for example showed that made no economic improvement and reported deterioration in general health status if we allow ourselves to buy organs from the poor we encourage the idea that they are mere instruments to be used by us at will and thereby corrode one of our most central convictions all persons including those in poverty have dignity and arent simply things to be purchased at the right price samuel j kerstein ph d fellow program in ethics and health harvard university associate professor of philosophy university of maryland boston dr luc noel m d coordinator clinical procedures essential health technologies world health organization geneva
