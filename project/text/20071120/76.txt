performance reviews need some work dont meet potential lets put it diplomatically and take the emotion out of it the whole performance review process now in season doesnt exactly exceed expectations whether these annual events are meant to weed out laggards reward achievers assist development or act simply as a liability shield against discrimination lawsuits is anybodys guess whatever their purpose they attempt to give employees an individualized and intimate portrayal of their performance but can end up saying more about the company than the individual "but enough about you " if you hate performance reviews that may be because you have spent more time than you can afford trying to understand whether the fact you "met expectations" is good or bad worse you may have to write the reviews and suffer from the awkwardness of telling someone hes more or less living a lie after all saying negative things about someone can lead managers to self incrimination providing proof that they failed to manage someone as effectively as their managerial peers who in turn inflated the grades of all their staffers "one reason they dont want to tell the truth is it creates responsibility " says aneil mishra associate professor of management at the babcock graduate school of management at wake forest university managers think "if youre not doing your job i have to figure out a way to make it better and if you are doing a good job i have to figure out a way to reward you " not surprising performance reviews are lampooned online "this employee should go far and the sooner he starts the better he doesnt have ulcers but hes a carrier if you give him a penny for his thoughts youd get change " books such as "perfect phrases for performance reviews " provide plug and play comments those employees who need improvement in the "grooming and appearance" category for example might be told "some have reported unpleasant body odor " note the "some have reported" construction intended to sound like fact instead of disputable opinion "im disappointed that there is such a demand for these books " concedes robert bacal one of the books co authors and a consultant "managers arent intentionally deceiving employees theyre deceiving themselves into thinking that what theyre doing is an objective process " nowhere is that more evident than in the "forced ranking" systems where managers rate employees against their peers and fire the bottom percentage better known as "rank and yank " its easy to get the impression that an unqualified judge is thumbing the scales wayne ryback a former aerospace engineer and manager once received a call on a saturday morning from a group vice president telling him to downgrade one of his employees to "very good" from "excellent " "the group vice president didnt have any clue as to what this person was like " says mr ryback who also believed the rankings were used to protect against lawsuits "if management were really interested in making a performance review helpful to the employee they wouldnt do it only once a year " he says it didnt matter "whether or not we communicated anything intelligible to the employee " thats one of bill savages beefs the enterprise risk management executive says reviews tend to raise more questions than answers once he was told by a former manager that he was below the proverbial "bar " which his manager conceded moved a great deal his other least favorite criticism "nonteam player " which seems reserved to beat down overachievers who deserved promotions they didnt get "the big problem is not so much the words " says mr savage "but the inability of management to provide context on why theyre using those terms " another method of review the degree feedback aims to give a fuller picture of someone by corralling anonymous input from peers subordinates and supervisors at the manufacturing company that business segment manager ed smiley works for the degree process has been suspended due to mutual back scratching "what you dont get is true feedback " says mr smiley mike bach a chief operating officer once received degree feedback that only confused him and his manager three anonymous peers reviewed him positively for decision making three others not so much no one provided specifics his boss shrugged and said "i guess you only won over of the people " brian borkholder has no such shortcomings for three years the department leader has scored out of points total on various "metrics " such as job knowledge interpersonal skills and adaptability "im great " he says "at least thats what my personnel file says about me " how does he do it year after year simple mr borkholder writes his own reviews "the last three years ive turned in the exact same one " he says "ive just changed the date " in the employee comment box mr borkholder responds "i agree " email me at jared sandberg wsj com for a discussion on todays column go to wsj com forums to see past columns please go to careerjournal com
