obstacle course in west bank checkpoints splinter palestinian economy cut off from customers a farmer gambles all on almond tree market qabatiya west bank striding atop a patch of brown earth he rents here sadiq nazal plucks leaves from one of the almond tree saplings he has planted this season in neat rows across a sun drenched plain the palestinian farmer has bet his nursery business on these saplings but may never get them to market "imagine " he says "if no one buys them " the problem for seven years palestinian movements within the west bank have been tightly restricted by a shifting maze like network of israeli military checkpoints barricades and permit requirements this gauntlet growing in size and severity over the past two years keeps away most of mr nazals customers the farmers who plant his trees and then harvest the olives nuts and other fruits they yield israeli defense officials say the travel restrictions are vital for securing their citizens against terrorism but the barriers also are choking the palestinian economy creating what the world bank calls "a shattered economic space" of separate enclaves per capita gross domestic product has fallen for palestinians since economists largely blame the plunge on the restrictions and a loss of palestinian employment in israel the splintering of the west bank is undermining a crucial plank in the bush administrations latest plan for the region the white house wants to bolster the west bank economy mainly through aid and development to buoy moderate leaders roll back growing islamist influence and enhance prospects for peace forging a broader israeli palestinian accord is the focus of an international conference expected to take place next week in annapolis md but dwindling hopes for progress there are expected to increase the pressure to find tangible ways to improve palestinian life washington launched an urgent economic and diplomatic push in the west bank this summer after the iranian backed islamist group hamas which won palestinian parliamentary elections the year before took military control of the gaza strip in a bloody sweep the u s responded by trying to isolate hamas in gaza and bolster the western leaning fatah party which still holds a tenuous grip over palestinian institutions in the west bank secretary of state condoleezza rice brought up the difficulties of the movement restrictions in every meeting she had with senior israeli officials on a diplomatic mission in october according to a senior u s official she was back in the region earlier this month ahead of the annapolis meeting the roadblocks started going up in force after the palestinian uprising known as the second intifada the israelis eased them briefly in but have been throwing them back up since in the west bank some of palestinians now live below the poverty line according to near east consulting a palestinian survey and research firm that has worked for the united nations and the world bank the world bank concluded in a may report that the blockages create so much uncertainty and inefficiency that business owners cant run their operations normally that in turn chokes off the growth and investment needed to rekindle the regions economy the bank concluded mr nazals year old al karmel nursery illustrates the damage and the difficulty of recovery checkpoints and closures over the past seven years have kept him from tending his fields and have increasingly depressed demand for his plants by damaging the businesses of his customers its also difficult for them to even reach his nursery mr nazal now relies primarily on international aid groups that try to bridge the security strictures by purchasing his trees and distributing them to farmers despite their best intentions such groups are poor substitutes for free market forces they never tell mr nazal until harvest time what theyre going to buy meaning he must plant blindly at the start of each season he can either guarantee a small amount of sales by planting a little bit of everything or fill his fields with only one or two varieties in an all or nothing gamble after seven years of losses mr nazal says only a banner season can keep him afloat now so this year hes risking everything on the almond trees "this has been a catastrophe for me " he says of the economic chaos around the west bank growing numbers of business owners are similarly dependent on such assistance from aid groups a year old father of three with a bushy brown moustache mr nazal has spent his lifetime in the fields where his almond saplings rise today his family started growing lemon trees on this fertile plain west of jenin in the s mr nazals older brother khalid traded farm life for militancy a senior member of the palestine liberation organization khalid was gunned down on an athens street in its unclear who carried out the assassination a rival palestinian faction or mossad the israeli spy service a year after his brothers death mr nazal chose a different path opening the nursery with his father where his family had grown the lemon trees "my resistance was to stay and work our lands " he says between drags on an american cigarette his first year the nursery planted about olive tree saplings on less than one acre of land spread across two different fields there was little machinery except a subaru he drove between home and his plots he drives the same battered silver five speed today a string of muslim prayer beads wrapped around its gearshift his business grew soon he was tending some saplings including olive almond apricot and cherry trees a mix of israeli and palestinian farmers came from as far away as miles from the north and south to buy them by business was booming he rented more land hired additional seasonal workers and boosted production the next three years he carefully calibrated his mix of trees before planting each season balancing weather forecasts and demand patterns from his local customers "i knew exactly what they would want " he says the rest of the palestinian economy was surging as well west bank economic output grew by more than annually from to almost three times the rate of growth for israel but palestinian prosperity ended in late in september ariel sharon then israels right wing opposition leader marched to what is widely recognized as the third holiest site for muslims the al aqsa mosque in jerusalem built about centuries ago atop judaisms most sacred site the temple mount many palestinians saw it as a deliberate provocation in the midst of peace talks protests erupted turning into riots israel responded with tanks helicopter gunships and thousands of security forces killing dozens of palestinians within weeks palestinian militants answered with car bombs and suicide attacks against civilian targets inside israel israeli forces began blockading west bank population centers including mr nazals hometown of jenin at the time his operation was reaching the peak of its production with more than saplings rooted in his fields with the israeli west bank border all but closed israeli farmers disappeared from mr nazals fruit and olive groves israeli forces also closed roads inside the west bank to channel palestinian cars and trucks onto main arteries and through new manned checkpoints cities and villages were cut off from each other palestinian farmers had a hard time reaching the nursery at one point israeli soldiers surrounded mr nazals hometown of jenin declared it "a closed military area" and imposed an around the clock curfew for days mr nazal says he lost saplings in those two weeks because the curfew kept him from making the three mile run to his field to turn on the water fighting abated but movement restrictions didnt around jenins perimeter israeli soldiers dug trenches to cut the city off and built checkpoints at main arteries concrete barricades boulders and earth mounds bulldozed into place by israeli soldiers cut off byways used by mr nazal and other palestinians across the west bank the u n counted about roadblocks and more than manned checkpoints inside the palestinian territory by the summer of excluding those along israels border individual palestinians needed permits to cross checkpoints and move from town to town and were only allowed to be on the road from a m to p m israeli soldiers would roll their humvees across roads stopping and screening cars at "flying checkpoints " which still pop up across the territory today at the main checkpoint outside jenin through which mr nazals trees had to pass israel adopted a so called back to back system for cargo israel wouldnt issue permits for trucks to pass so goods had to be offloaded from an incoming truck then reloaded onto another one on the other side the system went up outside seven other major west bank cities in just the first two years of the fighting and the resulting restrictions the palestinian economy shrank by as the flow of workers raw materials and finished goods dried up according to a report by the world bank mr nazal says he was having a hard time getting to his own fields from home he used to complete the drive in the time it took him to smoke a single cigarette but long lines at checkpoints that could close without notice turned it into a two hour expedition he says curfews were imposed from town to town and day to day mr nazal says he frequently had to evade curfews and checkpoints to keep his trees alive once he tried to drive his subaru over a dirt mound that israeli soldiers plowed into a barricade across the middle of an unpaved roadway with israeli troops moving toward him in the distance his car got stuck a group of palestinian farmers helped push his subaru over the top in time to escape possible arrest the u n counted roadblocks and checkpoints in january farmers who braved the security gauntlet to reach mr nazals nursery purchased fewer and fewer trees their own fruit and olive sales were withering and they feared saplings would die on truck beds behind checkpoints in february following the death of palestinian leader yasser arafat new palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas called a truce with israel as violence tapered off israelis started dismantling roadblocks in july of that year the u n counted checkpoints and roadblocks down by almost half from months earlier ms rice helped work out a "movement and access" agreement between the two sides in late aimed at further reducing restrictions despite the peace and the rhetoric barrier numbers started going up again this summer the total reached according to the u n israeli officials wont discuss details citing security concerns but they are clearly worried about the rising power of hamas and dramatically stepped up security operations in the west bank after hamas won parliamentary elections in january a crackdown aided by tighter movement restrictions this has created a sort of catch internal west bank restrictions squeeze hamas but also damage hopes for prosperity needed to politically counter the group in the long run "its a very difficult subject " says mark regev an israeli government spokesman "we want to move forward and we have every reason to move forward in order to strengthen mr abbas but at the same time we dont want to create a security vacuum because we know who will move in to fill it " the u s the u n the european union and russia the so called quartet that spearheads international diplomacy on the israeli palestinian conflict have called at least times in the past five years for israel to ease restrictions the group has charged its special envoy former british prime minister tony blair to push the issue israeli prime minister ehud olmert pledged earlier this year to roll back the system but israeli defense officials said in september they would knock down only a small number of dirt mounds blocking roads between some palestinian villages earlier this year israeli officials acknowledged that barriers they claimed were "dismantled" never existed the bush administration has been channeling a wave of international assistance into the west bank since hamas seized gaza fearing the militants might ultimately mount a similar challenge there but assistance wont have a lasting impact in the west bank unless travel restrictions are eased says naser abdul karim a palestinian economist "an israeli captain at just one important roadblock can wipe out the impact of international assistance in one day maybe one hour " he says foreign aid groups have tried to help mr nazal and other suppliers who have lost the business of farmers who can no longer reach them these groups take bids on only one or two varieties of saplings and because of the complexities of their arrangements with multinational funding sources buyers and the palestinian authority they only manage to identify what crops theyll buy just before the harvest when he plants mr nazal has to bet which variety theyll want and hes been a poor gambler thus far he once held onto a crop of olive trees for three straight seasons even though aid groups werent buying them this year he chose almond trees because he read somewhere he cant remember precisely where that arab states had plans to boost almond purchases from palestinian farmers firas badran a west bank agronomist who works with aid groups that buy the trees says he believes mr nazal probably bet well this time mr nazal estimates it would take three years for his business to return to normal even if his almond tree gamble pays off and travel restrictions are lifted he employs only four to workers depending on the season "if things were back to normal " he says "i could absorb employees "
