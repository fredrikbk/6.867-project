ipod of e book readers amazon taps apple strategy six years ago apple inc began remaking the digital music market with a portable gadget that could hold an entire music collection downloaded inexpensively from the web various companies from tiny rocket book to mighty sony corp have tried to do the same with electronic books but they havent caught on the same way indeed only about e book readers have been sold in north america as of today compared with more than million ipods according to richard doherty research director of the envisioneering group a technology assessment and market research firm now amazon com inc the online retail giant has come up with what it hopes will be the ipod of e book readers the kindle which can download books newspapers and web content wirelessly and includes a keyboard for annotating books as well at &# the same initial price as the original ipod the kindle is &# more than the rival sony reader but amazon believes it is bringing innovations that will justify the price "our vision is to have every book that has ever been in print available in less than seconds " says jeff bezos the companys chief executive officer besides ease of downloading mr bezos believes amazon can win over consumers with attractive pricing for content it is initially offering more than electronic versions of books for kindle with best sellers and new releases priced at &# and classics as low as &# newspapers such as the new york times and the wall street journal and magazines such as fortune will be available at monthly subscription fees kindle users will be able to access the web via wireless connection on the sprint network which is fairly extensive in the u s users wont receive bills for wireless access which taps the same high speed data network as advanced cellphones but amazon is passing along some of the cost of that wireless delivery to consumers in email and blog fees consumers can receive documents sent to them through the kindle through a unique email address that costs cents per message they cannot access their microsoft corp outlook email but they can access free web based email accounts through yahoo inc or google inc users can access a free web browser on the new reader reading blogs in a data feed will cost kindle customers cents or more a month for a subscription a controversial feature "youre paying a premium price for whats given away for free online" through ad supported web sites says joel johnson who writes for boing boing and says he reads hundreds of blogs a day even though bloggers will get to share in the revenue amazon generates he says "as an end user its a bummer " like others to enter the field amazon is placing a bold bet readers will warm to the idea of reading long form works on a display screen instead of paper the kindle has a display from e ink corp the same technology used by sonys reader that requires no backlight and provides an experience that is akin to reading on paper even in direct sunlight another advantage for aging readers is that users can boost the type size of their reading material many other companies have tried their hand at e books including xerox corp s gyricon unit philips electronics nv barnes &amp noble inc and gemstar tv guide international inc yet sales success to date has been slight arthur klebanoff co founder and chief executive of new york based rosetta books llc an e book publisher estimated that e book sales in the u s range between &# million to &# million early versions of e book readers were originally based on the same sorts of display screens and other technology used in laptop computers as a result the devices tended to be heavy difficult to read in sunlight and featured low battery life sony addressed some of those shortcomings last year with the reader the company hasnt disclosed sales figures but idc analyst richard shim says the product was hampered by issues such as the need to be plugged into a computer to download content "i like the sony reader but it was built by technology people " says evan schnittman vice president business development rights academic &amp usa divisions oxford university press "the kindle device was clearly built by readers " sony defended its progress noting that reader sales are ahead of expectations "the reader continues to build momentum every day " said steve haber senior vice president of digital imaging and audio division for sony electronics which oversees the e book he views the kindle as less a threat than a force for expanding buyer awareness "its more opportunity for consumers to see this evolution of digital books " mr haber says still skepticism abounds over whether e books will ever be considered as cool as portable music or as appealing to younger consumers "no one is going to buy kindle for its sex appeal " says ross rubin director of industry analysis for consumer technology at the npd group a market research firm "its not some digital fashion statement like apple products " "i spend more time listening to music than reading books " said bill battle a year old self described "tech head" and avid reader "if i want to listen to music on the run i need a music player if i need to read on the run theres something to be said for a book " mr battle said he waited for the ipod price to drop to &# before he bought it and will wait for amazon to lower the kindle price before he buys one even some dedicated fans of digital technology say they have their doubts about reading books in an electronic format "i have an iphone where i have a copy of ben franklins autobiography and a dictionary but i dont consider it a reading medium " says antony van couvering ceo of names at work llc a digital consulting firm mr van couvering who has stopped buying newspapers on newsstands because he prefers reading them online says he likes the physicality of a book and the sense of making progress as he reads "im going to have to be convinced " he says one of the biggest questions about kindle named to convey the "igniting" of knowledge amazon says is its potential impact on book prices at a time when the average hardcover costs &# or &# amazons &# pricing on best sellers may draw some consumers from physical volumes for example during his presentation mr bezos showed the audience that he had purchased a copy of ken folletts novel "the pillars of the earth " talk show hostess oprah winfreys most recent book club pick the new deluxe paperback edition is &# on amazon the kindle edition is priced at &# amazon prevents users from sharing purchased e books with friends the way they can with a physical book some publishers say that the price difference reflects how the books will be used "the physical book is of enduring value " says brian murray president of news corp s harpercollins worldwide "but if you are traveling the digital edition may be more attractive they each have different attributes " mr murray said harpercollinss policy is to sell its e books at below the prevailing physical book price a hardcover book price for example might be &# which means harpercollins sells that copy to e book retailers for about &# the e book edition of a fancy &# paperback is about &# which harpercollins sells to amazon for about &# in effect it appears that amazon may be able to make a little money on the e book editions of some fancy paperbacks but little if any profit on e book hardcovers craig berman director of retail and technology communications for amazon commented via email that "as is our usual practice we dont discuss or disclose the arrangements we have with our partners " mr bezos while praising the enduring attributes of books with paper pointed to a series of benefits from the electronic variety with little cost to manufacture or store books books should always be in stock and never go out of print he contends see related letter "letters to the editor the weight of knowledge bears hard on little backs" wsj
