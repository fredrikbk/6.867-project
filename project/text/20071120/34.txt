dont get ur pills text messaging for health new services use cellphones to quickly send information deciding whats appropriate kate hemond a nanny who cares for six children was considering salmon for their supper recently standing at the fish counter of a whole foods market near boston she pulled out her cellphone to text message a service that could tell her whether the farmed atlantic or the wild alaskan contained polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs which are known toxic substances "if one fish had higher levels we wouldnt want to serve that to the children " said ms hemond years old the new text messaging service that ms hemond uses which culls government advisories and scientific studies to provide environmental information on species of fish is part of an emerging wave of technology that allows consumers to get instant health information through their cellphones text messaging is fast cheap and private unlike voice mail it is easier to recall and easier to respond to and unlike email it doesnt require a blackberry or other email device when people are on the go in england women have received text reminders to take their birth control pills in australia texting helped aids patients adhere to complicated drug regimens and german researchers are examining how text messages can offer psychological support to bulimics a recent study in new zealand found that smoking cessation programs were more effective in conjunction with supportive text messages the san francisco health department started a texting service for sexual health information last year in response to rising gonorrhea rates among african american adolescents and young adults via a text message number advertised in public transportation and on billboards callers can request answers to common questions provided by the citys health department as well as details about health services available in town according to a preliminary evaluation of the system called sexinfo and based on a similar program in britain there were more than inquiries in the first weeks and more than half of those led to follow up questions and referrals to health clinics the service doesnt track what the referrals were for the top three messages that were accessed by users were "what do if ur condom broke " " find out about stds " and "if u think ur pregnant " in california parental consent isnt required for people over years old seeking reproductive health services in the u s health texting "is just starting up " says jonathan linkous executive director of the american telemedicine association a trade and professional group in washington mr linkous says the organization is developing guidelines on the appropriate use of text messaging as well as other technologies such as videoconferencing and email for delivering health information "there are obviously times when telemedicine is inappropriate " he says "texting someone to tell them they have cancer is one of them " in some cases texting involves a language all its own in order to squeeze enough information onto tiny cellphone screens such abbreviated "text speak" or "txtspk " is familiar to the instant message generation but may be confusing to anyone over say a few of the new services targeting adolescents use text speak intentionally as a way to appear hip but others are wary and try to communicate in plain albeit shortened language when it comes to content mr linkous says any type of health care information delivered to the patient should adhere to generally accepted standards and guidelines from the medical community "if its appropriate in the office its appropriate remotely " he says the majority of the programs dont cost users anything more than they are already paying for text messages through their various phone plans and for the most part all types of cellphones work in general the only information needed is the number to text and the unique message needed to access the service for example texting "sexinfo" to will connect users of the metro pcs phone service to the san francisco health information people with other cellphone providers can text another number some outfits

message reminders so they will be familiar with the message when it arrives a company called smile reminder in lehi utah lets businesses such as dentists and spas automatically send text and email messages to remind customers of appointments for dieters a company called sensei inc in boca raton fla part owned by insurer humana inc will send weight loss advice and information to sprint and at&amp t mobile phone users for a weekly fee starting at &# the information shows up in a multimedia format rather than as a text message for fishphone the text service used by ms hemond the massachusetts nanny the process is pretty simple users send a text to the number with the message "fish" and the species and then get back a message ms hemond opted for wild alaskan salmon over farmed because of its healthier profile according to fishphone which was launched last month through blue ocean institute a nonprofit marine conservation organization that also offers information via email and on the web there is some debate over how beneficial text messaging can be in certain areas for instance it may not be of much use to the elderly who are generally averse to using new technology in health care according to a report from vodafone group plc the british mobile phone provider in mental health mr linkous of the telemedicine association says his group is currently working with psychiatrists and others to develop clinical guidelines on "telemental health " which would cover the types of technology that might be appropriate for counseling patients with certain conditions if for instance a person suffers from agoraphobia a fear of unfamiliar settings technology such as videoconferencing could provide an effective medium for counseling he said rifat atun professor of international health management at imperial college in london says several hospitals in england text message appointment reminders and test results texting has also caught on among some physicians in personalized tracking of acute and chronic medical conditions such as asthma and diabetes for example in one study in scotland young diabetics could send a text message to their doctor to check how to modify their insulin treatment after eating certain foods or drinking alcohol at a party the effectiveness of texting in addressing health problems hasnt been rigorously tested on a large scale dr
