tyson dealt blow on no antibiotic label the u s department of agriculture has told tyson foods inc that it can no longer label its products as "raised without antibiotics " a blow to one of the nations largest chicken producers the company which has spent tens of millions of dollars since june on an advertising and labeling campaign to distinguish its product from competitors is scrambling to salvage the label the decision conveyed in a previously nonpublic letter dated nov comes after the springdale ark company received approval by the usda in may to label its products as "raised without antibiotics " a coveted term in the industry that companies are seeking as a way to appeal to consumers concerned about the use of antibiotics in animals the labeling was a coup for tyson and the following month the company announced with fanfare that it would become the "first major poultry company to offer fresh chicken raised without antibiotics on a large scale basis " at the time the label was approved consumer protection groups lauded tysons decision and urged other major poultry producers to follow suit now the usda says it made a mistake in approving the label daniel engeljohn an official at the usdas office that oversees labeling decisions said the department is trying to "make sure labels are truthful and not misleading" and "our consistent position is if youre going to make a raised without antibiotics claim that there will be no antibiotics that were included in the feed during the life of the animal " a usda spokeswoman said tysons "labels should not bear a no antibiotic claim" and the food safety and inspection service of the usda "mistakenly approved the labels that were contradictory to this policy " tyson disagrees with the decision and for the past few weeks has been in discussions with the usda trying to "convince them that we are right and that they made a mistake " said gary mickelson spokesman for tyson he said the company intends to have the issue resolved before thanksgiving at the heart of the usdas decision lies a type of animal medication called ionophores which are commonly added to poultry feed to help prevent an intestinal colonization by coccidia a single celled organism that can lead to lower body weight or death in poultry causing economic loss to producers tyson said the product isnt technically an antibiotic but instead is an antimicrobial in the usdas letter however the agency said "it is longstanding fsis policy that ionophores are antibiotics " tyson also said the usda approved the label earlier in may with full knowledge the company was using ionophores in its poultry feed however the usda said it was "recently drawn to the attention of senior officials at the food safety inspection service" that tysons poultry feed formulations contained ionophores the company has days to remove the labels from its products or stop using ionophores the agency also gave the company the option of petitioning the usda to initiate a public comment period on whether ionophores could be used in meat and poultry products labeled as "raised without antibiotics " also the agency gave tyson the option of submitting a new label application with new documentation tyson is in the process of submitting a new label application that would ask the usda to allow the company to modify its label to explain that the medication isnt an antibiotic that presents the possibility of creating antibiotic resistance in humans tyson said that because ionophores are metabolized by the bird before the meat reaches the dinner table consumers dont need to worry about consuming meat raised on ionophores that could lead to human antibiotic resistance margaret mellon director of the food and environment program for the union of concerned scientists a health and environmental organization in washington said she is "mystified" and "troubled" by the usdas decision to rescind tysons label and to classify ionophores as an antibiotic ms mellon who works with a group called keep antibiotics working a coalition of consumer health groups is opposed to the agencys classification because ionophores arent used in human medicine as a result it is unlikely they could develop disease resistance that could lead to an undercutting of the efficacy of drugs in humans also she said ionophores dont target bacteria like antibiotics do instead they target the single celled organisms that can be found in livestock and poultry tysons research showed that of consumers said they think it is important to eat chicken raised without antibiotics "despite this process that were going through we remain committed to the raised without antibiotic program and we fully intend to proceed with it " mr mickelson said
