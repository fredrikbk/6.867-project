rate cut speculation dominates market will they or wont they thats the question buzzing around wall street with widespread speculation about whether federal reserve policy makers will cut short term interest rates at their next meeting on sept the recent tightening of lending and bond markets due to rising defaults on subprime mortgages has led to a chorus of calls for u s central bankers to step in with a cut in their target short term interest rate lower rates could give the economy a shot in the arm by making it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow and thus boosting spending fed action could also help cushion the downturn in the housing market if mortgage rates also decline on friday the dow jones industrial average advanced points or after a speech by fed chairman ben bernanke increased investor optimism that a rate cut is indeed on the way mr bernanke said the fed will "act as needed to limit the adverse effects on the broader economy that may arise from the disruptions in financial markets " investors were also encouraged by a white house plan to help stabilize the housing market for the week the dow industrials declined leaving the benchmark up for the year to date but down from the record close of on july the nasdaq composite index gained last week and is up so far in earlier in the week jitters about the feds plans helped send spasms through the stock market on tuesday the dow tumbled points in part due to the release of minutes from the feds aug meeting that showed central bankers were more concerned that the economy is weakening than previously thought the following day the dow roared back points after the release of a letter in which mr bernanke told sen charles schumer d n y that policy makers are prepared to "act as needed" to maintain economic stability the recent volatility is likely to continue until the feds sept meeting unless the central bank decides to make a rare intermeeting move before then but economists say thats not likely to happen unless the markets volatility gets much more severe "volatility is definitely here to stay its not going to go away " says jeffrey kleintop chief market strategist of lpl financial services the fed stopped raising short term rates in june when it boosted its target to the last of straight quarter point increases that started in policy makers havent been in a rush to lower rates from current levels because they remain concerned about the threat of inflation despite a sharp downturn in the housing market as recently as a month ago most economists figured the fed would keep rates steady for the rest of the year and into early but with credit markets in turmoil expectations for a rate cut have jumped sharply "its not that the inflation risks have significantly diminished but they have been surpassed by the growth risk " says brian sack a senior economist at macroeconomic advisers which expects the fed to reduce rates by a quarter percentage point at the september meeting not everyone is convinced the fed will cut rates or that it needs to james paulsen chief investment strategist at wells capital management thinks the economy is in decent shape despite the downdraft in housing "my guess is the fed will not ease at the meeting " he says "if i am the fed i wouldnt waste a cut on a regular scheduled meeting id save it for when it was needed to boost panicky confidence and otherwise unless real economic growth fades i wouldnt use it " mr paulsen thinks now is a good time for investors to bargain hunt he likes financial stocks which have taken a beating amid worries about hidden subprime mortgage time bombs on bank balance sheets many banks have exposure to the housing market through funding of mortgage related securities and direct investments in the mortgage market mr paulsen isnt naming names but among some hard hit financial stocks securities firm bear stearns bsc has fallen more than this year after two of its hedge funds ran into trouble from investments in subprime mortgages countrywide financial cfc the nations biggest housing lender has tumbled more than amid concerns about rising defaults on mortgages lpls mr kleintop likes the prospects for the economy and the market unless data show major slowdowns in business spending and global economic growth tech stocks are among his favorites right now in part because the sector shows very little dependence on the credit market the industry should also benefit from relatively strong business spending and global growth even if u s consumers start to tighten their belts on the other side of the aisle and illustrating the diverse views on wall street that are pulling stocks in different directions is richard suttmeier chief market strategist of rightside advisors in new york he thinks investors are seeing the beginning of a bear market even if the fed cuts rates over the next year or so he expects the dow to fall points from its record more than the drop that is considered a bear market a key economic release on friday the august nonfarm payrolls report is likely to play a part in the feds decision making if the report indicates the labor market is weakening that will raise expectations for a rate cut even further in july the economy added just jobs after an increase of in june and in may the unemployment rate ticked up to from in each of the previous three months alan skrainka chief market strategist at edward jones in st louis thinks the jobs report and other economic data will show that the economy is slowing after several quarters of solid growth he expects the fed will begin a series of rate cuts at its next meeting what should investors do large stocks that pay dividends and stocks from developed international markets should hold up relatively well in a slowdown mr skrainka says some investors may be inclined to celebrate a weak jobs number since it would make a rate cut more likely but watch what you wish for if the labor market is weakening it indicates that serious trouble could be brewing for the economy which wouldnt be a good environment for stocks email forum sunday wsj com
