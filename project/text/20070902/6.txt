love &amp money the allowance strategy shifts again in recent months ive noticed a shift in my sons consumer patterns gone are the days when "buy me something daddy" meant a &# pack of trading cards now it typically means an expense of &# or more while i admit it wasnt always the right approach i generally didnt mind buying those trading cards on occasion whats &# when it made my son so excited as a dad i got as much out of the expense as he did but &# is a whole different game and one i generally refuse to play still just because he isnt old enough to have a job doesnt mean he shouldnt be able to afford the items preteens want so with his th birthday approaching my wife amy and i are once again changing how we dispense our sons allowance this time were focused on teaching him how to manage money beyond one week to prioritize purchases and to save a portion of every paycheck through the years lots of readers have questioned why we even pay an allowance noting that preteens in particular have no routine need for cash if a child wants an item that you the parent cant afford or wont pay for then the adult response is to firmly say no some suggest that we should briefly explain that "the family has other obligations that are more important right now " i dont agree with that approach allowances can be excellent teaching tools moreover quashing a childs every consumer desire risks a financial rebellion at some point i talk to people all the time who complain that a spouse is a spendthrift who cant save a dollar and has no money management inclinations they frequently link it to the partners parents who often treated childhood financial wants as frivolous or unworthy of the familys resources now their partners are effectively getting even with mom or dad by spending freely on just about every desire when amy and i started paying our son an allowance at about age we wanted to use it to teach age appropriate financial lessons on various occasions weve re evaluated our allowance scheme to gauge its effectiveness as our son has aged each year around his birthday when we increase his weekly allowance by &# to match his age we look back over key money related issues weve had with him in the prior year and if necessary devise a new strategy to address whatever issue has emerged amy and i talk about our various strategies in our weekly video which you can see at wsj com video longtime readers may remember in fact that last year amy and i completely axed his allowance at least in the traditional sense we still paid him his weekly dole but we didnt pay it to him directly we put in place a system under which his mom or i would spend the equivalent of &# on his weekly wants as long as he improved on certain school related tasks such as remembering to bring home the correct textbooks our aim was to use the allowance as positive reinforcement bring home x and earn y to modify behavior it was an approach that worked well with our sons outlook on life he gets down on himself when reprimanded for something he knows he did wrong but thrives on praise and strives to do right so rather than losing his allowance for failing at some task he wanted a system that rewarded him financially for doing something right and though there were lapses the new system has worked pretty well now were modifying that approach the need to change our sons allowance stemmed from his recent requests for all sorts of fairly expensive items a &# gadget to connect his handheld videogame player to the wireless network in our house a &# book detailing so called cheat codes for this game a &# doohickey to plug these cheat codes into his game and a &# monthly subscription to a kids only web site he enjoys and he wanted mom and me to foot much of the costs because his &# allowance obviously couldnt afford everything at one moment and waiting weeks to obtain each seemed interminably long amy and i saw this as a perfect opportunity to use his allowance to teach him how to budget and choose among competing wants moreover it was an excellent chance to begin instilling the idea of saving a meaningful piece of his income so instead of paying him weekly weve begun doling out a full months worth of allowance at one time &# the largest sum he has ever seen on a routine basis its a strategy several parents tell me they use some give their teenagers a full quarters worth of allowance to force them to think well beyond their immediate wants and one dad i know gives his college age daughter a years worth of allowance for tuition rent food and clothing at the beginning of each school year if she runs out because of reckless spending shes out of luck and must figure out how to earn the money she still needs she has become "quite proficient at money management " he says this new arrangement was partly our sons idea he wanted access to a larger sum so he could afford larger purchases but as we explained the larger sum comes with larger responsibilities since he must decide whats most important and budget accordingly as part of the plan though he cant spend every dollar he must save of his allowance a rule designed to instill behavior that i hope will carry over for his entire life amy and i can explain as we routinely do the utility of saving a big part of your income for larger wants emergencies or a sense of financial security but those words regularly fall flat so now were making saving a regular part of every paycheck he receives going so far as to drive him to the bank the day hes paid so he can fill out a deposit slip and hand &# of his allowance over to the teller the money in the bank is pretty much off limits for his spending if hes going to learn to spend like the big boys hes going to learn to save like one too jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal write him at lovemoney wsj com
