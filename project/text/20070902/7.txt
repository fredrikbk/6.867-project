marketwatch for some funds smaller is better in searching for top mutual fund companies to invest with dont ignore the little guy the best performing small firms often do better than similarly high ranking large firms regardless of whether they own small cap midcap or large cap stocks or follow a value or growth investment style forty percent of money managers in the top of their peers have less than &# billion in total under wraps according to research from financial services firm northern trust for investors the message is that giving money exclusively to industry giants shuts out a large group of talented stock pickers broadening horizons to include small firms boosts the odds of finding innovative managers with results in the top of their peers says ted krum a vice president at northern trust who helps institutional clients with money manager searches new research mr krum expects to release this fall looked at results over five years through for managers investing in small cap and midcap stocks it found that among firms in the top of their class the smallest players handling less than &# billion delivered returns almost two percentage points better than the giants tiny investment shops returned annualized on average in the period which covered both bull and bear markets while firms of &# billion to &# billion in size averaged competitive gains the research says performance slipped as assets grew the study reports midsized firms with &# billion to &# billion gained on average while the biggest outfits managing &# billion to &# billion posted average gains of on the flip side however bigger firms evidently have a slight edge the worst performing small firms with a average gain underperformed the worst giant firms return the analysis advances a northern trust research paper in which small managers investing in midcap and large cap stocks outdid their larger counterparts this pattern has repeated itself in several updates since mr krums original study small managers bring other advantages over larger organizations mr krums work suggests including the ability to protect their investors better in down markets these managers can be agile when buying and selling stocks so they may be better able to ride bull runs and sidestep a bears swipe but bigger firms trade huge share volumes that impact stock prices daily across the board "when you invest with a big firm you are the market " mr krum says "if the market is going down you cant get out of your own way " moreover emerging firms tend to be more entrepreneurial and independent minded qualities their owners acknowledge "having a small number of assets gives you the ability to be more flexible in the investments you choose " says bob killen chief executive of killen group in berwyn pa which runs about &# million mostly in its berwyn funds "we can get in and out of a position in one day " adds don hodges whose dallas based hodges capital management oversees about &# million in the hodges fund hdpmx "some funds might take two weeks " when choosing among smaller firms take a page from institutional investors mr krum looks for a spotless record of compliance with regulatory agencies a star manager or cohesive team and incentives tied to firm ownership and fund performance "we want to see a decision making process that is crisp and fast moving " mr krum says but make sure a firm isnt gathering assets too quickly adds jim peterson a vice president at the schwab center for financial research rapid growth may overwhelm a lone manager or firm he says and investing can take a back seat to marketing "institutions look at people process and investment philosophy " mr peterson says "things you think about are where did performance come from and what is it about their process that makes it likely theyll repeat " to find small manager standouts available to individual shareholders investment researcher morningstar searched firms with mutual fund assets of &# billion or less that boasted stock offerings in the top of their peers over the past five years hodges is a good example of a strong small shop with a single fund according to morningstar among other names auxier asset management which runs the auxier focus fund auxfx and al frank asset management manager of the al frank fund valux among families with more than one offering berwyn stood on the strength of its berwyn fund berwx and sibling berwyn income fund berix other noteworthy multifund firms in the fund screen included saturna capital the firm has about &# million in assets mostly in the large

banks saturna also manages the nonfaith based sextant fund family including sextant international fund ssifx saturna founder nicholas kaisersays one key to a small firms appeal is alignment with shareholders interests and more personalized service indeed dialing some small funds directly gets the manager on the line that said mr kaiser echoes a finding in the northern trust research investing with a mom and pop shop carries the risk that poor results will torpedo its business "most small firms probably do best if they have several strategies because time does weed out poor strategies " mr kaiser says "a small adviser is just like an investor " he adds "the more diversified he is the more stable that firm can be " jonathan burton writes for marketwatch www marketwatch com email forum
