dont count on your house for retirement if the current turmoil in the housing and credit markets tells us anything about retirement planning it should be this think twice about how big a role your home will play in subsidizing your future in recent years many families even those with savings on the small side have been able to think about retirement with some measure of confidence thats because the value of their homes in most cases has soared the thinking goes something like this if my budget gets tight in retirement the equity in my home will serve as a safety net indeed a study released last week by bell investment advisors in oakland calif found that of surveyed year olds count their personal residence as a retirement asset and of that one in four say their home represents half or more of their retirement savings the past several months though illustrate the risks involved in looking to your home to support your retirement home prices nationwide are falling and the decline is accelerating see the stat of the week if the value of your home falls which many americans had come to assume would never happen theres less equity to help finance your retirement "ive seen attitudes change in just the past days " says ron kelemen a financial planner in salem ore "people arent as self assured about real estate as the answer to everything including their retirement needs " when it comes to your nest egg and retirement mr kelemen says "what really matters is what assets will produce spendable income every month " with that in mind he suggests dividing your net worth into two categories "financial independence assets" and "lifestyle assets " the former includes everything you would be willing to sell and convert to an income stream today in many cases your house doesnt belong in that first category you might be planning to sell your house and move to a smaller and less expensive home as you enter retirement what happens though is that retirees often end up staying where they are most people after all like their homes or if they do sell buy a home of equal or greater value "we have observed many clients over the years that had good intentions " mr kelemen notes "but became too attached to their lifestyle or the asset to actually convert it " interest rates too could have a big effect on plans you might have to tap the equity in your home especially if youre thinking about a reverse mortgage with this type of borrowing you can receive monthly payments a lump sum or a line of credit the amount you can borrow is tied in large part to prevailing interest rates the higher the rate the less money you get from a lender at current rates which remain near historic lows you might be able to get a bit less than half the value of your house through a reverse mortgage but with credit markets tightening even small increases in interest rates could significantly reduce your payout
