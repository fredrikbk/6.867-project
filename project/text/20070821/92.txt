slaying californias health care hydra your editorial "arnolds health flop" review &amp outlook aug was shortsighted in prematurely declaring californias health care debate dead in more than of californians want health care reform and the budget stalemate does not change that more than of californians support gov arnold schwarzeneggers plan which addresses the rising cost of care with policies that will improve access affordability and quality for everyone the fact of the matter is that rising health care costs are burdening businesses and threatening the economy in california and across the nation companies are seeing double digit increases in their health care costs at the same time the uninsured population continues to grow and workable solutions are harder to achieve political jockeying and inaction will not cure the problem that is why more than of our nations employers have joined together to form the coalition to advance healthcare reform we believe that the health care crisis is a business issue just as much as it is a social issue we agree that market based solutions like those proposed by gov schwarzenegger that cover everyone incorporate prevention and wellness as a core value increase transparency and share responsibility for costs among government individuals and employers are the right prescription to solve this problem the opportunity for health care reform is alive and well in california i am optimistic that within the next month the states legislative leaders and the governor can come together to develop market based comprehensive reforms that drive down costs increase quality of care and achieve coverage for all californians steve burd ceo safeway inc chairman of the coalition to advance healthcare reform gov schwarzeneggers health care proposals in california inadvertently redefined his new concept of "post partisanship" as something that not a single member of either party in the california legislature was willing to put forward the hodge podge of proposals was not just awful but unnecessarily complex and difficult to understand a few isolated good ideas such as exempting contributions to health savings accounts from california taxes as most states do were lost in the rube goldberg machine most proposals would have substantially increased the cost of health care directly such as the "fee" on the gross revenue of physicians and hospitals or indirectly through even more insurance coverage mandates and regulations than exist today such as paying for gym memberships the proposals did nothing to meet the need for a national market for portable insurance that individuals could own and take from job to job in any state the response was stunned silence from some quarters or calls for huge but simple tax increases from others one has the uncomfortable feeling that this may have been a case of good intentions trying to circumvent reality rather than starting with proposals that raise taxes impose expensive mandates and require higher insurance costs the first steps should be to lower costs eliminating mandates and allowing competition from insurance companies in any state would lower the cost of basic insurance exempting all health insurance premiums and out of pocket expenses from tax would also make it more affordable people who cannot afford insurance surely cannot afford to pay taxes on the income they use for premiums the reason affordable health insurance is not available in california is because it is forbidden by law richard e ralston executive director americans for free choice in medicine newport beach calif
