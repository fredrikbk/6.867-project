arrested development the death of the grown up by diana west st martins pages &# in the s most people who played video games were teenagers now the average gamester age is nearly cultural products aimed at tots and preteens capture the attention of adults "spongebob squarepants " intended for the to age group draws almost million viewers from the to crowd some famous museums uncomfortable with their adult role as guardians of historical memory have gone adolescent staging exhibits on motorcycles hip hop and "star wars" movies many college courses even on major campuses make rainy day activities at summer camp seem profound such examples of americas descent into perpetual adolescence populate diana wests provocative "the death of the grown up " ms west a columnist for the washington times argues that the country is suffering a case of arrested development with teen tastes and desires eclipsing traditional adult conduct and values a good deal of evidence supports her an obsession with play and self expression and a resistance to limits conventional hallmarks of adolescence are increasingly strong "adult" themes too ms wests style is impressionistic she collects comments anecdotes and occasional statistics to bolster her case that the s war against authority lives on in the lives of middle class grown ups the attitude of rebellious teens that adults are idiots percolates through the culture and is standard fare in sitcoms and tv ads ms west quotes the cultural critic lionel trilling writing that "making a life" or shaping the self by closing out certain options had once been "salient in the west " by the late s trilling felt it no longer was ms wests principal claim is convincing but her argument at times shades into nostalgia and conventional culture war rhetoric she quotes frank sinatra at a performance telling his screaming fans to pipe down they were bothering the grown ups those were the days similarly she approvingly quotes psychiatrist francis braceland saying that the music at a rock concert was "cannibalistic" and "a communicable disease " sinatra is quoted again this time saying in the s that rock n roll is "the most brutal ugly degenerate expression it has been my displeasure to hear " but sinatra a great musician moved toward at least a grudging admiration for the music that had supplanted his own among the young ms west picks on us bono for assuring grammy night fans that he would continue warning euphemism alert "messing up the mainstream " despite this over the top remark bono makes a poor target his work against aids has been inspiring and fully adult though she deplores the s ms west maintains that the countercultural rebellion of the young was actually set in motion a decade before she writes "the revolutions of the s begin to look like a mopping up operation a rearguard action to eradicate an already doomed ancient regime the adults " and again "it was in the s that the adult was pushed aside even before most baby boomers were even out of diapers " it is true that s rebelliousness didnt spring into existence overnight tensions over conformity mounted during the s and civil rights unrest began then but adults had not yet been "pushed aside " having grown up in teaneck in the s i can attest that new jerseys ancient regime was in sturdy shape throughout the period the ike era was no revolutionary time the s is a far better place to begin detecting the seeds of adolescent revolution but ms west thinks not she finds "no mention of teen age problems" in the famous middletown studies done in muncie ind in the s and s by robert lynd and helen merrill lynd but in fact the lynds noted the rising conflict in middletown between parents and their young arguments about too much drinking this was during prohibition and staying out too late were common the automobile mass produced and available to ordinary families offered the young the means of forming peer groups and a place to have sex the roaring s were a shock that did much to loosen parental controls a familiar argument holds that the rebellion of the s might have occurred decades earlier if the depression world war ii and the recovery period of the s had not intervened by not noticing the forces unleashed in the s ms west misses a chance to analyze the s youthquake that might have been another question for ms west if american adults are emotional slackers stuck in arrested development who is responsible for the innovations and incredible wealth generated by the economy accepting restraint and boundaries is important as ms west says but painting outside the lines is important too instead of founding their company in a friends garage while they were in their mid s larry page and sergey brin
