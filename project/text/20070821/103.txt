every business day sign up for the e mail here on friday evening with congress out of town on its summer recess and americans heading into a mid august weekend the bush administration sent a message to the states the federal government will make it tougher for a national childrens insurance program to cover the offspring of middle income families the state childrens health insurance program was created in to help children whose families couldnt afford insurance but didnt qualify for medicaid and administration officials tell the new york times that the changes are aimed at returning the program to its low income focus and assuring it didnt become a replacement for private insurance administration point man dennis smith wrote to state officials saying there would be new restrictions on the district of columbia and the states including california and new york that extend or plan to extend coverage for children whose families make more than of federal poverty levels for a family of three that is &# and for a family of four its &# under the new limits a child from a family making more would have to spend one year uninsured before qualifying and any state that wants to extend coverage would have to assure washington that at least of children eligible for schip or medicaid are enrolled in one of the programs but as the associated press reports no state can currently make such assurances rachel klein deputy director of health policy for advocacy group families usa tells the ap that since many families above the threshold cant afford private insurance "the effect of this policy is to have more uninsured kids " ann clemency kohler deputy commissioner of human services in new jersey tells the times the changes "will cause havoc with our program and could jeopardize coverage for thousands of children " states have already been imposing waiting periods and taking other steps to prevent parents from moving their children from private insurance to schip which currently serves some million children the washington post notes the administrations new restrictions come as the program which expires at the end of next month if congress doesnt reauthorize it is the subject of a larger political fight that pits the white house against democrats and some republicans in congress and state capitals both houses of congress have passed legislation that would expand the program by tens of billions of dollars to insure more children with the backing of republican senators and a handful of republican representatives lawmakers are expected to reconcile the house bill and a more limited senate version when they return from the august recess as the wall street journal reports but the white house said the legislation "goes too far in federalizing health care " and that without tighter spending limits president bush will veto it white house cheney snub subpoenas another simmering standoff between the white house and congress flared up yesterday when the office of vice president dick cheney responded to a senate subpoena about warrantless wiretapping separately from the white house response resurrecting what the hill notes is a controversial assertion that mr cheney isnt part of the executive branch yesterday was the deadline set by senate judiciary committee chairman patrick leahy when the white house sought an extension for his request for information on the surveillance program but white house counsel fred fielding asked for a second delay saying a deferral until after labor day would help the two sides find a way to work out their differences mr cheneys office said it does indeed have documents related to the surveillance program but that it will resist congresss efforts to see them as the washington post reports mr leahy responded by saying that if the documents arent produced by the time congress is back in session he will pursue contempt proceedings against administration officials a possible date for petraeus presidential spokesman gordon johndroe yesterday reiterated that gen david petraeus the american commander in iraq and ambassador ryan crocker will testify next month in open congressional hearings about the status of the white houses current strategy for iraq but that hearing may be less contentious and more solemn than anticipated the white house says it will likely take place on sept according to the hill one person nonetheless likely to take heat at the petraeus hearing will be iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki senior u s commanders in iraq are increasingly at odds over whether mr malikis weakened government can make the political progress the current surge of u s troops is aimed at making possible the wall street journal reports though gen petraeus and some others "say mr maliki is starting to take small steps needed to build a multisectarian state or at least should be given more time a growing number of officers say they are concerned the current u s strategy wont produce lasting gains unless he is replaced " the journal says army chief of staff george casey says that when recently meeting with regional u s commanders in baghdad "he was taken aback by the intensity of anti maliki sentiment among senior u s officers " according to the journal meanwhile the top democrat and republican on the senate armed services committee jointly warned yesterday that "time has run out" on mr malikis efforts to form a political consensus the new york times adds as national security officials and members of congress continue to debate how to improve or start to end the u s operations in iraq a video has surfaced on youtube of a senior bush administration official predicting as long ago as that an invasion of iraq would lead to a "quagmire" and possibly split the country in pieces dick cheney "once you got to iraq and took it over took down saddam husseins government then what are you going to put in its place " the vice president said when asked about the gulf war as the telegraph reports "thats a very volatile part of the world and if you take down the central government of iraq you could very easily end up seeing pieces of iraq fly off " mixed
