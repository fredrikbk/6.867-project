europes carbon con job brussels with all the supposed truths out there about global warming heres one that doesnt get reported very often europe isnt the climate change champion that its leaders and their american apologists would have you believe its true that emissions both in absolute terms and on a per capita basis remain higher in america than in the eu the countries that belonged to the european union before its expansion and which are widely used as a comparison for the u s when the subject is global warming and when it comes to decrying the planets impending doom and making grand gestures about preventing this europe is second to none lets assume though for arguments sake that most americans believe global warming is a real danger that carbon dioxide is public enemy no and that the only question is what to do about it before following europes lead in adopting a cap and trade system or mandatory renewable energy targets wouldnt you want to know that those actions will lead to something better than the status quo so would i and the numbers show that if america is the great carbon satan europe is certainly no angel since emissions of co have been growing more rapidly in europe with all its capping and yapping than in the u s where there has been minimal government intervention so far as of were talking about a rise in the eu versus a increase in the u s according to statistics from the united nations whats more preliminary data indicate that americas co output fell by from to if these numbers hold up it would mean u s emissions growth is nearly flat so far this decade europe hasnt yet released figures for last year but it did report in june that emissions from the participants in its carbon trading scheme which account for almost half of europes co production rose slightly in the news gets worse for europe when you consider that during this decade the u s population has grown at roughly double the rate of the eu while the american economy has been expanding about faster it seems europe is becoming less efficient in its carbon production while u s efficiency is improving now few people this writer included would look at these statistics and conclude that europe should necessarily adopt americas more passive approach when you talk about co emissions during this decade or even go back to the globally accepted "base year" of youre working with a small sample size and there really isnt much difference between a change of and one of so why would the u s instead want to adopt europes policies as a measure of the gap between europes rhetoric and its reality nothing beats its emissions trading scheme the idea is that co intensive companies chiefly those that produce power or use a great deal of it receive a certain number of permits to emit the gas if they reduce their emissions and end up with a surplus they can sell the extra permits to firms needing more allowances in this way market mechanisms are supposed to punish or reward companies for their carbon output encouraging them to reduce it in the long run in europe however the "market" consists of demand that government has created artificially and more important supply that the state distributes arbitrarily not surprisingly companies lobbied hard to ensure favorable allocations when trading began in the number of permits exceeded actual emissions and prices plummeted today allowances for tons of co are priced at about euro cents hardly high enough to prod a company to cut its carbon instead of just buying more permits if you think the u s congress whether led by democrats or republicans would be more likely to shun special interests in the name of environmentalism then ive got some tariff free brazilian ethanol to sell you brussels claims its correcting the system for the next trading period which runs from to but a number of holes will remain for instance its expected that companies will be able to buy permits outside the eu from other countries and then import them to cover their needs a large influx of permits could depress prices in the same way that the eus own overallocation did the first time around thats particularly true if third countries are lax in their issuance of permits "these non eu credits have already been exposed as highly flawed and often fraudulent " max andersson a green member of the swedish parliament wrote this month in a study for the think tank open europe "they dont always reflect absolute reductions in emissions whilst many of these credits are generated from projects in developing countries that would have happened anyway " the result he concludes is that emissions might not fall but rise another potential problem an energy industry source says that in many eu member states the allocation will likely be done in a way that gives sufficient permits to most of the firms that use a lot of energy leaving a shortage for electricity producers there might be some logic in that instead of relying on manufacturers to reduce their energy consumption power companies would have more of an incentive to produce electricity in a way that doesnt create as much carbon in the first place it would only work though as long as the power companies didnt buy additional permits and pass the cost along to customers instead of investing in real carbon cutting measures it would require competition to keep them from that temptation though and theres the rub the main players in large markets like france and germany are still effectively insulated from rivals and can set prices as they wish brussels has been trying for years to create a pan european energy market but it may be the better part of a decade before its finished european policy makers have plenty of motivation to goad washington into going along with their approach before too many people realize it isnt working at a summit in march eu national leaders dramatically raised the stakes by pledging a cut in co emissions by thats a real laugher considering their scant chances of meeting their kyoto commitment of by their move is best seen as a bluff intended to pressure the u s into the game here in europe the grand gesture is always the most appealing play mr wingfield is an editorial page writer for the wall street journal europe see related letter "letters to the editor millions of acres of trees up in smoke"
