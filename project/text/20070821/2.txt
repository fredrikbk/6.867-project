a new battlefront the sedate sedan as suvs fall from favor passenger cars are focus for makers latest push detroit midsize sedans such as the honda accord are the wonder bread and butter of the u s car market sedate but steady sellers now a redesigned accord and a flurry of spiffed up detroit rivals signal rising competition among car makers who see an opportunity to pump up profits in the segment honda motor co today unveils the eighth generation of the accord the second best selling passenger car in the u s behind toyota motor corp s camry the accords mechanical innovations have long made it an icon in the auto industry with the latest incarnation honda is trying to get car buyers attention as well with more passenger space and new engine technology that aims to boost horsepower without sacrificing fuel economy detroit auto makers are making their own bid to compete in midsize sedans as ford motor co brings back the taurus and general motors corp introduces an updated chevrolet malibu "i see a car war " says mark laneve gms top north american sales executive "i would say weve been sitting on the sidelines of those wars were going to be in this battle " nevertheless industry observers say u s makers will have a tough time making inroads in the sedan market dominated by honda toyota and nissan motor co auto makers new focus on midsize sedans comes as customers abandon sport utility vehicles because of concerns about high fuel prices foreign oil dependence and climate change for the first time in several years passenger cars have come close to overtaking sales of pickup trucks and suvs in the u s the new models seek to capture the interest of consumers who previously regarded &# &# sedans as boring conveyances for those who couldnt swing a luxury car or an suv through the s when gasoline was cheap detroits big three auto makers let the quality and styling of their midprice sedans languish dumping many into rental fleets toyota and honda meanwhile got by with dowdy looking cars that sold mainly on reputations for stellar reliability midsize sedans have been steady sellers over the years in the latest quarter they accounted for of total vehicle sales in the u s compared with in the same period a year earlier industry executives say the huge posse of aging baby boomers bidding farewell to minivans and suvs is a big potential customer base for cars that are reasonably priced but look and feel more expensive "vehicles in this segment are so good they can rival luxury vehicles " says gary robinson product planner for the new accord the honda accord set to arrive in showrooms in september will offer a top of the line model with a horsepower v engine more power than some bmw series cars moreover honda says the new accord isnt technically a "midsize" car any more with total passenger and cargo volume for the lx model just over cubic feet it qualifies as a large car aiming to appeal to americans eager for more space in their autos ford and gm have also tried to rev up power and styling in their entries gm plans to offer a horsepower v motor in the redesigned malibu due out in early up from the top level horsepower in the previous model borrowing looks from chevrolets of the s and s the dashboard has a "dual cockpit" design with a pronounced arc on the the passengers side as well as the drivers gm vice chairman robert lutz has said the malibu represents the most complete example yet of his strategy to revitalize the design of its u s models positioning the malibu as a critical test fords new chief executive alan mulally decided to bring back the taurus name which the company had dropped saying it was suffering from a rental car image mr mulally argued taurus once was the best selling car in america and that few consumers knew the name ford had chosen to replace it "five hundred " the reborn taurus technically a full size sedan but priced to compete with midsize cars has a new horsepower v engine ford is also touting the cars five star safety rating from the national highway traffic safety administration but car makers moves to emphasize horsepower and comfort in these sedans mean their mileage ratings show little improvement from the past a potential problem now that consumers are putting a higher priority on good fuel economy detroit companies in particular face a stiff challenge to regain sales in the passenger car market this year through the end of july asian and european brands sold million cars in the u s compared with u s makers million according to wardsauto com the web site for wards automotive reports domestic auto makers weakness in passenger cars is a big reason their combined overall market share in the u s dipped below for the first time last month of the top vehicles that consumers researched on kelley blue books web site during the first half of this year only four were made by detroit and just one fords mustang sports car came from the passenger car segment in the midsize car segment the camry and accord together accounted for of sales in the u s in the year through the end of july "the ship has sailed in the midsize sedan segment " says john casesa a former wall street auto analyst who now runs his own advisory firm "camry and accord are now established titans in that part of the market " detroit makers may not even be able to establish themselves in the second tier mr casesa says as nissans altima is the preferred choice after the camry and accord sedans detroits expectations are implicitly reserved as neither ford nor gm are planning the capacity for their new models to match the nearly new accords honda is likely to make for gms recent launch of the saturn aura a midsize sedan mechanically similar to the new malibu has been disappointing despite good reviews and a "car of the year" award at januarys detroit auto show gm sold only about auras through july according to autodata corp toyota sold more than camrys last month alone "the aura has underperformed my expectations a touch " says mr laneve at gm "i expected this car to leap out of the gates and it didnt "
