investors to web start ups wheres the advertising tech entrepreneur glenn kelmans online real estate brokerage redfin corp allows consumers to buy or sell homes online and takes a cut of each real estate transaction it brokers to mr kelman its a sensible business model but when he sought backing from venture capitalists this past spring he found the process much tougher than he had expected during his meetings with silicon valley financiers many kept urging the seattle company to start selling advertisements on its web site instead of making money from commissions he says "today theres nothing more fashionable than having an ads driven model " says mr kelman years old content to be unfashionable he stuck to his guns and ultimately raised &# million mr kelmans experience is one of many like it as venture capitalists increasingly advise consumer focused tech start ups to follow the same business model online advertising chief executives of web start ups such as enjoymymedia corp and cake financial corp say they have also recently faced tough questions from venture firms over their business models that dont rely on advertising income photo and video service enjoymymedia runs a few ads but mainly offers a paid service cake financial plans to charge customers fees for investment services "if you have a model that is different from the of consumer web companies folks are seeing today its difficult to break through that clutter " says cake ceo steven a carpenter whose san francisco firm ultimately snagged money from baseline ventures and alsop louie partners entrepreneurs say the laser focus on online advertising may be a sign of a declining risk appetite in silicon valley by focusing simply on advertising venture investors are concentrating on businesses that "arent as aggressive" as those that dominated the internet in its early days says redfins mr kelman he notes that web companies like his that are trying to disrupt brick and mortar industries would have a hard time surviving on advertising since ads tend to be linked to a web sites business and "if youre going to change the insurance industry youre not going to be running ads from the insurance industry " according to research firm ventureone u s investors in the first half of this year poured &# million into "web companies" generally ad supported web sites in fields like social networking or blogging up nearly in the year earlier period venture capitalists typically take stakes in start ups with the hope of cashing out later through a sale or initial public offering some venture capitalists say they are backing innovative consumer web companies that dont sell ads such as game companies that peddle "virtual goods " others are funding business focused companies that make money through more traditional means but in the world of consumer web services "everybodys under pressure to do ads " says brad silverberg a partner with bellevue wash venture outfit ignition partners his firm declined to fund redfin but mr silverberg says it was mainly because he was busy with other investments venture capitalists tend to be fans of ad driven sites since advertising revenue theoretically covers the cost of giving away a web service free and free sites attract users much faster than sites that charge money such sites are typically also cheap to run because there is often no need for customer service agents or costs for physical goods so such companies can have high profit margins if they succeed many of todays hottest web properties are based on the online ad model including google inc which pairs ads with search results and social networking site facebook inc u s internet advertising revenue reached nearly &# billion last year up from revenue has been rising since and "we have every confidence that this growth trend will continue " says randall rothenberg ceo of the interactive advertising bureau trade group in a may statement still most of that money remains concentrated on a few large sites raising questions about whether thousands of start ups can snag a significant piece of that pie and grow into large enough companies that could actually make money for their investors nonetheless some entrepreneurs trying to profit from non online ad models say they are being penalized for being different enjoymymedia which charges people a monthly subscription to post and share family videos photos and other materials through special online software has faced some "hard questions" from investors over its business model says ceo keith loris enjoymymedia runs some ads on its site but mr loris says the company is "very much counting" on people actually paying for the service its still looking for funding new york web company meetup inc which spurns ads and uses its web site to help people form local community groups says it hasnt had trouble raising money but "there are investors who certainly say youre not advertising youre missing out " says scott heiferman the companys co founder and ceo when mr kelman went looking for money earlier this year he says he had some awkward encounters with investors even though he says redfins business was growing quickly in presentations to venture capitalists redfin positioned itself as the e trade of real estate the company offers web tools to let home buyers research properties and then drafts offers online salaried redfin agents similar to call center employees then step in to help customers negotiate prices and close home purchases redfin rebates buyers two thirds of the commission it gets for representing them saving consumers an average of about &# mr kelman says "we would say were going to let people buy and sell homes online" and save them money mr kelman recalls of his meetings with investors "and half an hour through someone would say well where are the ads and wed say weve been trying to tell you no ads theyre like no ads when are you going to put them up " mr kelman says redfin talked to more than venture firms ultimately getting funding from firms such as draper fisher jurvetson though his executives originally "thought that if we met just a few that it would be sufficient " redfin which started its current service last year had previously raised &# million from seattle area venture firms some investors say they had concerns about redfins business that had nothing to do with online advertising for one the national association of realtors along with local home listing services have complex rules that make it difficult for online real estate companies to get access to a nationwide directory of home listings redfin says the association says it is "open to all business models and favors none " redfin says it has access to such directories now but without them the company would have no business because it would have no inventory of homes for sale mr kelman acknowledges in addition redfin is competing for venture dollars with online real estate web sites like zillow com the brainchild of expedia inc founder richard n barton zillow which sells ads doesnt act as a broker in transactions and focuses on offering people slick easy to find real estate information online one investor who says he heard redfins pitch says redfins online search engine isnt as easy to use as those offered by sites such as zillow and trulia inc another real estate player the investor who declined to be named and who didnt fund redfin adds that redfin could incur high costs to snag customers since it has to pay salaries to real estate agents and customer service employees mr kelman says he doesnt view zillow and trulia as competitors and worries more about traditional real estate brokers who are beefing up their online presence he adds "weve never denied that in some ways our business is more difficult to build than zillows or trulias" because redfin is in the brokerage business
