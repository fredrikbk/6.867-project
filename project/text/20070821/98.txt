the calculus of courting iraqi sheiks the situation in anbar province in which sunni tribesmen are allying with u s forces against al qaeda seems a desperate marriage of convenience with little if any benefit to stated u s goals as your article "how courting sheiks slowed violence in iraq" page one aug clearly points out the influence of these moderate local sheiks was diminished by the islamic extremists with help from the u s these sunni chiefs now are building strong militias after driving al qaeda out of anbar only to surface elsewhere u s officials are correct to be fearful the militias will turn their u s supplied weapons on shiites the rise of these tribal militias was organic only insofar as it was their clans desire to regain power the bush administrations repeated claim that this is a positive development that strengthens the so called unity government in baghdad is nonsense its only a classic case of "the enemy of my enemy is my friend " and at best it increases the likelihood of the ultimate partitioning of iraq arthur j barrett santa ana calif no one can blame the iraqi sheiks for hedging their bets in the past several years as they assessed the chances that al qaeda and the militant religionists might eventually become successful in their struggle for power had al qaeda been successful the only chance of survival for the sheiks and their people would be a definitive allegiance to al qaeda but the u s did not quit and now the sheiks have cast their lot with freedom economic independence and prosperity as proposed by the americans but wouldnt this be a good time for france and germany and other countries that have stood by the sidelines with high claims of moral superiority to support the cause of reconstruction in iraq the iraqi people and nation need security and economic prosperity this means a huge infusion of cash economic projects reconstruction projects and much more other nations could now flex their power as well and take up the momentum that is happening in iraq moving the iraqi people to economic independence and political stability yes the tide has turned in iraq but the waters are slack and the currents are weak vigorous help from many countries of the world would change that momentum to a vortex of change paulo juarez pereira san jose calif the marine corps payments to sheik hamid heiss are no different than the storekeeper paying protection money to a mobster except this is more akin to the police on the beat paying off the mob it is appalling that marines would even contemplate such measures it is degrading that marines actually are doing this steven rothman philadelphia the culture of the mideast is drastically different than what we have in the u s the cash that our armed forces find necessary to send to iraq sheiks to fund repairs etc would probably be considered immoral under our standards but it is the culture of the mideast where power and allegiance must be recognized for success ralph seger dearborn mich critics often express fears that the iraqis are ungovernable and undemocratic however it seems to me that they are just the opposite as in gen john allens description of their social organization "when the tribes are at their best they live in a condition of splendid equilibrium " that sounds like the spirit of representative cohabitation if not the textbook definition of democracy indeed when "the tribes are constantly shifting alliances to suit economic and security needs " they are by whatever degree no different from any other social entity in our history be it the puritans the iroquois confederation the mafia or any current american political party jockeying for public support during primary or general elections the intellectual integrity of our military officers and their efforts to sift through history for lessons to apply to the present shows that they have the wisdom acumen and diligence that our congressional leaders do not in fact anti war politicians make no attempt to demonstrate any understanding of the past and current situation except to appeal to the lowest level of ignorance among public opinion a level of ignorance that ironically is often found among the better educated classes of society richard reay riverdale n y
