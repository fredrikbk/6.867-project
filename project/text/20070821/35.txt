enterprise hardened in battle this company sets its goals in cement quick dry concrete may help roads on the home front over the past four years a small baltimore company led by a year army veteran has quietly made its mark in combat zones with an unlikely weapon fast drying cement unlike traditional cements that can take many hours or days to harden ceratech inc s line of repair products take roughly one to four hours to cure they can then be driven over immediately with trucks or aircraft thats been a boon for soldiers handling infrastructure repairs in afghanistan and iraq where insurgents often lie in wait for u s troops to pour concrete then hide improvised explosive devices in the still wet mix where it sits primed to explode but ceratechs repair work to date has mostly gone under the radar of industry observers and thats been intentional the overseas efforts were just a stepping stone as ceratech prepared to tackle another ailing infrastructure the one on the home front a mission brought into sharp focus with the deadly collapse of a heavily traveled bridge in minnesota this month cracking this market is no small feat the u s cement industry is dominated by established giants many of whom base their products on a proven basic recipe thats nearly years old ceratechs products use a markedly different formulation and its chief executive has been cautious to put the companys face out there too fast "we had issues with technology to perfect " says ceratechs ceo jon hyman years old "we needed to establish intellectual property we needed to fly under the radar and get some brand equity the risk of going the other way is you are pulling on supermans cape " its a low profile strategy small businesses sometimes forget in their rush to market ceratech has worked out kinks abroad and in initial u s tests with little scrutiny and now there may be real opportunity as government officials push harder to find solutions for repairing aging bridges and roadways with minimal disruption scott johnsen senior supervising engineer for structures and design for the new jersey turnpike authority says after minneapolis "weve been scrambling to pull info and were always asking is there a better way to build the mousetrap " over the past two years the new jersey authority has tested ceratech cement products which in addition to fast cure time also purport to bond better and to be more compatible with existing road and bridge materials while "theres still a learning curve " mr johnsen says "we do believe their product will provide superior performance over other quick setting materials weve been using " cement is one key component of concrete which also includes water and aggregates such as rock and sand most cement manufacturers today base their products on a longstanding formula called portland cement which involves heating ground up raw materials such as limestone sand and shale at very high temperatures to produce a substance called "clinker " the process emits about one ton of carbon dioxide and requires a barrel of oil for every ton of cement produced according to the environmental protection agency the clinker is then supplemented with additives to alter its curing time or give it other properties "its hard to compete with a product thats been around years " says rick bohan director of construction and manufacturing technology for the skokie ill based portland cement association he says new formulations "dont have a track record " and that his members are working on their energy efficiency ceratech by contrast uses no clinker and makes most of its cements with fly ash a waste byproduct from the combustion of coal in electric plants that distinction helps give ceratech cements an environmentally friendly image the company can use as a selling chit by holding back widespread rollout of ceratech products mr hyman says he has addressed certain criticisms with minimal disruption to business one problem his products were pricier than those of competitors and ceratech cement products werent available in a bulk format that could be transported in traditional ways such as the familiar spinning truck mixers instead the product came in buckets intended primarily for small repairs mr hyman says the company is now rolling out products that can be used in larger volume with regular distribution methods and at a lower cost as a small firm mr hyman says "we had no constraints we dont have a set way to approach things " he says he expects sales which totaled &# million in mostly to military buyers to double this year as the company gains traction in the u s texas has tested ceratech cements recently along with other states workers in texas used one of the companys cements to repair a portion of a bridge deck with high volume truck traffic in nacogdoches the repair by feet was completed in hours about half what it would have taken with other high strength cement products says paul montgomery director of maintenance for the lufkin district of the texas dot
