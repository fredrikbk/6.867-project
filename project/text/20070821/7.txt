after the tumult is it buffett time berkshire chief finds his popularity grows as more loans falter the bond market has seized up stocks are in turmoil private equity funds are sidelined and hedge fund managers and lenders are hosting fire sales these are happy days for warren buffett "i can spend money faster than imelda marcos when things are right " he says referring to the former philippines first lady and renowned shopper for the past three years mr buffetts traditional bargain hunting investment strategy has been partly stymied as debt fueled private equity funds and hedge funds drove asset prices out of his value investing orbit the result today hes sitting on a war chest of nearly &# billion in cash now with the shakeout in the subprime mortgage market forcing the end of easy money and the distressed sale of assets such as thornburg mortgage inc s sale yesterday of &# billion of its top rated mortgage backed securities many see mr buffett the year old chairman of the giant berkshire hathaway inc holding company as one of the last buyers standing so what is berkshire buying or looking to buy mr buffett hews to berkshires policy of not discussing potential transactions but it is safe to guess that sellers of all shapes and sizes from beleaguered lenders hurt by the mortgage backed and commercial paper markets to sponsors of private equity deals that run the risk of falling through are reaching out to him some investors speculate berkshire could be a buyer for parts of mortgage lender countrywide financial corp whose stock price has been hit hard by subprime worries countrywides assets including its debt servicing business and its portfolio of high quality mortgages and mortgage backed securities could be attractive to berkshire these investors say it wouldnt be the first time a financial firm asked mr buffett for help in he took over as chief executive of salomon brothers then in the midst of a criminal probe for a scandal involving the treasury market many credit mr buffett today for shepherding salomon back into the good graces of securities regulators and investors seven years later he came close to bailing out hedge fund long term capital management which was run by some of his old salomon crew but later changed his mind in part because he wanted the firms assets its stocks bonds and other securities not its management company and its complex partnership structure unlike ltcm countrywide runs some straightforward lending businesses a strong brand name and high quality mortgage assets that could complement berkshires other securities investments for example berkshire is a longtime shareholder in wells fargo &amp co and m&amp t bank also reputed to be conservative lenders with strong brand recognition and long operational histories in fact mr buffett has already been dipping his toe a little deeper into the market for mortgage backed securities in the second quarter berkshire reported that its insurance division doubled its investment in mortgage backed securities rated double a or higher to &# billion from the first quarter as with other investments mr buffett declined to elaborate investors are betting that hes likely to swoop in and make some good calls while the dow jones industrials average sank last week berkshires normally steady shares rallied the class a shares gained &# or yesterday in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange to &# up since aug and higher in the year to date "this is berkshire hathaways market " says thomas russo partner at investment fund gardner russo &amp gardner where he manages about &# billion mr gardner also a longtime investor in berkshire says mr buffett should be able to cherry pick from a variety of cheap assets imperiled private equity deals which rely on the debt markets for financing could also be attractive to berkshire texas utility txu corp which is trying to persuade its shareholders to agree to its sale to kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co and tpg would complement berkshires stable of companies which includes the utility conglomerate midamerican energy holdings the trick would be getting a good price if the deal falls through which might be difficult given txus improved operating performance recently also berkshire doesnt participate in auctions so any deals would have to be privately negotiated with mr buffett a spokeswoman for txu declined to comment a countrywide spokesman wrote in an email that company policy prevents it from commenting on rumors of mergers and acquisitions berkshire could also be taking advantage of cheaper stock prices in companies he already owns for example berkshire bought shares of usg corp the wallboard maker for as high as &# in the past year and built up a little over a stake yesterday the shares closed at &# aside from the nearly &# billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet as of june berkshire also holds about &# billion in stocks and about &# billion in bonds some of which mr buffett has said he wouldnt hesitate to redeploy to other investments if they looked like they would yield better returns berkshire which so far this year has generated about of its revenue from insurance units including geico and general re can also borrow cheaply since it carries a sterling triple a credit rating mr buffett doesnt shy away from good quick trading opportunities after the enron corp and worldcom debacles in berkshire bought the high yield bonds of some energy companies and some telecommunications firms which had all been priced lower because of various scandals by the end of that year berkshire had sextupled its "junk" bond investment to &# billion at the end of berkshire reported realized gains from the investments of about &# billion or today berkshire still owns &# billion in junk bonds which mr buffett says hed sell if somebody brings him a deal that he can warm to there doesnt appear to be a shortage of people who are courting him these days "im definitely more popular than i was a few months ago " he says and then quips "but i started from a low base " see related article "why kkr is moved to aid shaky affiliate
