dull and her reluctance to sell increased according to people who knew her she also stayed in many real estate partnerships because their complicated ownership structures were so difficult to unwind mr helmsley was known as a master in structuring real estate deals in coming months the executors of mrs helmsleys estate will re evaluate all her properties to see whether they should be sold said a person familiar with the matter now isnt a great time to sell because of the credit crisis in the capital markets but some of her assets like the park lane and the empire state building long term lease would be likely to attract interest because they are unique "todays helmsley empire would fetch hyper aggressive interest even in the face of todays uncertain capital market climate " mr harmon
