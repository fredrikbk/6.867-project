business technology best of the business tech blog excerpts from recent entries at wsj coms tech blog with labor crunch in it on the horizon why are careers failing to lure women the percentage of women working in information technology departments which wasnt high to begin with is dropping with an it labor crunch looming its time to ask what is it about it that may be repelling half the population while women hold of all professional positions in the work force they only made up of it pros in down from in according to the national center for women and information technology only of corporate officers at fortune tech companies are women and jenny slade communications director for the ncwit tells the business technology blog that women who do pursue it careers tend to leave them at a higher rate than men "women feel discrimination in it " ms slade says indeed a recent survey of nearly female it workers by women in technology international found that say that their views arent as acknowledged or welcomed as those of their male colleagues and say that they have fewer opportunities to participate in or lead large initiatives consequently women feel they need to leave it in order to advance says ms slade over time this becomes self perpetuating women say that one of the main reasons they leave it is that there arent other women in the field says ms slade it isnt just a workplace dynamics issue women are also losing interest in computer science long before they choose a profession women only received of computer science undergraduate degrees in compared with in says the ncwit the number of incoming freshmen women choosing to major in computer science dropped by between and and teenage girls seem less interested in computer science than they are in other scientific fields only of the finalists in the intel science and engineering fair a national competition for high school students were girls compared with of the finalists in biochemistry similarly only of the high school students taking the advanced placement computer science test in were girls compared with of the students who took the ap calculus test why most web sites receive failing grades ninety seven percent of the plus corporate web sites that forrester research inc has evaluated received failing grades companies with bad web sites are turning off customers and leaving money on the table and usually harley manning a forrester vice president says its due to common mistakes that can be broken down into four categories  value the first mistake that companies make when theyre designing a web site is copying features from competitors bells and whistles are worthless if they dont help a customer mr manning says that too few companies take the time to sit down with customers and find out what theyre using a web site for and what information would make a site more helpful a good example of a site that does this well is fidelity com the web site for fidelity investments inc there isnt a lot of extraneous information that investors dont need and information that investors want such as ratings from morningstar inc are easy to find  navigation companies often opt for cute menus instead of clear menus for example merrill lynch &amp co s site for individual investors has four menu items including one called bullseye that happens to be the name of merrill lynchs newsletter which contains all sorts of useful information "but nobody knows that " mr manning tells this blog a merrill lynch spokesman declined to comment  presentation web sites need to be easy to read and understand yet the majority of companies still feel compelled to fit as much information into as small a place as possible "automotive companies are the worst " mr manning tells us the text on their sites is almost always too small as if theyre afraid that customers wont scroll down to see more of the page people will provided theyre given visual cues mr manning cites new york times co s web site nytimes com as a site thats easy to read also avoid unclear icons several of the icons on the booking page for the hilton hotel in times square are a good example of what not to do a hilton hotels corp spokeswoman says that forrester conducted a review of hiltons site and rated its use of icons "acceptable" and that the company is "constantly evaluating its overall site design "  trust people are concerned about online privacy and security calling attention to your companys privacy policy can actually help sales mr manning says also a sites speed matters but not in the way you might expect customers dont sense that a site is slow instead they conclude that the content isnt interesting and that its less secure mr manning says that theres no perfect web site on the internet forced to choose one he picks adobe com the web site for adobe systems inc which he says is easy to read and full of useful information more generally its easy to improve a site and mr manning says that doing so is a no brainer "many of these sites get millions of visitors a year " he says "if you can change your conversion rate just a little you can get a huge payoff "
