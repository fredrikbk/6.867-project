health mailbox columnist tara parker pope answers readers questions q in your story last week you referred to "wireless insulin pumps without a tangle of tubes and wires " what do you mean i dont see how a pump would function without a tube m w a an insulin pump is an external device that continuously delivers insulin to the body through a tiny tube placed under the skin its about the size of a cellphone and is usually hooked on a waistband a small tube connects the pump to a catheter which is inserted through a needle into the diabetes patients abdominal fat or on other parts of the body dosage instructions are entered into the pumps small computer a wireless pump performs the same function but without the visible tubing a podlike device sits on the body and a small cannula pokes through the skin so there is still essentially a tube that delivers the insulin to the body but its small not visible and not attached to another device as is the case with a traditional pump users say the main benefit is that because the tube is contained within the device it wont get bent or crimped during physical activity the user programs the instructions using a hand held device that looks like a small remote control phil southerland the cyclist i profiled in my column last week attaches the small pump to the back of his upper arm while hes cycling the pumps used by team type are made by omnipod which is also a team sponsor the company offers several videos and slides showing how the pump works on its web site www myomnipod com i also recommend going to the national institutes of health site www medlineplus gov and typing insulin pumps youll find a trove of information about the devices the best advice is to talk to your doctor about what type of pump will work best for you given your health needs and activity level q i just read your article about team type whose members are all type diabetics you mentioned that all team members use "continuous glucose monitors" to track blood sugars id love to learn more about these devices m r a the blood glucose monitor is an essential tool for people with diabetes because it helps them check their blood sugar levels regularly and adjust their food intake or insulin but the big negative is that people with diabetes have to constantly prick their fingers to check their blood sugar a continuous monitor eliminates the inconvenience and pain of frequent blood tests although the devices still have to be calibrated using a traditional finger prick test says barney softness a new york pediatrician who specializes in type diabetes several such monitors are on the market and they are useful for discovering trends in glucose levels and adjusting treatment the main advantage of continuous glucose monitoring is that it can help identify fluctuations that would otherwise go unnoticed with intermittent finger stick measurements but the monitors dont eliminate the need for finger prick testing entirely an insulin pump made by medtronic comes with a continuous glucose sensor that reads and transmits data to the pump
