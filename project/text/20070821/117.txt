young people will link up to the pages some are also encouraging bloggers to mention the causes on their sites raising thousands of dollars in small donations from readers many of the nonprofits that have embraced social networking are themselves run by people in their s and s who already spend a good portion of their lives online some of them also appeal to donors by offering them tangible
