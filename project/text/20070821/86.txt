russia floats plan for nuclear plant aboard a boat mr chilikov in indonesia finds the idea a tough sell theres no risk in an industrial park in northern jakarta traders hawk electronics and pirated dvds from a steel grated storefront here alexander chilikov is trying to sell a floating nuclear power plant "theres no risk " says mr chilikov a year old former vodka salesman from russia who says he spent six years in prison there "if you have the information you cant be against this " last year russia began a broad drive to reinvigorate its nuclear industry among the initiatives at a top secret shipyard in the countrys far north russias state run atomic energy company is overseeing construction on the first of what it says will be a fleet of reactor equipped ships the vessels are meant to provide electricity to remote areas mooring just offshore and supplying enough power to run a small city russian officials say the floating plants have generated strong interest among foreign customers in countries such as indonesia and russia ad hoc personal ties are often critical to getting business done that has opened the way for self styled brokers such as mr chilikov billing himself as an intermediary he has built contacts with the governor of a poor province on the indonesian island of sulawesi russian power company executives and a moscow lawmaker last year mr chilikov led an indonesian delegation to moscow to discuss the floating power plants participants in the meetings say still it isnt clear whether he is acting with a mandate two russian officials who provided mr chilikov with reference letters later distanced themselves when contacted about his role the state atomic energy company that oversees the plants rosenergoatom says it doesnt know mr chilikov mr chilikov says that as one of few russians with experience in indonesia hes indispensable "i have a name and many connections " he says with its shipboard reactor program russia is reviving a decades old idea in the u s westinghouse electric corp proposed building such plants in the s in early congressman joe barton a texas republican suggested alleviating californias energy crisis by harnessing power from nuclear powered navy ships the soviet union a pioneer in nuclear powered submarines and icebreakers had its own plans following the soviet unions collapse the floating reactor project languished deep inside russias atomic energy ministry the kremlin jump started russias nuclear industry last year when it announced a &# billion program to build land based reactors more than double the currently in operation by as part of the atomic push construction on the first floating plant began earlier this year on april state television covered the keel laying ceremony in the city of severodvinsk on the white sea sergei krysov head of the rosenergoatom department that is overseeing the project says the first vessel will be finished in late it will be a demonstration model powering the shipyard and other facilities in severodvinsk mr krysov says the facility will be able to start a new ship every year each taking about three years to build rosenergoatom says the next plants will be used in domestic areas in siberia and the far east mr krysovs th floor moscow office in a building guarded by security coded glass gates looks out across the moscow river to the kremlins golden domes sitting in a room adorned with a russian orthodox icon and pictures of nuclear plants he produces the plants marketing materials including a glossy english language brochure and a video presentation with a techno music soundtrack mr krysov says each ship will include two reactors that plug into the local grid the first a foot vessel named after russian scientist mikhail lomonosov will have a megawatt capacity less than one tenth the output of a traditional land based plant the vessels can be modified to desalinate sea water and will have crew quarters with a sauna the plants are already controversial vladimir chuprov the head of greenpeaces nuclear energy team in russia cites incidents in sea going nuclear vessels in the past years mr chuprov adds that floating plants could be a target for terrorists and provide material for dirty bombs the vessels makers say the reactors will use a less concentrated form of uranium than that used in nuclear weapons russia would tow the ship into place and tow it back to severodvinsk every years to offload spent fuel and other waste they say after about years the ships would be decommissioned in russia russians will own and operate the vessels overseers say so there will be no transfer of nuclear technology the vienna based international atomic energy agency says it is working with an international group that is studying the russian plans legality and safety rosenergoatoms general director sergei obozov compares the plants with a storied soviet gun "floating nuclear reactors will be no less reliable than the kalashnikov " he told russian journalists in june some in the russian government say the plants at &# million each are too expensive requiring a decade to break even but the state run company says more than countries in africa asia and the middle east have expressed interest mr krysov says he went to the island nation of cape verde in june to sign a preliminary agreement to study a floating plant there local press reports confirmed cape verdes interest country officials did not respond to interview requests mr krysov says stations could be ready for export as soon as mr chilikov a slim

short stint in the army and spent most of s without work he says at the end of the decade he set up a bread baking business in he says he moved to moscow and opened a company that sold vodka mr chilikov says his break came in as former soviet enterprises struggled to adapt to a market economy a contact at gazprom the state owned natural gas company told mr chilikov the enterprise was having trouble collecting payments from an electric station near moscow the plant was broke he says because their industrial customers were late on their own bills mr chilikov suggested setting up a barter

opportunities to develop tidal and hydropower in indonesia participants also discussed floating nuclear plants according to english language notes on the meeting that mr chilikov provided mr soeprapto and other attendees including alexander fink a deputy director at gidroproekt confirm the meeting and topic back in jakarta mr chilikov began shopping the idea around bambang waskito a former senior official in indonesias state owned electricity company says he introduced mr chilikov to the governor of the province of gorontalo the governor fadel muhammad says he jumped at the idea of buying a floating nuclear plant gorontalo which sits at the remote northern tip of the island of sulawesi faces almost daily power outages mr muhammad said in an interview the blackouts are stymieing his attempts to attract tourism and fisheries investments he said in december the governor wrote a letter to mr obozov the russian nuclear agencys director expressing interest in a reactor and asking to visit the production site in russia he says he didnt receive a reply rosenergoatom officials said they couldnt recall the letter but said they regularly inform indonesian officials about the floating reactor projects progress meanwhile mr fink the gidroproekt official wrote a letter to mr muhammad authorizing mr chilikov to conduct "preliminary negotiations" about a floating plan on its behalf mr fink confirmed the letter in a telephone interview a ues spokesman however says the electricity enterprise handles only non nuclear projects mr krysov the reactor programs overseer said his agency is the only authorized seller and that gidroproekt isnt involved indonesian officials balked at the idea of mr muhammad buying a reactor or transporting one through national waters the country doesnt have nuclear power but is looking into building a land based plant "i dont want indonesia to be used as an experiment " says as natio lasman deputy chairman of indonesias nuclear agency a spokesman for the indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono said mr muhammad cannot proceed without central government permission a few hundred kilometers from gorontalo in central sulawesi the poso

ahead selecting a mooring site and arranging for an army unit to defend it mr chilikov has been touring indonesia to meet with other provincial governors his main challenge he says is persuading indonesia that the plants are safe hes now organizing a seminar in jakarta to outline their benefits he hasnt contacted the russian agencies lately he says because theres little progress to report in moscow mr ivanov the legislator confirmed by telephone that he wrote an introduction letter for mr chilikov but that he considered him nothing more than a conduit "i gave him public information that you can find on the web site " says mr ivanov adding that mr chilikov has no official status to broker a deal the russians efforts mr ivanov says "smell of adventurism " adds mr fink the gidroproekt official who wrote the letter that authorized mr chilikovs preliminary negotiations "we warned him that if he misbehaves well pull the letter " svetlana rubalskaya in moscow and yayu yuniar in jakarta
