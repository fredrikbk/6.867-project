a cultural conversation with salman ahmad sufi rocker campus troubadour piermont n y early last winter salman ahmad pakistani rock star united nations goodwill ambassador for hiv aids proud muslim could have been playing his highly popular music in any big city in the u s or beyond as the founder of the wildly popular "sufi rock" group junoon mr ahmad has performed with his former bandmates or solo in locales as diverse as new yorks central park new delhis old fort and even before the u n general assembly but for four days in november he found himself belting out his urdu and punjabi language songs in front of altogether different kinds of audiences university students and local residents in kansas and missouri dubbed the "heart of america" tour the gigs were as uplifting for mr ahmad and enlightening for the crowds as they were unlikely "i met people who probably never set foot outside of kansas city " recalled mr ahmad over lunch recently in piermont close to his home in tappan where he lives these days with his wife and three sons "wherever this music has been played you get these converts " he says "a lot of people dont know the words to it but it just makes them feel good " his nascent american listening base is joining a bulging fold with more than million junoon albums sold mr ahmad sometimes called the bono of south asia may be the most successful muslim rock musician youve never heard of then again maybe you have the lahore born guitarist and singer is the subject of a pbs documentary "the rock star and the mullahs " as well as a bbc film about muslims in america called "its my country too " junoon meaning "obsession" or "passion" was also featured in vhs production "islamabad rock city " hosted by actress susan sarandon and in addition to his ambassadorial work mr ahmad speaks at forums around the u s about culture and islam and is an honorary committee member of daniel pearl world music days a concert series founded in memory of the slain wall street journal reporter who was reportedly a junoon listener this fall for the second time hell be teaching a class at new yorks queens college about south asian music and poetry "my job is to plant seeds" as a musician teacher and sometime documentary subject mr ahmad says "theres a goodness in the universe and youre on earth for little time and your job is just to preserve that goodness " musical seed planting in the u s is a second act of sorts for mr ahmad who in moved back to tappan where hed lived in middle school and high school thanks to his fathers job in part to escape from his celebrity status in pakistan during one of his early years in new york he was invited to what he first thought might be "a circus" at madison square garden but led zeppelin were no clowns and seeing the bands legendary guitarist bend the strings on his les paul changed the pakistani kids life forever "looking at jimmy page at that time it was mesmerizing " he recalls another turn on to the rock n roll life was watching "a hard days night" on late night television "seeing the beatles running around being chased by girls those two things i think that sold me completely " mr ahmad formed junoon after moving back to pakistan where he studied to become a doctor instead of a healer he became an alchemist junoons music and mr ahmads solo work is a powerful combination of the pump your fist hard rock of led zeppelin or santana and traditional south asian percussion like tabla and dholak check out for example "yaar bina" meaning "without my love" from junoons album "azadi " lyrically too its almost as if van morrison had slipped into a salwar kameez mr ahmad is a devotee of sufism islams mystical tradition and many of his songs are inspired by or quote outright such classical poets as baba bulleh shah and shah hussain "its the experiential islam " he says of sufism citing the poet rumi he says sufism is about the "oneness of god and oneness of humanity and the other big thing is that it loves diversity " its that sort of diversity that mr ahmad is peddling in his new role as an islamic troubadour about campus at queens college and during his midwestern and other gigs "my aim really is to give the students as wide a picture of muslim cultural expression as i can " he says of his college course islamic music and culture of south asia to that end he and his pupils dissect everything from traditional qawwali devotional sufi music to islamic rock and hip hop bands like irans hypernova and denmarks outlandish but for the man who has said he came back to the u s partly to "build bridges" after making cultural connections between islam and the west hasnt always been easy there was "a lot of skepticism " he says about his representation of islam in the u s heartland when he performed and screened documentaries at the request of the universities "in the q and as you get these incredulous sort of questions about but wait a minute the islam that we see in the media in the cnn and fox tv isnt this so are you for real " but he says "you would see that melt in the evening when the music would begin because the music has a power to just dissolve all barriers " mr ahmad is used to doubt and worse junoon saw the song and video of its politically satirical tune "ehtesaab" "accountability" banned from pakistani state tv in two years later then prime minister nawaz sharif kicked the band off the air entirely after mr ahmad criticized nuclear testing while on tour in india the ban has since been lifted mr ahmad has argued with clergy in pakistan over whether islam forbids or allows music a topic that still riles him today "nowhere in the quran does it say that music is prohibited " he told me six years after the terrorist attacks mr ahmad feels theres still a hunger for knowledge about islam in america its a craving that he appears only too happy to feed even as he works through the some song ideas he has for the album hes doing next in which he says junoon will be reincarnated as a group with different members "i know that im gigging a lot and for the last two to three years ive been going across colleges all across the united states everywhere from state universities to the harvards and the stanfords and the princetons and theres a great interest in qawwali you know because theres a great interest in islam and the best way that i can illuminate islam is through the music and the poetry " that music apparently remains in demand mr ahmad is slated to play at ohios oberlin college in october and at the massachusetts college of liberal arts in december hell also tour in turkey syria berlin and elsewhere in the fall meanwhile america is continuing to reflect back at him in the form of the blues a favored genre hes currently exploring as he composes his latest tunes and during our nearly two hour conversation over cokes and clam chowder mr ahmad talks excitedly about the illumination band a philadelphia bluegrass outfit that sings translated rumi verses he may do a song with them he says hes already collaborated with former eurythmics member dave stewart and says his wish list of studio partners includes carlos santana sting and peter gabriel he doesnt rule out singing songs in english junoon recorded a handful of english language songs including "no more" but says that whatever form his music takes "the key is does it have an emotional intensity " watching news of the latest al qaeda linked plot or seeing angry muslim protesters overseas denounce salman rushdies knighthood one can forgive mr ahmads midwestern audiences for wondering who actually speaks for islam is it the guitarist who was wearing a black fedora and camouflage pants on the day i met him or the intolerant extremists or someone else to be sure they share the same faith and read the same holy book but that faith says the rocker who once termed the "arabized" version of islam "very sort of fascist in a way " is as debatable and adaptable as it is widespread "within islam there is such a difference of opinion of what islam is " he says "people make the mistake of taking this broad brush stroke of saying the islamic world " misnomer or not that "world " thanks in part to mr ahmad includes kick butt anthems about divine love leather clothing and thousands of kids screaming not for holy war but simply for the next song mr schroeder is a washington reporter for marketwatch
