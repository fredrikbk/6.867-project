inequality check a wise man once noted that a rising tide lifts all boats so why are booming asian countries so worried about income inequality such talk is hardly cheap if these fears spur bad economic policies it could end up costing asia dearly the worries were fanned this month by a report from the asian development bank the study comparing more than a decades worth of data from developing countries found significant increases in inequality across the region "widening disparities in standards of living can threaten the growth process in one of the most dynamic regions of the world " the bank noted in its press release unveiling the report national leaders agree indias newly installed president pratibha patil marked the th anniversary of her countrys independence this week by claiming that "growth when unevenly spread dwarfs overall prosperity we have to ensure equitable growth for all " in tokyo prime minister shinzo abes cabinet has floated the possibility of a negative income tax to stem growing income inequality hong kong chief executive donald tsang has made battling inequality one of his top priorities singaporean prime minister lee hsien loong noted on the city states national day last week that the rising income gap is a "major challenge " there is evidence that inequality is rising in asia the adbs report finds that inequality as measured by the gini coefficient a statistical tool commonly used to gauge the severity of income differentials is growing across asia from nepal and china to south korea india and bangladesh in some places the uptick is marked the gini coefficient ranks income on a percentile basis in asia the adb used consumption rather than income data due to lack of better data but as the adb notes this doesnt mean the rich are taking food from the mouths of the poor rather the rich are getting richer faster than the poor are in all but one developing country per capita incomes for the bottom fifth of the work force increased at least slightly pakistan was the only exception this trend is also evident from other measures of poverty in china the proportion of people living on &# a day declined by an average of a year between and even as inequality measured by the gini coefficient increased by a year other measures also point at dramatic improvements in the lives of the regions poor indias statistical office reported earlier this year that of rural households which are more likely than the urban to be poor had electricity in up from in prime minister manmohan singh complained in june that inequality breeds social unrest because "the electronic media carries the lifestyles of the rich and famous into every village and every slum " thats because the poor can increasingly afford television sets the percentage of rural households with tvs increased to in up from its a story thats being repeated in the unlikeliest of places in cambodia whose gini measured inequality clocked the third greatest increase in the adb study life expectancy at birth has increased to years in from years in according to the world bank the proportion of births attended by trained medical staff increased to in from in and while developed countries like south korea saw an increase in inequality according to the adb and japan and singapore not included in the banks report worry about their own income disparities citizens arent exactly suffering the pangs of hunger theyre too busy talking on the phone for every people in these countries there are respectively and mobile and land based telephone lines poverty remains a serious problem throughout asia the adb estimates million people still live below the &# a day line to use one popular measure but "fixing" inequality wont fix poverty as even the adb recognizes inequality can be a symptom of economic growth not everyone can experience equal income growth simultaneously chinas rising inequality for example is fueled by growing numbers of people transitioning to higher paying manufacturing and construction jobs from low income agricultural work a policy of allowing successful people to keep their gains by not subjecting them to redistributive tax policies rewards risk takers and creates incentives for others to try to emulate them likewise not all inequality is well equal while inequality of outcome can be a good thing inequality of opportunity is another matter a caste system or corrupt government can contribute to the kind of "structural inequality" that hinders development by making it harder for entrepreneurial people to get ahead the adb worries that too much of the good inequality can lead to the bad variety by entrenching a new set of self interested elites but to the extent thats a danger the best solution is political not economic economists like new york universitys william easterly have filled books with stories of how corrupt unaccountable governments embezzled money out of programs designed to tackle inequality of opportunity true democracy complete with universal suffrage rule of law and transparent government is the most reliable method for keeping oligarchs in line the danger is that all this talk of "inequality" will lead to policies that in the name of redistributing income reduce economic growth and thus make it harder for asias poor to join the middle class the asian "pie" is growing for everyone the challenge is to keep it that way instead of quarreling over the relative size of the pieces
