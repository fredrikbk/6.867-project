lawyers without borders how did it come to pass that a lawsuit concerning banana farmers in nicaragua is being adjudicated in a state court in downtown los angeles just the latest abuse of the u s civil justice system courtesy of the plaintiffs bar the jury trial got underway earlier this month and involves male plantation workers who allege that exposure to the pesticide dbcp in the mid s in nicaragua left them sterile dole food which contracted with the plantations where dbcp was used is the lead defendant even though the nicaraguan government was already spraying the pesticide long before dole entered the picture theres no evidence that the farm workers were ever exposed to harmful levels of dbcp or that the level of exposure they did experience causes sterility or any other health problems in humans but there is evidence that some plaintiffs were already sterile before exposure while others had children afterward its worth noting as well that dbcp which kills the microscopic worms that attack plant roots was also approved at the time for use in the u s europe australia and south america which is to say that untold millions were exposed to the chemical without incident but never mind all that the real mystery is why this case is being heard in a u s courtroom these are foreign nationals after all with no connection to our civil justice system prior to the start of the trial the plaintiffs had never even set foot in the u s and the claims being brought on their behalf concern lawful conduct that took place in another country years ago unfortunately the dole case isnt anomalous u s class action firms best known for tobacco and asbestos suits increasingly are reaching out across the globe to drag all manner of claims into american courts back in the australian based mining giant rio tinto was sued by a seattle based plaintiffs law firm hagens berman on behalf of south pacific islanders who claim that rio conspired with the government of papua new guinea to quell civil resistance to a mining operation in the s the suit which continues was allowed to be brought in the u s district court in san francisco because rio happens to have a subsidiary headquartered in los angeles earlier this month a u s district judge in miami dismissed a lawsuit filed against two united arab emirate sheiks on behalf of thousands of children who were forced to race camels in various persian gulf countries although no forced camel jockeying actually took place in the u s the plaintiffs attorneys argued that the court had jurisdiction because the defendants had interests in racehorses in the miami area motley rice the u s law firm that brought the suit on a contingency fee basis of course is reportedly considering whether to appeal the decision or try another state as a practical matter these cases consume limited judicial resources and clog our courts with claims that have no connection to anything that actually occurred in the u s but they also raise constitutional issues the plaintiffs in the dole case are seeking not only compensatory damages but also punitive damages for conduct that has no connection to the state why should a jury in los angeles be allowed to impose punitive damages against a company for actions that were legal in nicaragua and caused no injuries in california in its state farm vs campbell decision among others the supreme court made clear that the constitution precludes a state from "punishing a defendant for conduct that may have been lawful where it occurred " the tort bar wont police itself so it falls to others to do the job congress state legislatures and courts could take steps to create higher jurisdictional hurdles and limit the ability of plaintiffs lawyers to seek punitive damages that wont stop every abuse but its a start
