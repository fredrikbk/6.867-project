politics &amp economics maliki faces fresh doubts tests u s troop surge in iraq creates opportunity to reconcile divisions baghdad senior u s military commanders in iraq are increasingly divided over whether iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki and his weak coalition are capable of making the necessary compromises that might help end the fighting in the country although some including the top u s commander in iraq gen david petraeus say mr maliki is starting to take small steps needed to build a multisectarian state or at least should be given more time a growing number of officers say they are concerned the current u s strategy of "surging" troops into baghdad and its environs wont produce lasting gains unless he is replaced army chief of staff george casey who spent several days last week meeting with top u s regional commanders here said he was taken aback by the intensity of anti maliki sentiment among senior u s officers "i heard more people talk about maliki not making it through his full term in two days than i had heard in all of my previous time here " gen casey said "theres a frustration with his inability to be a reconciliation leader and a fear that the momentum generated by the surge could just be frittered away " although mr malikis position has weakend in recent months there are no signs he will lose his post any time soon president bush has expressed support for mr maliki and even detractors say his exit wouldnt necessarily improve conditions in iraq but doubts about the prime minister among some u s military officers do raise questions about the bush administrations "surge" strategy which has committed an additional u s troops in a bid to stabilize baghdad and the surrounding areas its goal is to keep the cycle of sectarian violence in check to make space for iraqi leaders to strike the power sharing deals that could help end the countrys civil war yesterday the democratic chairman and senior republican leader of the senate armed services committee echoed u s military leaders concerns about the current iraqi government sen carl levin d mich and sen john warner r va fresh from a fact finding trip to iraq questioned in a joint statement whether the current iraqi leaders are willing to "shed their sectarian biases and act in a unifying manner " the two lawmakers suggested the iraqi people should consider whether it is time to form a new government in iraq the surge has had some clear successes in military terms it has helped halve the number of sectarian killings and violent acts here to about in july compared with november the august numbers are expected to be even lower military officials said while violence continues to flare in other parts of the country overall rates are down sharply the past six months though a roadside bomb yesterday killed a governor in southern iraq the second provincial boss assassinated in nine days the issue is whether mr malikis frail coalition is either able or willing to use this opportunity to reconcile the divisions tearing apart the country so far the drop in violence hasnt been matched by any progress on the key political benchmarks outlined by congress to prod iraqis to compromise the expectations placed on mr maliki are considerable his government is riven by ethnic and religious based parties dominated by shiite muslims who as a majority were repressed for decades by the sunni muslim minority are reluctant to cede much power meanwhile sunnis ousted by the u s invasion have waged an insurgency against american and iraqi forces and a terror campaign against non sunni iraqis questions about the willingness of mr maliki a shiite to make deals with sunnis are certain to hang over coming congressional testimony by gen petraeus and iraq ambassador ryan crocker the bush administration has sought to downplay the importance of a white house report on the surge to be released alongside the testimony but many lawmakers say its conclusions will help determine whether congress allows the troop surge to continue into or demands a shift in strategy last month the administration released an interim report that conceded mr malikis efforts were "not satisfactory" in terms of passing a new law governing the division of iraqs considerable oil revenue changing the nations constitution to make it easier for former baath party officials to participate in public life and funding billions of dollars in reconstruction projects some key officers including gen petraeus and his senior aides who interact almost daily with mr maliki and his staff continue to believe in the prime minister in an interview last week gen petraeus pointed to small signs that he and his cabinet ministers are making necessary compromises such as a willingness to hire sunni police officers to provide security in their areas last week the ministry of interior approved the hiring of police officers including some likely former insurgents in the largely sunni enclave of abu ghraib on the outskirts of baghdad "those orders have been signed and they start training this week " gen petraeus said "for the government it is easy to let sunnis police anbar province which is far from baghdad it gets much more challenging understandably so the closer you get to baghdad the government has legitimate concerns that we share " the general also noted that in recent weeks the u s and the iraqi government had disbanded the facilities protection service units at the ministry of culture and the ministry of health the security guard forces at the two ministries had been deeply infiltrated by radical shiite militias and were suspected in a wave of attacks on sunnis and he said progress albeit slow is being made to incorporate former sunni insurgents who were fighting al qaeda in iraq into the countrys official security forces "reconciliation is an action that takes place between former adversaries and not friends " said gen petraeus noting that this is neither easy nor quick other u s officers offered a bleaker assessment of the iraqi governments willingness to reconcile gen casey who served as the top u s commander here in and said the u s may have erred in believing that mr maliki with a lifetime of shiite activism would be willing or able to make political compromises with the countrys sunnis "it would be a huge shame if after all the military has accomplished with the surge we dont get a political accommodation " he said "but im not optimistic " it isnt clear who would replace mr maliki if he were forced out nor is it clear that any replacement would be able to do much better under the current iraqi system the prime minister lacks much power to force compromises or ram through unpopular legislation senior u s officials said one coming test of the maliki governments intentions will be whether it follows through on promises to hire police in the southern baghdad neighborhood of doura which had been mixed along sectarian lines and is now predominately sunni "it will show whether the government will hire sunni officers which they havent done in the past in baghdad " said brig gen john campbell a deputy u s commander in the capital
