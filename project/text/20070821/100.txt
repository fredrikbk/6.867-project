the daily fix columnists ponder downfall of the falcons michael vick online edition looks like michael vick is going to jail the atlanta falcons quarterback has agreed to plead guilty to federal dogfighting charges and will appear in court in richmond va on monday recommended sentencing is to months in prison though the judge in the case is free to impose a sentence above or below that range and can refuse to accept the agreement which could still fall apart mr vick will also face disciplinary action from the nfl including the possibility of a lifetime ban for a primer on the case and the legal maneuverings read lester munson on espn com in the washington post michael wilbon wonders "if the people who unabashedly apologize for michael vick particularly in and around atlanta will see vick for what he is for what hes been or whether theyll continue to give him the kind of cover that allows his brand of arrogance to thrive like most people who are arrogant but not particularly smart vick overplayed his hand to get back into pro football and theres no guarantee vick is going to have to repeatedly and convincingly demonstrate a level of humility i doubt hes felt a single day in his life " mr wilbon ends by asking if arrogant high school and college star athletes will draw any lesson about the perils of "keeping it real" a familiar subject for the kansas city stars jason whitlock "its my belief that if vick stayed involved with dogfighting he did so primarily because it was a way to stay involved in an activity in which his boys still participated " he writes "it was vicks way of keeping it real he was fearful of being labeled a sellout fearful of having his blackness questioned this is a burden weve created for ourselves we fight our own evolution this must end we need to redefine keeping it real for athletes and other people who experience professional success keeping it real should mean offering your lifelong friends and family members an opportunity to acquire the skills necessary to join the mainstream helping a friend or family member wallow in stupidity or self destructive behavior is not keeping it real its enabling a problem a problem that could eventually engulf you ask michael vick " in the atlanta journal constitution terence moore circles back to humility saying mr vicks only chance is to come clean about not just dogfighting but everything else "if vick bares his soul in public and if his delusional followers stop encouraging him to stay defiant by excusing away everything he does wrong the water bottle thing the flipping off the fans the stiffing of the u s congressmen the ron mexico deal the watch incident he will be forgiven by more than just a higher power " mr moore writes "he will be forgiven by just about anybody you can imagine vick needs to cry on barbara walters couch on national television after that he needs to call larry king then he needs to do minutes and with legendary bulldog mike wallace prodding and poking he needs to pull a jimmy swaggart through it all vick needs to save a few sobs for bryant gumbel on hbos real sports but you know exactly where im going oprah " the philadelphia inquirers phil sheridan has no particular sympathy for mr vick but hes worried about the hard lines taken by nfl commissioner roger goodell against mr vick pacman jones and tank johnson and how the commissioners actions move on a separate track from the legal process mr jones he notes was suspended despite not being convicted of a crime "this is dangerous ground " he writes "goodell is asking us the fans the media the players the teams to trust him never to abuse this power what happens if he does what happens if he simply makes a mistake will he also have the power to give a player a year of his career back " and mr sheridan casts a cold eye on how the threat of action by mr goodell affected the vick case "think about it from vicks point of view if he was inclined to go to trial and take his chances with a jury he had to know it would cost him millions in legal fees he would have weighed that risk against the millions he is still owed on the contract he signed with the falcons in but when you introduce the goodell factor the equation changes if the commissioner can and will suspend vick for a season or two regardless of the outcome of the criminal trial vick cant count on getting those millions of dollars suddenly the smart play is to plead guilty cut his financial losses and shorten the legal process " william hagy who died yesterday at never hit a home run or recorded a strikeout for the baltimore orioles but "wild bill" was a vital part of the clubs history nonetheless the quintessential fan whose o r i o l e s cheers were eagerly awaited in memorial stadium in the late s and s the orioles eventually let mr hagy lead the cheers from the top of their dugout with catcher rick dempsey sometimes summoning wild bill by waving a towel when he thought the team needed a lift "you didnt have to know hagy personally to appreciate him " writes dan connolly in the baltimore sun "he was the living breathing cowboy hat waving embodiment of baltimore that will always make you smile no matter where the world has taken you he was blue collar pot bellied and indeed wild he had scraggly hair and matching beard and a can of beer permanently attached to his hand and he loved dem oreos especially those of eddie and singy flanny and scotty mac demper the earl and eventually cal if orioles baseball was his religion his pulpit was section a perch in the upper deck of his church memorial stadium " through a successful but confounding season the new york mets have been banking on a guaranteed acquisition for the playoffs the return of charismatic ace pedro martinez from shoulder surgery but is that guaranteed in new york chris smith looks at pedros recovery "the moment comes to all but a few freaks of nature like roger clemens pedro martinez has dodged the crisis longer than his frail frame suggested was plausible but now he is playing out a drama bigger than contract disputes or a mere pennant race hes confronting athletic mortality " former mets pitcher and current broadcaster ron darling has confronted that himself and speaks candidly with mr smith about pain pitching and identity "i didnt realize how important pitching was to who i was with an arm injury you realize im really not that special unless i have this right arm you feel almost ashamed " last week the new york suns tim marchman also pondered pedros comeback expressing doubts but ending on a more hopeful note for met fans "pedro martinez is no ordinary man and every time hes ever been doubted hes shoved it right in everyones face it wont be long before he does it again " then theres the man himself and this pitching line from st lucie last night ip h er k bb seventy two pitches for strikes fastball hit sinker and curve were sharp the new york posts mike vaccaro reports on an outing that made met fans feel like they got a win on an off day "a successful bull ride is eight seconds of waltz crossed with a wrestling match " tommy craggs writes in the new york timess play "the cowboy tries to situate his center of gravity over the bulls and somehow convince the judges that he not the pound bull is dancing lead " few have done it better than adriano moraes a three time world champion at mr craggs dissects both bull riding and mr moraess amazing mental and physical gifts including this jaw dropping quote from the veteran riders chiropractor "whenever you deliver an
