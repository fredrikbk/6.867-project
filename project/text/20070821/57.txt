hsbc faces hurdles in keb bid a deal would test korea on openness to foreigners and set stage for rivalry hsbc holdings plcs efforts to buy a majority stake in korea exchange bank will require navigating korean regulatory hurdles and fending off potential rival bids for the interest held by dallas investment firm lone star funds if hsbc succeeds the deal would bolster its business in emerging markets and set the stage for a rivalry with standard chartered plc and citigroup inc both of which have a head start on hsbc in south korea hsbc announced it was in talks with lone star late sunday night hsbc chairman stephen green has stated that expanding in emerging markets is a priority the london bank which operates in some countries and territories does little business in south korea and it is likely to tap the commercial banking business of keb in a statement sunday hsbc said that discussions are under way with lone star and that an acquisition would be made through its hongkong &amp shanghai banking corp subsidiary hsbc didnt disclose the price it would pay for the majority stake of keb which has a market value of &# billion late yesterday lone star confirmed it is in "exclusive discussions" with hsbc any deal will set up a new test of korean public and government sentiment toward foreign investment a transaction would require regulatory approval creating another opportunity for korean politicians and regulators to play out their conflicting sentiments over whether the direction of the nations banking industry should be set by government or the market "the korean government or regulators do not look favorably at foreign banks like hsbc " says daniel baek banking industry analyst at woori investment &amp securities in seoul "i think its more likely a domestic player will be approved " last year lone star decided not to sell its stake in keb to a korean firm after regulators and politicians upset that a foreign investor would be making big profits in the country investigated whether it should have been allowed to buy keb in the first place though no charges have been brought the probe is in limbo between the prosecutors and the stock market regulatory agency in late june lone star sold of its keb stake in several blocks for a total of &# billion the company at that time said it would seek a strategic investor for the remaining a

preparing a new offer hana bank and the national agricultural cooperative federation purchased blocks of keb shares that were sold in june and are also considered potential buyers for the controlling stake representatives at the companies declined to comment the reaction of south korean authorities to a foreign acquisition of keb may also signal what could happen when the government carries out its plan to sell its controlling stake in the far larger woori bank which it is required by law to do early next year woori managers have said they want foreign participation in the sale to be limited but government officials say they will let the market decide to smooth the way for a purchase of keb hsbc said it would keep the keb name and its korea stock listing and would put a premium on retaining employees for hsbc the move marks a return to the acquisition trail the bank has been hobbled for most of because of problems in the u s subprime mortgage market in february hsbc said its provisions for souring loans would be higher than expected because of loans it had acquired that went bad the bank was one of the first to signal increasing problems in the mortgage market in london

billion in a premium to the banks market value at the time in may last year it agreed to sell that stake to kookmin koreas largest bank by assets for more than &# billion but a historical aversion in south korea to foreigners profiting from the country a sentiment rooted in its history of military invasion and domination emerged to threaten lone stars exit even before the deal was announced south korean prosecutors launched investigations into the terms of lone stars purchase saying keb might have acted to devalue itself in the original deal eventually investigations by prosecutors and financial regulators swept up current and former executives of keb lone star and their investment advisers in november lone star scrapped the sale to kookmin saying it would wait for the investigations to conclude earlier this year prosecutors and an independent government audit board said they found nothing illegal in the original transaction a court is reviewing practices at kebs
