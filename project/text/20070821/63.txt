a building owned by the macquarie office trust chief financial officer greg ward contended that an era of tighter credit isnt a bad thing for the bank macquaries purchases traditionally have been made with the banks own balance sheet and then involve some debt financing when the assets are transferred to the separate funds mr ward said the current problems in the debt markets could work to macquaries advantage by scaring off rival bidders such as private equity firms that are more reliant on raising funds for purchases "i think that will actually end up benefiting us " he said "we can buy assets today even in the new market " mr ward years old acknowledged that fewer mergers and acquisitions mean fewer advisory fees "not much we can do about that " he said but the banks
