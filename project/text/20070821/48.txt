how office tyrants in critical positions get others to grovel among john phelans challenges when he worked for an electronics manufacturing company was trying to extract office supplies from sam tracking all supplies by date sam would refer to his records of your last paper clip withdrawal to determine if you really needed a new box he would require the stub of an old pencil before he dispensed a new one and the remains of an old pen had better show no signs of chewing which might have sucked the ink away from the tip if it did recalls mr phelan sam would instruct you to blow the ink back down the tube toward the tip one had to surrender to sams authority "if he didnt feel you were paying homage enough there were several lists of things he needed to do before he got to your request " says mr phelan "everything on the other side of that supply closet door was his kingdom " you expect authoritarian rule to come from the corner office but tyranny from any other direction blindsides you potentially bringing your work to a dead stop lords of smaller corners can highlight the fragility of workplace productivity and theyre also another argument for having friends in lower places "the formal organization chart only gives you one aspect of the organizational power topography " says richard boyatzis professor in the school of management and psychology at case western reserve university "one of the competencies in every study of outstanding leaders is their degree of organizational awareness reading the informal networks like influence in the organization " misreading the choke points sources of influence or all those whose rings need kissing can spell disaster everyone even the titled brass class should look down their noses at their own risk "you might have the keys to the kingdom " human resources executive mike farrell notes "but if you dont have the keys to the gate youre shafted " and some gatekeepers drive you nuts when frank gastner worked as a manufacturers representative he had to work with a "totally bitter and unpleasant" purchasing agent no one would get anything without filling out a requisition form when a colleague needed to requisition more requisition forms because he ran out her reply "fill out a requisition " she lent him one of hers and he complied in another case the woman didnt want to pay the stated price for a new machine her company had already begun to use making the audacious claim that it was "used " says mr gastner "she seemed to be able to take whatever authority she wanted " crossing such authority has harsh consequences j j stives who has worked for companies once argued with an agent in the travel department over taking a train instead of a plane which was more expensive she resisted because it didnt comport with company policy so mr stives had his boss overrule her that went over poorly from that point on mr stives says he was singled out for infractions such as not having receipts for valet parking tips and his expense reports were bounced back "the travel baroness red flagged any travel reports that came in from me " he says "anything to slow down the reimbursement and let it sit on my credit card so i paid interest " authority in unlikely places means being told to wait your turn while the person remains deep in thought your request will be followed by a sigh some raised eyebrows indicating your order is a tall one and a shake of the head indicating that its chances for completion are dubious barring divine intervention when robert moliski an executive recruiter was in the navy one supply officer running the foreign currency exchange would begin a power dance whenever they pulled into an overseas port "it always seemed like he was doing us this big favor when in fact he was just doing his job " recalls mr moliski "he would take the same sort of swagger that you see someone take who is getting in their car when another is waiting on their space no rush no hurry just relishing the situation " the aggravation inflicted isnt always intentional when amy abbie robinson worked for a government agency she had to trudge to the basement of the building to get approval for photocopies where she would encounter a meticulous gatekeeper "she would look over your little request very carefully " she says "peoples tendency to create a fiefdom creates huge bottlenecks to an otherwise efficient organization " sometimes you have to admire their humbling effect on worse tyrants at evan steingarts consumer products company an inventory transfer clerk had to approve the shipment of all goods for a highly compensated highly entitled sales force theyd bark at him "just get it done " and otherwise treat him like dirt that understandably annoyed the clerk "if he saw you were in a hurry he was going to tell you that he couldnt do it right away " says mr steingart "he wanted to feel like they needed him more than he needed them " did they "they needed him more than they realized " admits mr steingart email me at jared sandberg wsj com for a discussion on todays column go to wsj com forums to see past columns please go to careerjournal com
