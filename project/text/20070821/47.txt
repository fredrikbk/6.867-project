home &amp family best of the juggle excerpts from wsj coms work &amp family blog whats your game plan for the first day of school last week we received the big packet a thick envelope from our daughters nursery school containing every detail about the coming year i was surprised to learn about an orientation for parents and kids the day after labor day that wednesday is the official first day of school now i am wondering about my own schedule i had been planning to take a personal day so i could pick my daughter up from school and hear about her first day now i will use the time off for orientation but i am also considering taking that next day as well my husband was mystified by my debate for his first days of school he said his parents put him on the bus with little fanfare what are your plans for the start of a new school year readers say "for my son i dropped him off at school on the first day and let him take the van to day care he felt capable and grown up and it helped him more than my leading him everywhere " "i actually take a vacation week for the first week of school i think it is important for you to experience it " tempted to stay at home the juggle recently received an email from a reader who said she was a full time working mom considering giving up her job in the legal industry she described "sleepless nights crying uncontrollably late sunday nights and yearning to be at home " the reader who said her husband is also a professional wondered why she keeps going "is it pride at work that if i quit ill be considered a failure by co workers is it pride where i might consider myself a failure if i quit that i couldnt do it all " she asked for thoughts from others on why they keep holding on especially if they dont love their jobs and have the choice to stay home readers say "i suppose we could manage on one salary but i love my job am happy that im setting a good example to my daughter that you need to pay your way in life " "fourteen years ago i quit my postdoctoral fellowship at stanford to become a full time father to our one year old son we now have three children i am still mainly a stay at home dad and i couldnt have made a better choice for me and my family " i now pronounce you legit at work from wsj com editor emily friedlander i was married at the end of june and the small talk question has been "hows married life " because my husband and i lived together for two years friends typically pause a beat and say "i bet nothings changed " actually something has changed and it is in the words husband and wife now that we have names to call each other besides "girlfriend" or "fiance " it is simpler to discuss each other at work i realized this a few weeks ago when i called my husband to ask about dinner plans before we were married we would speak in hushed tones and the conversation would typically be very quick this time we didnt whisper and chatted longer the difference my husband suggested had to do with the fact that now he was speaking to his "wife " having the titles husband and wife seems to legitimize the intrusion of ones personal life in the workplace readers do you find that the terms "boyfriend" or "girlfriend" have a less legitimate ring readers say "i announced my engagement at work years ago was i taken more seriously well i was congratulated and then was asked when will you have children and are you still going to work " "i just got engaged and all of a sudden i feel like my boss and older married peers have started taking me more seriously " post your thoughts on these and other work and family topics at www wsj com thejuggle
