fed fails so far in bid to reassure anxious investors investors largely shrugged off the federal reserves attempt to restore order to the credit markets and bought up the safest government securities triggering the biggest drop in yields on short term treasury bills in nearly years while the stock market rose conditions improved in currency markets and several companies successfully sold new bonds investors refused to take any risk with their cash holdings instead they accepted sharply lower yields in exchange for the safety of government bonds their actions signaled that the fed which moved friday to shore up confidence in the markets has failed so far to persuade investors that problems in securities linked to subprime mortgage loans wouldnt cause widespread losses in normally safe securities to ease a worsening credit crunch the fed on friday cut the interest rate it charges on direct loans to banks from its "discount window" to from and took other steps designed to increase the flow of cash to the nations financial system while the fed didnt alter the key federal funds rate its target for short term interest rates it said that the "downside risks to growth have increased appreciably" and it was "prepared to act " it made no mention of inflation its principal concern for the past two years stock and bond markets initially reacted positively to the feds overture but grew more skeptical as this week began the reaction yesterday in the treasury bill market can be seen as "a vote of no confidence in the feds move " said larry dyer an interest rate strategist at hsbc securities in new york "if people felt that the end of the problem was around the corner yields would be higher but were still seeing a continued flight to quality and thats not what the fed wanted " the latest wave of risk aversion in the credit markets is being led by managers of money market funds which are designed to behave like bank accounts and whose primary goal is to avoid losing money for investors while some of these funds own only short term treasury bills most also own corporate ious known as commercial paper and other highly rated short term securities because both individual and institutional investors are worried about risks in the commercial paper market they have been shifting money to treasury only funds that has forced funds that hold commercial paper to sell some of those holdings and treasury only funds to buy even more treasury bills some funds that own both types of securities are shifting toward treasurys mutual fund companies such as vanguard group and fidelity investments say they have been flooded with calls from investors asking whether their money market funds hold commercial paper backed by mortgage securities vanguard said its money funds arent exposed to subprime mortgage assets and fidelity said it has "minimal" holdings of them still in many cases investors have moved their money to lower yielding treasury funds in the final three days of last week money market investors overall poured &# billion into these treasury and government only funds while pulling &# billion out of so called prime money markets which can invest in other securities according to imoneynet inc which tracks money market mutual funds money market managers themselves are worried about losing money or "breaking the buck " a reference to the stable net asset value of these funds michael cheah a fixed income portfolio manager at aig sunamerica asset management in jersey city n j said a colleague recently asked whether he should invest in a seven day commercial paper issue from a large u s bank the paper bore an attractive yield of around "i told him this is all about safety if we break the buck we will lose our bonus and may get fired " said mr cheah adding it would be better to invest in treasurys the manager decided to put the money in a short term treasury repurchase loan that paid "this is about dealing with what we dont know there is little margin for error in money market funds " said mr cheah as investors snapped up three month treasury bills yesterday prices soared and the yield which moves in the opposite direction fell for the fifth straight day tumbling percentage points to the sharpest decline since january the three month yield sank as low as at one point during the day the yield on one month treasury bills fell percentage points to "the market is clearly saying that what the fed has done isnt enough were having a crisis of confidence and investors with the cash have no risk appetite at all " said james kauffmann head of fixed income at ing investment management in atlanta still many analysts say it is too early to measure the full effect of the feds effort to improve liquidity by encouraging banks to borrow stocks rose yesterday as investors digested the feds move the dow jones industrial average gained points to on top of fridays point advance one positive sign from the credit markets is that several companies managed to sell new bonds yesterday sabic innovative plastics sold &# billion in junk bonds to fund its buyout of general electric co s ge plastics unit agreeing to pay interest on the debt it was the largest junk debt sale since a sale of loans by chrysler group in late july comcast corp bank of america corp and citigroup inc also issued new investment grade bonds in addition to cutting the discount rate the fed also moved friday to lengthen the term of any direct fed loans to banks to days from one day and reminded banks they could pledge a wide variety of collateral including unimpaired subprime mortgages fed officials reassured bankers that they would view borrowing from the discount window as a sign of banks strength such loans have developed a stigma because they have been viewed as a last resort for troubled banks while banks dont need the cash the fed hopes they will use it to lend to their own customers or to finance transactions in relatively safe securities such as those backed by prime jumbo mortgages so far deutsche bank ag is the only bank that has said it has borrowed from the discount window according to people familiar with the german bank even so the fed hinted yesterday that it is expecting a sizable response by banks it said it would redeem &# billion of maturing treasury bills in its portfolio to offset other factors that could expand its balance sheet such as "discount window borrowings " traders took that as evidence the fed expects borrowings of several billion dollars in coming days the planned move has the added benefit of freeing up more treasury bills for the public to buy the treasury department is also expected to help by offering a larger than expected &# billion in new four week treasury bills at its auction today fed officials have indicated they expect it to take some time before they know whether their actions have restored confidence to the debt markets some economists say the fed may have only a few days to wait for market conditions to improve if conditions deteriorate it will have to take the more aggressive step of cutting its main interest rate target the federal funds rate from the current stephen stanley chief economist at rbs greenwich capital said the fed has given the impression it would prefer not to cut rates at all and that if it had to it would do so at its scheduled sept policy meeting "but given what happened today im not sure theyll make it that far " while the stock market rose and trading appeared to improve in currency and some bond markets money managers said it was still difficult to make trades in some cases jeff gladstein global head of foreign exchange trading at aig financial products corp in wilton conn said that trading liquidity in some of the high yielding currencies like those of many emerging market countries was the worst he had seen in a few years "theres a repricing of risk going on " he said in other currency markets volatility declined in comparison to last week the relative calm "doesnt necessarily mean that nervousness is declining " said jens nordvig a currency strategist at goldman sachs "theres not much appetite to trade " the elevated uncertainty about where money market rates are heading is also making it more difficult to price currency forwards which are contracts used to trade a currency at some future date if theres going to be abnormal volatility in prices "you need a strong desire in order to trade at all " said mr nordvig the european commercial paper market also struggled despite recent injections of capital yesterday traders in london said trading was difficult investors demanded higher yields and shorter durations in a research note yesterday deutsche bank analyst ganesh rajendra said "never before in our memory has the european structured finance market looked so fragile " the problems in the market caused troubles for another investment firm london hedge fund and money manager solent capital partners llp said an affiliate might have to sell some assets including securities tied to u s mortgages because it couldnt raise the funding it needs solent which had &# billion under management in

in the u s wall street money market specialists said that while some issuers of commercial paper backed by mortgage assets had to exit the market most of the maturing short term debt was being resold
