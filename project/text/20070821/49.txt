recently begun offering individual health insurance packages tailored for young adults the fastest growing population of uninsured americans besides basic medical coverage the packages also often

shoulder during a martial arts workout still mr wolfson says he likes having the policy in case anything catastrophic happens "its protection for the big stuff " he says insurers are expanding their insurance offerings for individuals in part because of the dwindling share of employers especially smaller companies offering health benefits in recent years though the new plans could meet some of the needs of a number of young and older people they wont necessarily reach those among the roughly million uninsured americans most in need of health coverage thats because the new plans currently
