welcome to london your luggage is missing why british airways is worse than even u s airlines at losing and finding bags the strains of the worlds aviation system can be seen pretty clearly in ned soltzs moldy luggage on june his suitcase was lost by british airways plc at londons heathrow airport on its way to israel mr soltz an arlington texas rabbi and digital video author says british airways often didnt answer baggage office phones or respond to emails when the bag finally was delivered to him by fedex on aug days after his trip ended he says the suitcase was so water logged that black mold was growing on his clothes and audio visual equipment "it was tremendously stressful because they were so quintessentially unhelpful " he said british airways has been a baggage nightmare for travelers since christmas last year tens of thousands of bags have piled up at heathrow at various times this summer british airways the worlds second largest airline in international passenger traffic mishandled bags per passengers in the second quarter this year a rate that is twice as bad as the worst u s major airline us airways group inc in all british airways has lost the bags of more than customers in the first half of this year the airline says it is sorry about customer experiences like rabbi soltzs and that its baggage operation is returning to "normal" now but at heathrow it is still susceptible to meltdowns when flights are delayed a look into the root causes of british airways baggage problems reveals much about the state of airline dysfunction today theres finger pointing between various groups responsible for operations plus a lack of manpower aging equipment jam packed planes security hassles and schedules packed too tightly together just like airport delays bumped passengers and other travel problems this year the british airways baggage system shows how airlines have made operations so lean and taxed infrastructure so fully that problems compound exponentially for customers traveler beware many of the problems likely wont ease until british airways moves into a new heathrow terminal in march or the british government relaxes its security restriction allowing only one carry on bag which has sharply increased the volume of checked baggage after the alleged liquid bomb plot was uncovered in august british authorities limited carry on baggage to one piece period the rest of the world lets travelers take two bags on board planes usually one suitcase and one personal bag like a briefcase or purse that increased the volume of checked baggage on british airways by about added volume strained a system already overtaxed regis philbin launched into a rant on his "live with regis and kelly" show last month about how british airways lost two of his wifes suitcases and returned one soaking wet mr philbin told his audience one of his wifes favorite armani dresses was ruined trudi behr a marketing consultant from los angeles says she arrived at british airways baggage claim area in heathrow in late july to see luggage stacked feet high "there were rows and rows of bags " she said hers wasnt delivered and a british airways representative told her it would be on the next flight out of rome where she had been on a business trip "i fell for it " said ms behr she tried to track her bags through british airways electronic system but got no updates she couldnt reach anyone to talk to then days after they were lost the three bags arrived at her los angeles home one each day for three consecutive days some problems emanate from the airport itself the association of european airlines says the heathrow baggage system physically failed times during may and june including power failures and breakdowns in a tunnel of conveyor belts that move bags between british airways buildings terminal and terminal heathrows owner and operator baa ltd "is delivering embarrassingly low service levels on everything from security wait times to baggage delivery and almost everything in between " giovanni bisignani chief executive of the international air transport association said earlier this month baa says problems have largely been airline problems not airport baa which is owned by grupo ferrovial of spain says it sorts bags for airlines and delivers them to drop points after that its all up to the airline "the airports baggage system is extremely robust and is coping well since the one bag rule was introduced in " a baa spokeswoman said british airways says weather has been a major factor fog last christmas storms this summer that has meant widespread flight delays something the airlines baggage setup hasnt been able to cope with while passengers run to get on their connecting flights bags dont move as fast and british airways hasnt held airplanes waiting for their bags the carrier says theres only enough room in its baggage hall where bags for specific flights aggregate and are loaded onto carts for the scheduled number of flights each hour the airline doesnt want planes sitting at gates waiting for bags because it needs the gate for other flights and it doesnt have room in its baggage hall for delayed flights leave a station dedicated too long to a delayed flight and theres no place to put bags that customers are checking for upcoming flights so its round em up and move em out whether they get on the right flight or not "if the airline holds too many planes at heathrow gridlock can develop in terminal areas and taxiways and its the same for baggage " said david noyes head of british airways heathrow operation "the whole effect snowballs and it doesnt take long to get gridlock " sending customers without their bags only compounds problems because the delayed bags will have to undergo special security screening to fly later without their owners that takes time and manpower mr noyes says british airways has supplemented the troublesome tunnel with vans and trucks and is in the process of hiring more baggage handlers the airline has used cargo carriers to ship out delayed bags and british airways has changed its schedule to add minutes to its minimum connection times now minutes for connections in different terminals and minutes for connections in the same terminal in addition british airways has been hiring phone staff after realizing it didnt have enough workers to answer customer calls it used to tell customers to call the baggage office where the bag was lost but heathrow baggage workers were often out looking for bags and rarely answered the phone the ultimate solution mr noyes noted is the march opening of terminal which will greatly boost capacity and move of the airlines operations under one roof
