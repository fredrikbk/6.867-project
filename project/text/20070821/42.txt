googling monopoly barely a week goes by without a new google controversy most recently the company has been in a dispute at the fcc over the rules for the upcoming spectrum auction egged on by self styled public interest groups and google rivals regulators have the company in their sights google has been under fire in europe for retaining its data too long in oakland calif for recording someones cat sitting in a window as part of its new street view map service and back in washington for purchasing the internet advertising firm doubleclick in the last few months the three most prominent players in the world of online advertising have each announced major acquisitions google doubleclick microsoft aquantive and yahoo right media yet the google deal has stirred the most controversy and is currently being scrutinized by the federal trade commission merger reviews are difficult when the markets are rapidly changing as they clearly are here internet advertising is growing rapidly up globally in the last year as tv and the internet converge the market will expand even more dramatically the great appeal of internet advertising is the ability to target the message to consumers more precisely than in other media using information from a variety of sources including sometimes the past history of an individuals internet browsing ads can be delivered to consumers that are most likely to be of use to them those who complain about googles purchase of doubleclick make two claims both are flawed the first argument is that since both firms have a large market share of their respective spheres a merger would be monopolistic the flaw is that the two companies undertake activities that dont overlap google places text ads mainly on its own web sites and search result screens doubleclick delivers display ads from advertisers to web sites it creates no ads and controls no web sites even if we believe that internet advertising is a distinct market debatable since it comprises only about of all advertising the combined firms will not gain any market power since they do not have any business in common the second argument comes from privacy advocates who have filed a brief with the ftc they say the merger "could impact the privacy interests of million internet users in north america " the ftcs antitrust function and its consumer protection function are fundamentally different indeed the more information markets have the more competitive they are if "privacy" advocates have their way there would be less information and markets would not work as well marketers use information some people have a cockeyed notion that if this information benefits marketers it is to the detriment of consumers wrong consumers benefit when marketers provide them with information about products especially new products that they may want a free flow of information enabling more efficient "targeting" of consumers is to their advantage opponents of googles purchase of doubleclick also cite the risk of identity theft which they claim is increasing the actual data from javelin strategy and research indicate that identity theft is not increasing more important free use of information reduces this risk after all how does a seller identify a purchaser one way is to ask questions of which "mothers maiden name" is only one for this method to work sellers must have access to the information needed to check the answers and be sure that the purchaser is in fact who he says he is it is exactly because this information is available that consumers can obtain financing for a car in one day and more generally make purchases in many venues including the internet easily our intuitions about privacy and information are flawed we tend to think that if something is known then a person knows it but most of the information used in internet marketing is "known" only to computers these computers do not start with a person and ask "what do we know about tom lenard " rather they start by asking "which ip numbers internet addresses are likely to be associated with someone interested in a new car " and then put ads for automobiles on those computers no one knows or cares whose computer is targeted even google does not fully understand this process when its opponents claim the company will have access to excessive information google defends itself by pointing out that they have in the past not misused data the better answer is that the information to which they will have access will be useful for both consumers and sellers and by having access to additional information they will provide large social benefits both the antitrust and the consumer protection branches of the ftc should leave this acquisition alone it will create benefits with no increase in market power and no harmful reduction of privacy mr lenard is acting president of the progress and freedom foundation mr rubin an adjunct fellow at the foundation is professor of economics and law at emory university both were senior officials at the ftc during the s
