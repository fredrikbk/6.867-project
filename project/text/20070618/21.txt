cereal killer remember when the idea of lawsuits over sugared cereal was a joke back when joe camel was public enemy number one skeptics warned that tony the tiger would be next well were almost there last thursday kellogg co announced it would stop using licensed characters like shrek for marketing unless the food in question meets certain nutrition benchmarks for sugar fat and calories disney and others arent far behind so whats next cigarettes have disappeared from the silver screen so a little airbrushing might soon be in order for winnie the poohs honeypot and a heads up to the food network which is planning an episode this month on cakes inspired by great cartoon characters like curious george betty boop and scooby doo please dont try these treats at home this retreat comes after the naderite center for science in the public interest and the more recently minted campaign for a commercial free childhood threatened a lawsuit against kellogg and nickelodeon for marketing junk foods to children or what is alleged to be "multimedia brainwashing " the claim is that kids are vulnerable to "slick advertising " though the last time we checked not many kids were buying their own breakfast food sugared breakfast cereals arent the cause of obesity among children theyve been around for decades and are a source of nutrition for children who will find a way to sweeten plain corn flakes in any case try serving your child a grapefruit for breakfast and watch him scowl unless he can pile on spoonfuls of sugar the rise of obesity in kids has far more to do with a lack of exercise and overeating in general but you cant sue parents for letting jason and emily watch tv for hours so the food activists who are fronts for the trial bar are targeting the cereal makers and broadcasters kellogg has embraced stricter "self regulation " no doubt preferring it to defending against lawsuits or legislative mandates but the effect is the same banning certain kinds of marketing the real issue is the threat of lawsuits themselves which can cost tens of millions to defend while a companys stock price is held hostage to a media assault no family brand looks forward to a public shellacking for causing obesity and other afflictions in children but for kellogg to cave so quickly is an unfortunate sign of the times by withdrawing advertising from elementary schools and certain programming and getting rid of movie characters like shrek and spongebob bad body types companies like kellogg will only encourage more intimidation by lawsuit see related letter "letters to the editor needed new commitment to shape up our children" wsj june
