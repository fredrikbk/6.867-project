markets in europe and asia were mixed wendys move towards a sale wendys the nations third largest hamburger chain said that it believes that a sale of the company merits thorough consideration news that would appear to bump it that much nearer to a deal that some of its most powerful shareholders have eagerly sought highfields capital management which owns of the companys shares and other big investors have pushed for the burger company to find a buyer and wendys has pranced around the sale question for most of the spring the company announced in april that it had created a special board committee to investigate its strategic alternatives that was followed in may by the news that it had retained j p morgan chase and lehman brothers to advise it on the strategic review then today the sale seemed to emerge as the leading possibility though a possible securitization financing was also mentioned the company said that there was no assurance a deal would be struck but chairman james pickett said the goal was to "move forward expeditiously " investors did not seem very excited by the long sought after development however wendys stock jumped by nearly when it announced that a sale may be in the offing back in april but they sank by more than today thats probably because wendys business looks softer than a soggy hamburger bun at the moment alongside the strategy shift wendys

company said that customers have reacted to steeper prices by spending less leading same store sales to come up short of its forecasts wendys spokesman bob bertini noted that the burger chain has "a very aggressive marketing campaign underway " but dumping more money into marketing could also pinch wendys bottom line over the short term big orders land at paris air show there are scarcely two
