mr fujinos bumpy flight lands honda in the jet age greensboro n c for years michimasa fujino an engineer for honda motor co pursued a mission that on the surface seemed both unrealistic and unnecessary transforming honda from just another japanese car maker into the first successful japanese aircraft builder since world war ii now mr fujino is close to realizing his dream with a tiny five passenger jet with the unusual feature of having its engines mounted above its wings executives hope the hondajet which could start flying in about three years will shake up the jet business with the same high fuel efficiency clever design and low price that the first generation honda civic used to rattle detroits auto giants three decades ago its been an arduous quest taking mr fujino from tokyo to starkville miss back to tokyo and finally to a rented hangar here in the north carolina piedmont along the way his intelligence has been questioned his design has been mocked and his friends have feared for his career "even today so called experts tell me with a knowing look that the over the wing engine mount is doomed " mr fujino says "but anger has been part of the energy that pushed me throughout " honda president takeo fukui says he believes the hondajet which is awaiting federal certification could grab of the small jet market and turn a profit in three to four years as long as it is able to deliver all the performance and price claims "honda should be able to nibble a share " says joe feord a director of the aviation consulting firm munro &amp associates troy mich "i dont think thats a big stretch " compared with the roughly similar cessna citation cj+ one of a new breed of less expensive small jets that seat four to six passengers the hondajet is designed to cruise faster and can take off and land on shorter runways it is also a much more economical jet the &# million honda plane uses about less fuel than the citation flying for instance at a speed of miles an hour and at an altitude of feet it also has passenger cabin space that is nearly larger and has cargo space "big enough for paris hilton " mr fujino boasts with more room than the cj+ on top of all that the honda is priced &# below the cessna and boasts the fit and finish of a luxury car cessna a textron inc unit says its watching the hondajet closely but points out the cj+ is the third generation of citation and has more advanced electronics than the newcomer as well as a world wide service network honda which wont disclose how much money it has spent to develop the jet says it has orders and deposits from more than potential customers but success is far from guaranteed honda and its radical design face daunting challenges in an industry where customers tend to be conservative and the market for tiny jets is getting crowded with new offerings like the eclipse jet designed and marketed by privately held eclipse aviation corp priced at about &# million honda believes its jet should be able to compete effectively with less expensive minijets like the eclipse for one thing the hondajet is bigger which allows it to offer amenities they dont have such as a full size lavatory mr fujino succeeded in keeping his project alive by nurturing ties to senior executives and by linking his risk taking to hondas broader efforts to rekindle a spirit of innovation mr fujino fondly remembers occasional late night dinners and drinks with top executives like mr fukui while formal reviews of the plane project could be "explosive" and "ugly" at times mr fujino says behind the scenes some of the companys top managers cheered on his efforts "there was a feeling inside the company that fujinos idea wasnt going to fly " mr fukui says " but we didnt want to give up because we didnt want to create an ordinary plane we wanted fujino to give us a jet that could create a new value and performance equation " mr fujino who is now president of honda aircraft co started his journey in when he was plucked out of a job working on electrical steering control to join a small team designing a personal jet they were sent to mississippi state university in starkville miles northeast of jackson to collaborate with the school on advanced aeronautics by the mid s the team developed a jet called mh that design featured a fuselage made of composite materials instead of more conventional aluminum but the company didnt believe the design would be competitive and killed the project in amid this uncertainty mr fujino began thinking about an unorthodox design that would prove critical to the hondajets performance putting the engines above the wing instead of underneath the wing or on the rear of the fuselage the idea ran against long held conventions designers usually avoid mounting anything on top of the wings for fear of creating a drag on the plane mr fujino says his design was inspired by a "classical" air flow calculation described in a s aeronautics textbook the initial proposal in met with skepticism from colleagues mr fujino says one dubious boss called him the "stupidest engineer ive ever met in my life " but nobuhiko kawamoto then honda president and an airplane aficionado who as head of research and development in the mid s launched the airplane project encouraged the idea at one critical board meeting mr fujino and his unconventional design met strong resistance a "cold gaze " as he puts it from many directors who doubted the odd looking jets marketability mr fujino presenting his idea by himself in front of the board struggled initially but he thinks he was able to drive home the jets potential when he analogized it to hondas breakthrough car calling the jet a "civic of the sky " even after hondas board gave mr fujino its blessing the project stalled again in this time slowed by new team members who expressed renewed design doubts initially mr fujino says he tried to address their concerns but made little progress in the end he began working exclusively with those who believed in the engine over the wing design and ignored the rest the project to his surprise began gaining steam still there were skeptics a friend of mr fujinos who was working for nasa as an engineer warned him against presenting his design to an academic conference fearing it posed a "career ending" risk if a flaw were found mr fujinos concept eventually received a favorable review from the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics in mr fujino says the frustrations have been worth it "a lot of companies try to cut into the small jet business but most of them repeat the same mistakes " he says "if honda had done it the same way and did not learn all the skills and technologies involved all from scratch we couldnt have come up with the design we have today "
