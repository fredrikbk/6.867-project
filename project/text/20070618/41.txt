ge and pearson discuss joint bid for dow jones talks signal alternative to news corp s offer could be taking shape as dow jones &amp co s controlling bancroft family continues to fret about selling to rupert murdoch general electric co and financial times publisher pearson plc are in talks about making a joint bid for dow jones that would allow the family to keep a minority interest the two companies have discussed a scenario in which ges cnbc business channel the ft and dow jones would be combined into a privately held joint venture according to people familiar with the matter the venture would be owned equally by ge and pearson with the bancrofts holding a minority stake these people said the ge pearson talks which these people cautioned are preliminary and could collapse signal that an alternative may be emerging to news corp s &# billion bid for dow jones publisher of the wall street journal until now mr murdoch news corp s chairman has been in the pole position with few serious rivals but the appearance of ge and pearson brings to the fore two names that may be more palatable to the bancrofts the family worried that mr murdoch might interfere in the journals news coverage is trying to hammer out a deal to safeguard the newspapers editorial independence in the event of a sale to news corp the new venture ge and pearson are discussing would have a strong global presence in business news and financial information in addition to the journal the ft and cnbc it would own barrons financial weekly of the economist magazine and interests in business newspapers in russia france south africa and india as well as the leading stock indexes in both the u s and the united kingdom it would also include dow jones newswires the factiva electronic news database and a controlling stake in interactive data corp a compiler of financial information cnbcs modest web site would be augmented by dow joness wsj com and marketwatch and pearsons ft com creating a potent online business news presence both ge which is based in fairfield conn and london based pearson have reason to fear a murdoch dow jones tie up news corp s global presence would help the wall street journal compete with the ft in europe and asia and the dow jones imprimatur would be likely to help news corp s planned fox news business channel compete against cnbc last month after concluding that it would be tough for dow jones to remain independent the bancroft family said it would consider offers for the company including news corp s &# a share bid but the family remains concerned about mr murdochs history of interfering in his news operations something it hopes to prevent with an agreement on standards for editorial independence the bancroft family members on dow joness board and their advisers met with mr murdoch two weeks ago but havent agreed on a proposal they think adequately protects the journal some family members have tried to slow down negotiations with mr murdoch fearing they may not be able to come up with a sufficiently strong structure although the bancrofts havent sent a revised proposal to news corp some in the murdoch camp are frustrated at what they believe to be the familys excessive demands they say the family essentially wants to keep editorial control of dow jones and leave news corp s hands tied "were not going to spend &# billion and then leave them the keys to the house " said one such person ge and pearson are discussing a plan under which each would take a roughly or stake in the company with the bancroft family members holding to the structure would allow some of the family to sell their stakes but would let others roll their dow jones stock into the new venture thereby avoiding any big tax bill the dividends regularly paid the bancrofts would be scaled back one person familiar with the matter said the structure could allow ge to gain a sizable stake in the venture without contributing any cash thanks to the hefty value of cnbc pearson which has been under pressure from analysts and investors for years to sell the financially struggling ft could contribute the ft group and some cash to get an equivalent stake the offer also would almost certainly include a measure of debt one of the challenges any transaction would face is how to cash out dow joness existing shareholders assuming for instance that the bancrofts kept a interest in the company the partners would still have to come up with an estimated &# billion in cash based on a value of &# a share a figure that would probably have to come from debt and cash contributions from pearson people close to the situation cited the complexity of three way mergers and pointed to another serious sticking point in the case at hand the lack of a clear leader who could integrate the disparate businesses all these difficulties lead many with knowledge of the situation to describe the possibility of such a deal in the same words "a long shot " the structure under discussion is similar in some ways to the one used by ge to gain control of universal studios in in that deal ge contributed the nbc television network and several cable channels such as msnbc and cnbc to a joint venture it formed with vivendi universal sa owner of the universal film studio and a group of cable channels though it put no cash into the deal ge ended up with an stake giving it control of a broader series of media businesses at relatively low cost in the vivendi case ges offer won out against a more cash rich deal proposed by a group led by edgar bronfman jr both pearson and ge have talked to other parties in recent weeks about a tie up for dow jones pearson chief executive marjorie scardino was in new york last week looking for potential partners ges nbc universal held discussions with microsoft corp about combining dow jones with a portion of nbc universal but the two sides couldnt agree on an approach those talks involved a similar structure to the one discussed with pearson said people familiar with the matter "microsoft is always open to exploring partnership opportunities including with companies like ge " a microsoft spokesman said yesterday but it is no longer holding talks with ge over dow jones ges interest shows that it is wrestling with how to confront news corp s plans for a business news channel a purchase of dow jones would give news corp an important tool in challenging cnbc it would however have to get around an exclusive content sharing contract between dow jones and cnbc that runs through the cnbc channel is a profitable part of nbc universal but the divisions nbc network has seen its ratings slide in recent years and ge has faced pressure from shareholders to turn around its entertainment assets in addition to ge pearson has approached hearst corp and others about a possible bid for dow jones hearst and dow jones jointly publish smartmoney magazine ge has also informally discussed a bid for dow jones with iac interactivecorp but as of last week iac appeared to be taking no action though it isnt clear what price pearson and general electric might offer for dow jones under a potential bid the family has been in agreement that it would give serious consideration to an offer that was lower than news corp s &# a share if it felt the buyer could protect the wall street journals integrity better than mr murdoch one family member said in p m composite trading friday on the new york stock exchange dow jones shares were up &# or at &# the familys decision still could be wrenching mr murdoch has deep pockets a strategic vision and a firm commitment to the newspaper business he could be expected to expand dow jones digitally and around the globe and isnt hamstrung by tight financial controls ge by contrast has put tight financial reins on nbc and it is likely that the alternative structure it is discussing would require more of the belt tightening that has plagued the newspaper industry as a whole ges ownership could also create a potential news coverage conflict for dow jones the company is the worlds second largest corporation by market capitalization with interests in a number of sectors covered by dow jones from airplane engines and real estate to nuclear power and medical devices any deal involving pearson which has been under pressure to concentrate on its profitable textbook and education businesses would probably call for cost savings in news operations the ft generated just of pearsons &# billion in revenue last year pearson is the worlds largest educational publisher and has a large testing arm it also owns book publisher penguin the journal and the ft have a good deal of overlap the journal has separate editions in europe and asia that compete with similar editions of the ft the ft whose home market is britain is strong in europe but less so in the u s the wall street journal is by far the u s s leading business publication by circulation but is only a minor player in europe pearson and dow jones held extensive discussions around three years ago about combining their newspapers operations in europe and asia according to two people familiar with the matter these talks eventually broke down primarily because of concerns that the move would dilute the newspapers brands in those markets cost savings from the proposed deal werent significant enough to outweigh those concerns aaron o patrick susan pulliam and matthew karnitschnig contributed to this article
