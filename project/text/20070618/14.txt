business solutions playing well with others how ibms employees have taken social networking to an unusual level cambridge mass martin t koszewski one of international business machines corp s top salesmen is wearing a navy blue suit burgundy tie and white shirt for his daily meetings with top computer buyers at mutual fund giant fidelity investments but on his computer he is a master of the social networking tools that are increasingly popular with a less staid set when he flips open his laptop he instant messages with the fervor of a teenage girl he has an avatar in the virtual community second life which he has used to help with a sales pitch he has a personal page in ibms bluepages a kind of corporate equivalent of myspace com big blue is big on social networking some ibm workers have registered blogs on the companys internal computer network where they opine on technology and their work employees starting a new project routinely create information storing web sites called wikis for sharing memos as they build their teams thousands of ibm workers swap lists of useful web sites and corporate resources using an ibm developed program for "social bookmarking" called dogear similarly when an employee calls an ibm expert for assistance with something he or she may be invited to rate the value of the help bosses see those ratings at review time while all modern businesses communicate electronically few have adopted the webs leading edge techniques for socializing some are skeptical that such tools are useful others fear they will be abused ibm has jumped in with both feet it says the tools foster teamwork among employees who work in ibm offices from boston to bangalore social networking is especially important for the of ibm employees who regularly work from their homes or client locations rather than ibm facilities unlike many companies that lay low out of fears that employee postings on the web could include gossip harassment or legal liability ibm simply reminds workers to remember the rules of privacy respect and confidentiality in ibms code of conduct richard calo vice president global work force relations says "when i wake up in the middle of the night im worrying about" employees abusing the system but he says ibm has presented access to the tool as a privilege "in exchange for participating in the global by seven exchange they seem to abide by the guidelines of collaborative etiquette " he says blogging started to go out of bounds during the world cup soccer finals however he says other employees squelched the discussion without any corporate action at most companies public relations managers and the human resources department tightly control all electronic communications except for email and instant messaging companies internal web pages are just analogues of the corporate newsletters forms and phone books that companies used in the previous century not at ibm despite its century old roots and button down east coast tradition ibm has leapt to web the latest incarnation of the internet in which user generated content is considered as valuable as content written by pros or company officials at ibm nobody is allowed to be anonymous online and its easy for anyone to send someones superior evidence of anything they regard as inappropriate as a result the profanity laced flame wars that happen on many public sites dont occur within ibms firewalls employees online cant disparage competitors or reveal customer names without permission "any employee can have a blog a wiki or a podcast " says ethan mccarty editor in chief of w ibms constantly updated daily online newsletter which most employees keep on their home page on mr mccartys newsletter "i trust employees to rank headlines" and pick what stories appear first he says such ranking is done by "tagging " or suggesting keywords relevant to the stories the more taggers the more valuable the article is considered when a person puts a tag on the page it also lets the system know he or she is interested in subjects of that type and w places such stories high on the employees personal page at ibm the key to the social network is bluepages the employee edited corporate directory when an employee wants to know who tagged a particular story he or she can see the name click on it and get directly to the persons blue pages entry clicking on the persons name in their bluepages entry allows the user to send an im to that person or view other tags the person has created bluepages which lists ibm employees both full and part time is used six million times a day by ibm employees it contains basic information from the hr department name title location phone and email it also shows where people are in the ibm hierarchy but bluepages is like myspace in the sense that employees have control of most of their own content for photos they can eschew the id badge headshot for pictures with their dogs or children or in costume from halloween ibm is far more demure than myspace though only thumbnail photos are permitted and nobodys page can play a favorite song employees can post their resumes to highlight particular skills opening themselves up for new opportunities the social networking tools are part of daily work life mr koszewski the salesman on the fidelity account says that ibms instant messaging system helped him keep his client happy a few weeks ago a fidelity software chief called to ask him to make sure that a new software program ibm was converting to run on sun microsystems computers would be delivered on time mr koszewski says that while waiting for his next appointment in a lobby at fidelity he was able to open his laptop and check his "buddy list" of people on his sales team he found that his software manager was in dallas he sent him an im asking him to contact the developer in lexington mass because "a developer wouldnt take a phone call from me hed think talking to a salesman was a low priority " his software manager who knew the developer quickly got confirmation that the project was on schedule other ibmers are using more exotic social networking tools grady booch one of ibms senior software architects who lives in boulder colo increasingly avoids travel instead he uses second life an online virtual community owned by san francisco based linden lab in second life mr booch has a long haired bearded avatar which he concedes is "more buff than me " recently when he was closing on a second home in hawaii he managed to use his avatar to attend a meeting in malaysia that was also taking place online ibm owns more than "islands" in second life and often uses them for lectures and group discussions a lecture in a second life virtual meeting room allows a distant person to place his or her avatar in the room and see power point slides while reading the text of the lecture in some cases the human can hear the lecture via a conference call while watching the virtual lecture viewers can use instant messaging to send questions and receive answers from the lecturer or other avatars lynne hamilton who runs professional development classes for ibms human resources department says second life is used for orienting new employees located in china and brazil an hr avatar can give a talk and then respond to text questions from the new employees ms hamilton says many of the international employees prefer writing the questions so the virtual meetings improve interaction two years ago when blogging became popular on the internet ibm invited employees to co author guidelines for blogging using a community forum that attracted some people the guidelines were approved by ibms legal human resources and public relations departments and now they serve as ibm policy john rooney manager of innovation programs for ibms chief information officer says ibm decided it needed to adopt social networking technology in part because "five years ago there was a concern that ibm wasnt attracting the best technical talent" from colleges and grad schools so the company started assigning interns to making self publishing blogging software that could contain content within ibms walls originally the software was meant only for internal use but its now being adapted for sale to customers another social technology embraced by ibmers is the wiki wikis are collaboration sites with lots of text describing a project that any team member can add to edit or delete many users say wikis are much easier to set up and use than proprietary collaboration tools like ibms own lotus notes or microsoft corp s groove two years ago ibm started wiki central to manage wikis for ibm groups it now has more than wikis online with more than users some groups manage their software production schedules on a wiki with team members saying when a software module has been completed and debugged brian goodman manager of an ibm software development team called "web ahead " says that because his team members keep the whole team apprised of how their assignments are going "i have a single view of the projects and their status without pinging each of them once a day" with an im mr goodman cant just walk down the hall at his office in southbury conn because his team members work from home in new york city and in massachusetts at ibms wiki central employees can grab small programs called widgets to enhance their wikis mr goodman says there is a "polling widget" that lets members of the group vote on issues such as the maximum size for a data file within the program and a "rating widget" that lets team members rate various proposals a new feature of ibms collaboration tools uses google maps and instant messaging tools to show people where their team members are on a recent monday morning david marshak a program director at the lotus unit clicked on the program and saw a map indicating most of the people on his buddy list were working from their homes in the boston area li te cheng an ibm software developer in cambridge mass says he finds the ability to identify and share bookmarks of web pages using ibms dogear program to be among the most useful aspects of social networking according to the program he ranks no among ibms biggest bookmarkers "my motivation is to keep tabs on whats hot and upcoming " he says he subscribes to the bookmarks of other advanced users seeing sites they find useful as soon as they mark them dogear also augments traditional search capabilities recently mr cheng changed laptops and wanted to find out how to set up the new machine for remote access when he typed "remote access" in the internal search engine the top references had to do with ibms global services business but when he typed it in dogear he found people had had the same problem and bookmarked the solution he needed mr bulkeley is a staff reporter in the wall street journals boston bureau he can be reached at bill bulkeley wsj com
