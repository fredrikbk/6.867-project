politics &amp economics japans policy plan draws fire for lack of steam dearth of proposals on economy hurt abe at critical point tokyo when shinzo abe became prime minister in september voters and investors hoped he would continue japans moves to cut public spending boost economic growth and shore up the pension system so far they arent impressed tomorrows proposal could add to their discontent when mr abes cabinet is expected to approve its annual blueprint for economic policy early drafts released by the prime ministers council for economic and fiscal policy already have triggered criticism economists say mr abe isnt pursuing with sufficient vigor the small government policies of his predecessor junichiro koizumi or making sufficient moves to deal with a declining aging population richard jerram an economist at macquarie securities describes mr abes economic policy as "notable by its absence " the lack of new initiatives are clearly hurting mr abe his approval ratings fell to in a poll taken in early june from last year and next month his liberal democratic party faces parliamentary elections the ldp is expected to lose seats and a severe defeat could even force him to resign the economic council is significant because under mr koizumi it became a major tool of policy leadership before mr koizumi became prime minister in policy making in japan had largely consisted of dividing up the national budget between ministries but mr koizumi used the economic council formed shortly before he took office to exert unprecedented leadership in japan at first the economy was in a slump and the nations banks were swamped with bad loans each year under mr koizumi the council came out with an annual directive oddly nicknamed the "large boned policy " these featured bold goals such as clearing up banks bad loans reducing public spending and privatizing the post office which for years channeled household savings into public spending projects the draft of mr abes first annual directive released last week was criticized for vagueness and lack of focus mr abe is pledging to reduce public spending but unlike what mr koizumi often provided he has no numerical target the submitted proposal was twice as long as some of mr koizumis and was criticized for meandering over too many different areas critics also said it was couched in bureaucratic language to avoid commitments for example mr abes draft policy touched on japans aviation sector which is known for high ticket prices partly due to government control of airports that minimizes competition in the u s and europe rivalry has increased through "open skies" accords which deregulate routes and flight frequency the policy said japan would pursue such agreements in asia but didnt mention timing or with which nations the problem says heizo takenaka the main architect of mr koizumis economic policies is that under mr abe bureaucrats are slowly taking back the initiative for policy making from the prime ministers office "what is needed now is strategic agenda setting " he says the lack of new measures has discouraged investors foreigners poured money into japanese stocks during mr koizumis era because of his bold steps to deregulate and invigorate the economy this raised the prospect of better corporate performance in industries such as banking and real estate during the six months after parliament passed mr koizumis bills to privatize the post office in october for example the nikkei stock average soared but so far this year foreign investors interest in japan has been subdued and the nikkei has risen just that underperforms all other major indexes including the dow jones industrial average which is up ryutaro kono economist at bnp paribas securities says "market participants have been left in the dark about what the government intends to do " instead of focusing on the economy mr abe has thrown himself into statesmanship like mending relations with china which were damaged under mr koizumi in may parliament approved a plan to bring about changes in japans u s imposed constitution a pet project of mr abes currently the constitution forbids japan from military action not directly related to self defense in the future japan might be able to assist the u s with military action while most japanese think these are sensible moves they care more about their economic well being polls show they are worried about the long term future now that the number of working age japanese is falling meaning there will be fewer people to support the national pension system japanese news programs recently have focused on the loss of million pension records by the governments social security agency though this wasnt directly the fault of mr abes administration and the records will likely eventually be found the debacle reminded voters of challenges ahead an opinion survey taken in early june reported that of respondents wanted the government to focus on pensions on education and on the economy just thought the constitution was important mr abes policy focus is "completely away from peoples life " says susumu sato years old a pensioner who used to work for a bank "there are many people who are living a tough life but instead of facing those people he is talking about the constitution and other things " his first big electoral test comes july when half the seats of japans upper house are contested his ldp and coalition partner the new komei party together have of the seats if they lose their majority mr abe will find it harder to pass legislation a big loss would spark calls for him to resign and plunge japan into uncertainty miho inada contributed to this article
