ills deepen in subprime bond arena more downgrades seen as foreclosures ripple a few weeks ago the market for bonds backed by risky home loans looked like it was calming down now problems are quickly mounting at bear stearns cos a group of hedge fund managers at the wall street firm spent the weekend scrambling to line up new investors or lenders to keep afloat their fund called high grade structured credit strategies enhanced leverage fund the fund which invests in many securities that are backed by subprime mortgages suffered heavy losses in recent months on friday credit rating firm moodys investors service slashed ratings on bonds backed by pools of speculative subprime loans because of unusually high rates of defaults and delinquencies among the underlying mortgages the ratings company also said it is reviewing bonds for downgrades including whose ratings it had just lowered all the bonds were issued as recently as last year the latest moves by moodys affected around &# billion worth of bonds which represent less than of the over &# billion in subprime mortgage backed bonds that were issued in still it was the most aggressive action taken yet by any of the ratings companies which some critics say have been slow to address the housing downturn and could weigh on the already fragile subprime bond market some investors may be forced to sell bonds whose ratings were cut to "junk" from "investment grade " and some may have to write down the values of the downgraded bonds in their portfolios in recent months market prices of subprime bonds have seen wide swings as investors fear many securities could default as mortgage losses rise subprime mortgages cater to investors with shaky credit records or a constrained ability to repay loans for bear the trouble at one of its in house hedge funds which had played heavily in the market for subprime loans worsened significantly late last week on friday afternoon amid investor demands to get their cash back and concerns that the fund wouldnt be able to make margin calls or requests from creditors for additional cash or collateral lender merrill lynch &amp co announced plans to seize &# million in collateral from the fund over the weekend managers of the fund which has &# million in invested capital and has borrowed additional sums of more than &# billion searched for new investors and lenders to avoid the prospect of liquidation says a person with knowledge of the matter the bear team led by veteran mortgage bond salesman ralph cioffi asked creditors for another hours to firm up the new investments this person said giving them until early tomorrow late yesterday it appeared they had already put some of the funding in place "the wave of downgrades will continue" among subprime bonds issued in says jay guo director of asset backed research at credit suisse in new york the moodys downgrades are so far concentrated among bonds backed by "second lien" loans which are taken out on homes that have already been pledged as collateral on another mortgage second lien lenders stand at the back of the line when borrowers default it is highly unlikely the loans will recover any money the housing market continues to deteriorate and many economists see little hope that it will start to recover before home prices are falling in much of the country particularly in parts of california arizona nevada and florida lower home prices will lead to more and costlier foreclosures meanwhile lenders are tightening their lending policies which will make it difficult if not impossible for some people to refinance loans when their interest rates reset to higher levels that would lead to more foreclosures moodys said second lien mortgage loans that were bundled into bonds in "are defaulting at a rate materially higher than original expectations " it said such loans were originated when underwriting standards were very aggressive and have deteriorated significantly as the pace of home price appreciation has slowed that is what is causing most of the bond downgrades on friday an index that tracks risky subprime bonds plunged to an all time low of the abx index was above at the start of this year in february it dove to a low of before rebounding somewhat to by mid may "negative sentiment took a firm hold of the subprime bond market" this past week j p morgan analysts said in a report friday "we think the weakness in the abx will continue " the analysts also noted that the recent steep rise in yields on year treasury bonds which in turn pushes up long term mortgage rates would make it difficult for subprime borrowers to refinance into fixed rate loans data from the mortgage bankers association last week showed a record number of homeowners entered the foreclosure process during the first quarter delinquency rates on subprime loans have soared to from and the associations chief economist doug duncan said delinquencies will peak only later this year while foreclosures may not peak until next year investor apprehension in the mortgage bond market could pose serious challenges for the pair of credit hedge funds managed by bear stearns on thursday enhanced leverage fund and a sister fund auctioned off nearly &# billion of their best assets which comprised higher rated bonds backed by subprime home loans the auction went well but it didnt placate all their lenders so the funds sold an additional &# billion on friday even so merrill lynch announced plans to auction off its seizure of the &# million of the funds less liquid assets which comprise mainly securities of collateralized debt obligations merrills move could trigger the dissolution of enhanced leverage fund especially if other lenders also decide to seize assets analysts say the securities merrill and the bear funds are trying to sell arent easily traded by investors as such they may draw bids that are significantly lower than what their sellers are hoping for the asset sales this week will be closely watched by wall street especially by other hedge funds that hold similar bonds the prices at which bear sells its hedge fund assets could impact how other investors price their own holdings it isnt clear if any of the bonds that moodys downgraded on friday are associated with securities that the bear funds are selling so far more than bonds backed by second lien subprime loans or around of such bonds that moodys rated last year have had their ratings downgraded around &# billion in securities backed by second lien loans were created by wall street last year less than of the &# billion in securities backed by subprime loans that were issued according to data from inside mortgage finance an industry newsletter most subprime bonds are backed by first lien mortgages which take a longer time to realize losses because their borrowers have to go through the foreclosure process which could take months or years just of bonds from that are backed by first lien subprime mortgages have been downgraded or are being reviewed by moodys for downgrades james r hagerty contributed to this article
