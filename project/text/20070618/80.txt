proof of citizenship should be required in order to vote john funds june editorial page commentary "vote fraud demagogues" misses a crucial point about the deficiencies of requiring id as distinct from proof of citizenship ids will prevent most fraud by impersonation but leave noncitizen voting unaffected the usual suspects on the left deflect the argument from citizenship to simple id and will fight any id requirement because when they yield "in the interests of bipartisanship" the id fight will be over and they will have won a drivers license will get one into the voting booth and the u s will be the loser permitting noncitizens to vote dilutes the votes of citizens and is indirect disenfranchisement and a violation of the th amendment those opposed to requiring proof of citizenship in order to vote engage in special pleading they assert a presumption that minorities would be disproportionately affected which raises the suspicion that it is noncitizen minorities who wrongfully vote who would be excluded such voting by noncitizens has not been properly investigated absence of evidence is not proof that it not happening "motor voter" registration methods can be are used to register non citizens when they apply for a drivers license those with limited english proficiency might be misled deliberately into signing an affidavit of citizenship by signing such an affidavit noncitizens commit felony perjury drivers licenses are unsuitable for voter id because they are designed as proof of identity not citizenship indeed a texas drivers license will be issued based upon a foreign passport as proof of identity we need a system of registration in advance of the voting period that requires proof of citizenship can that be so onerous as to be disregarded hardship in complying with a requirement to prove citizenship will be rare because most citizens already have the necessary documents the courts can adjudicate true hardship cases anthony j adolph austin texas mr funds effort to resuscitate now discredited arguments for voter id relies on assertions unproven accusations and innuendo more misleading than those he ascribes to its critics for example neither the u s supreme court nor georgias high court endorsed voter ids both courts ruled on technical grounds also there is no way that voter id can prevent voting machine tampering or illegal voting by people with disqualifying felony convictions plus there is no evidence of widespread fraudulent voting by non citizens people with felony convictions or any other ineligible voters weve had enough overblown rhetoric on this issue what we need is a sober look at the facts those facts show that millions of americans dont have the kinds of id mr fund supports for voting and that voter id does not prevent the kinds of fraud that actually do threaten our elections lets focus on real solutions to real problems instead wendy weiser deputy director democracy program brennan center for justice at nyu school of law new york
