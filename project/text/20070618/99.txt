the coming credit meltdown the subprime mortgage world has been reduced to rubble with no lasting impact on another larger credit market dancing on an equally fragile precipice high yield corporate debt in this fast growing arena of loans to business these days mostly private equity deals lending proceeds as if the subprime debacle were some minor skirmish in a little known far away land how curious that so many in the financial community should remain blissfully oblivious to live grenades scattered around the high yield playing field amid all the asset bubbles that weve seen in recent years emerging markets in internet and telecoms stocks in perhaps emerging markets or commercial real estate again today the current inflated pricing of high yield loans will eventually earn quite an imposing tombstone in the graveyard of other great past manias in recent months lower credit bonds conventionally defined as bb+ and below have traded at a smaller risk premium as compared to u s treasuries than ever before in history over the past years this margin averaged percentage points shortly before the asian crisis in the spread was hovering just above percentage points earlier this month it touched down at a record percentage points thats less than money for high risk borrowers so robust has the mood become that providers of loans now rush to offer "repricing" at ever lower rates terrified that borrowers will turn to others to refinance their loans leaving the original lenders with cash on which they will earn even less interest between jan and april &# billion of debt was repriced representing of all bank loans in the u s the low spreads have been accompanied by less tangible indicia of imprudent lending practices the easing of loan conditions "covenants " as they are known in industry parlance options for borrowers to pay interest in more paper instead of cash financings to deliver large dividends to shareholders generally private equity firms and perhaps most importantly a general deterioration in the credit quality of borrowers in a record of new high yield lending was to particularly credit challenged borrowers those with at least one rating starting with a "c " so far this year that figure is at no exaggeration is required to pronounce unequivocally that money is available today in quantities at prices and on terms never before seen in the plus years since u s financial markets reached full flower led by private equity borrowers have rushed to avail themselves of seemingly unlimited cheap credit from a then record &# billion in new leveraged loans reached &# billion last year and are pacing toward another quantum leap in even leading buyers of loans such as larry fink chief executive of blackrock say "were seeing the same thing in the credit markets" that set the stage for the fall of the subprime loan market why should so many theoretically sophisticated lenders be willing to bet so heavily in a casino with particularly poor odds strong economies around the world have pushed default rates to an all time low which has in turn lulled lenders into believing these loans are safer than they really are just of high yield bonds defaulted last year the lowest in modern times and with only three defaults so far this year weve luxuriated in the first default free months since by comparison high yield default rates have averaged since higher still for paper further down the totem pole like past bubbles the current ahistorical performance of high yield markets has led seers and prognosticators to proclaim yet another new paradigm one in which to their thinking the likelihood of bankruptcy has diminished so much that lenders need not demand the same added yield over the treasury or "risk free" rate that they did in the past to be sure the emergence in the past years of more thoughtful policy making may well have sanded the edges off of economic performance what some economists call "the great moderation" thereby reducing the volatility of financial markets and consequently the amount of extra interest that investors need to justify moving away from treasuries but to think that corporate recessions and the attendant collateral damage of bankruptcies among overextended companies have been outlawed would be as foolhardy as believing that mortgages should be issued to home buyers with no down payments and no verification of financial status and just as the unwinding of the subprime market occurred at a time of economic prosperity the high yield market could readily unravel before the next recession with the balance sheets of many leveraged buyouts strung taut a mild breeze could topple a few causing the value of many leveraged loans to tumble as shaken lenders reconsider their folly the surge in junk loans has also been fueled by a worldwide glut of liquidity that has descended more forcefully on lending than on equity investing curiously investors seem quite content these days to receive de minimis compensation for financing edgy companies while simultaneously fearing equity markets the price to earnings ratio for the s&amp p index is currently hovering right around its year average of leagues below the times it reached at the height of the last great equity bubble in some portion of this phenomenon seems to reflect tastes in asia and elsewhere where much of the excess liquidity resides foreign investors own only about of u s equities but of treasury debt in search of higher yields these investors are moving into corporate and sovereign debt today the debt of countries like colombia trades at less than two percentage points above u s treasuries compared to percentage points five years ago perhaps the mispricing of high yield debt has been exacerbated by the surge in derivatives a generally useful lubricant of the financial markets banks hold far fewer loans these days mostly they resell them often to hedge funds which frequently layer on still more leverage thereby exacerbating the risks another popular destination is in new classes of securities where the loans have been resliced to theoretically tailor the risk to specific investor tastes but in the case of subprime mortgages this securitization process went awry as buyers and rating agencies alike misunderstood the nature of the gamble inherent in certain instruments assessing the likely consequences of a correction is more daunting than merely predicting its inevitability the array of lenders with wounds to lick is likely to be far broader than we might imagine a result of how widely our increasingly efficient capital markets have spread these loans no one should be surprised to find his wallet lightened whether out of retirement savings an investment pool or even the earnings on their insurance policy the bigger and harder question is whether the correction will trigger the economic equivalent of a multi car crash in which the initial losses incur large enough damages to sufficiently slow spending enough to bring on recession much like what happened during the telecom meltdown a half dozen years ago but we have little choice but to sit back and watch this car accident happen it would have been a mistake to dispatch the federal reserve to deflate the dot com mania or the housing bubble and it would be a mistake now for the fed to rescue imprudent high yield lenders they have to learn the hard way hopefully not too many innocent bystanders will share their pain mr rattner is managing principal of the private investment firm quadrangle group llc see related
