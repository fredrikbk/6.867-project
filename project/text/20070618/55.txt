latest indiana jones film digs up more products when harrison ford returns as indiana jones next year he will have more accessories than just a rumpled fedora and leather whip for the first time the action adventure archaeologist will carry a plethora of products from lego sets to special packages of m&amp ms when the first three movies in the "indiana jones" series were released in the s licensing was limited to some t shirts a few posters and an abbreviated line of action figures which failed to sell in notable numbers but the fourth installment will include an extensive licensing program according to lucas licensing a division of lucasfilm ltd owner of the indiana jones franchise the company known for its "star wars" movies is well versed in licensing in merchandise marketed through lucas licensing racked up &# billion in retail sales according to license magazine without the need to build brand awareness executives hope to capitalize on the familiarity of "indiana jones" across generations "were selling to both parents and children " says howard roffman president of lucas licensing both "star wars" and "indiana jones" launched with a trio of films and waited more than years before attempting a comeback but the franchises licensing track records couldnt be more different the success of "star wars" has earned it an epic place in the licensing books it was the top toy license in the first half of last year beating out walt disney co s princess line according to npd group a market research firm based in port washington n y "indiana jones" is another story although the original movie trilogy was wildly successful together the three movies grossed more than &# billion at the box office sales of the limited merchandise licensed by the studio didnt sell well especially compared with "star wars " "we werent getting the same response " says mr roffman as a result the company stepped back from its "indiana jones" licensing efforts and shied away from revisiting the brand in recent years the company has released a smattering of souvenirs tied to "indiana jones" attractions at disney parks but nothing for the mass market "theres no indiana jones stuff in the stores " says jim makowski owner of action toys an online and catalog collectible toys retailer who says demand for the original action figures remains strong he sells a handful of them on his web site priced anywhere from &# to more than &# and says nostalgic adults and their children who have watched the movies on dvd come looking for indiana jones toys when the movies first came out the studio had to focus on getting the audience interested in the brand which didnt create the immediate inherent frenzy that accompanied "star wars " this time around lucas licensing is banking on interest from both parents and children and has put together a lineup ranging from action figures for children to high end merchandise such as resin sculptures for adult collectors but lucas licensing cant fall back on the "star wars" cult like obsession with "indiana jones " "we dont have quite that same degree of fanaticism " says mr roffman he contends that indiana jones has wider appeal luring in action adventure fans who might be turned off by science fiction and then there is the hype of the movie itself which will again star mr ford alongside newcomers cate blanchett and shia labeouf to bring back adult fans and attract a new generation still products will be available several weeks before the film even hits screens a recognized brand such as "indiana jones" easily draws licensees the companies that manufacture the licensed products even selective sectors such as food and drink want to be part of a new push for a storied brand "we usually look at franchises that are brands in themselves " says ryan bowling a public relations manager for mars snackfood u s a division of mars inc that makes m&amp ms which will also be part of the promotion in recent years mars has made deals with other movie series including "pirates of the caribbean" and "shrek " mr bowling says the company has big plans for "indiana jones " mirroring the blitz of "star wars" with special packaging in store displays and advertising campaigns as part of its agreement with lucas licensing burger king holdings inc is slated to promote "indiana jones" as well toy companies too readily produce products for well known properties because often that merchandise can stand on its own independent of the movie when lego took on "star wars" in it was the companys first licensed product says michael mcnally brand relations director for lego systems inc the u s unit of lego group of billund denmark it sold so well even in years when a movie wasnt released that the company has renewed its licensing agreement with lucas through lego jumped at the chance to be a part of "indiana jones " and plans to release two product lines next year one series commemorating the original films and another promoting the new film "we view indiana jones the way we see star wars " says mr mcnally "with or without a movie the lucas properties drive people into the toy aisle "
