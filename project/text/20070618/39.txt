detroit confronts surplus of showrooms legacy of dominance led to overdealering less is more for toyota north hollywood calif detroits big three will try to address their biggest competitive problem when they open contract talks with the united auto workers this summer but as that drama nears they are also starting to move more aggressively to tackle a second potentially costly albatross stemming from the days when detroit dominated the u s market a surfeit of dealers ford motor co is aiming this year to trim about dealers from its u s retail network of and a similar number annually over the next several years a company official said at the same time the future owner of chrysler group cerberus capital management lp has begun meeting with dealers and exploring ways of reducing their numbers people familiar with the matter said the company has dealers and wants to eventually cut that to about in part by combining dodge chrysler and jeep locations into three brand "alpha" dealers a company spokesman said general motors corp which now has a total of dealers for its eight brands has been slowly reducing its dealer count over the past several years mainly by urging separate buick pontiac and gmc dealers to combine operations under one roof at the end of last year it had dealers down from in by contrast toyota motor corp has about dealers in boston memphis miami los angeles and other big markets where import brands sell well the detroit brands typically limp along with a few strong dealers and many others that are losing money and cant afford to advertise enough hire and keep top sales people or spend money to give their showrooms the comforts and modern look found in stores selling foreign name vehicles michael jackson chief executive of the dealership chain autonation inc estimates that what he calls a "lack of retail muscle" lowers detroits sales to individual customers by or more "they have no idea what level of business they are leaving on the table " mr jackson said but auto makers cant simply force dealers to close for not selling enough cars thanks to state franchise laws written to protect local businesses buying out dealerships is expensive too even small stores are often valued at &# million or more back when three of every four cars sold in america were made in detroit it made sense for ford gm and chrysler to have a dealer on practically every corner but after years of ceding market share to foreign nameplates all three now have more showrooms than they need while some ford gm and chrysler dealers have continued to grow and prosper many others often small single location or family owned dealerships have seen their new car sales dwindle the problem called overdealering in the industry plays out each month along a
