the daily fix a chain smoking journeyman holds off woods furyk at open online edition weekend golfers who hit the ball hard and skip the psychobabble maybe the u s opens for you the winner at oakmont was year old angel cabrera nicknamed "the duck" and described by espn coms bob harig as "a big hitting chain smoking journeyman pro " now hes described by the history books as the man who wound up holding a trophy after finishing a stroke ahead of tiger woods and jim furyk he won the fix over for keeps when he said "there are some players who have psychologists sportologists i smoke " mr harig notes that mr cabrera hit just four fairways saturday five yesterday and over the opens four days but thats not meant to be an insult as he notes long hitters michael campbell and geoff ogilvy won the last two years "it was ogilvy who pointed out earlier this year that being a straight driver is overrated at the u s open these days because the fairways are so narrow that everyone is going to find the rough " mr harig writes "the point its better to be long and crooked than short and crooked the formula for winning the open it seems is changing right before our very eyes cabrera is just the latest example " in the washington post thomas boswell ponders woodss latest near miss mr boswell notes that woods is " for in majors when he has at least part of the third round lead but is for when he has had to come from behind " woods has major championship wins to jack nicklauss but has only finished second twice compared with also rans for the golden bear "now the law of averages or perhaps just the nature of golf itself might be gaining a bit of ground on woods " mr boswell writes "not much mind you but perhaps enough that tigers pursuit of the bear will become riveting rather than a mere ritual the baltimore orioles have lost eight in a row and of prompting the vultures to tighten their circles around skipper sam perlozzo and clubhouse leader kevin millar to schedule a players only meeting "finally the players are taking responsibility " writes david steele in the baltimore sun "theyre taking ownership theyre taking some of the heat off the manager and putting it where it belongs if this happens a month earlier there is no fertile ground in which the speculation about perlozzos job could have grown " fix update mr perlozzo has been fired up the east coast willie randolph can gaze at vulture free skies even though his new york mets have dropped of it helps that theyre still in first place thanks to a sputtering june from the atlanta braves met fans looking for comfort will find it in a marvelous portrait by sports illustrateds gary smith of gm omar minaya "o " to his many friends "it was the perfect name for the major leagues first hispanic general manager the perfect letter " mr smith writes "round an opening a circle that invited outsiders in and made them feel there was room for them it was much of the reason that pedro martinez had left a world championship team and an adoring public in boston to join the new york mets why other stars had soon followed why moises alou had virtually begged to be included this year it was why his team looked like the melange of cultures inside that number train beyond rightfield and the soundtrack at shea stadium pulsed like a festival of music from all their native lands but then everyone was born an o with a lifetime of chances and choices that widened or shrank it this is the story of o " few baseball players infuriate the fix more than miguel cabrera of the florida marlins a young slugger with prodigious talents who too often plays with deplorable sloth and indifference mr cabreras stats are eye popping but so is his ever expanding girth as the miami heralds israel gutierrez writes "with the marlins hoping for their annual midseason surge to finally hit cabrera remains the most compelling story line on the team both for his production and portliness " he writes adding that "the popular opinion is that the extra weight means nothing people say that other than a few inches on his range at third base cabrera has lost nothing by adding the poundage and that anyone critical of him is just nitpicking but is it really a crime to ask more from even the greatest of athletes is it really ok to feel like the best player on your team is settling just because he happens to naturally settle among the top five players in the game " the san francisco giants barry bonds hit his th home run yesterday in a losing cause against the boston red sox leaving him eight dingers away from breaking hank aarons record which leads us to a bit of fix business a while back we passed along a question for fix readers from our print colleague jonathan eig who has tickets for the san francisco giants july game at wrigley field against the chicago cubs what would you do if barry bonds was sitting on or and you had tickets go to the game sell the tickets throw them away here are our finalists slightly edited as always for the best suggestions well announce the winner tomorrow the prize a signed copy of jonathans new book "opening day the story of jackie robinsons first season " best suggestion from a reader lacking integrity go to the game whenever barry comes to the plate head for the concession stand or the restroom if he ties the record or breaks it go home or send me the tickets i used to work in "managed care" and lost whatever integrity i once had bruce libby best self serving suggestion the easy answer is to send the tickets to me dan shelly best malicious suggestion id take the tickets put one on each horn of a billy goat march the billy goat right up to that fraud and deposit them with prejudice on his backside mark hesse withbroe best suggestion involving the hall of fame i would mount the tickets on a plaque noting in a paragraph below why i didnt attend the game id send the plaque to the hall of fame so cooperstown could post it in the spot that would have been filled by memorabilia that the selfless mr bonds intends to keep for himself chris bergman best suggestion from a former floyd landis fan id put in my seats cardboard cut outs of any of the most popular tour de france cyclists banned for doping and leave the stadium for a nearby watering hole to watch anything but the giants and bonds porter clapp best suggestion from a dreamer suck it up and cheer for the guy its an important stat and maybe thats what this fellow has been dying to do since he was a child if he goes down in record books for this feat good for him maybe thatll change his outlook and encourage him to put a better face to the world donna k goodwin best suggestion from a dreamer part ii actually i hope he does hit it at wrigley and the bleachers are empty it would be great to see the video footage of one person scrambling around the empty bleachers to find no and then partaking in that great wrigley tradition of throwing the opponents homers back onto the field no fights in the stands no lawsuits no ebay auctions just the immortal image of the historic ball lying in the outfield with empty stands behind it rick viets best suggestion that almost changed my mind what would i do with my tickets id use them and if i had two id bring my five year old son and explain the whole story to him in terms he could understand the polarizing controversy alone makes the event history baseball fans mark their lives with such moments frank luby best market based suggestion id sell them on a conditional price basis that is id try to take bids on the tickets as if we knew the game was the one at which he broke or maybe tied the record if he does hit the dinger that day thats the price if he doesnt then the price is face value of the ticket of course the higher price amount would be taken in escrow upfront the logic is that if the ticket isnt going to be the grand keepsake anticipatory buyers remorse is eliminated giving room for a more accurate bid for the true fair market value of the hopefully more valuable ticket for the historic game boyd j brown best suggestion from a pragmatist would i go yes without equivocation is bonds a monumental jerk yes a cheat probably but say what you will about bonds hes a phenomenal baseball player that he would have been regarded as great without the drugs is his personal tragedy but he will break the record and all things considered id rather see the record set with an asterisk than miss the whole experience at the end of the day baseball is bigger than bonds bigger than steroids the game will endure beyond the steroid era as it has endured so many other scandals in its history scott daunheimer best suggestion that almost changed my mind part ii april th row aisle seat bottom of the th at the age of i didnt know about the letters the threats or that any animosity would be directed at my hero all i knew was that one of the greatest records in the universe they call sports was about to be broken at the game they gave away a x slip of paper that documented the moment this paper has endured four high school billboards a fraternity house a fifth floor walk up in the west village and is now in my home with me my wife year old son and two daughters in atlanta thirty three years later the memory is as clear as day and i was one of the chosen because my dad thought it would be nice you forget about the christmas presents and things that you have to have that day but the best gift a person can give their child is a memory i would fly drive swim or bike anywhere to give my year old a chance to have a memory like this alex van winkle best suggestion from an opportunist id carry another ball in my pocket and throw that ball back onto the field im a baseball purist but not an idiot catching that ball would be like winning the lottery heath dixon note from jonathan "i should have mentioned that my seats are in foul territory no chance of catching the home run ball " best suggestion from a true fan i love the game of baseball so much id never not go to a game i had tickets for i still know of no greater disappointment than being told the game is rained out however if i were present for the homer i would sit silently in my seat i do not respect bonds as a person or a baseball player no booing no catcalls no standing ovation just dead silence tony nicolo
