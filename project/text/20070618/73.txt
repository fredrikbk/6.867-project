politics &amp economics eu tries to clear constitution hurdle accord at summit would shift focus to russia expansion the european union hopes to bury its dispute over adoption of a constitution at a summit this week and free a set of new national leaders to tackle more substantive challenges from expansion of the bloc to forming a foreign policy toward an increasingly assertive russia disputes over the draft constitution in the two years since it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands have paralyzed eu debate on a host of economic and political goals german and other officials said the desire to get the constitution off the table and to move onto more substantive issues is so strong that a deal is close on a watered down version of the document overcoming objections from poland in particular will be a big hurdle when leaders of the eu countries meet thursday in brussels for a two day summit warsaw wants proposed changes to the eus internal voting system diluted so that poland keeps a bigger say in eu decisions relative to germany and other larger countries german chancellor angela merkel who as the president of the eu will lead the summit met polish and czech leaders over the weekend in a so far unsuccessful attempt to drop their objections to reach a deal on the constitution german officials said it will be necessary to call it a treaty and eliminate other attributes of statehood such as an eu anthem and flag a charter of human and social rights also may be ditched plans to have an eu foreign minister will have to be reworked but multiple foreign affairs bureaucracies and budgets would be consolidated under a single person a feature of the current document the eu also probably would get a new president for terms running as long as five years replacing the current system of six month rotating national presidencies "citizens expect us politicians to be preoccupied with their problems and not with ourselves " ms merkel told germanys parliament last week if germany gets a deal lower level officials would hammer out details and aim to have the treaty come into force in but the constitution may have to be watered down further than ms merkel suggested in a memo she circulated late last week as a basis for the summit talks the memo doesnt mention the eu voting system polish president lech kaczynski said after a four hour meeting with ms merkel on saturday that he hadnt changed his position although he shared a "conviction" a deal should be reached at the summit failure to agree on the draft constitution has made it hard to talk about the eus expansion particularly to include turkey the debate also has made it harder to develop a unified foreign policy toward russia and to forge greater cooperation on law enforcement "in all three areas nothing will happen until this totemic issue is off the table " said jan techau head of european studies at the german council on foreign relations officials also hope that ending the constitutional debate could make it easier to reach agreement on some of the eus biggest challenges at a time when the political atmosphere is improving "the political wind is better than in the past " said hugo brady a specialist on the constitution at the centre for european reform in london "the eu economy is doing better " and the generation of leaders that split over the u s decision to invade iraq in will have gone once britains prime minister tony blair leaves office next month mr brady said with three new leaders heading the eus largest countries ms merkel in germany nicolas sarkozy in france and gordon brown taking over in britain next week the hope is that real business could be on the table once the constitution is out of the way topping this agenda are the development of policies on energy security and climate change as well as retooling the eus budget and legislation to promote economic growth particularly in the high tech and services sectors eighteen eu nations approved the original draft constitution while nine havent germany which holds the eu presidency until next month is walking a tightrope to produce a document that governments can sell to their populations without appearing to have caved the united kingdom wants to reduce the number of new areas in which the treaty would allow decisions to be made by majority vote rather than by unanimous consent the most important of those areas is in law enforcement where the u k is protective in part due to its common law tradition which most other eu countries dont share london also is concerned that plans to give the eu an international legal personality allowing eu representation on global bodies could lead to the u k losing its permanent seat on the united nations security council france which also holds a permanent security council seat also is likely to share such concerns the dutch government wants eu membership criteria included in the treaty but other members worry this would put the decision on whether to admit new members into the hands of courts rather than governments the hardest problem to resolve german officials said is polands demand for greater say in decision making under current plans eu votes would be weighted by population giving germany twice as much clout as poland the two nations now have almost equal voting clout poland wants a formula that would effectively split the difference but it is supported only by the czech republic the eu has largely developed through compromises between countries that want to integrate the bloc more extensively and those that want to bring in more members rejection in of the draft constitution has made such compromises tough to reach french opposition to turkeys bid to join the eu has increased since france rejected the constitution helping to stall progress on those negotiations debate over whether to offer the carrot of membership to countries like ukraine has halted altogether leaving these countries hopes of western integration in limbo the constitutions defeat also prompted the dilution of economic legislation aimed at creating a single eu market in services
