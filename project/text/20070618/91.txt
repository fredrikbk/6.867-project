technology a special report lets get together as companies struggle with proliferating forms of communication tech firms are pitching a solution every few years technology makers seem all at once to hit on a panacea for problems they think businesses have in the early s it was "client server" computing a model of using cheaper computers to bypass the big expensive mainframe computers the corporate world had relied on for decades after businesses struggled through that shift tech companies gushed that "network computing" a setup that linked bare bones computers to server computers housing shared files would ease the pain of managing so many pcs spread by client server computing it didnt now say hello to "unified communications " being pitched to businesses grappling with a proliferation of communications tools the idea is to create a way to link and manage email phone calls instant messages videoconferences and other forms of communication which at most companies exist as silos separate from each other by merging them the thinking goes a person could communicate more quickly and easily and by extension work faster in its simple form unification might allow a user to click on a phone number in an email to place a call from a pc in its more advanced form the technology might offer the ability to use a pc to determine if a person is online on a cellphone or at a desk phone and to call them or launch a videoconference by clicking on an icon among the many companies sounding the clarion call of unified communications are tech giants microsoft corp cisco systems inc and international business machines corp but the push goes beyond the usual players to include telecommunications carriers equipment makers and services companies many of them describe the promise of unified communications in dramatic terms of "breaking down silos" and revolutionizing businesses but buyer beware as with most technology trends there is a vast gap between vision and reality the telecommunications and information technology industries the two critical areas of unified communications havent always worked well together any company that embraces unified communications will have to handle a strange brew of technologies partners and in house training that didnt exist when a phone was just a phone and a pc a pc while many firms are holding off some are wading in early adopters of unified communications and some vendors of the technology say there are a few things a company should consider before taking the plunge does it fit your business because of the complexity of marrying things such as phone calls and email this is an important question to ask before embracing unified communications some businesses might see immediate benefits others none at all workers whose main duties involve connecting with others a product support person seeking information from a product specialist to help a caller for example have the most to gain the technology is less suited for businesses or divisions with workers who dont have to interact with a host of other people smaller companies or groups where workers mainly interact among themselves also might see little gain says chris thompson senior director at san jose calif based cisco marshfield clinic which runs medical facilities in wisconsin is testing a cisco system that allows workers to manage their phone calls from pcs while it has "huge potential" for support staff says joe brickweg director of infrastructure its still unclear if doctors would benefit from the system "were going to have to figure that out " he says early adopters of the technology include companies that are geographically dispersed or in businesses that depend on rapid communication to compete such as financial institutions "we have people in india we have people in singapore were now opening in poland and were in all the financial centers " says tom sanzone chief information officer at credit suisse group explaining the roots of why his bank is starting to roll out a broad communications system that combines videoconferencing instant messaging and email strong governance a unified communications system often cuts across multiple departments making it more complex than many other it projects it demands a manager who can navigate the politics of various groups guide the training of users with diverse backgrounds and deal with multiple vendors each supplying a piece of the technology "make sure you have faith in your it department " says robert arpino chief executive of windrush frozen foods ltd a british foods wholesaler rolling out unified communications software from microsoft "its a very big leap to put money into something when you know youre going to come up against technical problems " unification also can open up regulatory issues email attachments that under law need to be archived for example might include voice mail in the future meaning a company would have to set up a system for archiving voice mail "get good regulatory advice and good legal advice " ciscos mr thompson says dont rush in marrying a mix of technologies and helping employees adapt takes time so a gradual rollout of a unified communications system is best many industry executives say still its important to set a pace that gets the technology into the live work environment starting with an application that isnt critical increases the risk the technology wont be used executives recommend rolling out a unified system in one area say finance or human resources and building from there starting with internal communications is safer because if the system fails or workers dont adjust to it quickly customers wont suffer it executives say mike gotta an analyst at researcher burton group suggests trying unified communications in core areas where results can be measured for example using the technology to speed contact between salespeople meeting with customers and developers building the next product might cut the time it takes to get a new product to market a measurable result he says keep it simple many technology projects fail from lack of use by the very people they are meant to help because workers tend to stick with what they know "if it isnt easier to use than the next best alternative then people wont use it " says ciscos mr thompson executives also recommend starting with a group that can prove the concept test for kinks and spread the word to other workers credit suisse like many companies is first rolling out a unified system to its it group world wide as it expands the system next year the bank will try to build "virtual communities" of workers who are on the same team or work in the same areas those communities will each have a portal site where they can use videoconferencing and other tools to communicate a strategy that the bank thinks will encourage workers to use the system says steve yatko managing director head of it research and development manage your vendors by its nature merging communications means juggling a mix of technology providers that each supply a piece of the system so its critical to manage vendors tightly executives say ciscos mr thompson says that participating in user groups where it customers can band together and assert their common needs is one way to apply pressure to vendors he also recommends "regular nonselling contact" between customers and vendors international sos a singapore health care services company that handles medical emergencies from main offices and suboffices world wide built relationships with key microsoft managers to ensure that it got the attention it needed when it decided to embark on a unified communications project says chief technology officer todd schofield the relationships helped the company avoid being sold more expensive software than it needed he says workers are consumers workers expectations are being shaped by cheap and easy to use technologies popular at home so a look at consumer technology trends can help companies prepare for future communications demands for many youngsters cellphones text messaging and instant messaging have eclipsed email as the preferred ways to communicate internet phone calling services are widely used in homes so office workers of the future likely will expect to manage calls from pcs "does digital life trump digital work " asks burtons mr gotta "at some point " mr guth is a staff reporter in the wall street journals san francisco bureau he can be reached at rob guth wsj com
