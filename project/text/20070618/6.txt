all things digital viacom vs google the battle from both sides google inc s youtube has become the top video sharing site with millions of offbeat user created videos emerging hit series like lonelygirl and untold numbers of illegally posted television and movie clips earlier this year viacom inc the parent of comedy central and mtv sued google accusing the search giant of copyright infringement "on a huge scale" over the vast hoard of viacom clips that users have uploaded to youtube google has countered that it is protected by provisions of the digital millennium copyright act which shields internet companies from liability for copyright infringements by their users if the companies act promptly to remove the clips kara swisher talked with philippe dauman viacoms president and ceo and walt mossberg spoke with google chairman and chief executive eric schmidt about the lawsuit here are edited excerpts of the discussions kara swisher explain the lawsuit to us philippe dauman i didnt want to file a lawsuit we set out about doing deals when i came to the job as ceo nine months ago one of the first calls i got was from eric schmidt and we spent a lot of time talking i thought wed get something done ms swisher what were you talking about mr dauman we were talking about having a licensed agreement to display our content on youtube we have had no problems in the conversations were having with the yahoos of the world microsofts of the world aols of the world this is not depriving the consumer of our content what it is about is to reward the creators of the content not the companies that did not create the content ms swisher what did they want mr dauman control of the content be able to sell advertising in our content having contact with our advertisers revenue sharing the like we were happy to work with them we have a huge amount of content we constituted the great bulk of the professionally produced content on youtube we talked we devoted a lot of resources to try to reach an accommodation i told eric look if we cant reach a deal thats fine i dont mind if you have user generated content up there i wish you every success in the world but if we cant do a deal then please take our content down and there were promises made about having filtering technology in place by the end of last year those deadlines passed ms swisher what about the idea that theyre protected if they take it down when told of these violations mr dauman the dmca digital millennium copyright act was not intended to cover a company that is in the media business that has knowledge of the copyright violation it was intended to cover companies that are involved in the building blocks of the internet routing caching all the rest i go to every media conference and i see these guys google theyre a media company so thats great they can create their own content they can have user generated content ms swisher did you feel they werent taking things down when you informed them or you just didnt want to inform them anymore you felt they knew it and should take it down mr dauman after we couldnt get a deal done we said maybe wed get a deal done someday but please take down our content now forget the law we had separate clips that we have found there the process to request youtube to take down the clips involved our having to scour every day and spend a lot of money looking through everything thats out there youtube is in a position to just look at what comes up its more efficient for them to screen that content for us its like finding a needle in a haystack because they dont make available to us what is newly put up there its very expensive ms swisher how many people did you have working on the take down notices mr dauman dozens dozens and its costing us hundreds of thousands of dollars a month it is not that expensive when youre already screening for pornography or hate speech youre screening for deals you have made with some content owners its a lot easier to do it on that end than to have every content owner have to go through every site to find stuff others are putting in filtering mechanisms nothings perfect i heard that it is very difficult to do ive always said im not looking for perfection lets use whats available ms swisher do you think theyre not making any efforts at all to help you mr dauman the burden was put on us ms swisher and you dont feel it needs to be on you it needs to be on them mr dauman i think theres a responsibility there if you choose a business model that involves using professional content like all the other forms of distribution whether its an aol a comcast or a movie theater you enter into a consensual agreement usually you enter that agreement before you take the content ms swisher their argument is that people keep putting it up mr dauman well its a very imperfect system after we started sending take down notices the week before the lawsuit was filed do you know what was the no clip on youtube it was a south park clip now in the meantime were making our content available everywhere we have today over sites well probably have over a year from now we want to be everywhere wed love to be eventually on youtube ms swisher how far are you going to take this lawsuit do you hope to settle or are you in discussions to settle mr dauman well see where it goes and by the way i dont think this was a big secret to google when google bought youtube it held back some of the purchase price to deal with copyright issues this is not a revelation i think the attitude was "we dont think that anyone is going to challenge us because we are a cool company " and they are a cool company we were spending a lot of our collective management time dealing with this we want to focus on creating more content ms swisher do you need youtube given its so popular and cool as you say mr dauman i think consumers will find great content wherever it is if they want it theyll find it on our sites theyll find it on yahoo theyll find it everywhere consumers will gravitate toward high quality content yes user generated contents great tv shows are great movies are great people want a variety of things were focused on what we do best
