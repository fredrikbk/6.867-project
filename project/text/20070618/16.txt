business solutions wikis at work companies turn the wikipedia concept into a powerful corporate information tool for employees wikipedia the online encyclopedia that anyone can edit has become one of the most visited web sites in the world by offering one place on the ever expanding web to learn about nearly anything now some think the wikipedia approach could serve a similar purpose in the corporate world take aaron hathaway director of information technology at prager sealy &amp co an investment firm in san francisco "so much of adapting to an organization is understanding who knows what and where you go for information " mr hathaway says "the system for collaboration is pretty broken " so mr hathaway turned in february to software from san diego based mindtouch inc for making company wikis web sites that allow any user to add content or make changes to whats already there he used the software to create pages with technical information that anyone in the company can access and edit when people stop by his desk to ask a technical question he directs them to the wiki for the answer people have lately caught on "ive even seen people come to the door and turn around while theyre on the way there " he says mr hathaways firm is among a group of companies that are experimenting with wikis as a way to gather information in one spot in essence importing the wikipedia concept inside the corporate firewall keeping track of information inside a company has been daunting because published information resides in so many disparate places an email here a handwritten note there a document on a pc elsewhere and that doesnt include information that employees collect over time but keep in their heads and take with them when they leave now companies are looking at wikis as a way to keep all that corporate information in one place two years ago an engineer at intel corp posted an idea on his company blog accessible to intel employees wouldnt it be great if we had an internal wikipedia in the comments section of his blog others chimed in many said it sounded like a good idea but thought it would take a long time several months even to push the idea through the intel bureaucracy to get all the necessary approvals josh bancroft an engineer who had set up a wiki on his own read the post and had a different reaction "if we had a place to put it up i could turn it around in a day " he recalls thinking so he did without waiting for official approval at the time he worked in intels internal it department which made it easy for him to corral the storage space and bandwidth to put up the wiki using the open source mediawiki software behind wikipedia company executives now know about the wiki but mr bancroft says none of them have come to him with concerns about it in fact the project got him a new official title at intel social media evangelist the wiki meanwhile has taken off it has been edited about times and has been viewed more than million times "its achieved critical mass " mr bancroft says the front page of the wiki looks a lot like wikipedia with a search box and some links on the left side of the main page but theres an intel logo in the top left corner and all the information is intel specific for instance an "in the news" section that highlights articles about intel or the chip industry people use the wiki for various purposes like collaborating on projects and keeping notes from meetings but the most visited page is a dictionary of acronyms used at intel like ease for "employee access support environment" and por for "plan of record " another popular page is a history of intel with photos and stories from employees another group of people has put together a page about software engineering processes at the company software maker sap ag has a wiki that acts as a base of information for people outside the company such as customers and software developers who build programs that interact with sap software in the past those people asked and sometimes answered questions in an informal way on sap online forums but that was an inefficient system with people asking and answering the same questions over and over "it got to be a little much " says mark yolton vice president of the sap developer network and business process expert communities at sap mr yoltons group put the most relevant questions and answers on a wiki and started encouraging people in the so called sap community employees software developers customers and so on to contribute mr yolton uses software called confluence from atlassian software systems pty ltd of sydney australia there can be difficulties in bringing wikis inside a company though wikipedia has been criticized for its susceptibility to vandalism uneven quality bias and inconsistency according to wikipedias entry on itself those kinds of problems while a nuisance in the consumer world could easily get a company in trouble especially at a time when government regulations closely police the use and dissemination of private information mr bancroft says he offers a simple rule when people ask what they can put on the wiki dont post any information that you wouldnt want every other intel employee to see he says he hasnt gotten a single report of a vandalized or inaccurate entry both because of the ground rules and because the community of users is so small that would be pranksters are deterred "the people who would potentially be doing something like that have an existing relationship with the people who would be affected " he says another potential problem is achieving scale theres a popular concept in the online world called the rule that is on a site that relies on content from its users only of those users actually contribute the content while the other passively consume it wikipedia is accessible to anyone on the web so even though a small fraction of its users write or edit its pages that makes up a massive amount of information thats not the case inside a company marie tahir director of the technology innovation group at intuit inc has tried to get intuit employees outside of her eight person group to contribute to a wiki that keeps track of interesting technologies so far few have so shes dangling a carrot her group was formed just last year and is assigned the task of thinking of and creating innovative technologies that could later make it into products product managers and designers often approach her and ask to spend a few months in the group as a sort of rotation in the past she hasnt had a place for nontechnical types in her group but recently she had an idea invite those people to temporarily join her group and assign them the task of building up the wiki using their writing skills "there was a lot of excitement" when she pitched the idea she says meanwhile at prager which has employees mr hathaway has come up with a similarly creative solution hes convinced the firms managers to have this years summer interns write for the wiki explaining how certain tasks should be accomplished keeping lists of prager clients and defining key financial terms that employees should know he hopes that will increase awareness of how wikis can be used ms vara is a staff reporter in the wall street journals san francisco bureau she can be reached at vauhini vara wsj com
