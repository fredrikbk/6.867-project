all things digital the end of time ann moore on the future of big brands ann moore is chairman and chief executive of time inc a role that has her overseeing about different magazines household names like time and people as well as such smaller titles as coastal living and land rover world like other publishers she has to figure out how to bring in profits online ms moore talked with kara swisher about competing with online gossip sites user generated content and the future of magazines here are edited excerpts from their conversation kara swisher coming from a magazine background what are some of the trends that youre particularly worried about ann moore what i really like was how often i heard that owning content is really going to be valuable thats what we learned this year you can make money on content ms swisher the aol time warner merger was a lot of trouble it caused a lot of setbacks for the company in terms of getting stuff online what happened there from your perspective ms moore when the merger happened i was ready to roll out instyle com and it got cancelled i wanted instyle com to be your personal shopper we merged with aol and aol shut it down so we launched real simple we went back to our corner and continued to launch print for a while ms swisher what happened after steve case co founder of america online and former chairman of the combined aol time warner left ms moore i had at the time done an annual deal with aol because they wanted our premium content most of the womens titles went behind the subscription wall aol paid us a very nice licensing fee and we were waiting for the business formula to show up and that happened last year the entire pot of print advertising dollars was surpassed by the pot of online dollars in mid that happened a full year faster than anybody would have predicted and so we were ready when the online advertising business model showed up that got interesting for us content players the really big breakthrough is that editorial drank the kool aid the editors of time inc really dont fear the web anymore the people who are leading the charge are the writers when you realized that you could write online and you would get thousands of readers responding disagreeing arguing it was really great today a great writer like tom verducci whos our baseball writer at sports illustrated writes something columns for si the magazine but he writes something columns a year for si com and i think they would write every day if we needed them to ms swisher sports illustrated is one of your more successful magazines explain what goes on there ms moore its a thing of beauty to be able to amortize our editorial costs to be able to monetize all the stuff that hits the cutting room floor we go to the super bowl and we shoot pictures we print in the magazine to be able to take all that unused edit and now put it online for the real football fan and monetize it because our advertising for the premium content sites is virtually sold out ms swisher lets talk about the gossip area there are all these gossip sites popping up i read all these sites and i dont read the people magazine site did the old aol hinder you from taking advantage of the growth of online gossip ms moore i was happy for people com to be behind the wall when there was no advertising money ms swisher so should you have gone out there with a free site anyway ms moore why and just lose money no as soon as money showed up we came from behind the curtain and took control of people i know the smaller gossip sites think theyre big and powerful but get out of the way the people editors have arrived people is no in the celebrity field with million unique visitors the stickiness of people is unparalleled ms swisher what do you mean by that ms moore seventy one page views per visit its million page views a month thats a lot of content to sell right now you dont see that on any other celebrity site it taught me that the biggest brands really do have power online we get the news that angelina jolie and brad pitt are first pregnant that hit a one day record of million page views the day after the oscars people com had million page views thats a huge amount of traffic this will be trust me a profitable business nothing comes close to this we know how to sell advertising we sell close to &# billion in print ms swisher what do you think of these upstarts how do your editors look at them ms moore theyre not hurting us in any way i dont ever fear cannibalization i was at sports illustrated in the early s remember roone arledge you forget this but in the s at most you could get one sports team one game on television a week it was really roone arledge that exploded sports in america we thought will this have a negative impact on sports illustrated roones got sports hours a day and the weekends what happened was that turned out to be the renaissance of sports illustrated we found that the first story youd turn to even though youd seen the game was the story that we wrote about the game it actually increased demand you dont want to be the only player in a genre in a field you dont want to be alone in the marketplace ms swisher talk about the financial magazines you have fortune you have several other magazines the print pages of all these magazines have been going down why is that happening and how do you replace that ms moore people are still reading magazines the instability in my business is not due to the consumer side about of all adults still subscribe time spent reading has been actually very stable in spite of the fact that we all spend about hours consuming media the instability has come from the print advertising dollars particularly those dollars targeting men and the dual audience and i have a lot of those magazines in our portfolio the business books have been hit hard because detroit and tech is down the womens titles have had an easier time because luxury in womens advertising has remained pretty stable about a year ago we combined the four business titles that we own fortune money business and fortune small business and we threw it into a joint venture with cnn we worried a lot about with the fortune brand or the business brand how would they survive online business is a great example they do a cover story called the dumbest mistakes in business every year thats like their fortune they get about four million unique visitors when its on the business web site but being part of cnnmoney com they got million hits the first week thats pretty thrilling for a small brand like business ms swisher lets talk about news people are not getting their news through those newsweeklies like time what do you do in a situation like that can you imagine a day that there will not be time magazine ms moore not in our lifetime look at what rick stengel times managing editor has done we first moved to friday delivery people have more time to read on friday and hes changed it he recognizes were not breaking news in a weekly newsmagazine were breaking news on time com which is the daily online site the other thing weve learned is that we need to do short form video its very easy and very impactful to populate the online sites of the time inc magazines with the short form news clips ms swisher what do you make of all the user generated content ms moore it is cool but its a different product the world is a big world theres plenty of room i have journalists my job is to maximize what we do and to keep it growing and we figured out how to do that ms swisher what user generated content would you see incorporated into time ms moore heres a great example essence magazine is one of the magazines im most proud of this is a small magazine its got about seven million readers it did a cover story in february called "will you marry me " and it found six men who were having trouble committing and we videotaped their proposals we put it online we asked you to vote who was going to go to south africa on their honeymoon and we got million votes tiffany sponsored the whole thing in the magazine and online that makes essence no longer in my mind just a little minority magazine trying to scratch out their fair share of the print pot they now can go after television dollars ms swisher time warner hasnt missed the boat because some people feel they did ms moore no it is definitely not too late for the big brands to establish their rightful place on the internet im occupying a little corner of the web im not trying to do anything but to leverage what we do well because i can see its valuable ive proved that we really can get the big time brands growing again
