onward upward investors await earnings reports to affirm their bullish outlook higher interest rates can lead to an array of woes for the stock market but one of the worst a downturn in corporate profits still isnt among the big worries for most investors and wall street pros even after the latest run up in benchmark treasury debt yields that attitude helps explain the stock markets rebound last week including a point three day rally in the dow jones industrial average which gained on the week with a wave of second quarter earnings reports due next month investors will get either tangible support or a rebuke for their optimistic bets in large part those bets are based on the belief that a strong economy the same one that has kept benchmark year treasury yields above within reach of a five year high also will continue to lift companies bottom lines some say there is danger however that higher rates may persist meaning higher borrowing costs for months or years although the market seems to have done little to factor in that risk so far it could change quickly if investors see more signs that consumer spending employment and demand in other sectors of the economy arent abating which could signal inflation standard &amp poors economist david wyss uses the analogy of a frog placed in warm water and slowly boiled "you raise the temperature in the pot eventually the frogs may notice " he says that could mean a heavy round of selling stocks akin to the drop in the dow industrials earlier this month as year treasury yields broke through those yields influence the cost of various forms of borrowing from mortgages to the financing of corporate deals and capital investment there are several reasons the initial shock over higher treasury yields has quickly worn off for starters most corporate debt is locked in for the long term and wont roll over for years as long as a decade for some companies with investment grade bonds outstanding at the same time many companies are so flush with cash after several years of booming profits that increased borrowing costs wont make a big difference at this point excluding financial companies components of the broad standard &amp poors stock index have enough cash on hand to buy back of their outstanding long term debt s&amp p says meanwhile most pros expect solid if unspectacular growth in corporate profits for the second quarter according to thomson financial which tracks earnings trends wall street analysts now expect aggregate earnings at s&amp p companies to rise more than for the second quarter but by the time all the reports are in hand earnings will probably be up to comparable to the first quarter growth rate says michael thompson research director at thomson actual earnings numbers tend to come in above expectations because corporate executives often make comments to keep investors hopes for big profits in check "its clear that the analysts are not factoring in the idea of interest rates having a big impact" on second quarter earnings mr thompson says "im not saying theyre right about that but thats where their thinking is " tom sowanick chief investment officer for investment manager clearbrook financial llcs clearbrook research unit says concerns that rising rates will hurt corporate stocks may be overblown he notes that since its june trough the yield on the year treasury note has climbed two percentage points and the yield on the two year note has risen nearly four percentage points during the same period he says the s&amp p has risen while the russell index a measure of small stock performance is up that doesnt mean that rates can continue to rise without crimping economic growth mr sowanick says but it does indicate the rise in yields so far has been the result of real economic activity and not rising worries about inflation which tends to eat into bond investors returns lehman brothers strategist simeon hyman says many companies profits tend to benefit during inflationary periods which entail a general rise in prices for goods and services throughout the economy "someone has to pocket those higher prices " which means that inflation often ends up on companies bottom lines says mr hyman he does however see some risk that a continued selloff in the treasury market which has led to higher yields eventually could make bonds more attractive as an alternative to stocks "you always have to watch whether the relative value has shifted " making fixed interest payments from bonds preferable to the risk of holding stocks says mr hyman even as treasury rates have moved up an indicator of corporate borrowing costs the difference between treasury yields and corporate bond yields or spread has remained appealing for companies that need to borrow money on friday the average yield on investment grade corporate bonds was percentage points above the year treasury yield the average yield on corporate junk bonds stood at just percentage points above the year yield up just percentage point in the past two weeks and well below the historical average spread of percentage points according to diane vazza s&amp ps managing director for global fixed income research ms vazza says s&amp p expects junk bond default rates to climb pushing junk bond spreads above three percentage points by the end of the year "its still a borrowing bonanza" right now ms vazza says but "the market has certainly gotten choppy" and many companies are rushing to borrow now before rates and spreads worsen "theres still an opportunity to get in before the window slams shut " she says "everybody whos thinking about coming to market suddenly wants to print the deal "
