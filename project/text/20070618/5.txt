all things digital viacom vs google the battle from both sides google inc s youtube has become the top video sharing site with millions of offbeat user created videos emerging hit series like lonelygirl and untold numbers of illegally posted television and movie clips earlier this year viacom inc the parent of comedy central and mtv sued google accusing the search giant of copyright infringement "on a huge scale" over the vast hoard of viacom clips that users have uploaded to youtube google has countered that it is protected by provisions of the digital millennium copyright act which shields internet companies from liability for copyright infringements by their users if the companies act promptly to remove the clips kara swisher talked with philippe dauman viacoms president and ceo and walt mossberg spoke with google chairman and chief executive eric schmidt about the lawsuit here are edited excerpts of the discussions walt mossberg we should start off with the viacom lawsuit doesnt philippe dauman have a point he owns and has paid a lot of money for the production of a bunch of this content doesnt he have a right to decide who can distribute it and get paid for distributing it eric schmidt the viacom lawsuit was probably just a mistake the underlying dispute is about the digital millennium copyright act and whether there is a shared responsibility around the take down provision or not as we read the law it is pretty clear that there is a safe haven for sites on the internet that host content that is incorrectly or illegally uploaded as long as they take it down promptly and indeed we do that we are busy building tools that will automate as much of that process as we possibly can because it is crazy having people doing this stuff manually mr mossberg what should they have done mr schmidt they should have waited for the tools mr mossberg why should they wait why should they believe that you are going to come up with the tools mr schmidt we have lots of other people using them mr mossberg but why shouldnt he say "even one day of using my material is an outrage because we paid for this" do you believe in intellectual property and copyright mr schmidt absolutely the important principle about copyright here is that google operates under the dmca for lots of our properties we happened to be sued by viacom over this particular issue which is largely a business negotiation had they simply waited the tools that are in development now would have addressed most of their complaints mr mossberg but why should the onus be on them to wait for you why dont your smart engineers come up with some tools mr schmidt because we follow the law the law does not require us to build tools were building the tools to make their lives easier because we think its good for everybody the more we can automate those tools the better from a legal perspective which is what you are asking we met the terms of the law a year ago we met it six months ago well meet it today
