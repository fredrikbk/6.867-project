in tax fight buyout firms have friends on the hill washington blackstone group and fellow private equity firms face a difficult fight in congress over their tax status but they have some advantages as well influential democrats with ties to the financial sector may be hesitant to attack a large and growing source of campaign support and many republicans remain deeply opposed to anything resembling a tax increase new yorks senior senator democrat charles schumer has led his partys charge against president bush and the republican agenda on many economic issues from attacking the controversial sale of a port last year to pushing for a harder trade line against china but he wasnt rushing last week to take the lead on the legislation which would take away a big tax break from private equity firms that decide to take themselves public such as blackstone one of mr schumers more prominent constituents a spokesman yesterday repeated that the senator and his staff are taking a careful look at the legislation illinois rep rahm emanuel who worked with mr schumer to help democrats take back congress last year also said in an interview last week that hes not yet taking a position on the issue of taxing publicly traded private equity firms as corporations "its fair to ask the question " mr emanuel said but added "is that really what we want to do alter the economics of going public you have to weigh that against the fact that they are changing the nature of the business " mr emanuel who before entering congress joined an investment bank after serving in the clinton administration said he has heard concerns voiced about the bill from friends in the private equity sector the senate bill was initiated by senate finance committee chairman max baucus a democrat and republican charles grassley to be sure rep charles rangel d n y chairman of the tax writing house ways and means committee has voiced support for the bills core idea and the committees ranking republican jim mccrery of louisiana has supported hearings meaning that hes not closing the door to the issue but concerns about increasing taxes were being raised among some republicans in the senate where its harder to pass legislation because of possible filibusters over proposals that lack more than the votes needed to cut off debate meanwhile the political clout of private equity firms is likely to grow as the industry wakes up to new threats and spreads more of its wealth among politicians in the election cycle most of the leading candidates for president in have attracted strong support from private equity firms republican contender rudy giulianis top contributor so far has been hedge fund elliott associates lp where executives and employees have provided about &# of his campaign funds so far democratic candidate john edwards has raised about &# from individuals associated with fortress investment group llc a hedge fund where he worked according to the center for responsive politics republican mitt romney the former massachusetts governor built his reputation and fortune as a founder of private equity firm bain capital in boston he has raised about &# from employees and executives at bain and another private equity firm hig capital on friday mr romney came out against the baucus grassley proposal mr romney "is opposed to increasing taxes he believes the folks in washington d c should instead be focused on cutting wasteful spending " a campaign spokesman said mr romney has received a &# contribution from stephen schwarzman blackstones co founder among other private equity executives sen hillary clinton d n y also has raised substantial amounts from private equity firms including farallon capital management llc and avenue capital group the private equity council a group comprising of the biggest firms including blackstone has been in existence for fewer than six months so far it has declined to take sides in the debate over the baucus grassley legislation spokesman robert stewart yesterday again wouldnt express any opinion on the legislation but the councils board is likely to consider the matter further within the next few days according to people familiar with the situation a few of its member firms already have expressed interest in going public as blackstone proposes to do so the baucus grassley bill is likely to be a concern for them as well for other members however opposing the bill is likely a lower priority so far private equity firms appear to have convinced lawmakers to reconsider a much bigger hit on their industry ending the favorable tax treatment of "carried interest " the cut in future profits that private equity and hedge fund managers receive in big deals this is typically taxed now at a rate rather than the ordinary income rates of as much as that apply to individuals the baucus grassley legislation would only take away the rate for private equity firms that take themselves public on the theory that theyre acting like corporations thus some members of the private equity council that arent affected by that proposal might prefer to stay focused on blocking the broader threat recent publicity about mr schwarzmans luxurious lifestyle appears to have whetted lawmakers appetites to go after his firm which earlier this year announced plans for an initial public offering but having scored their points with the public its possible that lawmakers will lose interest in the measure if it runs into heavy opposition or if it doesnt raise much money for the government to spend sens baucus and grassley havent said how much revenue they expect to raise from the measure
