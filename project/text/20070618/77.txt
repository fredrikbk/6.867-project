options trial could set path of future cases former ceo of brocade is first to face a jury in backdating scandal a criminal trial that could determine how aggressively the government will pursue other executives for backdating stock options is set to begin today in san francisco the federal case against gregory l reyes former chief executive of brocade communications systems inc a san jose calif data storage networking firm is likely to be watched by executives lawyers and scores of other corporations caught up in the options scandal it is expected to provide the first indication whether a jury considers backdating options a serious crime mr reyes who faces the prospect of years in prison and millions of dollars in fines if convicted is accused of defrauding shareholders between and by routinely altering the grant dates of stock options awarded to recruit and retain employees and of falsifying documents to cover up the scheme opening arguments in the case are scheduled for today a stock option gives its holder the right to buy shares at a future date at a fixed price usually the market price on the date of the grant if the stock later rises the recipient can cash in the option for a profit by backdating a grant to a prior date when the price was lower the awards value increases such options are known as being "in the money " to date executives at six companies have been charged with criminal offenses related to backdating five have pleaded guilty one has fled to namibia more than companies have come under federal investigation for stock options irregularities although government officials have closed some of those probes in recent weeks without taking action mr reyes is the first executive to stand trial his lawyer richard marmaro said he plans to mount a vigorous defense "i expect the trial will show that these were issues of misunderstanding of accounting rules " he said "im confident that when a fair minded jury hears what happened they will agree that no crime was committed here " one issue in the case is the question of criminal intent specifically whether mr reyes knew brocade had to expense stock options that were "in the money" at the time they were granted as accounting rules specified brocade didnt expense the options and the company later acknowledged its mistake by restating its earnings to account for them mr marmaro argues that the accounting rules at the time were extremely complex and many business experts besides mr reyes didnt understand them prosecutors are expected to maintain that mr reyes understood the rules and was involved in retroactively picking favorable option grant dates and then altering board meeting minutes and personnel and financial records to cover up the backdating from brocades auditors the government intends to introduce internal emails to bolster its case including at least one they believe shows mr reyes understood the implications of backdating according to a person familiar with the matter michael n levy a defense lawyer at mckee nelson llp in washington who isnt involved in the case said proving criminal intent in a corporate fraud case can be difficult "you dont usually have executives saying i am going to knowingly violate the law and defraud people so you have to prove intent to defraud by using circumstantial evidence and circumstantial evidence by definition is always subject to more than one interpretation " mr marmaro already has suffered one legal setback last month in a related civil case filed by the securities and exchange commission against mr reyes a federal judge refused to dismiss the case and rejected two of mr marmaros legal defenses that investors dont consider backdating options material and that mr reyes never personally benefited because he never exercised any backdated options u s district judge charles r breyer who is presiding over both the civil and criminal cases noted then that brocades share price fell more than after it first disclosed options problems in january he also wrote that "it does not matter" that mr reyes never exercised a backdated grant "simply put a defendant is not absolved of liability by remitting his loot " he stated mr marmaro said he still will be able to make the same arguments at the criminal trial which he said is expected to last two months lawyers familiar with the case said they believe its outcome likely will affect how many other cases are tried "everybody is going to be analyzing" the verdict said one lawyer "if jurors come back and say we dont think investors do care" about backdating "that would be a factor" in future cases the original prosecutor assigned to the brocade case left following a recent shake up in the san francisco u s attorneys office which saw the dismissal of u s attorney kevin ryan the case is being handled by timothy p crudo who specializes in securities fraud and adam reeves who joined the office a few months ago mr crudo also is involved in deciding whether to bring criminal charges in the case of backdated stock options at apple inc in addition mr crudo is overseeing a criminal case against stephanie jensen brocades former vice president of human resources who faces fraud charges over the governments objections that case will be tried separately no trial date has been set among the witnesses expected to be called in mr reyess trial is larry sonsini a silicon valley lawyer whose firm wilson sonsini goodrich &amp rosati of palo alto calif represents a number of companies caught up in the backdating scandal mr reyes has previously suggested that mr sonsini a former brocade board member was responsible for his predicament saying the lawyer supported giving mr reyes sole authority to approve and price option grants mr marmaro said his client "is not blaming anyone " and the defense plans to call mr sonsini as a witness "nobody did anything wrong " said mr marmaro in a class action suit filed against brocade mr sonsinis firm recently filed board minutes showing that the decision to make mr reyes a one man options committee which it says is "a common practice " was approved nearly a year before mr sonsini joined the board the government is expected to argue that as a "committee of one " mr reyes was responsible for any options irregularities mr sonsini also appears on the governments potential witness list that list includes the companys former chief financial officer michael byrd as well as several human resources employees who are expected to detail how the alleged backdating took place citing former employees the wall street journal reported in a page one story last year that the company routinely altered employee start dates to grant options with lower exercise prices mr reyes is from a family of high tech entrepreneurs his uncle george reyes is chief financial officer of google inc gregory reyes never exercised any of the questionable stock options at brocade he sold at least &# million of shares he received before the company went public in the company dismissed him in mid after its stock options problems became known on may brocade agreed to pay the sec &# million to settle
