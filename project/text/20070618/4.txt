all things digital tvs game plan les moonves goes online leslie moonves president and chief executive of cbs corp oversees the companys television networks its radio and records group and book publishing among other things like other executives of traditional media companies he has to navigate a different and more difficult digital world he talked with walt mossberg about the future of cbs programming network news and entertainment created for the web what follows are edited excerpts from that discussion walt mossberg youve just come from the upfronts where the big television networks show their fall lineups to advertisers do you want to tell us how it went for you leslie moonves the one thing that is different this year is for the first time the digital sales became part of that people are not just looking to buy "csi" in the cbs network but on all the things that are related to "csi" which are online they want to do an integrated marketing plan the bulk of the advertising dollars still will be on the network they still will be on a "csi" which gets million viewers every single thursday night but a very important part is what is going to be the integration of the internet with that buy mr mossberg when you sit down to plan a new television series or to purchase one from someone is the internet strategy integral to the planning mr moonves no question about it you will look at a show and youll say "all right what are the potential applications that could go online " on the cw network half owned by cbs they have a new show called "gossip girl " its sort of "the oc" for the upper east side its based on an internet site its about how there is social networking going on within this group of people etc weve already planted seeds online which can in fact help that show mr mossberg do you foresee a time where somebody will actually create a series on the internet im not talking about three minutes of a guy dancing in his dorm room on youtube but a series which actually will be a hit mr moonves the web cannot be used just to put regurgitated network product on we have to look beyond that we have to look to put on original content right now in los angeles we have a bunch of kids right out of various film schools in los angeles who are working full time given &# or &# and told "create a series create a group of minute series on dating " its important for us while we are selling our main content all over the place to do original content and there will be a day and it wont be that far in the future where one of these series will catch on youll hear about it all over the place and people will be looking at these shows and it will be millions and millions of people who are watching it every week mr mossberg lets talk about your syndication approach for making programs available online mr moonves you can get all our shows on cbs com we have all our shows or most of our shows on itunes as well we feel the way to the future is getting as much distribution as we can as long as we can get paid for this content we want our content all over the place if viewers want to pay for it on itunes for &# without commercials they can do it that way if they want to go to any of our partner sites they can get it that way with advertising there have been two generations of these deals one is the actual shows themselves and one is the ability to play with our shows to slice up the show i love it when people take episodes of "csi miami" and do different clips of david caruso taking his sunglasses off and saying one of his lines as he does in his ultradramatic way that is only a promotional value to us theyre reaching audiences we would never reach if we can get an year old or a year old to look at a clip of a cbs show and say "my god cbs is cooler than i thought they were and let me go on monday night and go watch that show there or go get that show somewhere online " thats only a positive for our company mr mossberg so what is a cbs show if i ask my kids who are in their s to tell me the distinction between a particular show running on your network and the other big networks i dont think they have any sense of what your brand is mr moonves a network is not a brand when there were three networks way back when there would be a branded show right now in a universe of cable channels and a universe of eight billion internet sites shows are brands networks are not mr mossberg is there a future for the evening news on television mr moonves id be lying if i didnt say the image of network news is very different than it used to be it used to be people would race home at six oclock to watch walter cronkite and it used to be a tradition by the same token every evening at to million people still watch the evening news thats not insignificant i think its very important still to have a news division its still highly profitable in the mornings somewhat less profitable in the evenings " minutes" is still a valuable part of the landscape of america still the most highly watched network newsmagazine the news has evolved and its changed because by the time people get home they usually know everything its about expanding on a story is it less significant than it used to be absolutely is it still important i believe so the highest rated show on cnn is under a million viewers katie couric is in third place but shes still watched by million people every single night so she kills every show on cnn and she kills every show on fox news in addition when there is a big story breaking whether its katrina or whatever people go to the networks first the network news ratings go way up for the hour a day coverage they do go to cable news and to the web the news sites on the web are growing in leaps and bounds every single day mr mossberg can the advertising model that has made you a rich and successful company continue on the web is there another more creative way to do ads mr moonves theres going to have to be when youre selling to million people who are watching the super bowl there will be one kind of ad that will work when youre doing a weekly television show theres a kind of ad that may be more pinpointed than you think when you get down to the web youre going to be a much more pinpointed kind of advertising our goal at cbs is to be in all those businesses if you have a dollar of ad spending we want to get it all mr mossberg in five years what proportion of the audience is still going to be sitting there the way people did or years ago and saying "ok this is on at this is on at this is on cbs" mr moonves i think the majority of americans are still going to be watching a show at a specific time period and theres going to be a communal experience people are going to want to watch a show when its on and then talk about it the next day by the same token a greater percentage will be watching what they want when they want it wherever they want it therefore were trying to make that available to them because clearly the world is heading that way mr mossberg can you ever imagine taking original material produced for the internet and starting to air it on the regular television network mr moonves i think its inevitable theres going to be some terrific creative idea that starts out as a three minute series once a week and its going to be so successful were going to say "look were going to open it up to the broader audience " but that is not the specific goal that will be the fringe that will be the gravy that happens the specific goal is to get original content on the net that people really want to watch this is where the next george lucases hopefully will come from
