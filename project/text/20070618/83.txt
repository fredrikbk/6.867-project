ses global strikes novel satellite deal paris in the latest sign of a resurgent commercial satellite sector european industry leader ses global sa has negotiated a novel roughly &# million deal to launch of its satellites on a combination of french and russian rockets slated to be announced today at the paris air show the five year agreement not only covers a large number of flights but is intended to provide reliability by ensuring firm backup rockets and alternative launch sites for each satellite by pressing ahead with such expansion plans and seeking long term launch arrangements stretching to at least the luxembourg satellite operator was able to get price breaks from french rocket operator arianespace as well as its russian rival international launch services the deal also sets a benchmark for flexibility in matching different size payloads and rockets as the industry is rebounding and launch manifests are being filled among its commitments arianespace agreed to use french ariane v and russian soyuz rockets at its equatorial spaceport in kourou french guiana as part of the package japans rocket industry committed to earmark additional backup capacity in case of a problem with one of the other two launch providers ses president romain bausch said the agreement provides "on schedule access to space" covering the companys plans to replace or expand its satellite fleet after the internet financial "bubble" burst around launch providers struggled with weak manifests and u s rocket makers lockheed martin corp and boeing co largely ceded commercial markets to french and russian providers but orders to build and launch commercial satellites have increased since late permitting ariane to increase its prices about over the period with financial support from european governments arianespace is building a launch pad in kourou to handle several soyuz launches a year the soyuz is about a third as powerful as the largest ariane v but it is considered a cost effective option for smaller and midsize satellites "we are the only space services company to offer such a wide variety of launchers " arianespace chairman and chief executive jean yves le gall said last month but he added "we need to have a stabilized production rate" to maximize returns the industrys revival is further underscored by arianespaces anticipated announcement at the show of stepped up production of rockets for its use arianespace expects to gradually increase to eight from five the annual launches of its heavy lift ariane v "thats an important signal " said douglas heydon a former arianespace executive now at aerospace corp "their cost efficiency will improve " and launches will generate more profit he said satellite operators historically have contracted for some backup capacity in case technical problems or an accident temporarily put a specific rocket out of operation but those were usually shorter term arrangements focused on specific satellites by contrast the latest agreement covers the bulk of all the satellites ses units plan to launch until the middle of the next decade ses also has been an industry leader in building smaller more flexible satellites that can be delivered faster to take available launch slots the deal also represents an important stamp of approval for international launch services which only a few months ago lost lockheed as a partner and is now dominated by russian government and industry interests
