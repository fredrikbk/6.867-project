ethanol producers expect consolidation ethanol plants which have sprouted up across the u s over the past two years are ripe for the picking as leaders begin to emerge in the renewable fuels sector some ethanol producers have begun to position themselves for a wave of consolidation that is expected to be driven by a drop in profitability with ethanol production capacity in the u s forecast to double by analysts are warning of a coming supply glut if it materializes this oversupply would be the first big test for an industry that is experiencing a renaissance thanks to the federal governments push to wean the nation off fossil fuels infrastructure to distribute ethanol widely and technology to use a gasoline blend that contains mostly ethanol are trailing leading to a potential oversupply of the fuel such conditions could force firms to sell out some industry watchers say that larger companies bring technological and operational advantages to the field and may come to dominate should a buyers market arise for ethanol assets "a profit squeeze will happen a couple of times over the next few years " said david black president of americas strategic alliances llc a dallas investment and merchant bank the first quarter of will likely bring the first of these because that is when ethanol production is forecast to outstrip the nations capacity to blend it into gasoline he said ethanol producers distill plant byproducts to make the fuel in the u s the primary input for ethanol production is corn a squeeze could also come because a poor harvest due to weather or other factors sends corn prices sharply higher pushing some companies out of the business mr black said ethanol producers such as aventine renewable energy holdings inc us bioenergy corp and verasun energy corp have become publicly listed companies over the past year in anticipation of consolidation however their share prices are all down from their debuts as investors fret about a drop in margins because of higher corn costs and expectations of rising ethanol imports from brazil nonetheless such companies are likely to be at the forefront of any merger and acquisition activity said ron oster an analyst at a g edwards "youll see these publicly traded companies get larger and grow their market share through acquisitions down the road " he said each of these recently listed companies has between and of the u s ethanol market the largest publicly traded ethanol producer archer daniels midland co controls about of u s capacity and is known for large scale plants that have the flexibility to process corn into ethanol or other products that suggests the decatur ill agricultural processor would be unlikely to acquire the small farmer owned ethanol cooperatives that account for almost a third of u s ethanol processing capacity because of their relatively small scale and focus on ethanol that leaves the field open for midsize companies they in turn are largely waiting for the cost of building a facility to exceed the cost of acquiring an existing one a g edwards mr oster said the trend is moving in that direction just a few years ago it cost about &# to &# a gallon of capacity to acquire an ethanol production plant since then asking prices have fallen to &# a gallon because the margin outlook and perceived earnings potential of these plants have declined considerably he said meanwhile the cost of building a new plant has risen and is now estimated at &# or more a gallon he said prime real estate has been taken making acquisitions a preferred alternative to building a plant far away from cornfields and transportation making ethanol more widespread may prove difficult because most cars in the u s cant run on gasoline containing more than ethanol this physical limit could curtail its growth for a time some say moreover a lack of infrastructure for distributing the fuel could make it difficult for the supply to reach new markets particularly the u s s southeast unlike gasoline and other refined products that are transported by pipelines from crude oil refineries to terminals ethanol is shipped largely via rail primarily from the midwest
