technology a special report matters of the mind want something more substantive than youtube heres where to find highbrow videos on the web a great documentary history of the mormon church was broadcast by pbs last month but dont fret if you missed it either live or on tivo the internet is coming to the rescue all four hours of the show are available for viewing online as streaming video at pbs org thats just one of countless examples of the way in which the web is coming into its own as a source of what might be called smart video while youtube has captured a great deal of attention and traffic for its vast collection of mostly goofy videos a growing number of sites are providing more cerebral alternatives documentaries speeches panel discussions research reports and more in some instances production values are minimal think c span with just a single camera trained on a podium but remember youre supposed to be here for the ideas not the flashy graphics so after youve spent an hour watching the most popular downloads at youtube or ifilm and want to atone for the wasted time you can check them out the show on the mormons was made for broadcast as a joint project of the pbs shows "frontline" and "american experience " increasingly programs like these that are shown first on pbs are later being offered online several of the pbs "frontline" documentaries and "nova" science shows are available on the web unfortunately for the many fans of these programs though the number currently being hosted on the web is still relatively small because of legal issues many of the programs were made for pbs under contracts that didnt mention online distribution but over time more and more of them are expected to be web ready taking high quality shows created for traditional tv and then showing them on the web is the first and most obvious step being taken to raise the internets video iq in a separate development web entrepreneurs are going the youtube route but with a high iq twist creating entire sites devoted just to smart video one of the most ambitious is fora tv a san francisco based outfit that wants to be the go to site for speeches panel discussions symposiums and the like fora tv has arrangements with many lecture societies think tanks and big book stores members include the brookings institution the asia society the hoover institution and more than a dozen others when one of them sponsors a speech or panel discussion a fora tv crew usually one person and a digital camera shows up and records it back at the office the speech is uploaded to a computer and then annotated by "chapters " much like dvds divide up feature films the file is then put online you can either watch the whole speech or jump to any chapter some even have transcripts that appear in synch with the video fora has hundreds of videos on scores of topics in the arts current events business science and more theres a session on feminism and other topics with jane fonda and gloria steinem nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus discusses how microfinance can end poverty and writer ian buruma talks about social tensions in modern europe brian gruber the founder of the site says his goal is for internet users to think of fora tv as the gathering place for those who want to experience for themselves a speech or panel discussion they may have read about in the paper there are plenty of other smart video sites to explore the research channel is a consortium of major universities that banded together to put presentations by their top researchers on public access cable channels it also has its own web site researchchannel org where you can watch the presentations the channels emphasis is on academic research and unvarnished technical topics william phillips

kingdom has a research channel of its own www research tv com emphasizing work at u k colleges and universities other substantive fare is sprinkled around the web and can be hard to find so some sites have cropped up as directories for these hidden gems for example the traditional fine arts organization inc works to support the arts in the u s on its web site theres a directory of arts oriented videos throughout the web at the main tfaoi org page click on "catalogues " and then on "online video on demand " one of the few online sources of smart video that charge users is totalvid com owned by the norfolk va based totalvid inc unit of landmark communications inc it costs &# a month for access to a huge library of how to and documentary videos many of them originally made for broadcast sites like landmarks weather channel users can test the site free for a week niche oriented video sites are another characteristic of the burgeoning world of smart video some focus on a single topic
