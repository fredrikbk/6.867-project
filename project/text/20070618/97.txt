the doctors office challenges of diagnosing autism physicians walk the line between being overly cautious and not cautious enough online edition we noticed there was something unique about my little patient at his month well child visit usually children know multiple words and can put two of them together by age two but this toddler was reading the numbers off my exam room doors as his father carried him down the hall id never seen a child so young do that his language skills were obviously advanced for his age his mother has a degree in elementary education and his father is a chemistry teacher so i initially attributed it to the extra educational attention i presumed hed been getting at home at age three he was reading bible verses without hesitation "has he memorized them " i asked "no hes actually reading them but he doesnt understand what the words mean " said his father when he went to a buffet restaurant salad bar he read the "fruits &amp vegetables" sign as "fruits ampersand vegetables " what three year old knows that the "&amp " symbol is called an ampersand he didnt seem to relate well to other children in the nursery at church they tried to play with him and he moved away he hated when his toy cars were out of order from her elementary education background his mother became concerned that he had a form of autism i had never seen a patient with possible savant syndrome and autism before it is reportedly quite rare after some research i agreed he needed more of an evaluation than i could provide for him there is no specific lab test for autism symptoms are different in children as the variations of the disorder are complex boys are three to five times more likely to be affected than girls autism is not a mental illness or a result of bad parenting it is a brain development disorder that may have a genetic component red flags for autism in children include unusual speech inability to relate socially repetitive behaviors poor eye contact fascinations with spinning objects absence of the ability to indicate needs by pointing lack of interest in typical baby games unresponsive to parents and a history of being "a very good baby" who "never cried " some forms of autism are genetically inherited but the mechanisms are complex and incompletely understood the cause of most of the cases is unknown about children in are affected according to medical studies the illinois academy of family physicians has put together a nice set of educational materials about autism for practicing doctors there has been a lot more attention about autism in the last years part of the increasing interest is due to better recognition of the signs and symptoms by front line doctors like me i have about six patients in my practice with various forms of the disorder but the issue comes up in discussions more frequently each time that autism and the need for early detection is in the news it generates anxiety in parents and i typically get more questions at the office when it is on "oprah " i get a lot more questions parental concerns often prompt me to make referrals for speech and language evaluations rather than wait on a potential problem that may get worse thats ok because problems like autism are often unreported and a little extra vigilance is a good thing for the patient the family and for me if small town doctor brewer misses the initial signs the parents will tell everyone they know forever i also get questions about vaccine safety from parents about once a month i tell them that the best available evidence is that vaccines are safe and not proven to cause autism or other developmental problems all four of my children have had a full set of vaccinations sometimes i find i need to push parents to respond to potential problems recently i noticed a toddler i delivered wasnt speaking as she should at years of age i wanted to make a referral and do a blood test for lead but the parents were initially resistant i encounter more denial of problems than over anxious parents when they did agree to the testing the child was about delayed in her speech and therapy was initiated the good news is that her lead levels were normal and autism wasnt a concern i screen for autism in my patients at the well child visits starting at nine months of age the month visit is particularly important and a more detailed examination is done then i make a concerted effort to identify kids with special problems as a comprehensive assessment is usually a hundred miles away when i suspect a problem i refer children to the state early intervention services that help coordinate care for children with developmental delays im actually mandated to report developmentally delayed kids by state law then members of a multidisciplinary team assess children and come to a diagnosis some of the pediatric specialists dont want to take the kids on medicaid i often have to arm twist the doctors personally if i want my patient seen one of the biggest frustrations for me and my patients families is when we just dont know whats going on another of my little patients didnt respond to his name at age this is a warning sign to watch out for that ive been discussing with the parents of my youngest patients he didnt like to be touched during his well child exams at first it seemed to be stranger anxiety and just a normal developmental stage that all kids go through except that it got worse and worse as he got older and stronger he went ballistic whenever he came to the doctors office he had a series of ear infections making me wonder if his delay in language skills was due to hearing loss by age an ent doctor i referred him to asked his mother "whats wrong with him " he could barely be examined he was so combative i suspected he was autistic but i really had no concrete answers for his mother who asked why he was like that she felt both guilty and traumatized by the experience at the ear doctor she thought the doctor thought she was a bad parent this youngster is working his way through the state system and is getting therapy for his developmental delays im uncertain what to tell her to expect for his future since his evaluation is ongoing children can be mildly or more severely affected unfortunately sometimes i just dont have a good answer and we have to wait and see
