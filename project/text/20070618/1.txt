all things digital ipod iphone itunes apple tv where steve jobs sees them all heading steve jobs the chief executive officer of apple inc was one of the pioneers of the personal computer but lately he and his company have gotten more attention for head turning consumer electronics such as the ipod and the soon to be released iphone he talked with walt mossberg about the iphone itunes and apple tv and the computer business here are edited excerpts from that conversation walt mossberg what businesses is apple in steve jobs apples in two businesses today and a hobby were about to add a third business the businesses are one our mac business which we love and is growing really well the second is our music business each of those two is about a &# billion business for us and the third business were about to get in is the phone business handsets the hobby is apple tv i call it a hobby because a lot of people have tried and failed to make that a business everybody from tivo to microsoft its a hard problem its a business thats hundreds of thousands of units a year but it hasnt really crested to be millions of units per year if we work on it and improve things over the next year months we can crack that mr mossberg when you changed your name to apple inc and announced that youre doing the iphone in addition to the ipod and apple tv people said "this is your gradual exit out of the personal computer business " do you remain committed to the personal computer business mr jobs totally were rolling out the next generation of our operating system leopard which well ship in october mr mossberg youre a lot nicer to cellphone companies than you were last time you were on stage here mr jobs weve gotten to know some of the players and we havent sold a phone yet but cingular has been really great with us mr mossberg by leaving you alone mr jobs no actually not by leaving us alone we did a different kind of a deal than theyve ever done before and it bent or broke a lot of their rules theyve never done anything like this and they did it with us without ever seeing the phone we wouldnt show it to them they took a gamble on us and likewise we took a gamble on them and so i will never forget that mr mossberg why do you think they did it mr jobs i think they did it for two reasons music on phones hasnt been so successful so far and they really wanted to do something good with music on phones they knew with the ipod built into the phone we could do that the second reason is that they have spent or are spending a fortune to build these g networks and so far there aint a lot to do with them people have not voted with their pocketbooks to sign up for video on their phones so they have a lot of bandwidth but existing phones are not capable of taking advantage of it because their internet experience is so poor they have lousy browsers you dont get the internet you get the baby internet or the mobile internet or something bizarre and what people want is the real internet on their phone and they believe that we could deliver that were going to be able to take advantage of some of the investments theyre making in this bandwidth in an entirely new way mr mossberg you put out a press release this morning may that you have begun to sell these non copy protected songs on the itunes store from emi mr jobs right now it is just emi but there are zillions of independents that are also jumping on the bandwagon as fast as we can get their stuff encoded youll see more and more on there i think over half the songs we offer on itunes will be offered in what we call itunes plus which is our drm digital rights management free higher quality audio versions by the end of this calendar year mr mossberg any other movement on the record labels coming mr jobs were working with them the music companies ship of their music drm free today because all cds are drm free weve gone to them and said "look youre shipping of your music drm free customers are willing to pay a little bit more to get their downloaded music drm free and why dont we do this " we were successful in persuading emi and hopefully over the rest of this year will be successful in persuading most or all of the rest of the labels mr mossberg is the iphone a wireless ipod or is it a phone that has an ipod in it mr jobs its three things its the best ipod weve ever made and its an incredibly great cellphone if it was nothing but a cellphone it would be really successful and then the third thing is its the internet in your pocket for the first time mr mossberg how much debate was there within apple about the decision not to have a physical keyboard on the iphone mr jobs none mr mossberg really why not mr jobs once you actually use a touch display like this theres no going back we actually think we got a better keyboard and it takes a few days of getting used to it but ill bet you dinner that after using it for a week you will think its really great the other nice thing about it is that we can use that physical space for other things when you dont need a keyboard you can keep changing user interfaces you come up with new ideas new applications it provides incredible flexibility to create great user interfaces for different applications in addition to that once you learn how to trust the keyboard its a better keyboard mr mossberg how much time do you think you have before people copy the overall form factor of the thing mr jobs why does the ipod exist why is apple successful in this business the answer is that the japanese consumer electronics companies who were the pre eminent hardware makers of consumer electronics until recently couldnt do software as well as it needed to be done if you look at the ipod its a software product and beautiful hardware the japanese consumer electronics companies couldnt make the leap to create that kind of software thats why apple enjoys the success it does with the ipod if you look at handsets it looks very similar the handset manufacturers have got their hardware down but they havent been able to make the leap to software the usual suspects will try to copy the hardware and it will take them some time but the software is at least five years ahead of anything weve seen out there and its really hard to do mr mossberg why do you describe apple tv as a hobby apple tv is a new device that allows consumers to take movies and other media from their personal computers to their television screens why isnt it dead simple to imagine people wanting to buy that in large numbers mr jobs what everybody has tried and the place where weve come from too is getting content from your pc on your widescreen tv and im not so sure thats really what most consumers want its great to show your photos its great to play your music but we tend to think of that as the entree and the more we think about this the more we think that might just be the peas on the side and that the entree might be things that you really get directly from the internet mr mossberg how many copies of itunes are out there is it more than the number of ipods mr jobs several times more mr mossberg youve announced a figure of ipod sales as million youre saying this could be million copies of itunes mr jobs or more mr mossberg that makes it one of the most ubiquitous pieces of software out there and almost all of them are on windows computers mr jobs weve got cards and letters from lots of people that say that itunes is their favorite app on windows its like giving a glass of ice water to somebody in hell mr mossberg do you think video on portable devices is a success i remember when you were here at one point and you said that you didnt think people want to watch video on small devices mr jobs i was definitely more skeptical than the customers they proved us wrong video has been the no or reason they bought the product and they use a lot weve sold the better part of million television shows mr mossberg the iphone can play video but you dont have a video service that allows people to download videos on the iphone why not mr jobs people have tried it with music so far and its failed part of the reason is that a phone isnt necessarily the best place for discovering or browsing through large catalogs of music when you download it to the phone it costs more money because the airwaves cost more than the terrestrial internet then when you get it on the phone you have to sync it back to your pc anyway because if you lose your phone or trade in your phone you dont want to lose a few hundred dollars worth of music so you can either buy on your phone for more money in a less good environment and sync it back to your pc or you can buy on your pc which has a much bigger screen and then sync it to your phone we have million ipods that people know how to sync to their pcs they know how to buy music on itunes mr mossberg so you have no plans at the moment to put any version of the itunes store either for music or video on the iphone itself despite the fact that you have a big screen and you have this non baby operating system mr jobs we certainly have nothing to announce today
