all things digital mastering a new tool george lucas on circus vs art george lucas is chairman of lucasfilm ltd and one of the most successful moviemakers of all time in addition to being the man who created the "star wars" universe he is responsible for bringing new technology to the process of movie storytelling from the computer animation that was used by walt disney co s pixar animation studio to the digital special effects that have dazzled viewers for years mr lucas talked with walt mossberg and kara swisher about digital moviemaking the business of hollywood and the difference between circus and art here are edited excerpts of their discussion kara swisher how do you look back on what you did in "star wars" from a technological perspective from a storytelling perspective george lucas painting music any kind of art form is essentially technological the most important part is to be able to communicate emotions that is the key to what we do i liken digital technology to going from fresco to oil painting if you are doing a fresco you needed about at least two dozen people it was done by candlelight and it was very hard to do the fact that they can make it consistent over a long time is a marvel but if you use oil paints you can go outside you can see the light play on your subject which completely revolutionized art at the same time if you dont like what youre doing you can paint right over it and start over you cant do that with frescoes with film thats what happened it used to be with film you went out and shot it whatever you got was what you got sometimes people would sit out there for days and days and days trying to get it right because they knew they only had one shot at it and they knew they werent going to be able to come back with digital technology we can go in and shoot it the way you would an oil painting then you can go back to your studio and touch it up you can completely manipulate it its much more like a painting than it is like photography ms swisher how do you feel your impact has been because some people feel that digital effects have taken away from moviemaking mr lucas digital technology is a tool whatever you do its going to get abused sound was abused color was abused everything gets abused but thats just the nature of human nature when you get a new toy you want to use it until it breaks and then you start to calm down walt mossberg when did you begin shooting movies entirely in digital mr lucas it was really "jurassic park" that pushed us to the new beginning mr mossberg "jurassic park" was shot entirely digitally mr lucas no but the dinosaurs were digital compared to stop motion which is what we did before they were so real looking that that was the breakthrough we could actually create real things digitally that would fool anybody then i said i want to shoot digitally i can cut digitally i can do the effects digitally i want to work the whole way digitally so we went to sony and eventually convinced them to build a frame camera we went to panavision and got them to develop lenses we were supposed to do it for "star wars episode i " but we didnt make it when we went back to shoot some additional material about a year later we shot about two weeks of material digitally which was then incorporated in the movie but of course nobody could tell what it was we released the film in four theaters with digital projectors we thought after sony builds the cameras after texas instruments builds a projector and we show you that it looks just as good as feature film this would be it that was in nothing really happened ms swisher what do you think of internet video mr lucas there are two forms of entertaining circus is random and voyeuristic its basically what you see on youtube now i call it feeding christians to the lions the movie term is throwing puppies on a freeway its very easy you sit there and watch and see what happens you dont have to write anything you dont have to do anything you just sort of watch it happen and its interesting then you get to art art is where a person contrives the situation and tells a story and hopefully that story reveals the truth behind the facts storytelling is trying to come up with an idea that is insightful in terms of giving you a different insight into how things work or is amusing ms swisher how would you look at this online medium right now as a filmmaker if you are just starting out mr lucas id think its great the problem we had there was no place to show what we did when i was in film school there was absolutely no possibility whatsoever of getting into the film business theyd say "why are you going into film school youre never going to get a job its a waste of four years and a lot of money " but we did it because we loved it mr mossberg today you could put your films if not on youtube somewhere else on the internet mr lucas basically if you want to work free its a great thing to do when youre young its good for that ms swisher how would people get paid in that medium do you ever see it developing as a way of distribution mr lucas everybodys talking about the fact that eventually it is going to be monetized and it will be it will be the best delivery system which is why im going into television instead of having six hours or hours of film i can have hundreds and hundreds of hours of film ms swisher what happens to hollywood they have so many systems of distribution gating controlling the money controlling distribution which are falling apart mr lucas the money doesnt exist they borrow the money the last thing you want to do is invest in the film business its the absolute worst hedge fund guys we call them the sucker of the moment theyre convinced that theyre going to make money at it ill guarantee they wont they just want producer credits they want the girls theyre going to find out that its a very expensive way to go about that situation but the real issue is that its not an economic model it doesnt work especially theatrical films and as the dvd is drying up the only profit margin they have is drying up with it tv isnt suffering from the same thing but with tivo and recording the material and taking the commercials out tvs going to end up with its own rapture
