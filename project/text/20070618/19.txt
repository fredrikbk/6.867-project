bushs shrinking global trade agenda white house will lose its fast track authority at the end of this month washington president bushs ambitious global trade agenda appears to be shrinking to this a new investment treaty negotiation with rwanda launched thursday likely to be followed by pursuit of similar pacts with the small african countries of ghana and mauritius bigger more complex agreements notably the doha round for multilateral liberalization are about to become significantly more difficult for the white house to advance that is because mr bushs special authority for negotiating major trade deals expires at the end of this month with no prospect in sight that congress will renew it any time soon "frankly theres not a lot of momentum right now " says montana democrat max baucus chairman of the senate finance committee his panel is the starting point for action in the senate on so called fast track negotiating authority which allows the president to submit a trade deal to congress for up or down approval without amendment the death of fast track matters in part because americas trading partners typically arent willing to deal with the u s without a guarantee that agreements wont be picked apart by special interests on capitol hill that could be particularly troublesome for the fragile doha round the most coveted prize left on the bush agenda u s trade representative susan schwab has been crisscrossing the globe in an effort to secure a breakthrough in the talks which were launched in the wake of the sept terror attacks ms schwab meets with other trade ministers in germany this week to try to jump start stalled discussions and additional bargaining sessions are planned for later this summer without fast track whatever momentum is generated in negotiations could fizzle out losing fast track also imperils bilateral negotiations with eight countries including thailand and ecuador "the overall signal is once again we cant get ourselves together and were turning in on ourselves " says susan sechler director of trade and development for the german marshall fund a trans atlantic think tank ms sechler says fast tracks expiration underscores u s unease about globalization and reinforces doubts abroad about the u s s continued economic engagement abroad "those are terrible messages to be sending " she says more broadly the expiration of fast track is likely to move the u s into a new era of trade uncertainty it isnt clear that whoever follows mr bush will have much luck winning renewal of fast track given the deep reservations about trade that have taken hold in both parties on capitol hill the prospects will be especially bleak if democrats retain their majority rank and file democrats are particularly anxious about trade citing the impact on workers and families antitrade sentiments helped elevate the party to power in and are already roiling the contest under the constitution congress has authority over international trade agreements but lawmakers have long delegated that authority to the executive branch under a process designed to streamline consideration and avoid major fights over deals fraught with complexity and political controversy the existing framework was established in under president nixon the authority is granted explicitly by congress but for only short periods and has lapsed from time to time most recently under president clinton mr clinton used the authority to push the north american free trade agreement and the uruguay round global trade deal through congress but he couldnt persuade the republican led congress to renew fast track once it expired in mr bush made renewal a priority after taking office since winning the authority in his biggest trade accomplishment has been passage of the central american free trade agreement a pact that bound the u s economy to five fragile countries in central america as well as the dominican republic in the caribbean mr bush has also pushed half a dozen single country deals through congress such as pacts with singapore and morocco deals with peru panama colombia and south korea still await congressional approval under fast track rules mr bush cant expect any real help on fast track from capitol hill the white house has vowed to ensure that democratic priorities such as labor rights are better reflected in trade policy but skepticism runs deep antiglobalization sentiments helped propel democrats to power in the house and senate in the election even with deals negotiated under the fast track umbrella pacts with colombia and south korea face particularly difficult paths to passage similar concerns are shaping the campaign the democratic presidential front runner new york sen hillary rodham clinton opposes mr bushs proposed deal with south korea calling it bad for american auto makers maneuvering on immigration legislation a bellwether of engagement abroad is roiling the republican presidential field given the political winds sen baucus generally a free trader says it doesnt make sense to try to push for a renewal of fast track suggesting energy and immigration bills demand more immediate attention reversing the usual formula and putting the white house in a catch mr baucus says the bush administration needs to somehow show progress negotiating doha first and then congress may again consider fast track "that would focus our minds " he says otherwise he adds dont expect action anytime soon "its a distraction " gary hufbauer senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics an influential think tank predicts the bush administration will try to spur mr baucus with a "last gasp" attempt to win renewal of fast track this fall if that fails though mr hufbauer worries the broader doha talks might collapse casting doubt on the future of the geneva based world trade organization which oversees the doha round "thats a big blow to credibility " mr hufbauer says schwab spokesman sean spicer says it is too early to say doha is dead if fast track expires "theres nothing that precludes" negotiators from continuing to meet he says "we still go to work and do everything weve done before " meantime planning is under way for life without fast track already some officials note there are range of trade related deals from food safety standards to customs cooperation that can be done outside of fast track during the clinton years for example officials negotiated the terms of chinas entry into the wto they led discussions within the wto on an agreement promoting trade in telecommunications and they pursued different bilateral investment treaties of the sort envisioned with rwanda nearly two thirds of them after fast track expired "a little creativity goes a long way " says charlene barshefsky mr clintons trade negotiator for much of his tenure
