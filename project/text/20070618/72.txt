political peer review does this sound familiar a questionable survey finds that an fda approved pharmaceutical may carry some risks a respectable but increasingly politicized medical journal publishes the research and attaches an alarmist commentary a media panic ensues democrats ride the story to kick up support for what they wanted to do all along which is increase regulation over "big pharma " meanwhile the complex science is trampled in the commotion well its not vioxx at least not yet the latest drug panic concerns avandia a medicine used to treat diabetes the facts arent all in but that didnt impede representative henry waxman from calling the controversy "a case study of the need for reform of the nations drug safety laws " since the next flashpoint will inevitably come with the meeting of an fda advisory panel on july lets review what we know avandia or rosiglitazone is a sophisticated drug that works at the gene level to lower blood sugar in diabetics manufactured by glaxosmithkline it was approved by the food and drug administration in the accusation is that avandia increases risks for cardiovascular problems including heart attacks according to a study published in may in the new england journal of medicine nejm it was accompanied by an editorial encouraging physicians to stop prescribing avandia and condemning the fdas "desultory approach" and "regulatory failure " that all but guaranteed a round of press hysterics sure enough first time avandia prescriptions are down and down overall by endocrinologists and their patients were bound to be wary but the nejm study was problematic steven nissen of the cleveland clinic employed a statistical technique called meta analysis which pools data from smaller clinical trials to suggest overall trends meta analysis can be a useful contribution to medical knowledge but it is in no way conclusive several aspects of the nissen study are particularly troubling the assertion that avandia raises the absolute risk for heart attacks by relied on a methodology that excluded data in which there were no reported adverse events skewing the results the nejm editorial itself acknowledged that "a few events either way might have changed the findings" and that "the possibility that the findings were due to chance cannot be excluded " even the lancet the british medical journal with its own politicization issues clucked about the nejms "alarmist headlines " fda critics say the agencys failure was to insufficiently warn avandia patients of these risks whatever they were and that this is particularly egregious because diabetics are already prone to heart disease but the reverse is also true the high cholesterol and blood pressure obesity and other conditions associated with diabetes might account for any problems not avandia correlation is not causation besides the data dr nissen analyzed did not control for cardiac events so things like indigestion and heartburn may have counted glaxosmithkline is conducting its own clinical trials which are more rigorous to be concluded next year the interim results showed that avandia patients had a decrease in heart attacks and a decline in deaths from cardiac events though these arent yet definitive either the larger political context here is the evidence of collusion to gin up one more drug company "scandal " dr nissen has a reputation as an adversary of the pharmaceutical industry and was involved in the controversy that led merck to withdraw vioxx from the market in late he admitted that he consulted with several congressional committees including mr waxmans before the nejm published his avandia paper at a waxman hearing dr nissen said he shared his "preliminary analysis" and "discussed some pending legislation " ostensibly serious medical research isnt supposed to be peer reviewed by the democratic majority the pending legislation is mr waxmans counterpart to the senates enzi kennedy drug safety bill which if passed will bolster the fdas authority to require postmarket testing but its hard to tell why avandia is the "case study" for this agenda glaxosmithkline was already engaged in extensive postmarket trials before this scandal broke beyond those that would be required by enzi kennedy and glaxo makes the data from its completed trials transparent on the internet where dr nissen acquired it in the first place so much for mr waxmans repeated claims that big pharma is suppressing negative results avandia will now be getting a "black box" warning from the fda the most stringent possible regulation short of a ban though the controversy will no doubt escalate with the july fda review avandia will probably remain available to patients and their doctors for some time for now thats better than the merck situation with vioxx off the market and the company mired in litigation at bottom the avandia fuss is political not medical and it turns on risk itself how to strike the best balance between patient safety and lifesaving therapies the fda already does too much onerous bottlenecking of new drugs those who think otherwise ought to make an honest case not rely on political sensationalism see related
