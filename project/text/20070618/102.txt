day sign up for the e mail here as an economic embargo against the palestinian government appears to be coming to an end the dilemma facing donor countries is how to ensure the aid is seen as a sign of support for president mahmoud abbas while still getting through to people in need in hamas controlled gaza the european union announced plans this morning to restore direct aid payments to the new palestinian government in the wake of hamass takeover of the gaza strip and the split with its rival fatah faction the associated press reports the eu said it plans to deliver assistance to gaza through the united nations or a program that bypasses the hamas leadership there washington is also expected to lift an embargo soon in a move that will coincide with a visit by israeli prime minister ehud olmert a senior u s official tells the ap and while advocates of a "west bank first" policy see the fatah controlled region as a potential example of what a future palestinian state could be others fear such a policy would result in the million gazans being left without international aid and opening a door for iran and syria to provide funding and increase their influence in gaza the ap says another possible obstacle to such a strategy is the problem of violence in the west bank where fatah forces have targeted hamas and the al aqsa martyrs brigade operates beyond the control of the palestinian authority the los angeles times writes gazans are now facing fuel shortages as the israeli company that supplies all of the gaza strips gasoline said it was stopping deliveries israel radio says according to the new york times meanwhile the israeli infrastructure minister binyamin ben eliezer who oversees fuel supplies threw his support behind the strategy of isolating gaza telling israeli army radio "we should simply increase the isolation of gaza i want to stop everything until we understand what is going on there " the new york times reports gaza is believed to have about two weeks worth of gasoline left the paper notes mr abbas and his new prime minister salam fayyad have promised not to abandon gaza and have pledged to continue paying the salaries of public employees in the area the los angeles times notes but the presidents power in gaza has greatly diminished and as saeb erekat a close aide to mr abbas tells the new york times "in reality gaza is no longer under the control of the palestinian authority " could dow jones have a new suitor an alternative to news corp s offer for dow jones could be emerging as ge and financial times publisher pearson are holding
