the borrower who never was synthetic identity fraud hits credit bureaus banks a night at the ritz carlton florence ariz in may las vegas resident adam gregory went on a business trip to phoenix he stayed at the ritz carlton and charged the &# bill to his american express card or so financial records show in fact mr gregory didnt live in las vegas never held a job and wasnt even a real person rather mr gregory was a "synthetic" identity a person who appears real on paper but is actually a fraudsters concoction designed to trick financial institutions into granting loans and issuing credit cards in the case of mr gregory the man behind the mask was james rose a year old former credit bureau operator working with a partner mr rose tricked the guardians of the credit system lenders and the three big credit bureaus into treating his fake identities as if they were real creditworthy consumers he obtained several hundred credit cards in the names of mr gregory and as many as other fake personas over two years filching around &# over a two year period unlike traditional identity thieves who purloin peoples information to get loans or make purchases fraudsters like mr rose mix legitimate and phony data to create synthetic identities this kind of fraud doesnt usually directly affect consumers the big losers are banks which get stuck with loan defaults and unpaid credit card bills that identity thieves leave behind there are no reliable figures documenting losses from synthetic identity fraud banks are secretive about losses but many say the problem is growing avivah litan a fraud specialist at research firm gartner inc estimates that synthetic schemes constitute at least of credit charge offs and of losses from credit card fraud banks "are very nervous " she says synthetic identity fraud "is showing up all over the place " scams like mr roses also show how fraudsters can exploit the practices of the three big credit reporting companies equifax inc experian and transunion llc the companies and the ftc say some inaccuracies and fraud are unavoidable given the bureaus complex task and lenders demand for quick access to credit histories mr roses story is based on court documents and interviews with law enforcement officials and mr rose himself who was sentenced to months last week in phoenix his partner in crime a canadian immigrant named malcolm newton is awaiting sentencing and declined to comment growing up in north hollywood calif mr rose branched out from television studio work to set up a small home building business in the mid s he started a credit reporting company after finding other companies took too long to produce credit histories attending credit bureau seminars mr rose learned that the bureaus maintain a file for every inquiry lenders make even if it contains mismatching or erroneous data the credit bureaus may tell the lender that it couldnt find a match a "no hit" situation but they still use the data to create a new file in their databases most of these files are legitimate some emerge when lenders submit inquiries with misspelled names others get created when people apply for their first credit card mr rose realized he could plant no hit files within the credit bureaus by applying for credit cards using a mix of real and phony data could these files be transformed into seemingly real people with seemingly respectable credit histories so that lenders would extend credit to them mr rose experimented with the idea in the late s a decade later the internet had turbocharged the credit granting process and depersonalized steps needed to make the scheme work on a grander scale around mr rose teamed with mr newton a credit savvy acquaintance to launch the scheme their goal make a lot of money "without actually hurting people " mr rose says the men paired fake names with social security numbers of real people adam gregory the purported las vegas resident had the social security number of a real california resident the conspirators needed addresses for their synthetic identities and for a dozen or so shell companies that helped to facilitate the scam eventually they rented odd apartments in states they kept binders of data in their phoenix headquarters to keep the details straight the duo acquired business licenses usually online for the dummy businesses a few had real offices with furniture others rented "virtual" office space after messrs rose and newton triggered the credit bureaus to set up no hit files for their synthetic identities their shell companies fed false data to credit bureaus as the fake data funneled into the credit bureaus the planted no hit files began to acquire history and look like creditworthy customers messrs rose and newton successfully applied for credit cards with at least major firms all in the names of their synthetic identities the financial institutions included wells fargo &amp co american express and household now part of hsbc holdings plc all declined to comment cards in hand the partners bought goods and services mostly from their shell companies after the shell companies received payments from the card issuing banks to cover the charges mr rose withdrew cash from bank accounts set up for these companies using atm cards "it was exciting when it came together " he says "i realized my god this can be done " u s secret service agents first detected the scheme in the summer of mr rose says when mr newton was apprehended in honolulu trying to cash checks made out by some of their fake identities agents subsequently raided the pairs headquarters and mr roses home on aug agents arrested mr rose "this case illustrates the level of misguided creativity and ingenuity that we commonly see on the part of identity thieves " said eric zahren a secret service spokesman all three credit bureaus say their data management procedures are legal adequate and continually updated meanwhile each company vigorously markets premium data screening services to businesses interested in taking extra security steps to weed out identity theft schemes including synthetic fraud evan hendricks editor of the privacy times newsletter says credit bureaus should better scrutinize data and the ftc should mandate stricter rules "the credit bureaus are at the epicenter of identity theft and theres no pressure at this point to force them to make changes " he says the ftc has estimated that the no hit phenomenon has created "tens of millions" more files in the credit bureaus databases than there are actual consumers it has said the bureaus dont routinely investigate these files pointing to cost as a factor the credit bureaus say they view the automatic creation of such files as a legal requirement transunion says it deletes files containing nothing besides an initial inquiry "within a set period of time " which it wont specify regulators are torn over what if anything to do about the problem tweaking the system too far in the direction security could slow down credit granting and economic activity but todays looser approach continues to invite fraud
