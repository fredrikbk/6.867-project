is it possible to decide when or even if torture is warranted in reading "getting serious about torture" editorial page oct i was stunned by this statement from authors david b rivkin jr and lee a casey "coercive interrogations have been key in preventing post attacks on american soil " this is the sort of sweepingly unsubstantiated claim that if written by a liberal commentator would provoke immediate censure from the right if true however it is a huge statement the facts of which should be revealed to the american people who have a right to know this would also strengthen the authors call for a national debate on interrogation methods can messrs rivkin and casey substantiate their claim with facts is anyone in the administration willing to do so without falling back on the "matter of national security" rationale barbara ettore new york the most important reason for restraint in interrogations is that we cant persuasively complain if techniques that we use on accused terrorists are used on captured american soldiers neither their captors nor the rest of the world is likely to agree with messrs rivkin and casey that actions that are legitimate for use against "unlawful enemy combatants" constitute torture when used against "honorable prisoners of war " malcolm pittman cambridge mass the debate over torture as described by messrs rivkin and casey is getting puerile if a suspect knows where a nuclear bomb is ticking in manhattan every civilized person understands that the moral imperative is to pull his fingernails out with a wrench in order to save the lives of millions of people can one imagine anyone pleading with the interrogator please please dont waterboard him and make him feel like hes drowning lets all say this openly and without reservation or qualms and then maybe we can have an intelligent discussion about when and how it is permissible to torture terrorists ari weitzner new york the authors suggest a national debate on the definition of torture that would take "into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the use of any particular interrogation technique " they ignore the fact that the bush administration has foreclosed any such debate by refusing to discuss such techniques or the legal rationale for them the administration has claimed that security considerations preclude the kind of debate messrs rivkin and casey advocate but that cannot excuse the failure to disclose the relevant "facts and circumstances" to the intelligence committees of the house and senate which are privy to a great deal of highly classified information the unavoidable inference is that the administration has authorized the use of severe interrogations under circumstances that it is unwilling to debate or defend anywhere douglas m parker south orleans mass mr parker held senior positions as a lawyer in the nixon and ford administrations to have an intelligent debate on torture we must first establish whether such techniques work or not messrs rivkin and casey make no attempt to answer this question instead they simply make the claim that "there is no free lunch coercive interrogations have been key in preventing post attacks on american soil " this is the underpinning of the entire essay your readers expect more then a simple assertion to prove a point terence wehle williamsburg va it appears that neither judge michael mukasey nor messrs rivkin and casey can decide whether waterboarding a technique where a detainees hands and feet are bound to a board rendering him helpless while his face is pushed under water to a point just short of asphyxiation is torture of course the detainee can never be sure whether his tormentors will make a mistake or haul him out just in time before he drowns messrs rivkin and casey suggest a national debate i suggest a quicker more empirical way they can make up their minds each should subject themselves to the technique as a scientific experiment then they can enlighten the rest of us is it torture ami laws m d adjunct associate professor of medicine stanford university school of medicine palo alto calif
