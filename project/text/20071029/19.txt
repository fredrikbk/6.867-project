china and martin lee earlier this month we were pleased to publish an op ed by hong kong legislator martin lee on democracy in china little did we know it would be seized by beijing sympathizers as a chance to undermine freedom of speech in hong kong the assault which has the flavor of a cultural revolution struggle session stems from an october op ed "chinas olympic opportunity" online at wsj com opinion in the article mr lee called on president bush and other world leaders to "press for a significant improvement of basic human rights including press assembly and religious freedoms" and to use "direct engagement " rather than listen to calls from some quarters for an olympic boycott mr lee was traveling when the op ed was published upon his return to hong kong last week the political assault started on friday a raft of pro beijing newspapers including hong kongs largest circulation daily the oriental daily news as well as the ming pao daily news and sing tao daily ran leading stories attacking mr lee oriental dailys subtle headline was "martin lee a crazy traitor " the biggest english language daily the south china morning post also took up the cudgel saying mr lees comments would "fuel beijings worst fears about hong kong being used as a base for foreign interference " hong kongs beijing controlled legislature added its criticism while the chairman of the pro beijing democratic alliance for the betterment and progress of hong kong called for mr lee to apologize several dozen people jeered mr lee as he left the legislature the hong kong government didnt muster a defense of mr lees right to free speech hong kongs second highest ranking official henry tang told reporters friday that the olympics shouldnt be "politicized " this incident is extraordinary and not only because its the first time that a hong kong democracy advocate has been targeted so ferociously in this case the campaign was organized against something mr lee didnt even say many of the articles suggested that he had called for an olympic boycott though he expressly didnt chinese translations also changed mr lees words so that his call for "direct engagement" became "intervention" and "press for" became "pressurize " the pro beijing camp has many reasons for assailing mr lee because he is hong kongs most eloquent and famous democracy advocate his words carry weight in western capitals at a time when china is under pressure to improve its human rights record china may also be trying to send a warning to its own citizens that anyone who links the olympics with human rights or democracy will be treated harshly beijing wants the olympics to be a showcase for nationalist pride not domestic debate however chinas efforts to demonize mr lee may backfire hong kong citizens are sophisticated educated people who treasure their freedoms and will recognize a mainland style smear campaign for what it is the attacks on mr lee have also been widely reported in taiwan further undermining any beijing hope that that islands people will accept hong kongs "one country two systems" as a model for unification when reached by telephone yesterday mr lee said he was "flabbergasted" by the attacks true to form hes fighting back by telling the truth about what he believes as for china and its spokesmen their heavy handed assault will only draw more attention to beijings own lack of freedom see related article "chinas olympic opportunity" wsj oct
