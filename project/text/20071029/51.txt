medicare for all enthusiasts for government financed health care dont seem to mind playing pangloss all is for the best in the best of all possible systems which would have the government as single payer aka "medicare for all " the frequent claim is that eliminating profits and private administrative expenses would more than pay for the cost of covering all the uninsured well no as demonstrated in a new study by benjamin zycher a senior fellow at the manhattan institute and a former senior economist for the reagan council of economic advisers he estimates that the real economic costs of moving to single payer would be at least twice those of todays semimarket patchwork "administrative" costs generally speaking are those not directly funding medical care but instead spent to deliver insurance benefits sure enough on paper medicares are about of outlays compared to to for the private system but mr zycher notes that a more accurate measure of medicares administration would include other indirect federal services such as tax collection which round them up by about double fold in the incentives for the uninsured to consume more medical services under single payer than they do now and those "savings" are revealed as make believe mr zycher also points out that the adverse effects of the increased taxation required for "medicare for all" more than outweigh the potential efficiencies it costs the economy more than a dollar the bottom rung estimate is to send a dollar to washington so in the end medicare clocks in substantially above private insurance the analysis also offers some reality about what those supposedly wasteful private administrative expenses actually do underwriting i e the pricing of premiums in accordance with risks and health status is often assailed by politicians but the administrative scrutiny leads to an efficiency it allocates costs in proportion to benefits you get in other words what you pay for all insurance systems impose limits on consumption but single payer would remove any hint of the price mechanism that will either vastly inflate health spending and lead to tax hikes or otherwise lead to government rationing or most likely both
