the fomcs only task should be price stability harvey rosenblum had the remarkable epiphany that "the fomc does create a moral hazard each and every time it makes a monetary policy decision" editorial page oct in fact the federal open market committee inevitably produces not moral hazards but actual sins because the fomc enforces "an economic environment characterized by low and steady inflation a low unemployment rate and a sustainable rate of economic growth " following a statutory "dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability " steady inflation and price stability are incompatible and this is the crux of the fomcs dilemma with roots in the collapsed bretton woods agreement in nixons unpegging of the dollar gold standard and in half a century of delusive keynesian manipulations congress gave the fomc incompatible tasks on the presumption that its members have special expertise and know what is best in reality there is no expert within the fomc or otherwise who can prearrange benign consequences of non trivial monetary policies beyond obvious immediate effects that anyone can predict the vagaries of domestic and international markets make for inscrutable consequences of fomc decisions even in the medium term and every move of the fomc toward maintaining employment and growth is a blind bet at best or at worst a favor to special interests and an injury to innocents too many in congress are already intent to steer the national economy their way but at least they are elected the fomc cannot be a political machine and its only task should be price stability and it should be the statutory mandate of price stability not the "slow and steady inflation" that mr rosenblum seems to envision gio batta gori bethesda md
