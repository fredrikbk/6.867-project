environment a special report the economics of hybrids for most u s consumers theyre still a money losing proposition its getting a lot easier to buy a hybrid but not necessarily cheaper amid heightening concerns over americas proclaimed oil addiction skyrocketing fuel prices and global climate change auto companies are making more gasoline electric hybrid cars and giving consumers more choices than ever before but marketplace dynamics in the u s including higher prices charged by the car companies dwindling tax credits given to fuel efficient cars and low gasoline taxes havent yet allowed a hybrid or other more efficient vehicle to become an economical choice for many consumers in europe by contrast several countries offer significant tax breaks to people who buy more efficient vehicles and high fuel taxes also are propelling europeans to invest in a more efficient ride there are several hybrids on the market now using different technologies but basically a hybrid consists of a traditional internal combustion engine paired with an electric motor the electric motor gets its power from a storage battery which is replenished by a recharging system within the cars powertrain electric motors boost power to the gas engine allowing manufacturers to install smaller and thus more efficient motors in these cars most hybrids sport four cylinder engines as opposed to the six or eight cylinder motors found in many vehicles there are essentially two types of hybrids on the mass market today often dubbed "mild" or "full" hybrids each with fuel sipping and emission curbing features a mild hybrid shuts off the engine at a full stop uses regenerative braking which utilizes dissipated energy from braking to recharge the battery and uses the electric motor to help power the gas engine a full hybrid does all of those things but adds another big fuel saving feature electric only driving in which a vehicle runs on the electric engine alone at low speeds thats why hybrids get better mileage in city driving than high speed highway cruising the laws of physics still apply so you shouldnt expect a hybrid suv to get incredible mileage but it will get better mileage than its gasoline counterpart hybrids are currently the most popular green vehicle choice in the u s in the first seven months of this year new hybrid vehicle registrations nationwide rose from the year earlier period to according to r l polk &amp co an automotive research firm in southfield mich hybrids make up about of the u s light vehicle market economics are still getting in the way of greater adoption however one reason is the tax system americans get a tax break for buying hybrids the starting amount varies by model but the more hybrids an auto maker sells the smaller the tax break becomes on any hybrid models from that maker after a manufacturer sells its th hybrid the tax break starts to phase out buyers can claim the full credit during the calendar quarter after the quarter in which the manufacturer reaches the limit then the credit is sliced in half it is reduced by half again after another six months six months after that the credit disappears toyota motor corp s popular prius for instance once garnered a &# credit but toyota sold its th hybrid in the second quarter of so starting oct of last year the credit dwindled and today its gone that means consumers no longer get the tax break for buying a prius or hybrid versions of some of the japanese auto makers other models the camry lexus gs h lexus rx h suv highlander suv and the lexus ls h l sedan honda motor co s credits also will decline soon as the japanese auto maker has just recently exceeded the sales cap other hybrids from general motors corp and ford motor co should retain their full credits for some time amid lower sales volumes in europe by contrast several countries offer significant tax breaks in belgium for example drivers get of a cars price back maxing out at euros &# if the vehicle emits less than grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer according to the european automobile manufacturers association cars that emit between grams and grams get a break vehicles emitting more than grams dont get anything europeans also face high fuel taxes encouraging them to buy more efficient cars and diesel is specifically taxed at a lower rate diesel engines are about more efficient than their gasoline powered counterparts because of the higher energy content in diesel fuel and the more efficient combustion process in the engine diesel autos make up about half of the european market compared with about in the u s even taking a tax credit into account u s consumers have to pay more when buying a hybrid because the vehicles use a lot of expensive technology between large battery packs and complex transmissions that join gasoline engines with electric motors hybrids can cost anywhere from &# to &# more than comparable nonhybrid cars take gms saturn vue greenline sport utility vehicle which sells for &# more than its gasoline engine only counterpart after factoring in a tax credit according to edmunds com an auto research firm this and other specific comparisons are for models it would take nearly five years to recoup that premium in savings at the pump with gas around &# a gallon according to edmunds assuming you drove about miles a year if higher taxes increased gas prices to about &# a gallon roughly the price in europe it would take about two years the vue greenline gets about miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving a good uptick from the four cylinder front wheel drive gasoline engine version which gets about mpg toyotas prius which gets a leading mpg combined but no longer qualifies for the tax credit costs over &# more than the auto makers compact corolla it would take nearly years to recoup the premium or more than twice the time you might expect to own it even with a more favorable comparison to the less efficient camry sedan which costs about &# more prius owners would still need about years to get their money back in fuel savings that means the prius isnt necessarily an economical buy despite its superior mileage "if you want to save money on fuel just buy a car with better gas mileage " says jeremy anwyl chief executive of edmunds some hybrids are geared more toward performance than efficiency the prime example is the lexus ls h l sedan which has a v engine in its hybrid drivetrain the car priced at more than &# marks lexus attempt to market a super luxury car with added hybrid cachet for wealthy consumers who have a green streak the sedan gets just mpg in combined city highway driving better than a comparable bmw model but a bit worse than the less expensive lexus gs h auto dealers say consumers had unrealistic expectations about the economics of hybrids two years or so ago but have adjusted and now tend to buy the vehicles to make a statement earl hesterberg chief executive of houston based group automotive inc a large nationwide dealership chain says a typical reaction from hybrid buyers used to be "hey this thing really does still use fuel " but now consumers are more educated he says "the majority of people just want to feel better about themselves and that theyre trying to make some effort to be more green be more socially responsible reduce their carbon footprint " one long term consideration when buying a hybrid is the relatively untested maintenance history of battery packs if a hybrid battery fails it will be quite expensive to replace likely at least &# and perhaps as high as &# depending on the drivetrains complexity says jack nerad editorial director of auto research firm kelley blue book fortunately hybrids have experienced few if any major repair problems over the past few years and while consumers may consider these vehicles new theyve actually been in production for a while giving manufacturers time to refine them the first prius hit the road in in japan and came to the u s in most hybrids come with long warranties on their powertrain technologies eight years or miles for the prius that cover potential foul ups still after the warranties end its unclear what problems might crop up in an expensive battery pack theres no experience with this since few if any people have owned a prius for more than eight years a spokesman for toyota says the company placed extended warranties on the prius to address just such uncertainty but adds that issues with the vehicles batteries have been "virtually nonexistent " he says the company actually expects prius batteries to live well beyond the eight year warranty auto makers are gradually pushing toward electric plug in hybrids which will allow drivers to recharge a battery with a traditional outlet and go much further on electric power alone such cars could be a "game changer" that eventually displaces conventional hybrids says mike jackson chief executive of autonation inc of fort lauderdale fla a nationwide dealership chain another fuel saver on the horizon diesel many americans think of diesel engines as noisy and dirty but the introduction of cleaner diesel fuel in the u s that can meet tough emissions standards promises less pollution and wider use auto makers are ramping up plans to put diesels in light duty pickup trucks and passenger cars and auto companies eventually may employ diesel hybrids to really boost fuel economy mr spector is a staff reporter in the wall street journals detroit bureau he can be reached at mike spector wsj com
