signs point to pressure on stocks as fed weighs another rate cut the federal reserve meets this week amid persistent signs of trouble in the stock market after the feds half percentage point interest rate cut six weeks ago major stock indexes rebounded and the dow jones industrial average remains near its record high but rising oil prices mixed corporate profit reports and the spreading effects of a housing slump continue to fuel tumult in the economy and some underlying patterns suggest that stocks may have trouble maintaining their high wire act major stock indexes are being supported by multinationals such as microsoft corp coca cola co and procter &amp gamble co which benefit from the strong global economy many other stocks notably financial institutions and smaller companies dependent on the flagging u s consumer have taken hits other indicators also suggest thin support for the market the ratio of the number of stocks rising versus the number that are falling has been getting worse since the spring and the number of stocks at week highs has been on the wane since last year "if you look at the economy you see softening durable goods orders slowing manufacturing gains and a troubled housing market " says russ koesterich head of investment strategy at barclays global investors in san francisco "these problems are entrenched " even if the economy escapes recession he worries "we could face a choppy grinding stock market" next year so far the worrisome news along with &# a barrel oil has done little to push down the dow industrials and the standard &amp poors stock index last week the dow had its best week in more than a month rising to it would need to gain only an additional to surpass its record finish of hit oct bullish investors point to low interest rates which are fueling the world economy with lots of cash and to the expectation that the fed will cut interest rates when it meets tomorrow and wednesday some even see the weak u s economy as a positive factor for financial markets because it could force the fed to cut rates half a percentage point to "the federal reserve is highly sensitive to this issue of credit getting squeezed in u s markets if they see that happening they will cut rates pretty aggressively " making it cheaper for banks consumers and companies to obtain money and keeping the economy out of recession says rafi zaman head of u s stock investment at dupont capital management in wilmington del which manages &# billion in stocks mr zaman is sticking with his holdings not only in the u s but also in such developing countries as brazil and south africa nonetheless he says a number of stock markets in developing countries such as china and india are starting to look like bubbles that could end badly "it is like being in the u s markets back in late " he says professional investors then were almost forced to invest in bubble stocks he says for fear of trailing the competition and the same is true today of foreign markets he and others are prepared to start selling developing country stocks at the first sign that the bubble may be getting ready to burst that is one reason to be wary of the view that the fed will rescue the u s stock market if global markets begin to teeter and if u s consumers continue to struggle rate cuts alone could have trouble holding the u s market up few money managers consider this scenario imminent as mr zaman indicates the warning signs are there however one stark way to see them is to compare the performance of the russell an index of smaller stocks with that of the dow industrials the quintessential blue chip index made up of just big stocks for most of the bull market that began five years ago the russell rose faster than the dow as its small nimble companies benefited from low interest rates and a booming economy since oct when the bull market began the russell is up while the dow is up starting this past spring however they switched places the russell fell as consumer spending growth finally began to suffer and as the housing crunch and troubled credit markets roiled the u s economy the dow industrials dominated by multinationals that benefit from global sales are up since the end of may while the russell has fallen over that period when a bull market is young and the economy is vibrant small stocks typically outpace large ones when the bull market gets older five years is above average for a bull market and economic growth starts showing fatigue the number of stocks that can sustain their gains tends to shrivel the biggest strongest multinationals keep rising pushing up indexes such as the dow finally as the biggest stocks peak and decline the bull market tends to end that isnt inevitable of course but there are other signs of below the surface weakness of the stocks in the broad s&amp p more than half were trading last week below their average levels of the past days says phil roth chief technical market analyst at new york brokerage firm miller tabak the overall index buoyed by its biggest stocks still was trading above its day average so while the index looked fine most of its components did not also the percentage of advancing stocks on the new york stock exchange has been in a gradual decline since spring the number of stocks hitting new highs peaked last year the market has become very sensitive to rumors another sign of investor nervousness these trends could reverse if the economy shakes off its woes but unless that happens they are signs of trouble ahead u s economic growth has slowed markedly in recent months due to the housing downturn past fed rate increases and a lingering credit crunch with some banks still refusing loans to low rated corporate borrowers and consumers oil futures have pushed above &# a barrel reawakening inflation fears higher inflation would push interest rates higher making it harder to borrow money and taking away one of the main underpinnings of the economy and the financial markets cheap credit one big question now is whether the healthy job market and recent u s export strength helped by growth in asia and europe and a weakening dollar which makes u s goods and services less expensive compared with foreign ones will offset those negatives investors still widely expect the fed to achieve a "soft landing" preventing an inflation resurgence while keeping the economy strong enough to escape recession they hope lower fed rates will boost demand and keep corporate profits growing while the overall stock indexes look strong more and more of their component companies look less strong something similar happened in when the biggest global players such as microsoft held the indexes aloft as smaller companies fell away last week stocks benefited from hopes that the fed would bail out the market by cutting rates this week which it almost certainly will do but after that the fed wont meet again until dec and in practical terms it takes months for a fed rate cut to percolate through the economy and actually boost corporate performance "i think the fed is going to ease rates again but as soon as the fed eases we wont have a fed ease to look forward to and we will be staring at the bad economic environment " says mr roth of miller tabak who has been warning for months that the stock market could be headed for trouble
