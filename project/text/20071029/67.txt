oneal out as merrill reels from loss startled board ditches a famously aloof ceo the revenge of mother new york whenever goldman sachs group inc would report quarterly profits in recent years the pain would be felt nearby at the downtown headquarters of merrill lynch &amp co there merrill chief executive stan oneal would grill his executives about why for instance goldman was showing faster growth in bond trading profits subordinates would scurry to analyze the goldman earnings to get answers to mr oneal "it got to the point where you didnt want to be in the office" on goldman earnings days one former merrill executive recalls soon it will be mr oneals turn to avoid the office the year old ceo was negotiating the terms of his forced departure yesterday afternoon in the wake of a multibillion dollar write off he announced last week according to a person briefed on the negotiations merrills board is expected to consider external candidates and current merrill executives in its search for a successor mr oneals resignation is expected to be announced as early as today calls to mr oneals office and home werent returned a merrill spokeswoman said he wasnt available to comment with mr oneals ouster the global credit crunch triggered by a steep downturn in the value of subprime mortgages to the least credit worthy borrowers reaches deep into the executive suite damage across wall street has topped &# billion including &# billion at ubs ag a swiss bank whose head of investment banking resigned a month ago it has also cast further doubt on the future of citigroup inc chief executive charles prince whose co head of investment banking resigned after mortgage related losses according to people familiar with the firm a top contender to succeed mr oneal is laurence fink ceo of blackrock inc a money manager that is owned by merrill mr fink is close to greg fleming merrills co president and himself a possible candidate one scenario is a power sharing arrangement between the two other contenders may include john thain the ceo of nyse euronext and himself a former president of goldman sachs and bob mccann head of merrills huge brokerage arm in some ways mr oneals downfall seems a straightforward consequence of last weeks announcement that merrill would write down &# billion in the third quarter &# billion of that connected to its revaluation of mortgage related assets the largest loss in wall street memory but many wall street executives were stunned by the speed with which the board most of it picked by mr oneal was willing to throw its chief overboard mr oneal after all is widely credited with boosting merrills profitability and transforming it from a u s focused retail broker to an international financial giant with strong footholds in important segments such as commodities private equity asset management and bonds some former colleagues say mr oneals talent and steely drive came with a tragic flaw he didnt much engage in debate kept his own counsel and had little use for the kind of strong willed subordinates who might have helped him steer clear of the subprime troubles that brought him down in the early years of his tenure which began in mr oneal purged the firm of many of its longtime senior employees and later fired some of those considered his allies "he was uncomfortable around independent people with views which might be different than his and whose loyalty was to the firm rather than to him personally " said barry friedberg merrills longtime head of investment banking in the s and s mr friedberg retired in after he tried unsuccessfully to offer mr oneal advice mr oneals lack of support became clear in recent days starting in late september mr oneal had briefed merrills board of directors on the firms mortgage losses a write down he estimated would be &# billion in early october days after the close of the third quarter merrill fired two top bond executives mr oneal named a new bond chief david sobotka to clean up the mess on oct mr sobotkas team came up with a more conservative valuation which boosted the mortgage related write down by to &# billion the size of the loss startled the board particularly concerned was armando codina a florida real estate developer who is chairman of the boards nominating and corporate governance committee mr codina is a former business partner of former florida gov jeb bush and served with mr oneal when both were directors of general motors corp mr codina expressed his surprise to mr oneal at a recent board meeting according to a person familiar with the meeting "what bothered the board was that the size of the loss went up at an alarming rate " said this person if anything mr oneal should have "overcommunicated" with his board about merrills problems this person said but mr oneal didnt walk the board through the reasons for the write offs increase as much he should have the "final straw" was mr oneals unilateral decision to ask wachovia corp ceo g kennedy thompson a longtime client of the firm whether he would be interested in buying merrill mr thompson demurred according to a person familiar with the situation but those familiar with the firm say the moves appearance of desperation particularly since wachovia just acquired a big st louis brokerage and now rivals merrills brokerage in size offended some of merrills directors brokers and some executives who were unaware of the overture "if there are too many surprises the board loses confidence in the senior management team " says michael p kelly head of the board services practice for ctpartners a new york executive search firm the firm has done some search work for merrill in the aftermath of sarbanes oxley the corporate reform law directors "need to be in sync with the ceo " he says no one on wall street embodied the horatio alger story better than mr oneal who became the highest ranking african american on wall street raised in poverty amid the cotton fields of the deep south he worked as a young man at general motors during his days in the auto business an auto assembly line foreman pointed out mr oneals strong southern drawl mr oneal took speech lessons that gave him perfect diction an associate recalls that same determination showed after mr oneal joined merrill in in its junk bond division he came to power amid growing investor impatience with the firms cost structure particularly after money losing expansion moves into canada and japan he made cost cuts in merrills brokerage division was named president of the firm in july and reorganized the firm quickly after the terrorist attacks of sept he made even more draconian firmwide cuts during the stock market slide winning the top job in july and taking office in december with his restructuring mr oneal was seen as rejecting the longtime culture of a company known internally as "mother merrill " for years the brokerage giant was willing to accept lower profit margins in order to keep longtime loyal employees on the payroll much like international business machines corp had a no layoff policy during its s heyday mr oneal was criticized for purging a few dozen rivals and their allies after gaining power and later even his own former allies such as executive vice chairman thomas patrick merrills board gave him leeway because he more than doubled the firms profit level to an average topping &# billion annually from to those at the company said he was proud of cutting through the cozy corporate culture many former merrill executives who stayed in touch with each other were critical of his moves former executives say they were bothered by the firms lack of support for a group of its former bankers who were convicted and served jail time for allegedly helping enron corp deceive investors about its earnings the bankers convictions were later reversed but some face retrials such episodes showed mr oneal "forgot what mother merrill stood for and just disavowed the past " said daniel tully a former broker and merrills chief executive in the mid s "we had a great thing going for us with the so called backslapping type of people that we are we were tough taskmasters but not mean spirited " in recent days former executives also discussed moves to launch a proxy fight if mr oneal wasnt removed according to a person familiar with those discussions mr tully said he and other former merrill executives would be willing to step in to lead the firm temporarily during a one to two month search for a new ceo "to right the ship and show that mother merrill is alive and well " he said the losses were "awful " and said he and other merrill alumni had expressed their unhappiness "behind the scenes " mr oneals aloof management style was on display at the firms quarterly operations committee meetings in the boardroom on the rd floor of merrills lower manhattan headquarters instead of fostering freewheeling interchanges the meetings were often staged and choreographed with formal presentations to which mr oneal would ask questions but rarely entertain discussion a former executive says also visible at such meetings was mr oneals open disdain for bob mccann the popular executive had left merrill but returned in after an oneal purge had thinned the ranks at the top and took over the firms core army of brokers if mr mccann made an observation at a meeting mr oneal would often barely acknowledge it former colleagues say he would sometimes roll his eyes at the mention of mr mccann these people say and a person close to mr oneal derided mr mccanns abilities backslapping irish american bonhomie and track record as head of the research arm which isnt a moneymaker in may mr oneal bypassed mr mccann by naming two other executives co presidents another slap in the face of merrills brokers since then there have been periodic rumors mr mccann wanted to leave mr oneal could give even close allies a cold shoulder in early merrill was negotiating an alliance with blackrock the bond manager led by mr fink when mr oneal became dissatisfied with the way the talks were being handled by mr fleming the merrill co president who was then co head of institutional securities mr oneal sharply criticized his approach a person familiar with the episode says when mr fleming asked to see him mr oneal didnt respond until mr fleming showed up in his bosss office mr fleming eventually clinched the deal for merrill and the purchase of the stake in blackrock is considered one of mr oneals best accomplishments throughout his tenure mr oneal pushed his troops to match goldmans growth trajectory that quest led merrill into riskier areas such as underwriting collateralized debt obligations pools of securities backed by assets including mortgages without enough risk controls merrill alumni say merrills cdo inventory which eventually topped &# billion generated catastrophic losses disclosed last wednesday that equaled of merrills stock market value merrills stock price had slid a steep since the size of the losses first began emerging on oct it rebounded friday to &# on the reports of mr oneals possible departure another key decision that worsened the losses critics say was mr oneals ouster in july of three seasoned bond executives led by jeffrey kronthal a veteran of the salomon brothers mortgage bond department of lewis ranieri a group featured in michael lewiss book "liars poker " the others were longtime merrill bond executives harry lengsfield and doug demartin the three were summoned upstairs one after another for five to minute meetings with dow kim then co head of institutional securities mr kim told them there was no role for them only two days before they had outlined their plans for the next year during a two day gathering of the top executives of the institutional securities business at a posh bermuda resort hotel the fairmont southampton in the next year despite a gathering deterioration of the market for mortgage securities especially subprime loans to less credit worthy buyers merrill was stuck with &# billion of cdos and &# billion of subprime mortgage securities which had been left over from the firms drive to keep its no ranking in cdo underwriting despite the recent write downs merrill has cash to ride out the current upheaval though the firms balance sheet has ballooned by over the past months to &# trillion in assets the firm says it has &# billion in cash and readily salable securities "everything is uncertain at this point " says scott sprinzen a managing director following financial services companies at standard &amp poors which last week downgraded the companys credit rating "in the wake of recent problems there could be a disruptive change in strategic direction or more write offs all occurring when the credit markets remain unsettled but merrill lynchs liquidity is very strong so that is not a great concern we have right now " analysts say the firm will have to rethink its commitment to structured finance including cdos the firm will also have to balance choosing an outsider with few ties to recent mistakes against picking an insider who can provide continuity and limit the number of high level departures said david trone an analyst at fox pitt kelton the firm may have to accept reduced profits over the next few quarters mr trone says as it keeps pay levels up to limit departures
