congresss patent mistakes congress is preparing to enact far reaching reforms of the patent system and the stakes are high intellectual property in the u s the security of which relies upon the patent system is worth more than &# trillion today roughly of our annual gdp sweeping legislative change would however be a dangerous mistake critics have complained vigorously about the patent systems perceived inequities and inefficiencies a proliferation of low quality patents skyrocketing litigation costs and potentially ruinous damages for patent infringement have they argue combined to undermine the foundations of inventiveness congress is sympathetic but reforms are hotly contested by contending corporate coalitions on one side software and high tech companies who want weaker patents are allied against biotech and pharmaceutical firms and some old line manufacturing companies who vociferously argue that their ability to compete internationally depends on the full panoply of current intellectual property rights before rushing to enact major changes congress should remember that its past reforms have often spawned new problems for example the court of appeals for the federal circuit a specialized intellectual property court was created in in order to centralize judicial decisions on patents and end forum shopping it accomplished that by and large but at the cost of producing a court peopled largely by patent attorneys that instinctively sided with patent holders strengthened patent protection lowered the bar for inventiveness "non obviousness" in patent law jargon and paved the way for large damages against alleged patent infringers similarly the reinvention of the u s patent and trademark office uspto as a "fee for service" organization in the early s created strong incentives to move patent applications quickly and at the lowest cost congress compounded the problem by raiding the new revenue pool often drawing off more than half the annual proceeds just as the uspto faced a burgeoning workload caused by technological developments such as advances in biotechnology congress should not overlook the surprising ability of self correcting forces in the patent system and elsewhere to adapt to change in ways less susceptible to the unintended negative consequences of the blunt force and heavily lobbied legislative process in april the supreme court raised the bar for granting patents for "obvious" inventions warning that looser standards would actually "retard progress" for innovation similarly over the past several years the uspto has demanded greater specificity and detail in patent applications it even took steps recently to revoke three embryonic stem cell patents because they duplicated already published research and similar patents incremental reform is a better idea than radical change congress would do well to build upon consensus starting with proposals commanding widespread support among contending interest groups the most obvious is a first to file system which is what the rest of the world uses the date of filing with the uspto should determine control of the patent not todays confusing "first to invent" rule which produces endless disputes another useful and innovative reform would be a new administrative procedure a "post grant opposition proceeding" to provide opponents a brief opportunity to challenge a new patent without costly and time consuming litigation it should be bound by strict procedural rules to foreclose deliberate filibustering and most important it should extend no more than months allowing administrative challenges throughout the life of the patent as some overzealous reformers desire would weaken legitimate patent protection and undermine r&amp d incentives especially for pharmaceuticals and the small highly innovative biotechnology companies that rely upon patents to raise capital in the contentious area of assessing damages for patent infringement federal courts have begun to fashion an approach that takes account of the highly fact dependent nature of equitable solutions in each case far better to let the courts apply a rule of reason than to codify a single method by legislation several provisions in the bills before congress are notably ill considered particularly one to grant new substantive rule making authority to the uspto given the current disarray within the agency and its continuing struggle to master the challenges of emerging technologies giving it even greater authority just now would be extremely unwise this is no time to slice and dice a truckload of compromises among bitterly opposed special interests the economic cost of forcing the patent system to lean decisively one way or another crippling the usptos and courts ability to adjust to changing conditions would be immense congress should be mindful of the physicians oath as it contemplates patent reform first do no harm messrs barfield and calfee are resident scholars at the american enterprise institute
