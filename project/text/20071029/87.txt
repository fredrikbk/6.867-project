the daily fix red sox win seventh title behind lester and lowell online edition the boston red sox beat the colorado rockies last night to win their seventh title and second in the last four years while the world series wasnt particularly compelling no red sox fan could possibly mind the relative lack of tension one of the fixs favorite reactions to bostons cathartic title was that of espn coms bill simmons who explained that all he and other red sox fans had ever wanted was to be a normal team without curses and mythology and baggage despite the joy of it took this title for mr simmons and other fans to really get their wish the red sox are now no longer raw material for depressing new england literature theyre just the planets best baseball team with a glorious present and a bright future to go with their storied past by the way heres the oct fix "see this is what happens when you win it all under the simple guise of just being the best team absent the melodrama " writes bob ryan in the boston globe "you sweep the rockies and neither jimmy fallon nor drew barrymore is anywhere in sight this time the wait was only percent as long as the last one we didnt have to raid nursing homes to find people who actually saw the red sox win their last world series youre probably one yourself yeah yeah yeah the experience wasnt the same too bad sports cant always revolve around a nine decade soap opera " in the hartford courant jeff jacobs offers an appreciation of manager terry francona "start to finish this year francona managed like he was the chalk and nobody was going to come along to erase what was in his mind he had a plan and although some outsiders may have second guessed it from time to time and others may have said the plan was given to him by his bosses nobody could argue that he didnt stick with it tito managed like a man confident with a lead he liked his horse and told the rest of baseball to come catch him nobody did " in the washington post thomas boswell hails the work of game starters jon lester boston and aaron cook colorado whose courage has extended beyond the ballfield "lester had brought his team bereft of any other plausible starting pitcher after an injury to tim wakefield to the brink of its second world series sweep in four seasons " mr boswell writes "and he had done it months after learning last september in the midst of a fine rookie season that he had anaplastic large cell lymphoma the story of this night will be retold for many a year not only because of lesters excellence but because of the distinguished work of the losing pitcher aaron cook of the rockies another emergency starter who himself returned to baseball after a life threatening blood clot in his lung three years ago and if hyperboles arm is twisted in the process so be it the cause is good " your world series mvp third baseman mike lowell who began his red sox career as a salary dump in the deal that brought josh beckett from the florida marlins mr lowell is now a free agent and his rbi season and fall classic heroics should ensure him a big payday but where "maybe mike lowell should leave " muses rob bradford in the boston herald "when youre standing on a baseball field clutching a world series mvp trophy in the midst of being showered with deafening chants of re sign lowell from more than a thousand red sox fans well it cant really get much better " asks mr bradford "will he ever have another year like the one he just completed in maybe not but there has to be something to the fact that even the fans who never have gotten a peek behind the red sox clubhouse curtain understand there is more to the man than projections and promise sure other leaders and legends have come and gone from the red sox and they seemed to land on their feet but lowell is a different sort of glue than the likes of kevin millar presented no player under the current regime has supplied the presence of lowell not one if there is any doubt go to the four corners of the red sox clubhouse and ask " "when it was finally over swept away by the giddiness tension and ultimate disappointment of the first world series in city history rockies shortstop troy tulowitzki did not want to go home " writes mark kiszla in the denver post "as red sox players danced on the coors field mound tulowitzki stood frozen near the on deck circle steadfastly refusing to drop his bat for several minutes then slumped near the dugout with a helmet stuck stubbornly on his head " there should be no shame for the defeated rockies a good young team that rode a month long hot streak to baseballs biggest stage the rockies only failing was to arrive ahead of schedule which might have tripped them up in the world series but should stand them in very good stead next year judging from mr tulowitzkis words after the loss the rockies are already building on the experience "it was shocking i didnt want to leave you watch them take it in and realize what they did was special but now i want my turn " with the world series in the books time to welcome a new arrival in the crowded fix skybox of champions paula burton prevailed over the other readers who entered our postseason baseball contest finishing points ahead of runner up john andrews full details from carl here unfortunately mr lowell wasnt the only al third baseman discussed last night alex rodriguez couldnt manage to show up to receive an award from hank aaron before game citing a family commitment but agent scott boras saw no reason not to interrupt the world series to announce that a rod was opting out of the rest of his year &# million contract with the new york yankees to become a free agent anyone with the slightest respect for the sport was understandably appalled but to the fix the raw shamelessness of it was utterly appropriate now any team that negotiates with mr boras has received ample warning just what kind of sour megamerger awaits those red sox fans at coors field yelling for the team brass to re sign mr lowell they also chanted "dont sign a rod " more on this in days and weeks to come but for now heres mike vaccaro of the new york post who recalls a rods assurances upon arriving in new york three years ago that hed just be one player among "as we came to know quickly and as we learn right to the bitter end it was always all about a rod is always about a rod " he writes adding "dont blame boras for this a rod had to know how malodorous the timing of this is if he cared he sure didnt do anything about it " the world series finale has squeezed the nfl off the page today sorry football fans the rest of the winter is yours so the fix will quickly stop in for the muddy slog in london between the new york giants and the miami dolphins which was excellent if you wanted to emphasize the common ancestry of football and rugby but pretty painful to watch otherwise in the guardian tom lutz chronicles the game and the day quite entertainingly particularly when it comes to the nfls success at revving up a normally subdued english crowd "the whole thing is just so damned professional the cheerleaders are uniformly six feet tall with thousands of dollars worth of dentistry blazing out of their mouths and when the music pounds out of the speakers the bass is powerful enough to send shivers down the spine " and some things about american football do translate as mr lutzs scouting report of the dolphins makes plain "some dolphins fans have complained that theyve been deprived of a home game but judging by their teams inept performance the nfl has done them a favour " tip of the fix cap to reader don hartline found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and
