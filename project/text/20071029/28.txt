environment a special report what price green for many americans pretty much any price is too high many americans think global warming is a serious concern but dont ask them to make personal sacrifices to help fight it public attitudes toward global warming have changed dramatically in the last decade due in part to the increased attention being given to the issue a wall street journal nbc news poll of adults conducted earlier this year by the organizations of democratic pollster peter hart and bill mcinturff his republican counterpart found that of respondents said global warming was a serious problem and immediate action was necessary up from last year and in an abc news washington post stanford university poll released in april shows that of americans surveyed said they are willing to make changes in their lives to help the environment but apparently they are willing to make changes only if it doesnt affect them too much when the abc news poll asked if theyd be willing to alter their lifestyle if it meant personal inconvenience only of respondents said they were very willing to make such a sacrifice and just said they were doing "a great deal" to reduce their energy consumption it can be difficult to compare current levels of individual activism to previous years as several polling organizations say they only recently started asking about consumer habits some things like recycling have been popular for years a march gallup poll of adults shows that the percentage of those who voluntarily recycle newspapers glass aluminum motor oil or other items has stayed relatively the same in compared with in and in the percentage of people who buy products specifically because they think they are better for the environment than competing products declined just slightly to this year from in and in but there are signs of more movement elsewhere according to the gallup poll more people said they have been active in environmental groups and are voting for candidates based on environmental issues in the latest poll said they have been active in a group or organization that works to protect the environment up from in the percentage of people who said they voted or worked for candidates because of their positions on environmental issues rose to this year from in americans think they should be environmentally conscientious in their day to day lifestyles within certain limits a majority of americans surveyed in the gallup poll said they personally should be using fluorescent light bulbs and installing solar panels to produce energy for their homes most people also said they should be riding mass transit buying more efficient hybrid cars and spending thousands of dollars on making their homes as energy efficient as possible a majority said they wouldnt support construction of a nuclear energy plant within miles of their homes still environmental experts say intentions dont necessarily translate into action "it reminds me of the joke of how many therapists does it take to change a light bulb just one but only if it really wants to change " says paul bledsoe spokesman for the bipartisan national commission on energy policy based in washington d c whats more consumers may hesitate before spending money "i think people are interested in green products and feel that they should be buying them " says gregg easterbrook a fellow at the brookings institution who has written about climate change "but then we all feel that we should lose weight exercise more and read more and we dont do those things either " mr easterbrook believes many people may be driven to buy products that are better for the environment because its trendy federal policies to combat global warming would draw majority support if they arent too costly according to a survey of adults conducted this year by stanford university new scientist magazine and resources for the future a nonpartisan environment and energy think tank in washington d c the poll tested the attractiveness of three options federal mandates telling companies exactly what they must do to reduce emissions a government imposed tax on greenhouse gas emissions and a cap and trade scheme where the government requires emissions cuts and issues companies permits allowing them to emit a certain quantity of greenhouse gases companies that dont use all their permits can sell them respondents were told how each option would affect the cost of vehicle fuel and electricity prices in the poll found much more support for policies that would affect electricity prices because the resulting price increases were lower than those in the cost of vehicle fuel seventy five percent of the people surveyed said they would support a federal mandate even if their electricity bills would rise to &# a month from &# said they would support a mandate if their bills increased to &# a month said they would support a mandate if their bills jumped to &# a month overall the percentage of respondents who said they supported a federal mandate was much higher than the percentages expressing support for an emissions tax or a cap and trade scheme another poll indicates that both americans and residents of other nations would support action at the federal level according to a bbc poll of people in countries released in september majorities in the u s and other countries now believe that human activity causes global warming and that big steps need to be taken the poll was conducted by international polling firm globescan with the program on international policy attitudes at the university of maryland in college park md "theres a widespread sense of urgency that steps need to be taken right away and significant steps too " says steven kull director of the program on international policy attitudes "theres more readiness on the part of the public to take action than governments have drawn on " however u s attitudes are behind those in many other countries that were surveyed for instance of americans surveyed said human activity is a significant cause of climate change compared with of respondents in spain in italy in france in south korea and in china but mr kull says events such as former vice president al gores receiving the nobel peace prize and recent reports by the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change that show with more certainty that global warming is occurring are causing public perception to change its "definitely shifting " he says ms athavaley is a staff reporter in the wall street
