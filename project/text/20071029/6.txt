a killing in siberia injures russias green irkutsk russia marina rikhvanova is a mother of russias green movement last year she led thousands of protesters into the streets of this siberian city against an oil pipeline that would have skirted the pristine waters of lake baikal afterwards president vladimir putin scrubbed the plan this spring ms rikhvanova put together new rallies against kremlin plans to turn the irkutsk region into a center for processing nuclear fuel she helped protesters plan a tent bivouac near the fuel plant and printed leaflets for campers to hand out to locals warning of the dangers of radioactive leakage one morning in late july she got a phone call telling her the campers had been attacked in their sleep by masked men armed with metal pipes and wooden clubs one camper was beaten to death what happened afterwards has shaken the environmental community and ms rikhvanovas role as its leader authorities arrested her year old son who confessed to a role in the attack ms rikhvanovas defenders say she was set up by russias security services who they say lured her son a sometime security guard who had recently fallen in with nationalist skinheads into the attack on the campers authorities dismiss that charge as absurd and say the year old ms rikhvanova should have spent more time with her family in any case the incident has diminished the stature of one of russias most influential environmental leaders until now ms rikhvanovas group in siberia was able to pull together scientists ecologists and common folk into a populist groundswell that forced the government to pay attention her agenda of unspoiled air and water was seen as transcending politics in the increasingly authoritarian era of president putin she and other environmentalists have comprised one of the few respected alternative voices to the kremlin on public policy now some erstwhile allies are keeping their distance "the attack and the arrest afterwards have been a tremendous blow to the environmental movement and divided it like never before " said mikhail kulekhov a local journalist who had worked with ms rikhvanova previously but now has backed off "we all now have to think closely about whom we work with " after the fall of the soviet union in russias green movement had a strong footing in irkutsk because of lake baikal a million year old russian national treasure known to locals as the sacred sea the lake is miles long and more than a mile deep and holds nearly a quarter of the worlds unfrozen fresh water and an abundance of unique animal life ms rikhvanova studied biology in irkutsk under the soviet system she said "because i didnt have to lie in the sciences " she married a fellow biologist and wrote a thesis on the effects of effluent being dumped into the lake by a soviet built pulp and paper plant the group she co founded baikal ecological wave started as a kind of tea society but quickly gathered strength and members in the early s baikal wave began collecting grants from the likes of the u s agency for international development and germanys green party bought its own headquarters and started a newsletter soon the group was locking horns with the federal government and moscows newly minted energy barons ms rikhvanova probed the work of a nuclear fuel enrichment plant in the nearby city of angarsk and lined up experts to testify against plans of state and newly privatized oil companies to build pipelines skirting the lake in federal agents raided baikal waves offices seized its computers and accused the group of acquiring secret maps of the nuclear enrichment plant in angarsk but the groups persistence paid off when the kremlin tried to push through a plan to build one pipeline through a seismically active area within about yards of the lake baikal wave helped organize street protests one rally in central irkutsk in march last year drew people in freezing temperatures baikal wave also organized "flash mobs" that deposited bottles of blackened water in front of administrative buildings that they labeled "baikal water" the kremlin made an about face the next month at a news conference on national television mr putin ordered the pipeline moved miles away from the lake the pipeline victory made ms rikhvanova "a messiah " said igor ogorodnikov an organizer in a leftist youth group autonomous action the american magazine conde nast traveler flew her to new york and feted her at an annual awards dinner born in just as his mothers career as an activist began to take off her son pavel had trouble as did millions of young russian men navigating the penury of post soviet russia he wanted to study business at a private institute but his parents had little money to help him ms rikhvanova and her husband made no more than &# a month between them and still lived in the same two room apartment with pavel and his sister that they had inherited in soviet times while selling books to pay for business school pavel was hit over the head by a mugger who stole the books and money he was carrying then he got out of the hospital only to be hit in october of by a car while crossing the street shattering his knee for most of last year he lay on the family couch recovering from an operation that put pins in his leg when he was able to walk again he reveled in his freedom by going to soccer matches "i didnt think there was anything wrong with it i was happy that he was happy " said his father yevgeny rikhvanov but in russia racist gangs have often congealed around soccer fan clubs pavel began coming home from games drunk his father said and "speaking in racist ways that i had never heard before " in april of this year pavel told his parents that a new friend named stepan had found him a job as a security guard working for a local businessman his parents were alarmed security firms are often closely tied to law enforcement in russia ms rikhvanova thought it strange that pavel sickly and asthmatic from childhood would be offered a job usually reserved for burly toughs she said she asked her son not to take the job fearing it would draw him into trouble but the salary about &# a month seemed enormous to him the family had to worry in part about pressure from the government because ms rikhvanova had just announced plans to oppose the nuclear fuel plant in angarsk a top secret complex in soviet times that lately had figured in kremlin plans to make russia a key player in the world energy market at a meeting of the g in st petersburg in mr putin announced russia would create an international center for processing nuclear fuel so that countries such as iran could develop civilian nuclear power without having the technology to make nuclear weapons ms rikhvanova said an official advising the local government told her that she risked her reputation by opposing the plant some of ms rikhvanovas former allies shied away from opposing expansion plans that were backed by the kremlin and would have been a big source of new jobs in the region one group that was willing to help fight the plant was autonomous action a loose coalition of mostly youths who call themselves anarchists and radical ecologists mr kulekhov the journalist calls its members troublemakers because many dub themselves "antifa" radical antifascists who have a history of clashing with racist skinheads at soccer matches ms rikhvanova defends her work with autonomous action which she said was vital to demonstrations against the pipeline last year each year the group has set up a tent camp somewhere in russia that has doubled as a sort of discussion forum on ecological issues when members said they wanted to set up the camp this year near the angarsk nuclear facility ms rikhvanova agreed to help they chose a campsite at the edge of angarsk in a public forest of mixed pines and birch trees about three miles from the nuclear plant tensions simmered from the start police officers confiscated some notebooks and music discs from early arrivals police also blamed them for spraying antinuclear graffiti on the buildings of the city administration and the pro putin political party united russia after visiting the camp a local journalist wrote a scathing article suggesting the campers were living off foreign grant money and hinted they could be "ecological spies" trying to collect information about secret nuclear installations in the area the campers held pickets in town and handed out thousands of leaflets that ms rikhvanova helped them print warning of the dangers of the plant she arranged for a physicist to visit the camp and explain the technical side of nuclear enrichment on july some officers walked into the camp and told the activists to hand over any cans of spray paint that might have linked them to the graffiti police also demanded to see the passports of people staying in the camp several campers who refused to surrender their passports were taken to the police station ms rikhvanova said she went to the police station to help them and headed home after they were released that evening campers gathered around the fire they were tired from a day of picketing but worried about a report from a local youth who said he received a text message on his mobile phone inviting him to take part in an attack on the camp that night mr ogorodnikov said the group decided that three volunteers should stay awake and stand guard one was ilya borodayenko a lanky typesetter who had arrived that afternoon by train from the far east port city of nakhodka mr borodayenko was an experienced fighter alexei sutyuga also volunteered to stay up that night and sat by the fire with the others drinking tea and talking to keep one another awake at about a m he said young men with scarves covering their faces ran into the firelight mr sutyuga said he rose to meet them but someone hit him over the head from behind with a bottle he said several men beat mr borodayenko with metal bars and he staggered away towards the woods mr ogorodnikov said he woke up to screams and opened the flap of his tent to see more than a dozen young men rampaging through the camp they slashed open tents with knives and beat those inside the attackers poured out the campers drinking water on the ground and made a bonfire with their banners leaflets and camping gear they left after about minutes he said campers found mr borodayenko near the edge of the woods unconscious and bleeding ambulances began to arrive minutes later and took him and eight others to the hospital with broken bones and bruises he died of a cracked skull shortly after dawn ms rikhvanova learned of the attack hours later her son who came home from angarsk later in the day seemed preoccupied she said he was arrested later that week while at work police arrested other men but identified only one of them ms rikhvanovas son by name ms rikhvanova says her son was assigned with the task of tearing down the anarchist flag that was flying over the encampment police said the attack stemmed from hurt feelings over a fight at a soccer game two weeks before mr sutyuga dismisses the claim and said no one from the camp had been involved in any fights most had just arrived in angarsk from different regions of russia allies have closed ranks around ms rikhvanova but they say the attack and pavels arrest have badly dented the image of irkutsks environmental movement "in russia there is a feeling that in an ordinary family children support their parents " said maksim vorontsov a member of the national bolshevik party which has worked closely with ms rikhvanova "now people are wondering why children might be attacking their parents they are saying ecologists must be abnormal " ms rikhvanova set out her own views on the attack in a letter she wrote to erstwhile allies in the ecology movement she said she later learned that the security company that hired her son called continent was owned by a top official in the union of right forces a political party that was once headed by the man who now runs russias atomic energy agency today she says she suspects that stepan and possibly her sons employer had some kind of link with the security services and that her son was lured into the attack to help ruin baikal wave igor kokourov the cigarette magnate who owns continent calls the accusation nonsense saying he never met pavel "i have too many workers here to act like a parent " he says adding that minding pavel is "her job not mine " ms rikhvanova said she communicates with her son today mainly by letters passed through his lawyer as he awaits trial in a local prison "i am sorry for what has happened i should never have gone there " he wrote to her on a sheet of graph paper last month "but i swear i never hurt anyone " he still has not explained to her how he got involved in the attack she said
