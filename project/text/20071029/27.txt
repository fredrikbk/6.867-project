environment a special report the journal report online energy blog wildfires santa anas revenge may or may not be the result of greenhouse gases but the fire ravaged residents of southern california are discovering that it pretty clearly is attributable to two other human factors lots of houses and lots of brush only recently did the the u s forest service abandon its "fire suppression" policy and begin letting underbrush burn in the thousands of regular natural fires that regularly sweep the western u s and that for centuries got rid of the deadwood that fuels massive fires last year the forest service and its local helpers like the park service cleared less brush in california especially in the high risk border between subdivisions and wilderness than they had since the fires are contributing to global warming the san francisco chronicle reports whether theyre the result of global warming is anyones guess higher temperatures longer summers and more intense droughts make trees burn hotter and for longer than they used to earlier snow melts for example have extended the fire fighting season out west by more than two months thats one reason sen dianne feinstein d calif pushed for legislation to clear the underbrush last year some environmentalists like friends of the earth president brent blackwelder are drawing a link between the california fires and global warming others see the cause more directly below their feet than in the clouds as kristina johnson of the sierra club a former firefighter in colorado and wyoming puts it "dry brush is a tinderbox " she wants action against global warming to prevent more megafires but says its "common sense" to get rid of the "brush and chaparral" that keep the flames licking online today wsj coms energy roundup collects and

chief executive says the company is using green practices in developments that include rental units in a project with the broward county housing authority and a unit project with the nonprofit camillus house in a historic building in downtown miami mr greer spoke with the wall street journal online about his strategies and the challenges of going green here are excerpts q tell me about your green building efforts what are the challenges so far a the first step is getting the development community on board and convincing them that it isnt going to cost an arm and a leg and that residents who live there are happy at the same time there are developers who have said "over my dead body " they dont like having to tackle floridas concept of what it means to be green its a disruption and inconvenience q what specifically are you doing to make your buildings green a it involves a lot of things there are people who come in and inspect the air and lighting and tune all of the settings so they are tuned for the most efficiency for example making sure the size of the air conditioning unit is suited for the size of the room were also diverting construction waste from dumps so that in can be reused ten percent of the materials we use are recycled waste we install bike racks and we petition to have bus stops moved near our properties q so how much do you estimate going green has added to your buildings costs a in terms of actual numbers we dont really know until the end of the job id say to additional costs on a &# million building which translates to maybe &# in additional incremental costs is my goal ive heard estimates of to from others if we come in on the lower end of that estimate well move forward if were on the high end were going to have to go back and rethink
