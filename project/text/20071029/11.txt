ceo search file merrill fink fleming mccann thain among possible candidates for top spot as merrill lynch &amp co s member board deliberates on who should succeed stan oneal as chief executive it will have to appease a number of unhappy yet powerful constituents shareholders employees and an influential cadre of alumni as early as today after a tumultuous weekend for the year old firm merrill is expected to announce the departure of mr oneal years old after months of upheaval that culminated with an &# billion write down of assets mostly related to mortgages a number of wall street brokerages have been stung by bad bets on the market for risky or subprime mortgages but none as badly as merrill the losses prompted calls for mr oneals resignation and yesterday afternoon merrills board was hammering out mr oneals exit package and planning a search for his successor a number of names currently under consideration are well known including laurence fink chief executive of money manager blackrock inc and gregory fleming merrills co president john thain head of nyse euronext would be a catch given his background as president of goldman sachs group inc bob mccann head of merrills huge brokerage arm is believed to have a shot to share one of the top jobs according to wall street executives the director who could end up being kingmaker is armando m codina head of the boards four person nominating and corporate governance committee that will vet potential candidates mr codina ceo of flagler development and a director since has been among the most vocal directors so far angered about how the firms fortunes turned so quickly boards tend to act swiftly when picking a new chief hoping to avoid staff departures that uncertainty often causes as well as further downward pressure on the firms stock that is something merrill doesnt need not only was its credit rating recently downgraded which could increase borrowing costs but its stock also has been falling down more than since the beginning of october although it rebounded friday in rival firm morgan stanley moved to replace then ceo philip purcell who like mr oneal was under attack by various camps who argued he had mishandled a number of key issues it took the board just two weeks to find a successor john mack mr mack met a number of the criteria merrills board needs having once been president of morgan stanley he was no stranger to the firm and as a result had a good handle on what needed to be done to right the ship he was also popular with morgan stanleys alumni network and staff by that measure mr fink appears to have a leg up over other candidates because merrill owns of blackrock he has gained insight into the workings of merrill mr fink who was considered for the top job at morgan stanley has extensive expertise in the fixed income area where merrill has stumbled and lost a number of key executives blackrock appears to have sidestepped the subprime mess central to blackrocks approach is risk control lessons that mr fink and the others drew from their experience with previous trading losses "i would not be at all disappointed if larry fink became chairman and ceo " said former top merrill ceo dan tully "he would be en excellent choice " another advantage he is friends with mr fleming who was the point person for merrill in acquiring the stake in blackrock last year if mr fink won the top spot it is likely mr fleming would stick around to work with him and the boards goal is to not lose more top executives but mr fleming who is well liked in many quarters is a contender in his own right a onetime consultant mr fleming made his name at merrill as an investment banker doing deals for financial companies such as the &# billion merger of first union corp and wachovia corp still mr fleming is just years old was just elevated to co president in early so he doesnt yet have the operational experience of running a large investment bank the head of merrills brokerage force mr mccann is also likely to figure in the new management mix because the business he leads has been successful and wasnt part of the write down problem mr mccann has the loyalty of the firms brokers and many former top executives though he doesnt have mr finks deep bond market experience mr codina and the board will also have to decide whether to split the jobs of chairman and ceo corporate governance experts widely applaud this sort of arrangement as it allows for a powerful nonexecutive voice on the board but it is unusual on wall street it was considered but vetoed by the board of goldman sachs group inc when they appointed lloyd blankfein chairman and ceo in mid and in addition to looking at the obvious candidates the board is sure to canvass wall street for seasoned executives who are skilled leaders a dream pick would be mr thain ceo of nyse euronext he is a skilled executive with experience running a big company the onetime president of goldman sachs is credited with transforming the nyse not only ushering it into the electronic age but also orchestrating a merger with a big european rival however people close to him have thrown cold water on speculation he may throw his hat in the ring for the merrill job one reason he may be holding out for a bigger job possibly the top spot at citigroup inc although it currently isnt open gary cohn and jon winkelried co president and chief operating officers of goldman sachs could be wild cards in the race goldman has managed to both navigate and profit from the recent subprime meltdown and as a result they bring a lot to the table in terms of risk know how yet they are likely years away from the top job as mr blankfein isnt expected to retire anytime soon along these lines other outside candidates for the top job could include alan schwartz president of bear stearns cos and zoe cruz co president of morgan stanley who for years oversaw morgan stanleys bond operation randall smith
