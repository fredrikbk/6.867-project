driving a hummer on tokyo streets takes a battle plan rising to the challenge is sort of fun for car buffs something big and mean tokyo when sadayoshi ishi drives his hummer he takes precautions he has installed a navigation system that shows wide open streets in green and more dangerous narrow streets in pink on a computerized map inside the truck periscopelike monitors on each side view mirror alert him to obstacles mr ishi isnt dodging land mines in a desert war zone the year old japanese cartoonist is trying to navigate tokyos urban jungle of streets too narrow for his foot wide vehicle "i broke out in a sweat every time i drove it " says mr ishi he now drives his hummer just once a week to golf games on a predetermined route mr ishi is one of a growing number of japanese who are spending more than &# for the military style h hummer mesmerized by the mammoth trucks shown in tv news coverage of the war in iraq they are determined to overcome the special problems of driving in japan the hummer is the civilian version of the u s militarys high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle or humvee made by a m general corp the south bend ind company started selling a limited number of hummers to civilians in in general motors corp bought the license to use the hummer brand and market the a m general made hummer as the &# plus h the civilian h is almost exactly the same as the humvee except for a few added features like air conditioning and a stereo system and a few that are subtracted such as fittings for attaching machine guns and grenade launchers the vehicle was trendy in the u s but as gasoline prices soared and consumer tastes shifted to smaller more fuel efficient brands demand waned last year gm stopped selling the h world wide and began pushing the more practical h model launched in and also made by a m general the h starts at &# and has a slimmer body smoother ride and more lavish interiors than the h in gm itself began manufacturing the h a scaled down version of the h about the size of a jeep cherokee that capitalizes on the hummer name and appearance and has a base price of &# last year car dealers in japan sold about hummers four times the number sold in and triple the number of ferraris sold in some japanese about last year buy their hummers directly from dealers in the u s japan makes up just a small part of gms hummer brand suvs sold last year but it is a surprising growth area american cars have typically not wowed consumers in japan except for a few niche models like the boatlike cadillac sedans and classic corvettes gm the largest u s brand here sold fewer than vehicles last year at the tokyo motor show going on now gm is showcasing a new japan only version of the h with the steering wheel on the right since japanese drive on the left side of the road the hummer appeals to drivers who are "looking for something big and mean that looks like youve got real wheels " says shiro horie editor in chief of american edge magazine a new japanese publication dedicated to american cars it was a rebellious spirit that motivated iwao makino to buy a royal blue h hummer in he had seen it on news footage of the war in iraq and heard it could wade through inches of water and survive a foot drop from an airplane the year old owner of a small business that sells computer systems knew that driving on rough terrain is a common practice among hummer owners in the u s but he found that off roading is banned in most parts of japan for environmental reasons "im just waiting for a typhoon or big disaster to hit tokyo so i can use my hummer to rescue people " says mr makino his biggest thrill now is dodging retailers street signs when driving to the grocery store and taking his dogs to the park while u s h drivers also have problems squeezing into parking garages and driving on narrow roads such problems are way worse in japan where minicars make up a third of the car market passionate owners like messrs makino and ishi exchange driving tips at the hummer owners club of japan a support group designed to help h owners care for their cars the club was co founded by tsuyoshi ishitobi one of japans early converts who bought a fire engine red hummer in in the early days the year old assistant manager at a technology firm spent his time measuring the width of the streets in his neighborhood because there is no place to park his hummer at his house and most of the streets in tokyo are so narrow mr ishitobi keeps his hummer in a garage an hour and a half away he uses a tiny suzuki miniwagon to get there on weekends "my lifestyle completely changed " mr ishitobi says in his spare time he coaches new drivers who come out to his suburban garage on how to care for their hummers and navigate narrow roads he helps them install complex machinery such as high resolution video monitors that instantly display the width of streets on a gps or global positioning system screen parking is a big concern among h owners because the h at around feet tall wont fit into most tokyo parking garages shuichi asai a year old apparel industry executive tore up his wifes garden to build a carport large enough to park his beige h when his wife protested he appeased her by buying her an ocean blue h of her own he says she had always liked his hummer but never expected such an expensive gift it costs about &# to fill up the gallon gas tank of an h in japan compared with about &# in the u s in addition japan has an environmental law that requires owners of gas guzzlers like the h to pay &# tax annually another problem since gm stopped selling the h last year spare parts are hard to find hummer club members order h parts like suspension balls and joints in bulk from lynch hummer in chesterfield mo the largest h dealer in the u s together the members spend about &# a year on parts and call lynch hummer almost daily as the h and h models proliferate in japan one looming concern for h owners is that their vehicles wont stand out as much yoshiaki matsubara a hummer club member who owns a restaurant and car museum and wears a hat decorated with a skull and crossbones owns five h hummers and says that until recently children ran after the car and waved to him as he drove by "i dont get as much attention as i used to " sighs the entrepreneur ayako nomura and naoto okamura contributed to this
