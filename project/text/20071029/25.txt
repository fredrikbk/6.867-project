environment a special report renewed effort big oil companies are joining the search for the next generation of biofuels if asked to describe the perfect renewable fuel most oil executives would say economical easy to produce on a large scale and compatible with existing pipelines in other words an environmentally friendly version of gasoline or diesel some of the worlds biggest energy companies including bp plc chevron corp conocophillips and exxon mobil corp have stepped up spending to find just that a fuel derived from plant matter or waste material but without the complications of the current crop of biofuels namely that they cant be transported or stored using existing infrastructure all four companies are among those funding university research into second generation biofuels some of them also are investing in pilot plants to produce batches of test products and at least two big oil companies chevron and marathon oil corp have invested in todays renewable fuels ethanol derived from corn or sugar and biodiesel derived from vegetable or plant oils betting it will put them in a better position to refine superior products once they are discovered the current energy transportation system "has been a hundred years and billions of dollars in the making " says rick zalesky vice president for biofuels and hydrogen at chevrons alternative energy arm it would be a significant and expensive challenge to develop both new fuels and new infrastructure to enable their wide use which is why "the ideal outcome of our research is to develop biomass based transportation fuels that have chemical properties similar to those of gasoline and diesel " he says unlike earlier forays into alternative fuels the current efforts are likely to gain momentum oil executives and analysts say concern about global warming and securing a reliable supply of energy in the u s have increased political pressure on energy giants to find oil alternatives and while oil companies profit from higher prices on fossil fuels new reserves are becoming increasingly difficult to find as global demand for oil grows biofuels are one thing that potentially could fill the gap says mr zalesky bp based in london has committed &# million over years to a biosciences energy research laboratory hosted by the university of california at berkeley and its partners the university of illinois at urbana champaign and the lawrence berkeley national laboratory bp also has started building a demonstration plant that will refine processed cereal feedstocks into biobutanol a less corrosive cousin of ethanol the company says small commercial volumes of the fuel should be available by and it hopes to eventually produce it in large quantities to be sure big oil companies investments in alternative fuels are still a tiny part of their overall investment budgets in bps case the investment in biofuels is less than of the companys annual capital expenditures which were &# billion in but philip new senior vice president of the fuels management group for bp says the contributions are significant compared with the budgets of the university departments they fund and the ventures represent a "significant amount of discretionary growth investment" for bp big oils previous investments in fuel alternatives following the oil price spikes of the s were short lived some years ago after oil imports were curtailed by a mideast embargo three major energy companies chevron texaco corp and ashland inc began producing corn based ethanol to add to gasoline at the time u s regulators were pushing for unleaded gasoline and removing lead from an already dwindling supply of gasoline meant a shortage for companies like texaco with large investments in saudi arabia but when the embargo was lifted and oil prices fell ethanol became expensive by comparison and the plants eventually folded or were sold "this time we think these high oil prices are here to stay " says ron oster a st louis based analyst with broadpoint capital inc that will add stability to the current investments oil companies are making he says a biofuel without the drawbacks of ethanol and biodiesel would be a better economic bet for big oil critics of corn based ethanol small amounts of which are blended in gasoline in certain regions worry that because the corn supply is limited soaring demand from refineries could lead to shortages that would drive up prices of both food and the fuel to unacceptable levels ethanol and biodiesel cant be transported through pipelines that carry gasoline and diesel because they leach water and other contaminants that would render them unusable ethanol and biodiesel also get lower mileage per gallon than conventional gasoline and diesel and their corrosive effects have led some auto and truck manufacturers to shy away from offering warranties to drivers who use gasoline blended with high percentages of ethanol or diesel blended with high quantities of biodiesel big oils engineers are working to overcome these shortcomings chevrons mr zalesky says a fuel made from feedstocks such as cornstalks grasses and other nonfood products would reduce reliance on corn a host of plants such as jatropha switchgrass and even algae could be used he says the fuel would get better mileage per gallon than the current alternatives and might even flow through existing pipelines chevron has an interest in a biodiesel facility in galveston texas the plant is dwarfed by the megarefineries of nearby houston and texas city which on average each produce times the volume of the biodiesel plant but mr zalesky says the small venture allows chevron to better gauge the nascent industry and prepare for expansion once second generation fuels emerge conocophillips of houston meanwhile has paired with tyson foods inc to produce renewable diesel at its refinery in borger texas renewable diesel shares properties of conventional diesel fuel but is derived from feedstocks such as food waste rather than oil a second venture announced in late september unites conocophillips with agribusiness giant archer daniels midland co to research and commercialize means for developing renewable transportation fuels from biomass or farm waste royal dutch shell plc has two separate joint ventures one in germany and one in canada aimed at producing ethanol from noncorn sources marathon oil also of houston has secured a toehold in corn based ethanol production investing in a joint venture with grain processor andersons inc the oil companys midwestern refining base in the heart of corn country makes it a good candidate for blending the corn based fuel with gasoline still the company says it expects to be able to retrofit its plant to develop fuel from feedstocks other than corn when new technologies emerge while exxonmobil has supported research at stanford university it hasnt embraced biofuels as much as its peers instead favoring research on hydrogen cell vehicles and other technologies exxonmobils chairman rex tillerson has suggested that viable biofuels are still far out on the horizon
