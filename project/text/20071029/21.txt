environment a special report embracing the change the chief executive of ppg industries says its time for business to take the lead on environmental issues as chief executive of ppg industries inc a leading global producer of specialty chemicals industrial coatings paint and glass charles e bunch is an unlikely environmentalist but mr bunch says a clear consensus has emerged in society that global warming is a serious problem and that u s business needs to get in front of the issue he argues that the u s is behind the rest of the world in developing alternative energy sources such as solar and wind he frets that soaring fuel bills are making domestic manufacturing less competitive in global markets and he warns colleagues that if businesses dont act they risk getting run over by a wave of poorly conceived state and local regulations mr bunch years old is also chairman of the national association of manufacturers or nam and says manufacturers of all types have woken up to these issues for ppg a year old company that is about as basic as basic industry gets the issue boils down to hard goals such as an initiative crafted under mr bunchs leadership that calls for cutting ppgs greenhouse gas emissions by a year per ton of manufacturing output across the board here are excerpts of a recent interview which took place in his glass walled office overlooking downtown pittsburgh the wall street journal why are companies like ppg getting more active on environmental issues mr bunch some of it is tied to dislocations in the global economy on the availability of energy supplies take the case of natural gas with a lack of a comprehensive energy strategy the regulatory environment has really discouraged any development of alternative sources of power so most of the new electrical generation over the last years has come from natural gas what has developed now is that you have more users competing for natural gas supplies which historically have been the purview of primarily industrial companies at the same time weve capped or limited the supply of new developments of natural gas weve had restrictions passed for new exploration in the gulf of mexico or in the coastal areas or in alaska today weve taken what had been an advantage for an industrial company like ppg our use of natural gas and now were paying higher prices for natural gas here in the u s than the chinese are paying or the russians or the europeans who all have access to cheaper russian gas this is why energy is a real competitive issue for us wsj what about alternative energy sources like solar and wind mr bunch the u s is far behind europe and the rest of the world in developing a good wind power industry same thing with solar we need to open up the supply not only of things like natural gas but also increase the supply of environmentally friendly technologies like solar wind and nuclear that dont create greenhouse gas effects but we havent been able to build the consensus or a coalition to develop these alternative fuels today of frances electrical supply comes from nuclear power we havent built a nuclear plant in this country in what more than years wsj whats the holdup mr bunch you have guys like ted kennedy who sit down there in washington and rail against a lot of u s industry but hes the last guy who wants wind turbines in his backyard in massachusetts wsj how much of a factor is this in the exodus of manufacturing jobs from the u s is the high cost of power prompting some companies to flee mr bunch i would say that energy for the most part up until now has not been the primary driver if you look at the industries that have left the textiles the toy industry or furniture these are industries that have been more labor intensive and clearly countries like china and other parts of the emerging world have much lower labor costs but now for the first time you are seeing companies like alcoa closing facilities here and they are going to trinidad iceland or other parts of the world i think alcoa like a lot of other high energy users had access to natural gas and lower cost energy and thats no longer available here wsj so are manufacturers like ppg mainly concerned about getting energy or are you truly concerned about climate change mr bunch these issues have come together this has also coincided with the development of china and india and others where theres been an increased demand in raw materials and energy supplies weve also had the iraq war would we be in iraq today without the oil element im not sure but it certainly points to the fact that all of these issues of the last five years have coalesced so that not only me as an individual but as company leader nam and others have said "hey fine we have a growing problem but we need to approach it from a holistic view " one of the problems we have is that in washington today its hard to have that dialogue its not viewed as an emergency and whats worse for us as an industry or as nam or as ppg is that you now have a lot of other initiatives both at the sate and local level so you have the state of california developing their own environmental regulations or the city of new york because in some cases its easier to develop this kind of consensus and theres more leadership and less of a logjam in state and local governments what we dont want as an industry is to have to deal with different policies or hundreds of different policies of cities or states or regions wsj are you optimistic some sort of national consensus is achievable mr bunch do the economics of supply and demand give us more of a spur today than there was in the past certainly all of us as consumers see this in our heating bills or in our electricity bills and to me we are all seeing the same thing i think that today with &# gas we have a better shot at coming up with a consensus that something needs to be done than we have in the past wsj so what kind of targets does ppg have for reducing its own greenhouse gas emissions mr bunch we have a target for energy productivity gains of per year thats an improvement on a per ton basis of our use of energy we call it an energy productivity measurement wsj have you managed to achieve your targets mr bunch yes and weve been exceeding them weve had a target started in to reduce greenhouse gases by by when we did the calculations for we had already achieved our target and so now were developing our next target for mr aeppel is deputy chief of the wall street journals pittsburgh bureau he can be reached at tim aeppel wsj com
