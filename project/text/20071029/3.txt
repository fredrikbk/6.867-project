an insulting insinuation in response to your oct editorial "mukaseys constitution" on judge michael mukaseys nomination to be attorney general i found mr mukasey to be a very impressive and deeply grounded in the law however on the second day when he made it clear that there are powers that pertain exclusively to the president and would not succumb to the position of sen patrick leahy on wiretapping or interrogation methods he was asked if hed gotten a call the night before an insulting insinuation that hed received orders from the white house his answer that hed had dinner with his family was a gentle reminder that hes his own man who if he is confirmed will serve all three branches of government joy loth houston
