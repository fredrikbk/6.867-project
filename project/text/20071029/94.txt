the mother of all tax hikes the great philosopher waylon jennings once said "there aint no right way to do the wrong thing " congress should take this to heart when it comes to fixing the alternative minimum tax amt both republicans and democrats agree that the exploding amt is bad news for taxpayers and the economy and its growing burden creates a political constituency for tax reform this is especially true in high tax blue states like california and connecticut where a growing number of democrats have a serious amt problem thats a bit of irony since the amt was their scheme to raise taxes on a handful of "super wealthy" by creating a parallel tax system because the amt was not indexed to inflation then this year it will raise taxes for million americans unless congress acts quickly thats the leverage house ways and means chairman charlie rangel d n y wants to use to force a sweeping tax increase and income redistribution plan through congress the legislation is misleadingly titled the "tax reduction and reform act of " its informal moniker "the mother of all tax reform " gives us a better sense of the profound impact it will have on american taxpayers and the economy mr rangels bill starts simply enough with a one year extension of amt relief provisions however the democrats have sown the seeds for additional taxes with their "paygo" rules which require all tax cuts to be offset by revenue increases elsewhere for a temporary &# billion amt fix mr rangel has targeted one of the more productive and dynamic sectors of our economy the financial services industry with several new provisions that will increase taxes including higher taxes on so called "carried interest " which will affect hedge funds and possibly other partnerships beyond this years temporary amt patch mr rangels bill would permanently end the amt in thats a good idea but the static price tag for this "relief" is where the trouble starts mr rangels bill increases tax rates by on individuals earning above &# and couples earning over &# this increase will come on top of the rollback of the and bush tax cuts the combined result americas top income tax rate will skyrocket from the current rate to a top rate of lets be clear thats a tax hike so much for low tax america and high tax europe this would put the nations top rates among the highest of all developed nations this is an especially heavy burden for american farmers and small businessmen who pay taxes as individuals according to an oct memo from ways and means committee ranking member jim mccrery r la the net result will be the biggest tax increase in u s history totaling &# trillion in higher taxes over the next years mr rangel does shuffle the corporate tax code dropping the top rate to from the current its rather refreshing to see that he recognizes that americas corporate tax rate is too high and hurts our competitiveness but this glimmer of progress is swamped by the plans range of new taxes on capital investment and punitive measures towards american companies that operate globally contrary to its deceptive name mr rangels bill is not tax relief but a breathtaking tax increase and it is not tax reform but just another round of new complexity layered on top of the existing tax code with tweaked provisions changed definitions and redistributed income to favored groups through carefully crafted new subsections compliance with the page tax code costs americans seven billion man hours and over &# billion in fees to accountants and consultants all before a single check is cut to the government while the amt may be repealed by this bill the inefficiencies and burdens that keep washington lobbyists employed full time remain thankfully theres an alternative to mr rangels redistributive approach and its being offered by a group of pro growth tax reformers in the house of representatives "the taxpayer choice act " is being offered by reps paul ryan r wis michele bachmann r minn jeb hensarling r texas and john campbell r calif that repeals the amt while fundamentally reforming the tax code these young republican legislative entrepreneurs offer taxpayers the choice of remaining in the current system with its itemized deductions charts and schedules or moving into a greatly simplified system that eliminates all deductions and loopholes while offering only two simple rates all taxpayers would have a standard individual deduction of &# and individuals earning below &# would pay a flat of income while individuals earning above that would pay calculating taxes would take less time than brewing a pot of coffee last year i observed on this page that on fiscal policy voters could not see a dimes worth of difference between the two political parties how things have changed mr rangels mother of all tax increases is another of the same tired "tax the rich" revenue raising schemes of past democratic congresses it focuses on redistributing income through the tax code at the expense of economic growth and tax simplicity such tax schemes have a high political demagogy coefficient that can temporarily satisfy liberal constituencies but they always backfire in practice in the early s i remember watching sen george mitchell sing the praises of a new luxury tax that would "tax the rich " but as any economics student might have predicted the immediate effect of this luxury tax was a sharp decline in sales of "luxuries " particularly new boats and a dramatic loss of boat related manufacturing and service jobs it was less than a year before sen mitchell was working to lift the tax so his constituents in boatyards in maine could get back to work the taxpayer choice act on the other hand is based on the belief that the only legitimate purpose of the tax code is to raise the revenue necessary to fund the legitimate expense of government it is not a place for social engineering or rewarding favored political constituencies it treats taxpayers with dignity and moves us in the direction of eliminating double taxation which encourages capital formation savings and investment i have long advocated a tax code that is simple fair flat and honest income should be taxed once and only once thereby promoting economic growth through increased savings and investment sadly mr rangels democratic vision for tax policy takes giant steps away from that ideal republicans have a competing vision that offers taxpayers an escape from both the amt and many of the heavy compliance costs of todays tax code this small step may still be too big for the income redistributors in our nations capital until american citizens beat washington bureaucrats and special interests taxpayers will remain trapped in a tax code built by and for special interests finally at least they have a choice between two fundamentally different visions lets hope the taxpayer wins this debate mr armey republican majority leader of the u s house of representatives from to is chairman of freedomworks foundation see related letter "letters to the editor an excellent suggestion concerning tax reform" wsj nov
