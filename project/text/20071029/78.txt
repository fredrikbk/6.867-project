politics &amp economics linking terror on the trail republicans point to islam democrats take different tone a divide is emerging on the presidential campaign trail over battling terrorists how exactly to label the fight while democrats tend to talk about terrorism in general republicans increasingly pin the threat directly on islam all the major republican candidates regularly weave some form of the phrase "islamic extremism" into their stump speeches former massachusetts gov mitt romney has taken the rhetoric to a new level running a television advertisement about "this centurys nightmare jihadism " democratic candidates generally dont emphasize linking islam and terrorism sen hillary rodham clinton talks more of "global terrorism " while sen barack obama refers to "stateless terrorism " "in four democratic debates not a single democratic candidate said the word islamic terrorism " former new york mayor rudy giuliani said at a republican debate "now that is taking a political correctness to extremes " those who like the republican candidates choice of language say it reflects the reality of who threatens america the most "everybody ought to call an ace an ace " says jim gorsh a year old retiree who heard mr romney speak in clinton iowa earlier this month others including some arab american groups say the constant references to islamic terrorists even if meant to refer only to a single radical strand of islam may end up tarring the entire religion after a group of conservative academics declared last week "islamo fascism awareness week " david halperin a senior vice president at the democratic leaning think tank center for american progress criticized the effort "to continue to harp on the idea that islamo fascism is the source of terrorism is to suggest that all muslims are terrorists " mr halperin said the republican tone might alienate arab american voters says james zogby founder and president of the arab american institute a washington based advocacy group there are about million arab americans in the u s according to dr zogby and they make up as much as of the electorate in one key state michigan "people are quite startled and frightened" by the republican phraseology he said mr romney whose father george romney was a michigan governor says his rhetoric is designed to win over muslims not offend them "in the end only muslims themselves can defeat the violent radicals " he says in "strategy for a stronger america " a pamphlet describing his proposed policies "but we must work with them " mr romneys invocation of the word "jihad" is a source of controversy "jihad" is an arabic word found in the quran that roughly translates to mean "struggle " what that struggle is or how it should be carried out is less clear terrorists including osama bin laden use it to refer to holy war or religious struggles to purify islam many muslims prefer a more peaceful definition representing a quest for self betterment "there are insurgents and radical islamists who use the word to describe what they are doing " said gary sick an adjunct professor at columbia universitys school of international and public affairs who served on the national security council under presidents ford carter and reagan "but they are a teeny minority compared with muslims in the world who dont see it that way " while several republican candidates including former arkansas gov mike huckabee and former tennessee sen fred thompson have used the word "jihad" in debates mr romney is the most consistent user for the past two weeks a romney television advertisement titled "jihad" has aired in iowa with a backdrop of fall leaves and a soundtrack of a trumpet mr romney warns "their goal is to unite the world under a single jihadist caliphate " he also incorporates the word into his town hall style events to a group in sparks nev earlier this month he said "there are so many factors impinging on our world right now and particularly our country the threat of radical violent jihad is one of them " the next day to a crowd in grand rapids mich he said "we face jihad " and described it as "a military threat unlike anything weve known before " the word serves as an attention grabber with many audience members henry eldridge the past chairman of the york county republican party in south carolina heard mr romney refer to jihad at a campaign event "when somebody says that theyre going to destroy israel and wipe the united states off the face of the earth i dont have any question in my mind what that means " mr eldridge said "they call that jihad " the interpretation of jihad as extremist and violent disturbs nihad awad executive director of the washington based council on american islamic relations he says mr romneys use of "jihad" legitimizes claims by terrorists that they are fighting on behalf of islam democratic presidential candidates rarely invoke islam when discussing terrorism in a word speech titled "a new strategy against terrorism " former sen john edwards used the word "islamic" once he did so in that instance to say republicans were making a mistake by using rhetoric that could frame the battle against terrorists as a war of civilizations see related letter "letters to the editor not in islams name " wsj november
