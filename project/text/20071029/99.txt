to find a ceo for hilton blackstone raids a rival blackstone group lp is expected to announce today that it has lured christopher nassetta the chief executive of a lodging industry rival to lead recently acquired hilton hotels corp as it pursues an ambitious growth strategy and plans to boost the hoteliers standing in the luxury market mr nassetta years old will leave his position as chief executive of host hotels &amp resorts inc the nations largest publicly traded hotel owner and become president and chief executive of hilton after a four to six week transition period in plucking mr nassetta from host hilton gets a manager with a strong track record in real estate hotel ownership and finance as hilton is rapidly expanding some hotel rooms under construction in the u s alone will eventually carry a hilton flag and an additional rooms are in the development phase the announcement which comes less than a week after blackstone finalized its &# billion acquisition of los angeles based hilton quells doubts about the private equity giants vow to keep hiltons assets in tact that contrasts with some of blackstones recent large real estate acquisitions particularly the &# billion equity office properties trust purchase in february in which most of the companys assets were quickly carved up and sold "if they were planning to break this thing up i wouldnt be sitting here " mr nassetta said friday in the park avenue office of jonathan gray senior managing director of blackstone at host mr nassetta ran a real estate investment trust that was primarily in the business of owning the buildings that house hotels at the larger higher profile hilton he will run a private company that mainly franchises or operates them he will be asked to marry hiltons many lines which include the flagship hilton chain as well as embassy suites doubletree and hampton inn with many of blackstones own hotels hilton franchises or manages about rooms world wide but owns only about of those blackstone with a smaller footprint owns about hotel rooms in the u s and europe and franchises an additional rooms blackstone is unlikely to put the hotels that it acquired from laquinta corp in into the hilton system mr nassetta will also be charged with building the luxury lines of hilton some of blackstones marquee properties including the boca raton resort &amp club in boca raton fla and the el conquistador in fajardo puerto rico likely will be folded into hiltons waldorf astoria collection that line includes the flagship new york hotel but also a handful of landmark properties that retained their historic names such as the arizona biltmore in phoenix blackstone also said it intends to add a division of intimate luxurious boutique hotels to hilton while mr gray declined to discuss specific plans about future acquisitions he said that blackstone will likely pursue more deals to expand the hilton portfolio even at a time in which the number of leveraged buyouts has dropped off sharply because of turmoil in the debt markets blackstones real estate arm would most likely buy additional hotel properties that then would be put into the hilton system "i would be shocked if this is the last thing we would do on the lodging side " says mr gray the strategy isnt without risk hotel construction has been rising and some analysts have questioned whether too many hotels are in the pipeline and breaking into the crowded luxury market could prove challenging as major competitors like four seasons and ritz carlton are already well established in the segment and newcomers have announced a slew of up market projects nonetheless the supply of new hotel rooms opening this year and in isnt as sizable a percentage of available rooms as in past years when hoteliers found themselves in trouble says will marks an analyst with san francisco based jmp securities moreover mr nassetta points out that construction costs and the difficulty of getting loans approved right now could constrain new construction more of an unknown is whether the credit crunch and the home mortgage crisis could wound the economy to the point that hotel revenues begin to be hurt "if the economy becomes weak no matter what the case is with new supply we will see lower than expected top line growth " says mr marks blackstone closed the hilton deal wednesday for &# a share amid a lull in the leveraged buyout frenzy that had taken private dozens of publicly traded real estate companies particularly in the office and hotel sectors unlike some other deals that were announced over the summer that either fell apart completely or had the debt structures changed blackstones acquisition involving seven banks marched through fairly smoothly one reason for this says mr gray was the strength of hiltons business itself as well as the fact that blackstone put in roughly &# billion the largest equity sum the firm has ever contributed shareholders of host hotels formerly known as host marriott corp will likely be disappointed with the announcement as mr nassetta was instrumental in the companys growth in january a survey of portfolio managers and analysts in the trade publication institutional investor named mr nassetta the best chief executive among all reits through a spokesman host executives declined to comment on their plans for the chief executive vacancy mr gray and john schreiber co founder of blackstones real estate business have known mr nassetta for years since they were trying to buy distressed real estate loans at the bottom of the cycle in the early s though they didnt end up doing a deal together blackstones relationship grew in when blackstone sold a group of luxury hotels to host marriott for &# billion and blackstone became the companys largest shareholder but in choosing a friend and confidant mr gray passed over the man hilton was grooming to take over the reins before blackstone came knocking this past summer mr gray credited matthew hart hiltons former president and chief operating officer with helping to guide the company to its current phase of growth and profit and has offered him a position as an adviser to the company and a seat on hiltons board mr hart accepted those positions a company spokesman said mr hart couldnt be reached for comment yesterday in moving to hilton mr nassetta switches sides from hotel owner to hotel operator and manager like many major hotel companies hilton has focused on managing and franchising hotels as opposed to owning them in recent years hotel companies like starwood hotels &amp resorts worldwide inc marriott international inc and hilton have sold their properties to outside owners investors families or large reits such as host but continued to manage and brand the properties through multidecade contracts that strategy provided these hotel companies with huge cash infusions and helped inoculate them from steep downturns in the real estate industry and costs of maintaining properties while allowing them to continue to profit from long term management contracts yet relationships between owners and management companies can sometimes be fraught with tension over management fees profit expectations services and maintenance issues "chris understands what it means to be an owner what owners want and how they think and some of the frustrations they have chris is completely focused on meeting their needs " mr gray said both mr gray and mr nassetta want to see hilton brands expand in other countries last year hilton reunited with its foreign arm hilton international clearing the way for a surge in overseas growth for the hotel company like many of its competitors hilton will likely look to expand in russia china and india mr nassetta added that the international opportunities are still in their infancy he points out that only about of hiltons rooms in development are in foreign countries "the reason im here is that i think this is a great company with a great foundation and platform to have some phenomenal growth generally but particularly in the international arena its an opportunity to take a company thats already in good shape and make it the pre eminent global lodging company in the world " mr nassetta said
