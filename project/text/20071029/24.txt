environment a special report new priorities for some job seekers oil companies are out alternative energy start ups are the place to be in the s and s the oil business enjoyed the pick of the crop of graduates at top schools the booming business offered young engineers foreign travel interesting projects and great pay then came the oil crash of the s and wrenching industry consolidation sapping much of the industrys allure now todays top graduates are flocking to a new energy boom that of the start ups producing wind power biofuels solar power and geothermal energy "in many ways they see it as more attractive " says chris ross houston based vice president of business consultancy cra international for some young people theres no comparison in terms of which field captures their imaginations "oil has been around for a long time and if you pay attention to the news oil is seen as if anything evil not something to do research in " says scott horton one of three high school seniors from oak ridge tenn who won the elite siemens foundation prize for scientific research this year their project identified genetic material in tiny organisms that could predispose these bacteria and fungi to develop ethanol from sources other than corn and sugar mr horton and other students are flocking to these types of clean energy projects renewable fuels and energy require similar high level engineering skills but bring a sense of fulfillment thats absent from the oil industry says james whaley president of the siemens foundation in iselin n j over the past five years the foundations science competition has received myriad entries exploring alternative energy sources but none related to fossil fuels or conventional energy projects mr whaley says in the top prize went to aaron golden of encinitas calif who is now patenting the design of his winning project a system for harnessing ocean wave energy "this generation of scientists wants to do things to make the world better mr whaley says "they really do have that feeling when i talk to them " students interest also reflects the appeal of increased government funding for alternative energy research says scott molony one of mr hortons teammates a growing swath of alternative energy companies are quickly snapping up qualified applicants as they graduate from college such companies range from agribusiness giant and ethanol leader archer daniels midland co to the fleet of newly public companies like verasun energy corp a biofuel company in brookings s d and rentech inc a los angeles based company that produces technology aimed at converting substances such as organic material and animal waste into alternative fuels and clean chemicals as more small companies join the industry and venture capital backed projects reach commercial volumes the demand on manpower will multiply rapidly says joseph stanislaw a founder of cambridge energy research associates in cambridge mass government support and venture capital pouring into new projects will spur hiring and make the field more attractive to young engineers says mr stanislaw now a boston based consultant to deloitte &amp touche usa llp the renewable energy industry already has been growing rapidly in recent years and annual growth or more in the size and number of companies can be expected for years to come in certain corners especially in areas like offshore wind energy which has been virtually untapped in the u s mr stanislaw says start ups in alternative energy say their recruiting efforts are helped by a mix of idealism environmentalism and nationalism among both students and oil industry engineers in the past months rentech a company of some employees has seen its work force increase tenfold an acquisition quintupled its work force in april and it has since doubled that size with new hires says richard wesolowski the companys vice president of human resources the publicly traded company is minuscule by oil industry standards but rentech and alternative energy companies attract employees seeking a start up opportunity the ability to produce new technology or the potential to have an impact on national energy security mr wesolowski says "if theyre comparing an offer from one of the larger companies that has been around for or years one of those motivators is going to have to kick in " says mr wesolowski "otherwise theyll go to the other place " so far the company has hired experienced engineers but when he recruits at colleges and universities for the first time this year mr wesolowski says "were going to appeal to folks who want a bit more risk taking and are less structured in terms of the way they want to work " work forces at alternative energy companies have low turnover rates says kim regenhard vice president of human resources for u s bioenergy corp a st paul minn ethanol producer like her peers at other alternative energy companies ms regenhard sees a crop of employees who are driven by an interest in clean energy with as many as applicants for every jobs in locations across the midwest the company has had its pick of qualified professionals she says the employees are excited about the opportunities at the company and are likely to stay ms regenhard adds "people are looking for an opportunity where they have causes they believe in not just a job " as desirable workers are increasingly drawn to alternative energy and biofuels companies some old line energy companies say theyre feeling the pinch in an already tight labor market the squeeze could be costly according to james hertlein a houston based managing director of boyden global executive search to retain employees oil and natural gas exploration and production companies will likely spend an extra &# billion annually and miss out on &# billion to &# billion in profits due to lack of experienced staff mr hertlein estimates strategic opportunities will be lost as well he says mr hertlein based his projections on data from u s department of labor society of petroleum engineers and university studies images of a dwindling pool of engineers are projected at nearly every energy conference at a poorly attended presentation recently in houston the moderator quipped that the conferences participants might have all turned and retired that morning the joke wasnt entirely off the mark in the ethanol field companies say their employees average age is around far below that of conventional fuel producers whose employees often average or more years in the business a mere of the work force in conventional oil is under says mr hertlein
