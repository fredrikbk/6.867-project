theory &amp practice when rebuilding confidence becomes the priority airbus had to open up to ease customer fears after jets were delayed airplane manufacturers airbus and boeing co must do more than build new jets these days they also need to regain the confidence of their customers both companies suffer from credibility problems with customers because of production delays for their newest planes airbuss superjumbo a completed its first commercial flight thursday almost two years behind its initial schedule a major step in rebuilding confidence now boeing has delayed by six months delivery of its first dreamliner jets when mario heinen took charge of building the a in september the &# billion project was already a year late wiring snafus soon forced airbus to double the delay to two years customers who had planned schedules and marketing around the plane were furious carriers and leasing companies said they were losing faith in the ability of airbus and parent european aeronautic defence &amp space co to deliver on their promises "our credibility was probably zero " recalls mr heinen an eight year airbus veteran who previously worked in the competitive jetliner maintenance business to restore trust mr heinen years old threw open airbus factories and invited customers into planning sessions "we shared details i cant imagine other companies presenting " he says mr heinens moves demonstrate the challenge of restoring confidence after a commercial fiasco or public relations nightmare mattel inc must reassure consumers after recalling dangerous toys sony corp matsushita electric industrial co and other makers of high tech batteries for portable electronic devices have recently had a similar situation with customers ranging from nokia corp to dell inc which have been forced to recall products because of problems with power sources overheating now boeing faces a customer relations headache over its production problems last month the chicago based company said manufacturing difficulties would delay the first flight of the dreamliner by three months but it assured customers it would deliver the first plane on time in may a month later boeing pushed back the first deliveries to late november despite the delay boeing says it still plans to deliver roughly the same number of dreamliners through boeing says it is being frank with customers and working with those whose planes will be delayed but customers are warier now john plueger president and chief operating officer of american international group inc s international lease finance corp says the aircraft leasing giant will "trust but verify" boeings promises "i dont think boeing is anywhere close to being in the same situation that airbus was on the a but this delay does cause you to ratchet up a notch your healthy skepticism " airbus managers say one of their biggest mistakes was failing to catch problems as they snowballed its disclosures of long delays then took its customers by surprise airbus repeatedly assured qantas that the a was on track before announcing a delay in june says john borghetti executive general manager of australias qantas airways ltd "so it was somewhat of a shock and we expressed our disappointment quite strongly " he says as airbus managers moved to control the damage their close relations with customers both helped and complicated the situation though jet manufacturers typically communicate more directly with airlines than do mass marketers with the general public many of the broken promises such as the reassurances qantas received had been made personally by top airbus managers gary davies director of the corporate reputations institute at manchester business school in england says that personal element is vital to businesses that interact closely with customers in such fields from hotels to consulting a companys character becomes much like human character clients prefer suppliers who are straightforward and show concern for their needs prof davies says airbus customers including singapore airlines qantas and dubais emirates airline demanded details about the as problems that airbus typically considers confidential amid the crisis though mr heinen scrapped secrecy and made customers part of the solution he updated customers weekly on a work he gave them milestones against which they could judge progress like aircraft tests he quickly communicated any changes in the plan to avoid surprises "we were very vocal and to their credit airbus took measures we recommended " says singapore airlines chief executive chew choon seng emirates chief executive tim clark dispatched engineers to check on airbuss problems mr heinen allowed emirates auditors into a factories to examine half built planes quiz designers and talk to assembly workers "transparency lets customers participate in getting things done and the customer supports you more " mr heinen says such nakedness would have been useless if airbus couldnt address its underlying problems airbus had stumbled with the a managers now say because they werent honest with each other about production problems so mr heinen forced similar openness on his own staff engineers and plant managers met daily and worked to resolve all outstanding issues within hours by this spring singapore air emirates and others showed their increasing confidence by accepting discounts on purchases of additional as instead of cash as compensation for the delays last month british airways became the first new a buyer in two years ordering a dozen of the two deck planes
