biogen gets a dose of skepticism amid deal chatter critics question pipeline existing drugs can biogen idec inc help cure big pharmas ills carl icahn thinks so although the activist investor has indicated interest in buying the biotechnology concern he says shareholders could make more by selling to a large pharmaceutical company as mr icahn sees it biotechs whose drugs are made of proteins instead of simple chemicals have robust development pipelines that traditional drug companies need in an era when many of their top products will soon lose patent protection but some analysts who follow the cambridge mass company arent so sure about its pipeline they also say the companys existing products might face sales pressure because of growing competition in multiple sclerosis treatment an area it now dominates and a looming decrease in biogens share of the profits on drugs it co markets with genentech inc biogens shares took off after the company responded to the offer from mr icahn who owns roughly of the company by saying it would open the bidding to others the stock hit a week high of &# on oct the shares since slipped to &# as of friday on the nasdaq stock market as some investors have grown skeptical and the company reported weaker than expected earnings last week biogens market value has surged from &# billion a year ago to about &# billion it may well be sold for that price or higher any buyer will be getting one of the pioneers of the biotech industry with extensive expertise in manufacturing proteins and a cash generating drug avonex that is the top selling medicine for multiple sclerosis skeptics argue that while biogen may hit its forecast of about &# billion in revenue in up from an expected &# billion this year its future after that point is cloudy biogen like the big pharmaceutical companies that might be interested in buying it will face its own revenue pressure said caroline stewart of piper jaffray cos who recently downgraded the companys shares to "underperform" and says a buyout at current prices is "questionable " a biogen purchase she says "doesnt really help them " biogen says its valuation is up to those who might want to buy it investors "want to know that were not intransigent " said biogens chief executive james mullen last month near the time mr icahn first spoke with the company he added "if somebody makes an approach for the company that is significantly above what we believe we can create for the shareholders in a reasonable period of time then were going to be open to that conversation " avonex provides of biogens revenue but some analysts predict sales of the year old medicine will start to shrink soon in its just reported third quarter results biogen reported year over year growth in overall avonex sales but avonexs u s sales decreased and the company said growth overseas was due to favorable exchange rates by or rival drugs now in late stage trials from novartis ag genzyme corp and others may be on the market biogen says avonex is just one in a growing portfolio of ms drugs the companys no revenue generator rituxan which has been approved for cancer and rheumatoid arthritis is shared with genentech which helped develop it biogens share of rituxans u s profits is or &# million in the third quarter the companies are working to get rituxan approved to treat lupus and ms which could provide a boost to sales but under the agreement between the companies biogens portion of rituxan profits will shrink by a quarter to as soon as the companies launch a successor drug something analysts predict will occur in or biogens share of the new drugs profits would also be biogen has launched an arbitration proceeding against genentech complaining about the "unilateral development" of follow on drugs biogens chief financial officer paul clancy says the dispute "isnt based on economics " but "decision making rights " outside the u s roche holding ag sells rituxan and pays the companies a royalty but roches obligation to pay royalties ends in for sales in most european countries by it ends everywhere tysabri biogens new ms medicine was pulled from the market in because some patients using it in clinical trials died of a rare brain infection it was reintroduced in and has grown to patients biogen has predicted that patients will be on the drug by most of whom will be outside the u s after though that growth will slow to or lower bear stearns cos s mark schoenebaum predicted in a report last week the firm has a "buy" rating on biogens stock ms stewart of piper jaffray thinks sales of the drug will stop growing altogether in as rival treatments are expected to enter the market biogen says it is confident about tysabris benefits to ms patients federal regulators are also considering whether to approve the drug to treat crohns disease which could provide additional sales tysabri which is often used as a last resort for ms patients unsatisfied with other drugs still warns of the potential for deadly brain infections on its label so far the condition hasnt appeared in other patients if it did "the investment community will run for cover " said mr mullen biogens ceo in an interview last month but "the patients are probably the most pragmatic of the whole grouping theyve already been told thats a possibility theyve already had to weigh that " analysts are also debating how to value biogens pipeline of drugs in testing for example the companys bg could be one of the first oral medications for ms but the three times a day pill faces potentially stiff competition from novartiss fty a once a day pill also in late stage tests biogen says it has drugs in midstage testing or beyond mr schoenebaum of bear stearns estimates that pipeline is worth &# a share using his assumptions or &# a share to a "motivated buyer" who accepted the companys more optimistic forecasts about sales in total mr schoenebaum thinks biogen is worth &# a share using his own forecasts to a drug company acquirer that could cut out &# million in redundant expenses mr schoenebaum thinks the "motivated buyer" would pay &# ms stewart thinks biogen is worth about &# a share without cuts based on her estimates of future revenue but she considers a much higher bid from a motivated buyer unlikely when biogen "was &# a share yeah it was cheap " she said "its not so cheap now "
