how trade talks could tame sovereign wealth funds the rise of sovereign wealth funds the trillions of dollars accumulated by governments of asian exporters and oil producers is prompting a new effort to make sure the governments dont wield the funds as financial weapons the u s treasury worried about a global backlash against cross border investment and a surge of protectionism urges a minimalist approach voluntary codes of "best practices " but even free traders are dubious because the practices cant be enforced a different concept may make more sense make the activities of the funds a new issue in global trade and negotiate a bargain between the countries that have funds and the countries where the funds invest violations of the accord could be enforced by prohibitions on future investment the issue of sovereign wealth funds dominated a recent meeting of finance ministers from the group of seven leading nations that included a dinner to which the g invited counterparts from countries with sovereign wealth funds afterward the g canada france germany italy japan the united kingdom and the u s issued a statement saying that while their economies "can benefit from openness" to wealth fund investments the international monetary fund and world bank should examine issues such as the funds structure transparency and accountability the reason for concern the funds now have between &# trillion and &# trillion to invest a kitty that could reach &# trillion within a decade at that size "they are the global financial system " says former imf chief economist kenneth rogoff some of the largest funds are owned by countries least trusted by the u s and european public china saudi arabia russia kuwait and the united arab emirates while the funds have generally bought government debt so far helping aid global stability critics believe they wont continue to act that way and they point to chinas purchase of a nearly stake in private equity firm blackstone group lp this spring as the start of a new wave securities and exchange commission chairman christopher cox even mused that government investment funds could use "the vast amounts of covert information" that their spy agencies collect making that "the ultimate inside trading tool " the treasury allergic to regulation says best practices should suffice an organizing principle should be that "investments are being driven by commercial purpose " treasury undersecretary david mccormick says the goal make the saudi sovereign wealth fund act like harvard universitys endowment not the financial equivalent of fighter jets a better model exists since world war ii the global trading system has handled red hot political disputes is japan using import barriers to dominate the worlds auto market is the u s subsidizing farmers at the expense of developing nations via detailed accords if deals are flouted penalties are assessed usually through higher tariffs something similar could be done with sovereign wealth funds "its something that is coming more trade deals involving financial markets " says mr rogoff who now teaches at harvard imagine a two step process in the first the u s europe and canada which have common interests would work out common positions on the most pressing questions should government funds be limited to minority stakes should defense media and other industries be off limits to any investment should countries whose funds invest in certain sectors say financial services be required to open those same sectors at home to foreign investment unless the u s and european union coordinate their policies says jeffrey garten a yale university professor of international trade investment funds could play one country against another to attract investment like auto makers play one state in the u s against another to get a richer package of tax cuts in a second round the governments of the funds would participate their interest maintaining the freest possible access to invest in the worlds richest markets if the countries dont reach a deal the u s and europe could impose their rules unilaterally negotiations could start with the dozen countries with the biggest funds to keep the talks manageable unlike the endlessly deadlocked doha trade talks which involve nations gary hufbauer a trade specialist at the peterson institute for international economics a washington think tank says negotiations should be held under neutral auspices to reduce the sense that the u s and europe are dictating terms he nominates the international center for settlement of investment disputes which has close links to the world bank and arbitrates investment disputes often involving developing nations none of the negotiations would be easy a decade ago the u s and europe couldnt agree on an investment treaty over less incendiary issues china and the middle east may bring up issues that would divide western nations such as whether private hedge funds should be bound by the provisions of a deal that require disclosure of financial information financial services companies in the u s and europe which stand to reap huge profits advising government funds may lobby against any restrictions but the prospect of a nationalist backlash is only likely to grow especially during a u s presidential election that may give enough impetus to the parties the choice may be either to cut a deal or have the congress and european parliaments erect barriers to open investment
