as chrysler deal is set uaw looks to ford ford motor co this week moves to the center of labor talks with the united auto workers after the union narrowly ratified a new contract with chrysler llc over the weekend in a statement the uaw said the four year chrysler contract was approved by of the production workers who voted and of the skilled tradesmen who voted passage was also helped by an overwhelming majority of the uaw represented office clerical and engineering workers who approved the pact the chrysler contract parallels a similar deal with general motors corp and allows the company to shift billions of dollars in retiree health care obligations off its books to union run trusts known as voluntary employees beneficiary associations or vebas both chrysler and gm also get two tier wage systems that enable the companies to hire new workers in certain "noncore" jobs such as materials handlers at a compensation package half that of most previous hires the auto makers hope the moves will give them enough cost savings to help them narrow the gap with asian competitors like toyota motor corp some workers objected to the two tier wage system and wanted chrysler to make firmer promises to build future vehicles in u s plants which would preserve union jobs "our members had to face some tough choices and we had a solid democratic debate about this contract " uaw president ron gettelfinger said in the statement "now were going to come together as a union and now its on the company to move ahead increase their market share and continue to build great cars and trucks here in the u s " mr gettelfinger has said a contract with ford would follow a similar pattern but ford is in deeper financial trouble than chrysler or gm and would like additional concessions from the union it is unclear how difficult negotiations with ford will be both gm and chrysler reached tentative agreements with the union following strikes but the walkouts were short and come at a time of high inventories of many vehicles and slowing sales ford and the union already have begun preliminary discussions ford posted losses of &# billion last year and has seen its sales tumble in the first nine months of this year amid a broader downturn in auto sales it is also expected to post a loss in the third quarter and analysts are beginning to question whether ford can achieve its goal of returning to profitability by in a new contract ford would push to expand the definition of what is considered a "non core" uaw job which would get less in wages and benefits than existing union jobs a person familiar with the matter says this would enable ford to push more new hires into this lower compensated designation ford and the uaw also are discussing another potential round of thousands of additional buyouts to "take care of the extra people" from the six additional plants ford plans to close another person familiar with the matter says the two sides are revisiting the fate of six unidentified plants the auto maker intends to close as part of its turnaround plan this person said the new chrysler contract covers approximately active workers at chrysler and more than chrysler retirees and surviving spouses the union said the ratification at chrysler came despite heavy opposition within the rank and file at the final plant to vote on the contract a small car assembly facility in belvidere ill on friday a majority of workers voted against the pact but the result didnt change the outcome overall
