torturing mukasey just when you thought someone might be confirmed in washington without a partisan fight senate democrats are suggesting they may not approve michael mukasey as attorney general after all the judges offense is that hes declined to declare "illegal" an interrogation technique in the war on terror that congress itself has never specifically banned last week democrats postponed a vote on his nomination and all democrats on the judiciary committee have sent judge mukasey a letter expressing alarm that he refused to repudiate "waterboarding" during his recent confirmation hearing "i dont know whats involved in the technique if waterboarding is torture torture is not constitutional " the judge had said this seems fair enough because both the justice departments legal opinions on interrogation and the specific cia practices are classified it would be irresponsible for judge mukasey to make any declarations about the law or practice until he knows the details thats not good enough for democrats who are under pressure from their antiwar left to keep pinning a phony "torture" rap on the bush administration the letter from the judiciary democrats demands that judge mukasey declare himself on the legality of "waterboarding " with the clear implication that if he gives the wrong answer his nomination wont make it out of committee these are the same democrats who had declared before he was nominated that judge mukasey was exactly the sort of "consensus" choice they welcomed the irony here is that congress has twice had the chance to ban waterboarding or simulated drowning but has twice declined to do so in both the detainee treatment act of and the military commissions act of congress only barred "cruel inhuman or degrading" treatment while some members have said they believe waterboarding is banned by that language when given the chance to say so specifically in a statute and be accountable for it they refused as usual congress wants it both ways the members want to denounce what they call "torture " but the last thing they want is to be responsible if some future detainee knows about an imminent terrorist attack but the cia cant get the information because congress barred certain kinds of interrogation so they toss their non specific language into the lap of the executive and say "you figure it out " yet they still object because the justice department has since tried to interpret that language by providing some practical specific guidelines to the cia according to several news reports the cia rarely uses waterboarding but believes it can be useful against the very hardest cases senator john mccain all but acknowledged congresss political dodge when he once said that while he deplored aggressive interrogation in extremis a president might have to approve it and in that case he added the commander in chief has the power to absolve some jack bauer type who did the dirty work at least mr mccain is honest about the realities of the war on terror in which surveillance and interrogation are two essential tools to prevent future attacks but this also passes the buck from congress to the executive and cia interrogators can be forgiven if they want more specific guidance lest they be interrogated themselves by the monday morning generals on the judiciary committee we hope mr mukasey holds fast to his earlier answer if he makes a declaration of illegality he will be doing so without all the facts and will undermine the office of legal counsel officials he may soon supervise at justice if he attempts the feint of saying that he is personally opposed to waterboarding or other aggressive techniques he may get confirmed but congress will eventually ask if hes gone on to ban these techniques which in any case is a presidential decision the judge will only be buying political trouble for himself later if democrats want a debate over specific interrogation procedures then by all means lets have it and if they want to ban waterboarding or for that matter any stressful interrogation they can try to do so but they shouldnt use a universally hailed attorney general nominee as a political pawn to appease the antiwar left even as they refuse to say what kind of interrogation they do support
