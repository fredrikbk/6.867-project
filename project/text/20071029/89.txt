software executive shifts gears to electric cars green technology craze takes hold in silicon valley but many hurdles lie ahead not long ago shai agassi was seen by others in his industry as the future of software giant sap ag where he was next in line to become chief executive all that changed when he left the company in march prompting speculation in silicon valley about how and when he might resurface today the questions will be answered in a surprising way mr agassi has raised a hefty &# million in initial funding to tackle a daunting problem how to make electric cars a viable alternative to ones powered by internal combustion engines mr agassi has no background in the auto or energy industries his palo alto calif based company has employees and no officially registered name but he has an audacious idea some may call it foolhardy to change they way electric cars are sold and maintained electric cars have two big limitations they are costly and need frequent recharges some auto makers are waiting for technology to improve so that batteries are able to power cars for longer distances say miles on a single charge mr agassi thinks he has a more immediate solution exploiting existing batteries that are smaller and can go about miles before recharging his company would try to get auto makers to build cars using such batteries making it easy to remove them from the cars then instead of making customers pay for the car and battery which drives up the cost of electric cars charge them only for the car "the thinking has been the battery is part of the car " mr agassi says "actually the battery is like the new gasoline " he says his company would buy and own the batteries it would charge consumers a monthly subscription fee to recharge the batteries and set up a network of charging sites and service centers akin to gas stations that pull out depleted batteries and plug in new ones to allow users to continue driving the subscription rate would depend on a few factors including how much customers drive but overall mr agassi says he expects the cost of owning and operating a car under his system to be less than that of gasoline based cars mr agassi acknowledges that pulling off such an idea could take years and billions of dollars in capital investment that he has raised &# million to try it is the latest evidence of an investment boom in silicon valley over "clean technology" start ups aimed at finding ways to reduce energy consumption and its negative effects on the environment other silicon valley veterans have been jumping on the clean tech bandwagon tesla motors inc the well publicized maker of electric cars founded in by two computer scientists has so far raised &# million from venture capital firms including vantagepoint venture partners and several individuals including a paypal co founder elon musk and silicon valley venture capitalists vinod khosla and john doerr have invested in clean technology the biggest backer of mr agassis venture israel corp an israel based holding company with interests that include oil refining chemicals and shipping invested &# million its chairman idan ofer will hold the same title at mr agassis company while mr agassi will be chief executive the companys working name is better place backers say their investments are commensurate with the companys potential and the size of the existing auto and energy industries "if youre going elephant hunting you need an elephant gun " said alan salzman co founder and managing partner at vantagepoint which has also invested in mr agassis firm nonetheless they are staking a lot on mr agassi a year old who was known at sap for a forceful persuasive way of promoting his ideas but a mixed record in following through on them he joined sap in california in when it bought his company toptier software inc mr agassi studied computer science in college and until a few years ago knew little about the auto or energy industries that changed in when mr agassi was invited to join the forum of young global leaders a nonprofit group of influential people under years old that includes google inc co founders larry page and sergey brin members were asked for ideas to make the world a better place by mr agassi an israeli native settled on two lofty goals achieving peace in the middle east and helping solve the global warming problem by reducing dependence on oil mr agassi says that late at night and on long flights he began reading books about the auto and energy industries he cobbled together a white paper with an overview of how technology could be used to address energy issues and began passing it around to people in the auto and energy industries no one took up the ideas but he got encouragement from shimon peres who became israels president this year following one of mr agassis presentations mr peres asked him "do you really think you can do this " mr agassi said yes then mr peres said "if you think you can do this what else do you have in your life that is more important " mr agassi recalls there are huge hurdles until the service center infrastructure is as ubiquitous as gas stations there wont be a way for people to drive long distances in these cars also mr agassi has to work with auto and battery makers to come up with specifications for removable batteries in some cases he may need approval from local governments to set up charging sites and battery replacement centers in the early years of his company he expects to distribute cars directly to companies or other large buyers but he eventually expects consumers to get their cars from conventional dealers while he operates an infrastructure that includes the batteries and the charging network he likens his company to a wireless provider such as at&amp t that provides a subscription service that makes phone calls possible while auto makers would be like handset makers such as nokia corp steve girsky a former auto analyst and general motors corp adviser briefed on the plan says mr agassi faces a chicken and egg problem "the car companies wont build cars for this until they see a commitment on infrastructure but he cant build the infrastructure until the car companies build cars " he says despite the challenges though it seems like mr agassi has "got a lot of momentum " adds mr girsky who is now president of the private equity firm centerbridge industrial partners which isnt taking part in the funding mr agassi hasnt announced any deals but says he is in discussions with several countries and auto makers nissan motor co chief executive officer carlos ghosn who also runs nissans french partner renault sa says they are looking into leasing batteries to consumers for electric vehicles that they hope to produce commercially by "its definitely a technology that were very interested in and were investing to develop that technology but how were going to sell and lease is still something were looking at and not something weve taken a decision on " said spokeswoman frederique le greves when asked about mr agassis model general motors is also looking into the idea of leasing batteries for its chevrolet volt plug in hybrid electric vehicle says tony posawatz vehicle line director for the volt "by removing the battery cost from the vehicle price the customer derives much value " mr posawatz says adding that gm hasnt made any concrete plans yet mr posawatz says he hasnt spoken with mr agassi but is familiar with his company and expects the movement toward electric cars to "spawn many entrepreneurial ideas " mr agassi for his part plans to start slowly with pilot projects involving a few dozen cars next year growing to thousands of cars by and a hundred thousand by he predicts the idea will first take hold in contained environments such as islands where driving distances arent great and the cost of a battery handling infrastructure would be limited whatever comes of his idea former colleagues say mr agassi is already using a skill for which he was well known salesmanship "ive never seen someone as skilled as shai at selling abstract concepts " says nimish mehta a former senior vice president at sap joseph b white contributed to this article
