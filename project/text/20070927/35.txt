earnings digest the deal struck at a m yesterday between general motors corp and the united auto workers union marks the dawn of an uncertain new era for the american auto industry and its unionized work force for much of the last half century detroits big three auto makers had collaborated with the uaw to create an industrial aristocracy of blue collar workers whose pay and benefits set the standard for the american middle class if the proposed contract announced yesterday is ratified by union members and is subsequently replicated at ford motor co and chrysler llc that era in american industrial history may be over the contract which covers about u s auto workers restructures gms obligations to cover health care for uaw retirees it also sets up a mechanism for the auto maker to buy out thousands of workers whose wages and benefits total about &# an hour and to replace many of them particularly those in nonproduction jobs with new employees earning far less in return gm has agreed to invest in uaw represented factories and to make certain improvements to retirement benefits the proposed contract allows gm to shift to an independent trust &# billion in liabilities for uaw retiree health care gm has argued that it cannot shoulder that burden and remain viable the auto maker could eventually contribute as much as &# billion to that trust called a voluntary employees beneficiary association or veba people familiar with the bargaining process say for detroits big three which together lost more than &# billion last year the establishment of such independent trusts would constitute a major step toward avoiding the fates of the steel and airline industries where crushing pension and health care costs forced major players to seek bankruptcy court protection ford and chrysler are also engaged in contract talks with the uaw talks that are now likely to accelerate the uaw retiree health care obligations of detroits three auto makers total between &# billion and &# billion uaw workers who went on strike at all of gms u s plants on monday began returning to work yesterday afternoon gm rose &# or to close at &# a share in p m new york stock exchange composite trading ford shares climbed cents or to close at &# the tentative pact appears to ratify what has become increasingly clear over the last several years that toyota motor corp not gm or the uaw now sets the bar for labor costs in the u s auto industry over time the new contract could allow gm to significantly narrow the cost gap between its unionized u s operations and nonunion u s plants run by toyota and other asian and european auto makers a gap now pegged at &# to &# an hour auto research firm csm worldwide inc estimates that the new pact may allow gm to reduce that differential by to uaw president ron gettelfinger still has to sell the deal to his rank and file but his decision to agree to its terms suggests that the union leader thinks detroits problems stem from a permanent realignment of the auto industry in the face of globalization one of mr gettelfingers biggest challenges will be to stop the erosion of union auto jobs which has reduced uaw ranks at the big three by since the last national contract was ratified in mr gettelfinger said wednesday he expects gm will have as many uaw jobs at the end of this contract in as it does now a talking point he will likely repeat as he tries to win votes ratification of the new contract would mark a turning point in relations between the big three and uaw during the s and s the two sides established a pattern of agreeing to ever better wages and benefits sometimes after strikes without any significant union givebacks the last time the uaw offered significant concessions was during the economic downturn of the early s at that time detroits woes were seen as the result of a short term economic slump and rising energy prices since then however detroit has watched numerous storm clouds roll in imported japanese and european cars made inroads among american consumers honda motor co followed by nissan motor corp and toyota began building nonunion factories outside the industrys stronghold in the upper midwest these japanese rivals succeeded in transplanting their celebrated manufacturing methods to american soil using american workers and they did so while keeping uaw organizers at bay they paid comparable wages but did not offer detroit style retiree benefits as they lost market share to foreign rivals detroits auto makers and the uaw lost the power to set standards on labor costs yet during the prosperous s they seemed reluctant to accept the fact that their business model with its expensive defined benefit health and pension programs was driving the domestic industry toward ruin with yesterdays deal the uaw and its biggest employer have effectively conceded that their golden age of dominance is over gm has by far the largest retiree health care burden equivalent to more than double its market capitalization yesterday that liability coupled with &# billion in losses over the past two years led some analysts to predict that gm might someday have to seek chapter bankruptcy protection gm executives consistently dismissed such speculation but acknowledged that it couldnt be competitive in north america without a fundamental change in its labor cost structure gms obligation to provide health care for union members retirees and surviving spouses lies at the heart of yesterdays agreement even after a partial overhaul of retiree health care benefits in gm still faced a &# billion obligation to uaw members health care obligations added more than &# to the cost of every gm vehicle sold in the u s in a heavy burden given that many gm vehicles sold for less than competing toyota vehicles the agreement allows gm to transfer those obligations to an independent trust that would survive even if gm seeks bankruptcy court protection the trust will be funded over time with cash and securities valued at about of the &# billion obligation it could remove the threat of an endlessly escalating liability the auto maker has been building up cash for more than a year in anticipation of such a deal selling key assets such as a stake in its finance arm general motors acceptance corp "the advantage for the uaw is they get hard assets now away from risk of gm and the others which could really be a good move if we are heading into a downturn and these companies struggle even more " says itay michaeli an auto analyst at citigroup inc "if you are a creditor youd rather negotiate when the debtor has liquidity and cash which is the situation right now " in addition gm will be able to use early retirement packages and buyouts to ease out thousands of highly paid veterans if gm chooses to do so aggressively it could usher out most of a generation of auto workers who started with the company in the s and s that would enable it to reposition itself with a younger less expensive work force it wasnt clear yesterday how many categories of employees gm could hire at lower wages chairman and chief executive officer rick wagoner has said that gm already is as efficient in day to day manufacturing as toyota but that its legacy costs have prevented it from capitalizing on that if the labor pact is ratified investors will be looking for mr wagoner to start delivering better results with a weak dollar driving up the cost of imported cars and components mr wagoner and his counterparts at ford and chrysler appear to be catching some breaks on other fronts the raw hourly wages of u s auto workers employed by asian auto makers such as toyota honda and nissan are on par with wages on detroit factory floors roughly &# an hour its the benefits that create the gap lifting total compensation for big three workers to &# to &# an hour compared with an estimated &# to &# an hour for asian rivals detroit labor negotiators attribute about one third of the gap to retiree health care the gm deal could produce a nonfinancial dividend for the uaw erasing its status as the struggling domestic industrys no scapegoat uaw leaders often maintain that labor represents less than of the cost of new vehicles blaming detroits market share slide and revenue woes on design engineering marketing and other areas labor leaders said yesterday that the tentative settlement would have a big impact on upcoming negotiations in other industries they expressed relief that gm had not sought to eliminate or further cut retiree health benefits which they said would have emboldened other employers to aggressively seek health care concessions "i think it ends up being a positive thing for general motors for the uaw and for other unions " said gregory junemann president of the international federation of professional and technical engineers which represents workers at boeing co lockheed martin corp general electric co among others the uaw formed in negotiated its first health care benefit in during contract talks between gm and legendary uaw president walter reuther gm agreed to pay half the cost of hospital visits and surgeries for workers and family members in the uaw won full health care coverage for active workers and one half coverage for retirees the first medical coverage for retirees again gm was the lead company in the talks the next contract brought full coverage for retirees the contract gave full coverage to surviving spouses in after a day strike gm agreed to allow members to retire after years which increased the cost of retiree health care that contract also expanded hospital and surgical coverage and added prescription drug benefits at that time domestic car makers were dominating the world markets and health care was still a manageable expense by the early s however both conditions had changed toyota and honda ramped up production at nonunion factories in the u s uaw membership which had been between one million and million during the s and s was sliding toward todays level of just active members auto makers particularly gm realized that retiree health care was a runaway locomotive health care costs shot up and gms market share slid gms top management tried during the s to persuade uaw leaders to accept measures to check the growth in uaw health care costs those efforts failed today gms demographic problem is stark it has active uaw hourly workers down from in it provides health benefits to about uaw retirees and surviving spouses by comparison toyota provides retiree health care to about people according to gms internal estimates about two thirds of gms active uaw workers could retire in the next five years according to outside projections although the proposed agreement would cap that exposure it doesnt solve all of gms problems the company is struggling to stop erosion of u s sales and market share which stems in part from consumers associating its vehicles with poor quality and reliability and bad resale values ford and chrysler will also face substantial challenges to their respective turnaround efforts even if they strike similar health care deals fords plan doesnt project profitability until at the earliest and those projections dont take into account fears of a broader recession brought on by recent problems in the housing and debt markets chrysler under its new chief executive robert nardelli is also trying to rebuild its battered brands overhaul its product development strategy and slim down a dealer network sized for an era when chrysler was significantly bigger than it is today for the uaw the proposed independent trusts represent both a risk and an opportunity if ford and gm strike similar deals and all three funds are merged into one the health care fund could contain &# billion to &# billion that would make it equal to the th largest pension fund in the country says global proxy watch the uaws biggest risk is that the funds liability is likely to grow a previous health care trust negotiated by the uaw with industrial giant caterpillar inc collapsed in after about seven years in part because of runaway health care costs caterpillar its retirees and the uaw now are embroiled in litigation over who was at fault in detroit the uaw will be betting that its fund has enough upfront money from auto makers and that the fund can earn enough on its investment returns to keep up with health care inflation that has averaged to a year the uaw and detroits auto makers have also debated the possibility of a national health care plan the uaw wants auto makers to keep pushing for nationalized health care while auto makers want some of their money back if such legislation passes mr gettelfinger is gambling that the tentative agreement will be approved by a uaw membership that in recent years has shown reluctance to accept concessionary deals a midcontract concession on health care with ford in passed with just of the vote and the uaw didnt try to push a similar measure with chrysler after chrysler uaw plant officials told union leaders the deal wouldnt pass in a radio interview yesterday morning mr gettelfinger said the health care trust meant uaw members are "going to be secure in their retiree benefits " he acknowledged that the move to shift the health care burden to an independent trust could spark debate among members worried that the trust wont be adequately funded he said he welcomes that debate asserting that the trust will be adequate to pay benefits for years "our membership will be very pleased with this agreement " he said union members were still waiting late yesterday to hear details of the agreement as they returned to work they expressed views ranging from elation to apprehension over the tentative contracts main points and their industrys changing landscape mike mooradian years old has worked for gm for years the last three months on the assembly line at the detroit hamtramck plant putting wiring harnesses on buick lucerne and cadillac dts cars "im still a little leery about all of it " he said "this veba stuff is interesting but is it going to stick or is it going to change five to years from now and we find out weve been snowballed again " a gm spokeswoman said yesterday that the auto maker is not providing details about the tentative agreement at this time instead allowing the uaw to take the lead on communicating with its members mr gettelfinger said hes confident of ratification and that voting likely will start as soon as this weekend union leaders will be briefed on thursday and friday he said the uaw also expects to decide on thursday what auto maker it will negotiate with next mike spector and kris maher contributed to this article write to
