small investors gain an edge in properties credit crunch opens window for buyers long shut out of strip malls small offices for small investors whove been shut out of the commercial property market in recent years theres a bright side to the mortgage meltdown its much easier for them to compete when andrew brooks first offered &# million for a medical office building in valencia calif in early august the seller turned down the year old orthopedic surgeon but just three weeks later the seller called back dr brooks who lives in los angeles the two large real estate investment trusts that had knocked the doctor out of the running with their bids were no longer interested dr brooks believes that the companies were unable or unwilling to come up with the cash that left dr brooks who buys medical office buildings in addition to performing surgeries related to sports injuries as the sole player he quickly put down a "substantial" nonrefundable cash deposit to buy the property for &# less than he had originally offered and is waiting for the deal to close though the marketplace for health care related properties has been extremely competitive over the past few years "if youve got some cash to spend theres a tremendous opportunity " dr brooks says over the past few years more investors have wanted to add small apartment complexes office buildings and shopping centers to their portfolio retirees well off individuals and the self employed who often lack corporate pensions and retirement plans have traditionally used these types of investments to amass long term wealth and fund their retirement but as prices soared both individual players like dr brooks and small companies that buy such properties which are typically priced between &# million and &# million found themselves outbid and outmaneuvered by better capitalized firms including investment banks and publicly traded real estate investment trusts or reits now with the capital markets roiling once active big firms are being more prudent about making deals thats opened a window of opportunity for smaller investors who want to buy these properties "right now everyone is trying to figure out how to make these deals work so while were in that transition period the institutional investors are taking a wait and see approach " says mark larson national director of grubb &amp elliss private capital investment group smaller investors a universe that includes individuals partnerships and local and regional investment companies can cut deals faster than bigger players which appeals to sellers fed up with the growing number of deals that are falling through theyre also more willing to buy properties that need improvement which can be a lucrative but are often deemed too risky for institutional investors and reits says harvey green chief executive of marcus &amp millichap real estate investment services based in encino calif another big advantage smaller investors have many of them pay primarily with cash thats a plus in an environment where debt has become more difficult to get or at least more expensive "so many investments just dont make sense unless you have the cash " says marsha slotten a commercial real estate broker in las vegas despite the federal reserves move last week to cut its overnight interest rate by half a percentage point to many experts believe that small investors still have an advantage when it comes to buying smaller commercial properties but that advantage could be short lived if institutional players wade back into the market which could drive prices up and leave smaller players priced out of the market william hutchinson owns a small dallas company called dunhill partners that buys shopping centers priced between &# million and &# million mostly in texas oklahoma and louisiana he says his competitors for these properties until recently often included midsize to large reits but these days mr hutchinson is finding that these firms arent making as many bids he chalks it up to the fact that the shopping centers sometimes include mom and pop tenants who dont always have the best credit ratings in todays credit sensitive environment larger investors particularly ones who have to answer to shareholders arent willing to take chances on properties that may seem too risky he says h alan welles a commercial real estate broker in west palm beach fla acts as a "sponsor" to groups of individual investors who pool their money to buy retail industrial or office properties entrusting mr welles with handling the entire transaction including acquisition leasing and management his clients include professionals and retirees in their s with a lot of cash a few weeks ago one of mr welless groups beat out several offers on a &# million medical office and retail building in west palm beach because they were able to offer all cash and the ability to close with no financial contingencies "with us there is no red tape but the procedures for getting stuff done are so much slower with the larger groups " says mr welles who deals with commercial properties valued at up to &# million "a lot of sellers have gotten burned while trying to hold out for the top dollars so now theyre just looking for fewer headaches " leslie evans a palm beach based attorney invests in some of mr welless groups and will occasionally negotiate their contracts because of the opportunities for individual investors right now he says that more professionals have been calling about investing their money in a group and the number of these groups has been expanding mr evans says the current commercial real estate market is perfect for the doctors and other professionals in the group who have a high net worth and are taken aback with the stock markets recent volatility "this is definitely the better opportunity right now for those who are looking to be able to sleep at night a little bit better " he says some smaller investors are even being approached by the larger players for partnerships john crossman co owns a small orlando fla company that buys area shopping centers priced at between &# million and &# million not only has he seen the number of bidders on properties drop from around to five in recent weeks he also says institutional investors are asking him to team up on projects because of his knowledge of the local market at a time when taking risks is frowned upon these larger investors particularly those making purchases from outside the region dont want to buy properties without having inside information about the areas rent and job growth and about the local tenant base "when people get concerned about things they rely more heavily on the local markets " mr crossman says "were seeing an unbelievable amount of people who want to be our operating partner because we have that knowledge " mr crossman says his experiences were echoed by other smaller investors at a recent conference held in new york by the international council of shopping centers an industry trade group "i was in the elevator with a few other small guys like me and while the speakers at the conference were talking about all these concerns every single one of us talked about how excited we were about the market because there are opportunities for us " he says but the advantage that smaller investors have could be brief as their bigger brethren find solutions to the credit crunch and look to make deals again "i dont think institutional investors and reits are going to sit out of any major market any longer than three to maybe six months " says david illsley a commercial real estate broker in scottsdale ariz "theyll figure out a way to be in the game " the upper hand small investors now have an edge in bidding for certain commercial properties heres why they often pay with cash while larger firms typically borrow funds they are more likely to buy properties in need of renovation bigger firms have become more risk averse because of the credit crunch
