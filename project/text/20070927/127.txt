what might gm trust fund mean for workers elsewhere general motors corp s new trust fund for retiree health benefits has workers at other companies wondering what it might mean for them particularly on two important questions are retirees at gm and other companies that have set up minipension funds to pay for retiree health coverage more likely to continue receiving health benefits and will the funds keep retirees share of benefit costs from rising substantially the quick answer is that most employers arent setting up so called voluntary employees beneficiary associations or vebas to make life easier for their retirees they are doing it because it makes financial sense for the companies themselves under pension accounting rules company run vebas can improve a companys bottom line whether a veba leads to more affordable health coverage for retirees is anything but certain here are the basics q what is a veba a vebas are similar to pension funds they have assets intended to pay for retiree health care as well as other smaller benefits like retiree life insurance or dental care employer contributions to vebas are deductible and grow tax free companies or in some cases labor unions withdraw money from the trusts to pay benefits each year as needed gms deal removes &# billion of retiree health obligations from its balance sheet in return its union gets to set and manage the health insurance benefits q apart from tax breaks why do employers like vebas a employers can contribute their own stock to the plan that can make it cheaper to fund whats more like pension plans retiree health trusts can also boost earnings the veba at procter &amp gamble co for example has contributed more than &# million to earnings since if the gm veba is independent of the company it wouldnt affect gms bottom line once it is established q who has vebas a about one third of large companies have vebas most are companies with large union work forces such as utilities and defense contractors they include conagra foods inc duke energy corp ford motor co kellogg co and texas instruments inc q why are they more common at unionized companies a employers whose work forces have collective bargaining get additional tax breaks employers with salaried workers generally cant deduct contributions to a veba that exceed the amount they actually spend on retiree benefits in a given year if they do the extra investment income from the veba is taxed this rule was designed to make it harder for employers to abuse vebas as tax shelters but companies with vebas covering union employees can contribute more based on the retiree benefit plans estimated liabilities without incurring additional tax bills gm has long had a veba to fund benefits for its union employees at the end of last year it had &# billion in assets to cover &# billion of obligations for health and other benefits for retirees q if my company has a veba are my benefits safer not necessarily many companies shifted more of the cost of benefits to retirees as they drew down their trusts assets in the s meanwhile when companies cut retiree health benefits or downsize they can end up with overfunded vebas in some cases they can apply to the internal revenue service to use the money for other purposes such as health care costs for active workers whats more retiree health trusts are like pension plans in another way when employers cut benefits they reduce the liability they carry on their books for those benefits a move that generates accounting gains and improves income that happens whether or not they have a veba but when the company does have a veba the funds assets can generate investment gains that further reduce the plans cost and thus boost income that means the very fact that a company has prefunded retiree health benefits may give it an incentive to cut those benefits still having a separate trust makes it more likely that at least some benefits will be paid even if the employer becomes insolvent
