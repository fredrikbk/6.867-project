a rocky mountain high end problem aspen considers limiting luxury retailers in an effort to revive its faded charm aspen colo the colorado ski town of aspen has found itself in an unusual quandary its gotten too swanky some long time residents complain that its downtown is cluttered with too many high end jewelry shops and luxury chain stores selling pricey apparel so while other resort and historic towns are slamming the door on retail chains like hooters and mcdonalds for fear of becoming too plebeian aspen is studying ways to limit the gucci and prada style stores filling its downtown streets this mountain resort city whose population boasts around year round residents but can swell to in high ski season has long reveled in its reputation as a playground for the wealthy and glamorous the average home price has surpassed &# million retail space downtown leases for an average &# per square foot compared with &# for downtown denver on display this week in aspen storefronts a &# knee length fox and mink fur coat at brioni a &# diamond encrusted womens watch at buccellati and &# ostrich skin bags at gucci but now city leaders are worrying that all the high living is destroying the exclusive small town allure of their former hippie hangout and mining outpost aspens more modest living year round residents have looked on in dismay as a flood of luxury retailers have replaced their unique independent shops which no longer can afford the lofty rents aspens block downtown now counts jewelry stores and roughly high end chains aspens city council must make a decision on the downtowns fate by year end when a yearlong moratorium on approvals for downtown construction will expire the hiatus was intended to provide city officials time to determine the downtowns direction after an historic independent restaurant and movie theater both closed among measures the council is considering are caps on the number of luxury chains and jewelry stores allowed downtown it is also mulling subsidizing at risk stores deemed "essential commercial uses " like pharmacies and laundromats that assistance could entail public private partnerships that defray rent or incentives for developers to build ancillary space such as basements or second floors that could be occupied by local retailers should the council opt to freeze the number of luxury chains downtown a plan favored by aspen city planners new luxury stores will be allowed only if another leaves many downtown property owners oppose restrictions landlords view chain stores as financially stable tenants and aspen is a prized location even with owners charging top dollar vacancies are few and short lived says developer stephen marcus mr marcus controls square feet of retail property downtown including space rented by a designer brand malo apparel store and a high end waterworks plumbing fixtures store "we all love our old aspen from the s and s but nothing stays the same " says mr marcus "you have to let the free market prevail " to date the luxury chains with aspen stores have said nothing publicly about the potential regulations several luxury chains with aspen stores declined to comment for this story mickey alper owner of the independent aspen fur and shearling store downtown largely serves the same clientele as the luxury chains "i dont think the city needs to regulate the types of businesses downtown " he says adding that sales tax revenues are high and downtown vacancies almost nonexistent "i dont see the problem " but many disagree in surveys conducted by aspen officials last summer and again this past friday the majority of local residents said they were concerned that downtown stores were "too high end " but they were split on the question of whether the city should restrict the number of luxury retailers many preferred a system that encouraged the return of independent local shops through some kind of support from the city city planners have proposed regulating downtown retail to promote a better mix of restaurants and unique stores selling moderate wares that will draw shoppers to the city center throughout the year while luxury stores funnel significant tax revenue into city coffers during aspens busy winter and summer seasons they draw few patrons during the spring and autumn seasons "what were looking at is trying to ensure that vitality that interest that uniqueness " says ben gagnon aspens special projects planner gracys outlet consignment shop an unpretentious outlet that sells womens apparel shoes jewelry and home furnishings priced from &# to &# has been a fixture in downtown aspen for years karen carner a former flight attendant has owned the store for the past eight years while idle sales clerks at downtown luxury stores peered out their windows in boredom monday during the off season doldrums gracys outlet welcomed a steady trickle of shoppers not for much longer though ms carners landlord is selling the building to a buyer who will convert it to pricey condominiums it is the third time in eight years that gracys has been displaced as its landlord pursued more lucrative tenants now unable to afford the rising rents ms carner plans on shuttering the store for good and switching her career to real estate "if the city council doesnt do something to the rents in this town there will not be any local businesses left it will be all pradas " she says by putting luxury stores in the bulls eye aspen is proposing a new twist in a trend where more cities are seeking to restrict chains in an effort to preserve local identities san francisco and at least two dozen other resort towns across the u s have aimed to limit more middle brow retailers such as starbucks blockbuster and hollywood video a few towns including san juan bautista calif and port townsend wash have banned chains outright in most areas such restrictions come at a price port townsend residents pay higher property taxes than their counterparts in neighboring cities which receive significant sales tax from the chain stores in some towns lawsuits have challenged the legal basis of new ordinances with mixed results aspen residents are divided on the issue sally hansen and eleanor meyer exited aspens prada store tuesday with a billfold they bought as a present for a friend as self described professional shoppers the women visit aspens luxury stores often and oppose any regulation but a few blocks away outside of the independent carls pharmacy artist and writer peyton budinger expressed dismay about the luxury store boom "not
