developer tries comeback with new chicago waldorf chicago it wasnt so long ago that michael reschke was one of the biggest names in chicago real estate and the company he built developed or acquired more than &# billion worth of properties he founded his development company while in his s and constructed a chicago skyscraper by the age of his chicago based prime group thrived during the s spinning off five publicly traded real estate companies but he ended up losing his office company in part because of a gamble he took with blackstone group lp and the retail company he founded was sold against his will now mr reschke is mounting a big comeback with &# billion worth of projects planned or under construction the most prestigious is a waldorf astoria hotel and residence towers in chicago that he plans to develop for hilton hotels corp the &# million project will offer rooms in a five star hotel and luxury condominiums in a sleek modern building about a block from the chicago river other projects mr reschke years old has in the works include a luxury condominium building under way on the tony gold coast near lake michigan and a jw marriott hotel that will go in a landmarked building designed by daniel burnham in the financial district it may be an awkward time for a return to center stage wall street is nervous about lending chicagos condo market is slowing and industry experts question whether the city needs more luxury hotel rooms but mr reschke is unfazed "im a developer an eternal optimist " he says mr reschkes career tumble started in when he teamed up with blackstone to buy an additional four million shares of prime group realty trust stock at &# a share before the office company which was spun off from the prime group went public at &# a share for its &# million contribution blackstone received an option to force mr reschkes closely held investment vehicle to buy it out at &# million or &# a share three years later by that time prime group realty trusts stock was trading at about &# a share in desperation he turned to the new york reit vornado realty trust which agreed to lend him &# million to pay off blackstone the loan was secured by mr reschkes controlling stake in the prime office reit mr reschke teamed up with cadim inc a montreal based real estate advisory company and attempted a management led buyout cadim also agreed to refinance the vornado debt but after the sept attacks mr reschke said cadim got spooked by the office market and bailed mr reschke was left with his loan due on sept he was current on his interest payments but vornado wouldnt extend the loan and he couldnt pay it in full vornado later foreclosed on loans to mr reschke and bought his stock in an auction for &# million vornado didnt return calls cadim had no comment equally frustrating to mr reschke in the board of directors of his prime retail inc a struggling outlet mall company voted to sell the company at the fire sale price of &# million over his objections in mr reschke tried again to buy out his office reit this time with barry mansur a chicago based real estate investor mr reschke admits that he desperately wanted to win "it was like buying my kids back " he says but another group of investors came in with a higher bid when mr reschkes team invoked its right to match the reits executives announced that the partnerships financing was defective and sold the company to the other bidders in mr reschke and his partner sued settling in part for the ability to buy the burnham designed building at south lasalle for &# million that set the stage for his comeback the lasalle property was built in two years after the architect died as an office building but mr reschke always believed it would be perfect for a plush hotel mr reschke lured marriott international inc to sign on for a jw marriott at the site a luxury property in the heart of the financial district an area underserved by high end hotels yet it is difficult to borrow right now mr reschke said one wall street firm backed out of a construction loan this summer on the marriott project now he will borrow less and put in more equity believing this will get the project funded "this is a very attractive development and there is financing available for quality projects " said john wolf a marriott spokesman the waldorf astoria is being built in a partnership with fordham co a chicago based high end residential developer preliminary plans call for a floor tower that in no way resembles its art deco style manhattan namesake instead the project is more akin in style to the chicago spire the foot tall condominium project being built by architect santiago calatrava on lake shore drive "its a little bit of a tip of the hat to the spire just down the street as they are both slender tall and elegant but its different " says christopher carley chairman of fordham if mr reschkes projects which also include an embassy suites hotel all are built as planned they would increase the citys hotel room supply by almost "even if its the right thing for the market over the long term there will be a short term impact to existing operators including existing marriotts " says will marks an analyst with san francisco based jmp securities about of the revenue from the waldorf astoria project will come from the condominium portion at prices about &# per square foot says mr carley yet there are concerns from experts that chicago has too many condominiums under construction this total includes units of mr reschkes project ten east delaware d waveland kendt sales manager for ten east delaware says are sold two years before completion despite the number of hotels and condominiums being built in chicago hilton considers this a long term endeavor that will pay off "its a market that every hotel brand in the world wants to be in " says david greydanus senior vice president for hiltons waldorf astoria collection with all his projects how does mr reschke know he wont get in over his head seated in his th floor offices he glanced around a conference room plastered with plans of projects he was working on and shrugged "its not that many " he said "how can i be overextended i still have room on the walls for more drawings " alex frangos contributed to this article
