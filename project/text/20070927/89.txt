politics &amp economics soot king plays progressive tune on climate energy secretary bodman pushes for action in an administration that is losing its skepticism washington samuel bodman used to be known as the "soot king " for the grimy substance called carbon black that his company made from incinerated oil sludge since then mr bodman president bushs energy secretary since early has emerged as one of the leaders of a band of administration progressives on climate change the group which also includes treasury secretary henry paulson has been quietly pushing for the white house to take stronger action to combat global warming as the administration begins climate change negotiations today among the worlds largest economies the bush white house has perhaps what will be its last best chance to reshape its reputation as uncaring about climate change the talks slated to run through next year are expected to serve as a foundation for a broader agreement to replace the kyoto protocol when it expires in a big question is whether the administration will heed its progressives and make a concerted push for meaningful limits on greenhouse gas emissions or be content to run out the clock on mr bushs term in office "youve got some new cabinet members who came from the business community who believe we need to do something " says christine todd whitman former environmental protection agency head in mr bushs first term who was rebuffed by the white house in her push for more action on climate change policy many experts warn that greenhouse gas emissions must be cut by at least globally within two decades to prevent severe droughts heat waves and hurricanes some environmentalists say as much as of output might have to be eliminated by the administration hasnt yet embraced such global limits and might never do so because of opposition from big developing nations as well as internal reservations about their feasibility but it has come some ways from its skepticism on global warming which had led the administration to formally reject the kyoto accord in that shift reflects an evolution in thought on the issue that is under way in the u s particularly among big businesses mr bodmans own concern grew as he pushed to accelerate the governments scientific research the energy secretary declined to comment for this article a chicago native mr bodman earned a chemical engineering doctorate from massachusetts institute of technology after teaching and consulting stints he moved to fidelity investments venture arm eventually becoming the parent companys president and chief operating officer in mr bodman moved to cabot corp a century old leader in carbon black the smudgy gunk that is used in a variety of products including ink and automobile tires running cabot earned mr bodman the title of "soot king" in a magazine profile and the enmity of some environmentalists over the next dozen years mr bodman helped remake cabot into a cutting edge player in computer chip making and ink jet printing cabot also developed less polluting production methods for its plants after mr bush won the presidential election mr bodman accepted the no job at the commerce department to oversee government climate research he helped recruit an old mit colleague james mahoney mr bodmans chemical engineering background made him open to climate science with its computer modeling and data analysis that sometimes put him at odds with other administration officials including white house chief environmental adviser james connaughton a senior administration official says mr connaughtons concern focused on developing more real world data to take the place of the many assumptions then being used "early on there was a fair amount of pressure and disagreement between connaughton and bodman" over the science recalls mr mahoney "bodman was also careful but thought the issues were too important to wait five or years " from the earliest days of the bush administration conservatives led by vice president dick cheney had put the brakes on any dramatic action on climate change when mr bush announced his new climate change policy in june he emphasized doubts about the science and called for more federal research responding to mr bushs call messrs bodman and mahoney began planning a year research program at commerce but they again ran into internal skepticism vetting their plan mr connaughtons white house council on environmental quality made at least changes that emphasized scientific uncertainties a later house investigation found friction with white house officials also emerged over the plans scope and cost although the officials signed off on it "we have in place the most transparent system of science reporting and claims that the administration interfered with scientists are false " said kristen hellmer a ceq spokeswoman in december mr bush picked mr bodman to be energy secretary "we must take a comprehensive look at our climate change policy and discuss how to move these activities forward " mr bodman said at his confirmation hearing mr bush had begun planning a new approach in the weeks following his re election in november u s officials remained skeptical of the tight caps that many european leaders favored they also worried that emerging economies like china and india which were never covered by kyoto wouldnt go along bush advisers aimed to re engage the u s in the global debate while avoiding what they viewed as kyotos failures at the same time the research that mr bodman had helped initiate at commerce was beginning to prove the human links to climate change "i recognize that the surface of the earth is warmer and that an increase in greenhouse gases caused by humans is contributing " mr bush said in in july the u s with australia china india japan and south korea established the asia pacific partnership to discuss technological solutions some environmentalists criticized the partnership as an attempt to undercut kyoto but administration officials regarded it as a new forum for dialogue with emerging asian economies the bush administration began an internal dialogue in on a new climate policy mr connaughton says mr bodman "was an early catalyst" for a new policy and favored "significantly more aggressive measures " mr bodman found an ally in mr paulson a longtime conservationist who had recently come on board from goldman sachs group inc during the run up to mr bushs january state of the union speech administration officials debated whether the president should endorse mandatory u s caps ultimately mr bush and his advisers decided to hold off fearing that u s only caps wouldnt pass congress and could push some industries offshore if they did
