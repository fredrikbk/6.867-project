after gms labor pact its time to kick the tires investor focus will turn to the car operations where picture is blurry general motors corp s health care problems hung over the stock for so long some investors stopped thinking of gm as an auto maker now that gm has foisted the retiree health care monkey onto the back of its union the united auto workers the companys basic operations will get more attention and that might weigh on the stock over the summer investors grew increasingly negative on gm because of worries about consumer spending and the companys continually declining market share that made the stock somewhat cheap given its juicy dividend and overseas growth prospects but since word spread about the health care deal gms shares are up including a jump yesterday one reason for the jump is takeover speculation cerberus capital management llcs takeover of chrysler llc over the summer has made investors believe that gm could be next but the deal would be big and unless credit markets undergo a serious thaw very hard to finance that leaves investors to evaluate gm the auto maker gm will need to improve the quality of its vehicles and sell more of them a challenge amid a competitive market with oil prices around &# a barrel the challenge could be even greater the agreement does help level the playing field among auto makers likely helping the u s auto makers better compete globally but one large auto investor quipped that "the bad news is now people will focus on quality" an allusion to the gap that is still seen between gm and other domestic auto makers and foreign competitors general motors sold million cars and trucks around the world in the second quarter of this year barely changed from the million vehicles in the second quarter last year u s sales are down in through the end of august though they are up globally gm trades at a relatively skimpy times its expected earnings of the next year but the auto maker hasnt been able to generate positive cash flow in recent years and some analysts doubt it will be able to in the next year or two and while the health care deal will help gm control costs gms japanese competitors are still more efficient "even if this goes through unit labor costs are higher than foreign competitors" says david dreman head of value oriented dreman value management in jersey city n j which manages more than &# billion "its a major step in the right direction but theyll still have a major cost disadvantage " still the agreement is seen as a boon for gm it effectively enables gm to cap &# billion owed to the uaw for retiree health care by setting up a fund known as a voluntary employees beneficiary association and move it off its books and while gm still has to deal with quality issues and its employees still are expected to be better paid than those of global competitors the deal gives gm a shot in the arm and sent auto shares and bonds climbing amid expectations that ford motor co and chrysler will reach similar agreements the fact that gm averted a potentially costly strike also buoyed investors the best part about the gm deal from wall streets perspective it allows investors to better analyze the future of the company "not only were future health care costs a big liability but it was an uncertainty and wall street and investors hate uncertainty " says david kudla chief investment strategist at mainstay capital a grand blanc mich financial advisory firm that manages money for more than a thousand current and former gm employees this bodes well for the company the deal met or exceeded most investor expectations " neil hennessy portfolio manager of the &# billion hennessy funds in novato calif which own shares of gm says shares of both gm and ford look more attractive on the heels of the deal because it is a sign that the unions at both companies "realize they have to make concessions" for the auto makers to compete some even suggest that gm with its &# billion market value could be a takeover candidate but gms &# billion of debt is more than twice the value of its shares which likely would scare off potential buyers and bears on the stock note that gm will have to fund the health care fund which is expected to be worth more than &# billion with a combination of cash and securities perhaps yesterdays biggest winners were the big banks that helped cerberus finance its takeover of chrysler investors are assuming that the same deal that gm struck with the uaw will be replicated at ford and chrysler to fund cerberuss takeover of chrysler from daimler ag j p morgan chase &amp co citigroup inc goldman sachs group bear stearns cos and morgan stanley tried over the summer to raise &# billion from investors to help finance chryslers continuing operations but the banks were forced to keep &# billion of that debt on their books as investors balked at the loan sale amid weakness in credit markets cerberus and daimler took on an additional &# billion in debt cerberus and its banks hope to sell the loans this fall however and the terms of the union deal are expected to make it easier to sell the debt yesterday credit rating firm standard &amp poors ratings services said it may boost its rating on chrysler and daimlerchrysler financial services americas llc see related article "lazards man at uaw taps into a veteran of auto clashes dad" wsj sept
