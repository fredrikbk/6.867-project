image conscious upstart seeks to create a chinese fashion power in a sleek new york showroom overlooking the hudson river designers and stylists were busy on a recent day putting finishing touches on an african inspired collection of poplin and raffia dresses silk sheaths and metallic lame turbans by the label ports when presented on new york runways during fashion week earlier this month the ports collection was reviewed and bought by the same stores that buy big designer names like marc jacobs michael kors and oscar de la renta what makes ports different from those american brands is that its manufactured and based in xiamen a coastal city in southern china the companys efforts to position itself alongside high end european and american brands underscore chinas hopes to move from an apparel manufacturing center to become an owner and marketer of luxury brands but in the image conscious world of high fashion a china based company faces unique hurdles in recent years east asian firms have entered the fashion business by purchasing western companies hong kong manufacturers s c fang &amp sons have owned the pringle of scotland label since taiwanese publishing executive wang xiao lan bought parisian luxury firm lanvin a year later ports s owner alfred chan is also considering that route he recently expressed interest in buying the high fashion jil sander label owned by a private equity firm change capital partners in london but the year old mr chan who runs ports from a s beaux arts mansion on an island off xiamen also thinks he can create a successful new brand from the ground up he aims to make ports a household name in the west within five years since clothing for many high end italian and french labels is already being made in china he says his ambitions arent far fetched "they just sew the label in europe but much of it is made in china " he says "we can do this and better " still in a recent email mr chan expressed concern about negative publicity surrounding china made goods "i feel strongly that the right way to inform consumers is what pepsi was doing a blind test this is the real fair treatment of any companys product " products should be judged by the way they look and feel he said launched in the u s in ports is now sold in locations including neiman marcus saks fifth avenue and vivre com a high end online retailer the company says it expects the number of retailers carrying the line to double next year its &# dresses and &# coats made mostly of european fabrics are starting to get mentioned in fashion magazines its first two branded boutiques designed by the same architect who created jil sanders minimalist spaces in milan and paris are set to open next year in los angeles and new york to compete in the rarified high fashion world ports hired executives and manufacturing experts who have worked with top fashion companies such as coach and michael kors from early on the company insisted to retailers that it be positioned on the same floor as european brands like missoni and roberto cavalli in the september issue of vogue ports took out an eight page ad spread shot in iceland ports benefits from the unusual business model of ports international an apparel maker and retail chain controlled by mr chan and publicly traded in hong kong mr chan says he hopes to eventually merge privately held ports into ports international while most apparel companies in the u s and europe outsource production ports international owns its entire supply chain making clothing for both its own label and ports in xiamen the potent mix of low labor costs and an increasingly global market for talent allows ports to sell its clothing at a significantly lower price than european and american competitors for example a black tank dress in a wool cashmere blend from ports s current collection sells for &# a similar style by the italian brand fendi sells for &# the result ports internationals net profit margins were last year up from in brands like burberry and hugo boss which outsource production have margins in the mid to high teens jennifer gonzalez a year old business school student in new york is a ports customer who liked to wear the lines &# sweaters and blouses on casual fridays at her former bond trading job she says the brand is "fashion forward but not too trendy " she says she cares more about the fit and the fabric of her clothes than where they were produced mr chan declines to disclose sales for ports though publicity surrounding the label has a halo effect on the larger ports international its holding company ports design ltd had sales of about &# million last year ports international has more than stores in china other industries have already seen the impact of acquisitions by chinese companies chinas lenovo acquired the personal computer division of international business machines corp in more recently nanjing automobile bought the quintessentially british mg sports car brand fashion however may be a harder nut to crack although china dominates apparel manufacturing producing as much as a quarter of the worlds clothes according to some estimates image is paramount in the world of luxury goods ports will need to overcome chinas reputation for cheap and lately tainted products as well as counterfeits "global consumers overseas associate china with things like cheap takeout and pirated dvds " says p t black a partner at jigsaw a shanghai consumer research company "its not like the french whove spent decades promoting their champagne culture and refined lifestyle images which work very well with their luxury labels " indeed ports plays the image game carefully on the "about us" section of its web site the company notes origins in canada but doesnt mention that it is now based primarily in china even in china some ports salesclerks tell customers that the brand is canadian mr chan who comes from a wealthy chinese family with interests in mining and textiles went to college in canada eventually becoming a canadian citizen he and his brother set up a contract manufacturing business in called etac sales ltd his brother was based in china and sourced basic apparel and home furnishings mr chan was in canada selling the goods to stores there such as kmart and bargain harolds mr chan recognized the risk of operating as a middleman and set his sights on acquiring a high margin upscale clothing brand "as a contract manufacturer youre vulnerable dependent on orders i didnt want to be that way " he says in etac bought ports international a line of career sportswear founded in by a toronto entrepreneur at its peak in the s the line had sales of million canadian dollars and more than stores in canada and the u s including a flagship on fifth avenue by etac owned several upscale brands and operated more than stores with revenue of more than c&# million or the equivalent of us&# million at the time but rapid expansion debt and poor performance of some retail operations led to heavy losses in etac filed for bankruptcy mr chan blames the companys failure on recession and the removal of tariffs that enabled american competitors to enter the canadian market he also said in an email that his family owned a "very small percentage of etac before etac went into troubles" and that he wasnt managing the company mr chan bought the rights to the ports brand and an apparel factory in xiamen from receivership for c&# million he hoped for a comeback "we left open the door " he says in mr chan moved back to china and set about launching the brand there the brothers experience manufacturing in china proved an advantage as did the lack of high end competitors in the early s in china "every consumer was a blank piece of paper " mr chan recalls ports international expanded quickly in china to give the label cachet the company hired models kate moss and claudia schiffer to appear in ads with items priced between &# and &# ports international is out of reach for most chinese people but is targeted at chinas rapidly growing middle class particularly career women in their s and s in ports design went public on the hong kong stock exchange in the past two years the companys share price has more than quadrupled to about hong kong dollars or about us&# mr chan began considering launching a more expensive label six years ago when his sister in law presented the idea tia cibani a canadian who is the sister of mr chans wife fiona cibani moved to china to work for mr chan in she presented mr chan with a business plan for everything from the ports name to the globe logo "i liked the look of the number you turn it upside down and it is still " says ms cibani "i told him that what orange is for hermes brown would be for us " mr chan liked the concept but thought ms cibanis designs such as a minidress with a plunging neckline could alienate older consumers who might remember the clean cut ports look of the s ms cibani insisted that unlike ports international which makes classic styles the luxury label be on the cutting edge the ports looks were tested in canada where three stores opened in sales exceeded mr chans plan and he agreed to invest between &# million and &# million to launch the brand overseas ms cibani became head designer she persuaded mr chan to lease a square foot showroom in manhattan in a building where martha stewart and karl lagerfeld have offices to build the label mr chan hired experienced american managers and artisans from designer labels to teach factory workers in xiamen a pattern maker trained at jil sander was brought in to instruct chinese workers how to cut garments to help start an accessories line ports hired the manager of a factory doing contract manufacturing for coach the companys first u s employee was vice president of operations jacqui wenzel who had worked as a buyer at henri bendel and ran her own merchandising firm bruce baas vice president of sales was formerly head of retail at michael kors both say that the ports showroom in new york with its painted concrete floors dark wood fixtures and leather couches signaled mr chan was serious "when we saw this space we knew this was going to be something big " ms wenzel says the new york showroom helped the companys celebrity marketing strategy in when actress nicole kidman was in the building saw the clothes and knocked on the door the company was happy to outfit her in its latest designs an unexpected boost came last year when the film "the devil wears prada" used an image from a ports ad as a cover for the fictitious "runway" magazine as a result the ports name appeared in the films credits right below prada "the company continues to enjoy the benefits of the films popularity " ports said in its annual report to court celebrities ports introduced a couture evening wear collection called "par mains" this year and hosted a party at the chateau marmont in los angeles for hollywood stylists although the company didnt nab anyone for the oscars celebrities such as actress portia de rossi and model molly sims have been photographed wearing its designs positioning ports at retail has been tricky saks fifth avenue was the first u s retailer to place orders for the label but ports pulled the clothes out of three of the six saks stores that carried it because in those stores saks placed it with "bridge" and "modern" brands rather than higher priced designer brands "were better than that " says mr baas he picks up a pair of &# cotton slacks and points out details such as silk piping that covers inside seams "you can practically wear these inside out " michael fink womens fashion director at saks says the collection has thrived at its stores regardless of what department it is sold in he defines the labels customer as "very interested and knowledgeable about whats happening with fashion but not quite ready to jump into designer price points " a big challenge remains running a high fashion business from xiamen a steamy second tier chinese city whose chief industries are fishing canned food production and electronics designers dean and dan caten who worked for ports international for a few years left in the early s to form a successful italian label dsquared ms cibani who trained under the caten brothers also wanted to leave china and move to a fashion capital where she "could be in the air of the market that i was selling to " mr chan who originally wanted to avoid the high overhead of a new york design office recently acquiesced "this is about retaining your valuable employees " ms cibani recalls telling him the five person design team just moved from xiamen to new york at his home mr chan acknowledges that counterfeit handbags and cheap manufacturing are "part of china " then he gestures around his mansions hand laid marble floors and high ceilings and smiles "this is also part of china " he says sue
