him do it encouraging his creativity last week dr pausch a computer science professor at carnegie mellon university told this story in a lecture to students and colleagues "if your kids want to paint their bedrooms as a favor to me let em do it " he said "dont worry about resale values " as i wrote last week his talk was a riveting and rollicking journey through the lessons of his life it was also his last lecture since he has pancreatic cancer and expects to live for just a few months after he spoke his only plans were to quietly spend whatever time he has left with his wife and three young children he never imagined the whirlwind that would envelop him as video clips of his speech spread across the internet thousands of people contacted him to say he had made a profound impact on their lives many were moved to tears by his words and moved to action parents everywhere vowed to let their kids do what theyd like on their bedroom walls "i am going to go right home and let my daughter paint her wall the bright pink she has been desiring instead of the resalable vanilla i wanted " carol castle of spring creek nev wrote to me in an email to forward to dr pausch people wanted dr pausch to know that his talk had inspired them to quit pitying themselves or to move on from divorces or to pay more attention to their families one woman wrote that his words had given her the strength to leave an abusive relationship and terminally ill people wrote that they would try to live their lives as the year old dr pausch is living his "im dying and im having fun " he said in the lecture "and im going to keep having fun every day because theres no other way to play it " for don frankenfeld of rapid city s d watching the full lecture was "the best hour i have spent in years " many echoed that sentiment abc news which featured dr pausch on "good morning america " named him its "person of the week " other media descended on him and hundreds of bloggers world wide wrote essays celebrating him as their new hero their headlines were effusive "best lecture ever " "the most important thing ive ever seen " "randy pausch worth every second " in his lecture dr pausch had said "brick walls are there for a reason they let us prove how badly we want things " scores of web sites now feature those words some include photos of brick walls for emphasis meanwhile rabbis and ministers shared his brick wall metaphor in sermons this past weekend some compared the lecture to lou gehrigs "luckiest man alive" speech a year old girl told dr pausch that her ap english class had been analyzing the gehrig speech and "i have a feeling that well be analyzing your speech for years to come " already the naperville ill central high school speech team plans to have a student deliver the pausch speech word for word in competition as dr pauschs fans emailed his speech to friends some were sheepish "i am a deeply cynical person who reminds people frequently not to send me those sappy feel good emails " wrote mark pfeifer a technology manager at a new york investment bank "randy pauschs lecture moved me deeply and i intend to forward it on " in miami retiree ronald trazenfeld emailed the lecture to friends with a note to "stop complaining about bad service and shoddy merchandise " he suggested they instead hug someone they love near the end of his lecture dr pausch had talked about earning his ph d and how his mother would kiddingly introduce him "this is my son hes a doctor but not the kind who helps people " it was a laugh line but it led dozens of people to reassure dr pausch "you are the kind of doctor who helps people " wrote cheryl davis of oakland calif dr pausch feels overwhelmed and moved that what began in a lecture hall with people is being experienced by millions still he has retained his sense of humor "theres a limit to how many times you can read how great you are and what an inspiration you are " he says "but im not there yet "

footbridge will connect it to the arts building the bridge will be named the randy pausch memorial footbridge "based on your talk were thinking of putting a brick wall on either end " joked the universitys president jared cohon announcing the honor he went on to say "randy there will be generations of students and faculty who will not know you but they will cross that bridge and see your name and theyll ask those of us who did know you and we will tell them " dr pausch has asked carnegie mellon not to copyright his last lecture and instead to leave it in the public domain it will
