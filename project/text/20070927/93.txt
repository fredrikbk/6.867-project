politics &amp economics private security providers become a pentagon focus blackwater incident sparks rule review walking fine line the fallout over the recent blackwater usa shooting in iraq may redefine how private security forces operate in hot spots around the world with blackwaters tactics at the center of the debate over what constitutes acceptable force the iraqi governments drive to impose its own laws on foreign security firms is being watched by the rest of the security industry hard legal and tactical questions are being considered in an industry that owes its current robustness to the billions of dollars spent by the u s on security for diplomatic and reconstruction efforts in iraq there are myriad international laws and rules that address conduct by armies but few that directly address a situation like that faced in iraq by private security contractors working on behalf of american interests that could soon change in iraq where an immunity agreement with the government has shielded u s contractors from criminal prosecution but figuring which laws should apply wont be easy "one of the big issues with the laws is that theres a lot of overlap its just kind of this thicket of regulations " said deborah avant a professor at the university of california irvine and an expert on the subject of private military companies "blackwater is not accountable for how the counterinsurgency is doing blackwater is accountable for keeping their guy alive " the role of private contractors and the question of their accountability came to the forefront after a blackwater security detail got into a gunfight sept while escorting a u s diplomat in baghdad the incident left iraqis dead the iraqi government alleged the blackwater team acted with excessive force and killed civilians blackwater denied doing anything wrong and the state department has stood behind the company but the situation has put the u s in an awkward position of having to simultaneously defend one of its contractors while continuing to encourage the iraqi government to take a greater role in its own affairs the incident was the subject of discussions between secretary of state condoleezza rice and iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki in new york this week the state department said "i think its a very serious tension and one that this case exacerbates " said rep david price a north carolina democrat who has been working on legislation that will hold u s contractors to federal law he said he believes the three year old immunity agreement exempting contractors from iraqi oversight is "virtually sure to be withdrawn" by iraq such a move would have huge implications for an industry that is being called on to provide security on some of the most dangerous streets in the world "if security contractors dont have confidence in the legal system or due process they are going to be loath to put their employees in the field " said doug brooks head of the international peace operations association a trade organization based in washington that represents blackwater as well as other security and military contractors restricting the use of security contractors in iraq would have a huge effect on the myriad agencies international organizations and companies that couldnt work there without private guards iraqis comprise the majority of the estimated to private security guards employed in iraq by foreign firms and the local firms that work for them former u s soldiers and law enforcement officers command a premium blackwater one of the largest of the u s firms has approximately employees in iraq security contractors have become an important issue at the highest levels of the defense department as well defense secretary robert gates told a senate committee yesterday that he has concerns about security contractors oversight in iraq and how their work affects u s military operations a group from the pentagon is also in iraq currently looking into their use "my concern is whether there has been sufficient accountability and oversight in the region over the activities of these security companies " mr gates said "and thats the main thing that our team is looking into out there whether what is required to give the commanders the means and the resources that they need to be able to exercise adequate oversight " the defense department has security contractors in iraq according to the latest quarterly census an increase from before the recent troop surge deputy secretary of defense gordon england has also sent a memo to senior u s commanders that said they are authorized by military law to "disarm apprehend and detain" defense department contractors that operate "outside the scope of their authorized mission" or commit felonies in violation of other rules the pentagon believes that the military extraterritorial jurisdiction act and uniform code of military justice can be effective legal tools to prosecute defense department contractors the companies charged by the american government with keeping diplomats safe in iraq have walked a fine line between making sure their clients dont get injured and aggravating an already tense relationship between iraqis and occupying u s forces some companies most visibly blackwater have adopted an aggressive style that often more resembles a military operation than a discreet detail used to protect dignitaries security industry executives say such an approach is necessary in iraq because of the extreme threats posed by roadside bombs and ambushes by insurgents blackwater has defended its tactics by pointing to its record of never having had one of its clients killed or injured in iraq although blackwater has lost some of its own personnel executives with u s security companies that operate in iraq asked about the situation declined to talk on the record one executive said that "in order to protect people in a high threat environment youre going to have to drive fast jump the curb " nevertheless he said that "there need to be controls that whatever actions are taken are appropriate " from oct to sept the state department spent &# million on security contractors in iraq the department has a world wide umbrella security contract that includes blackwater as well as the virginia based companies dyncorp international and triple canopy inc this five year contract is valued at as much as &# billion for each firm and is bid according to the task that needs to be done the state department sets the standards and requirements for these projects including specifying what types of weapons the security forces can use and how much training the guards must have despite the lucrative work in iraq the u s private security industry has been looking beyond baghdad triple canopy this summer bought clayton consultants which has an expertise in kidnapping situations dyncorp which counts security work as only a small portion of its overall business has other u s government contracts including work on drug eradication in countries like afghanistan and international police training and the business plan behind blackwater and its parent the prince group goes well beyond providing security in high threat areas the firms roots are in lifelike military and police training programs which continue to be a core business at its north carolina training grounds other ventures include designing armored vehicles operating and maintaining aircraft and a u s navy contract for mentoring aspiring special operations soldiers for their selection into the services elite fighting forces where many of blackwaters executives including its founder served during their military careers
