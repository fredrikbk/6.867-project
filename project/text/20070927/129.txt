they cant get enough of obama in greenwood s c townsfolk were fired up about his recent visit why ms parks felt miffed greenwood s c when barack obama wants to get a campaign crowd really fired up he tells the story of a whistle stop a few months back in this out of the way town he was having a down day the weather and his mood were both foul and he had driven to greenwood "an hour and a half from anywhere" to keep a promise to a state legislator just a handful of well wishers were there to greet him suddenly the illinois senator heard a voice sing out from the back of the room "fired up ready to go " it came from a tiny woman in a big brimmed church hat she repeated the chant before long everybody joined in and mr obama himself was again feeling the spirit "heres a lesson for you " he said while telling the greenwood story at a rally in carroll iowa this month "if youre fired up and ready to go we can change the world " but beyond mr obamas soapbox rhetoric about greenwood is a more complicated story of small town politics snubs and jealousies and a reminder that even presidential campaigns can be very personal and very local mr obamas appearance in greenwood may have left him fired up but it also left bruised feelings among local democrats and left his campaign with a damage control job that continues to this day the story began in may when mr obama attended a democratic party dinner in columbia the state capital mr obama trailing hillary rodham clinton in both national and state polls is betting that south carolina the main january voting state with a heavy african american population could give him a boost before the bigger primaries in february seated at his table was anne parks who represents parts of greenwood county in the south carolina house of representatives the year old ms parks is an influential figure one of the few african american women in state level elected office and a greenwood mortician the sort of person whom others rely on for advice about fixing their finances or getting their children out of trouble with the law an imposing woman with her hair pulled tight ms parks runs on the slogan "ill be the last one to let you down " "what would it take for me to get your endorsement " mr obama asked ms parks at the dinner her demands were simple "you gotta come to greenwood " had he said no she says she would have stayed neutral in the primary race but on a rainy day in june mr obamas motorcade pulled into greenwood a town of that is scarred by shuttered textile factories and empty storefronts ms parks figured she could easily round up people for an obama rally but the senators campaign aides told her she could only invite for the campaign it was an arithmetic problem the senator had only minutes between stops in more populous cities and according to the campaigns informal time to crowd formula that meant he could give a short talk and shake hands ms parks was aghast aware how angry and disappointed her constituents would be she negotiated the list up to and invited politicians pastors and others but she was seething when mr obama arrived "you have people mad at you and at me " ms parks remembers telling him "why " the senator asked apparently unaware of the size constraint "anybody who wanted to see you should have been able to come " she said among the lucky few was edith childs a county councilwoman known around town as the hat lady for her sizable collection of head wear that day she was wearing brown straw tied with a leopard print scarf another invitee robert tinsley a criminal defense lawyer here suggested ahead of time that ms childs might want to lead her signature fired up cheer a leftover from her civil rights days as mr obama worked the room mr tinsley gave the signal "now is the time ms childs " at first mr obama looked perplexed even concerned as the chant filled the room but by the time the crowd started singing "senator obama will be will be will be our next president " he was smiling broadly and he embraced ms childs on the campaign trail mr obama often describes the chanting this way "and after she did this for about three minutes i gotta admit i started feeling kinda fired up and i was ready to go " but while mr obama hit the road feeling pumped up ms parks was deflated she knew that when her constituents found out that mr obama had paid a stealth visit to greenwood theyd blame her indeed the perceived slight rippled through county democrats especially african americans the next day the newspaper the index journal ran on its front page photos of mr obama ms parks ms childs and other invited guests "this is like sticking a knife in them putting salt in the wound " recalls county democratic party chairwoman elaine gentry "that just made the ones who didnt get to go even madder " floyd nicholson the citys popular mayor says at least people asked him why they werent told of mr obamas visit at morris chapel baptist church the following sunday real estate broker anne gunby asked ms parks crossly "what do i have to do to get on that list " ms gunby says she still supports mr obama but fears many others in greenwood will hold the affair against him "some people are just looking for a reason not to support obama " she says "being overlooked might give them a reason to say they dont need my vote " each time ms parks tried to explain that it wasnt her fault but the damage was done ms childs is tickled that mr obama tells thousands of people around the country about her fired up chant but even she gets an earful from greenwood residents who accuse her of engineering the decision to keep the obama event small "he needs to apologize" to greenwood she says ms parks relentlessly hounds mr obamas staff to schedule another visit pledging to fill a new seat baptist center for him she was pulling her midnight blue cadillac out of a parking place on main street the other day her pet yorkshire terrier on her lap when she spotted obama aide kevin griffis "when is he coming back " she demanded "i dont know yet " mr griffis answered the senator promises to return before the primary but mr griffis hopes that greenwood will notice that mr obama is the only presidential candidate to have opened an office in town and the only democratic candidate to have set foot there during this election season one obama campaign aide says locals dont understand how little time a presidential candidate has to commit to any one city the campaigns county organizer shannon talbert says the best way to overcome any residual anger over mr obamas visit is with a personal touch ms talbert a year old atlanta native spends her days hitting barber shops and beauty salons churches and funeral homes she drops off get well soon cards and remembers to ask about a son having trouble at school ms talbert says she sees progress with the network of obama supporters spreading its way through greenwood besides she told mr griffis that the june faux pas "is not as bad as it seems because a lot of people dont know he was here " but ms parks says mr obama should be careful not to take greenwoods black vote for granted some blacks here back mrs clinton out of loyalty to her husband the former president ms parks says some she says dont believe an african american can win some just like mrs clinton better than they like mr obama in any case ms parks says even a small slight in a small town can make or break his campaign "you never know " she says "i lost an election once by votes "
