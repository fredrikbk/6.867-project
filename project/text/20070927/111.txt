style fashion journal when bloomers dont cut it we scan milans runways for something fit for work the new colors for the office giorgio armani has long been the sort of designer a professional woman can trust he sends her out looking sophisticated in suits and separates just the right side of sexy but im trying to imagine showing up someplace in the silken bloomers that mr armani sent down the catwalk here in milan this week the milan runway shows are famous for producing readily salable designer collections but even here it takes a real search to find designers who consistently create clothes that work for mature working or active women in an effort to grab the attention of easily bored fashion editors trusted brands sometimes go in new directions like mr armanis bloomers or like the collection shown this week by jil sanders designer raf simons which was too revealing and frothy for the wardrobes of the professional women who have been the brands loyalists in the program for his show mr armani suggested that the bloomers convey a certain "nonchalance " that might appeal to young customers but surely he was also using them to try to generate a sense of excitement and novelty its hard to get attention if youre on the conservative edge and it can require subtler design skills "being too practical is limiting from a design point " says designer graeme black who showed his last collection for ferragamo this week still i came here this week looking for designers who have taken real women in all their sizes and shapes and activities into careful consideration bottega veneta designer tomas maier is one of them his eyes light up when discussing the women he considers his clients the "women with bad legs who always wear pants the women with big hips with little hips with big busts " mr maier enjoys designing clothes to fit the elasticity of actual bodies he claims to have no muse but many women friends and he installs darts and tucks and pleats on the inside of a garment to flatter a real womans figure mr maier says that his garments have an "inner life " and hes talking about structure one graceful dress for the spring season has a soft inner bustier that allows the exterior pleating to appear loose a dying label just a decade ago mr maiers bottega is now among gucci groups top selling brands bottegas collection for next spring spans from casual wear to clothes that would look good in any boardroom theres plenty in the khaki sand and other neutral tones that a lawyer or accountant could wear to the office if her wallet could withstand the bottega hit most of us of course have to wait for more affordable derivatives to show up in stores all the more reason to cheer on those standard bearers who create for real women perhaps the key to bottega venetas clothes is that they arent intended to be the stars of the show "i like a woman who doesnt actually like overpowering clothes i want to see her face " mr maier says at his own show graeme black has come up with a collection full of daywear that is eye catching yet will often cover your bra straps now finished with ferragamo mr black is concentrating full time on building his own brand he attributes many of its touches to the trunk shows he has been using to build his fledgling company which sells in about stores and had roughly &# million in sales last year he hopes to add more stores this year the trunk shows where he personally pitches his wares in stores put him in contact with real women and "help me understand what women want " mr black says for instance the loose less structured cuts of his bolero jackets and dresses come from comments from customers who have said they want to feel comfortable and not overly tailored both mr maier and mr black adhered to one big milan trend that may be helpful to professional women color schemes that involve neutral understated or earthy tones that is unlike the frilly floral prints and pastel shades that we saw a lot of at new york fashion week two weeks ago the colors here have been as drab and unremarkable as the boardroom which can be a good thing another line that deserves mention is the collection was chock full of smart dresses and skirts that could inspire respect for women who wear them to make a marketing presentation or to meet with clients on tuesday miuccia prada took earthy to deep levels with dark greens maroons and browns featured in a romantic collection of silk prints and checked knits ms prada is a true trend setter in fashion and we can count on seeing a lot of her weirdly mesmerizing checks flowers and flared pants but except for the elongated cardigans few of the clothes would work in most offices email christina binkley wsj com
