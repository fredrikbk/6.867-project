job references you cant control job interviewees beware your prospective boss may have called your references before you walk through the door and they may not be the contacts you provided professional networking sites such as linkedin corp and jobster inc are making it easier for employers to get in touch with people who have worked with job candidates in the past or know them personally recruiters say they use such sites where people create online profiles and then link to professional colleagues who are also members to find mutual connections they can hit up for information many hiring managers say they even check to see if they have mutual connections with a candidate on facebook and myspace the popular social networking sites the trend which started mostly with web savvy recruiters in the technology industry is now spreading to other industries such as human resources and financial services says cathy henesey talent acquisition leader at appliance maker american standard cos recruiters typically use networking sites to check on entry level and midlevel job seekers she says but even professionals and ceos have experienced the practice often referred to as "informal reference checking " traditionally recruiters call references after a thorough face to face interview the contacts are provided by the job seekers and are typically people who are likely to provide a positive recommendation but for a growing number of job seekers linkedin now has million members networking sites have "completely changed everything " says dennis smith senior recruiting manager at t mobile usa a unit of deutsche telekom ag now recruiters can access entire personal networks says mr smith who checks facebook linkedin and jobster for mutual connections before he interviews a candidate in person because online contact lists are typically viewable right on members profile pages hiring managers can quickly identify relevant contacts and confidentially message these people through the networking site such reference checking exposes job seekers to certain risks many site users routinely connect online to people they have only a glancing relationship with say someone who simply works at the same company and there is no guarantee that the references will be favorable but such checking can work to a job seekers advantage too chandan mahajan says his linkedin profile which lists his previous work experience displays eight recommendations from former colleagues and shows that he has more than connections online helped him land a job in may as a business development manager for wipro technologies the global information technology services business of wipro ltd the recruiters at wipro "did say there were a couple of people they knew in my network " says mr mahajan years old of east brunswick n j wipro technologies confirms that it contacted some of mr mahajans connections after the first interview "we did every informal reference check " says madhulika goel the companys manager of strategic resourcing in fact wipro didnt ask him for a standard resume during initial interviews opting instead to use mr mahajans online profile for job seekers "its kind of a caution and an empowerment " says jobster ceo jason goldberg if your online profile is clean and you are connected to people through social networks who would say favorable things about your abilities it may help you land the job he says some recruiters believe the tactic can backfire "you have to be careful referencing people who have jobs because you might blow them out of their jobs " says chuck wardell managing director at executive recruiter korn ferry internationals eastern region he says he may perform an initial google search check whether the job candidate has written any articles and make sure the candidate has the degrees listed on the resume but he doesnt use networking sites and he doesnt call references "before they have a bona fide job offer " the risk of tipping off the candidates current employer is too high the practice which recruiters say helps save companies time and money on face to face interviews is the latest way employers and recruiters are using popular sites to hunt for talent they are already scouring facebook news corp s myspace and linkedin for passive job candidates and using the sites to learn more about active job hunters whether it be from information in their profile or the photos they post online "its just an aspect of what we can do because we are all so connected " says mr smith at t mobile "a persons online presence is just an integral part of their life at this point " social and professional networking sites are adding features that make it easier for recruiters to learn more about prospective job candidates and their connections jobster is planning on launching today a feature that allows job seekers to invite colleagues to write recommendations online that would be visible to recruiters linkedin which already has a similar recommendation feature plans to announce today that it will allow users to add photos to their profiles a feature that could help make job seekers more recognizable to industry recruiters who may know them recruiting experts say that job seekers should be careful about choosing people to connect with on networking sites this month charles moore managing partner at abba wireless executive search group used linkedin and myspace to contact two customers and a former co worker of a job candidate who was interviewing for a director of sales position at a large company mr moore says he typically contacts references he finds online before sending a candidate to a client "what i found out through reference checks is that the person was tough to work with and get along with " says mr moore he didnt pass on the candidate to his client steven rothberg president and founder of collegerecruiter com a jobs site for college students and recent graduates recommends extra precautions for job hunters who are worried that their online profiles could hurt their chances some sites allow members to adjust the privacy settings on a profile so that your contacts cant be viewed by other members he notes "if you are the kind of person who has good friends who will reflect well upon you then its a good idea for the employer to be calling those friends " says mr rothberg "if you are going to have friends who are at best questionable in dealing with a potential employer on your behalf you are probably better off not having those friends visible in your network " even top brass can be subject to thorough reference checks dan nye chief executive officer at linkedin says that the company did reference checks on him without his knowledge before calling him in for a face to face interview with former ceo reid hoffman mr nye says he wasnt bothered by the companys digging "in the year its fair game " mr nye says "hiring is such an important decision and information about people is very public these days " he joined the company in february
