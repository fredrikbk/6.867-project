book excerpt exit ghost online edition  the present moment i hadnt been in new york in eleven years other than for surgery in boston to remove a cancerous prostate id hardly been off my rural mountain road in the berkshires in those eleven years and whats more had rarely looked at a newspaper or listened to the news since three years back with no sense of loss merely at the outset a kind of drought within me i had ceased to inhabit not just the great world but the present moment the impulse to be in it and of it i had long since killed but now id driven the hundred and thirty miles south to manhattan to see a urologist at mount sinai hospital who specialized in performing a procedure to help the thousands of men like me left incontinent by prostate surgery by going in through a catheter inserted in the urethra to inject a gelatinous form of collagen where the neck of the bladder meets the urethra he was getting significant improvement in about fifty percent of his patients these werent great odds especially as "significant improvement" meant only a partial alleviation of the symptoms reducing "severe incontinence" to "moderate incontinence" or "moderate" to "light " still because his results were better than those that other urologists had achieved using roughly the same technique there was nothing to be done about the other hazard of radical prostatectomy that i like tens of thousands of others had not been lucky enough to escape nerve damage resulting in impotence i went to new york for a consultation long after i imagined myself as having adapted to the practical inconveniences of the condition in the years since the surgery i even thought id surmounted the shaming side of wetting oneself overcome the disorienting shock that had been particularly trying in the first year and a half during the months when the surgeon had given me reason to think that the incontinence would gradually disappear over time as it does in a small number of fortunate patients but despite the dailiness of the routine necessary to keep myself clean and odor free i must never truly have become accustomed to wearing the special undergarments and changing the pads and dealing with the "accidents " any more than i had mastered the underlying humiliation because there i was at the age of seventy one back on the upper east side of manhattan not many blocks from where id once lived as a vigorous healthy younger man there i was in the reception area of the urology department of mount sinai hospital about to be assured that with the permanent adherence of the collagen to the neck of the bladder i had a chance of exerting somewhat more control over my urine flow than an infant waiting there envisioning the procedure sitting and flipping through the piled up copies of people and new york magazine i thought entirely beside the point turn around and go home id been alone these past eleven years in a small house on a dirt road in the deep country having decided to live apart like that some two years before the cancer was diagnosed i see few people since the death a year earlier of my neighbor and friend larry hollis two three days can go by when i speak to no one but the housekeeper who comes to clean each week and her husband who is my caretaker i dont go to dinner parties i dont go to movies i dont watch television i dont own a cell phone or a vcr or a dvd player or a computer i continue to live in the age of the typewriter and have no idea what the world wide web is i no longer bother to vote i write for most of the day and often into the night i read mainly the books that i first discovered as a student the masterpieces of fiction whose power over me is no less and in some cases greater than it was in my initial exciting encounters with them lately ive been rereading joseph conrad for the first time in fifty years most recently the shadow line which id brought with me to new york to look through yet again having read it all in one go only the other night i listen to music i hike in the woods when its warm i swim in my pond whose temperature even in summer never gets much above seventy degrees i swim there without a suit out of sight of everyone so that if in my wake i leave a thin billowing cloud of urine that visibly discolors the surrounding pond waters im largely unperturbed and feel nothing like the chagrin that would be sure to crush me should my bladder involuntarily begin emptying itself while i was swimming in a public pool there are plastic underpants with strongly elasticized edges designed for incontinent swimmers that are advertised as watertight but when after much equivocation i went ahead and ordered a pair from a pool supply catalogue and tried them out in the pond i found that though wearing these biggish white bloomers beneath a bathing suit diminished the problem it was not sufficiently eradicated to subdue my self consciousness rather than take the chance of embarrassing myself and offending others i gave up on the idea of swimming regularly down at the college pool for the bulk of the year with bloomers under my suit and continued to confine myself to sporadically yellowing the waters of my own pond during the berkshires few months of warm weather when rain or shine i do my laps for half an hour every day a couple of times a week i go down the mountain into athena eight miles away to shop for groceries to get my clothes cleaned occasionally to eat a meal or buy a pair of socks or pick up a bottle of wine or use the athena college library tanglewood isnt far away and i drive over to a concert there some ten times during the summer i dont give readings or lectures or teach at a college or appear on tv when my books are published i keep to myself i write every day of the week otherwise im silent i am tempted by the thought of not publishing at all isnt the work all i need the work and the working what does it matter any longer if im incontinent
