politics &amp economics disconnect over childrens health plan for poor stalls as president congress debate governments role washington expanding health care for poor children was supposed to be easy or at least easier than a lot of other health care issues facing congress but tension between lawmakers and the white house is bogging down efforts to renew the childrens health insurance program known as chip the stumbles despite cooperation between parties is a worrisome sign for democrats seeking to make their agenda from spending bills to iraq policy into reality at the heart of the fight which could come to a head next week with a presidential veto is a simple question how involved should the government be in paying for health care for the uninsured president bush says congress is spending too much to subsidize families who can afford private coverage democrats and some republicans say expanding the program is the best way to provide insurance to more of the nearly nine million children who lack it complicating matters further the debate has unfolded amid a presidential campaign in which democratic and republican candidates are taking starkly different stances on health care because congress will likely pass a patch to keep chip running past its sept expiration the argument is set to run for months when democrats took the majority in congress this year they cited the expansion of chip as a priority even as mr bush took a harder line against growth in the program the bill now moving through congress represents a middle ground between what many democrats wanted and what mr bush said he would support democratic lawmakers scaled back their ambitions on both spending and policy in the interest of taking a unified stand the bill which the house passed tuesday and the senate may pass as soon as today would spend an additional &# billion over five years on chip it would be paid for as required under budget rules mandating that new expenditures be offset with added revenue or spending cuts with an increase in the federal tobacco tax amounting to a cent increase for every pack of cigarettes an estimated million uninsured children would gain coverage with million being picked up by the medicaid program for the poor the other two million will go into chip which targets children whose families earn too much for medicaid yet the congress and white house have little incentive to work together democrats are eager to spar with the white house on the popular issue of covering kids and see a chance for a political win ahead of the elections mr bush meanwhile wants to rally the support of conservatives and portray the democratic congress as fiscally irresponsible and ineffective "despite all the good will and interest in trying to find a better way to cover the uninsured i can understand why there are frustrations on all sides that we havent been able to do better than this " said mark mcclellan a former white house policy adviser who also headed medicare and medicaid in the bush administration in some ways after difficult negotiations the bill turned out to be an unusual example of cooperation in talks with two senate republicans house democrats compromised they cut new spending from &# billion to &# billion gave up an effort to cover legal immigrants and young adults and dropped cuts to private health insurers operating in medicare the final deal includes many nods to republicans though most republicans in the house and senate oppose it as an irresponsible expansion of government spending it reduces federal funding for states that enroll children from families with incomes above about &# a year for a family of four it bars the federal government from allowing any more states to use chip funds to cover parents and it phases out coverage of childless adults that some states include in chip to tilt the program toward poorer children the bill calls for states not meeting enrollment benchmarks for the lowest income children by october to give up chip funds for enrollees above of the poverty level "weve given up a little bit because we want to get legislation done " said finance committee chairman max baucus democrat of montana a lead negotiator of the deal republican senator charles grassley of iowa another top senate negotiator on the bill said chip became bogged down by the white houses toughened stance on fiscal issues "i dont think its a case of just this bill " he said instead sen grassley said "the president is playing catch up realizing that he made a mistake that he didnt veto a lot of bills when the republicans were in control of congress " on tuesday night the house approved the final chip bill to which leaves democrats more than votes short of the amount needed to override mr bushs expected veto democrats must decide soon whether to try to override the veto or to modify the bill to pick up more support eight democrats voted against the legislation in some cases balking at the size of the tobacco tax forty five republicans many of them headed for tough election fights in supported the bill white house officials say mr bush wants to lay the groundwork for a greater private sector role in covering the uninsured in his view chip and medicaid are fine for children below of the poverty line which is about &# a year for a family of four but people above that income level should be helped through tax changes to buy their own private insurance this year big tax changes appear unlikely to become law and so far republicans and the white house havent coalesced around an alternative to the chip expansion that has momentum in the short term that makes it more difficult even for republicans sympathetic to mr bushs view to sustain a fight against the popular idea of more health insurance for children
