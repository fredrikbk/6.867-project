south africas one party rule cape town post apartheid south africa is a democracy with an asterisk only one party the african national congress wins elections the anc controls the presidency parliament all nine provinces and large municipalities then there is cape town this port city of million is a rare laboratory in africa of multiparty democracy at work in the months since the democratic alliance won city hall the local anc bosses have tried by hook or by crook to unseat the countrys only prominent non anc mayor helen zille without luck so far in may ms zille also became leader of her party the local power struggle takes place against the backdrop of the most politically critical time for south africa since at its national conference in december the ruling anc picks a new leader and probable successor to president thabo mbeki who must leave office in no obvious heir apparent has emerged an even bigger uncertainty the next presidents commitment to multiparty multiracial democracy africa is littered with former liberation movements that succumbed to racial scapegoating and authoritarianism just cross over the border into robert mugabes zimbabwe the story from cape town is sobering in the spring of the democratic alliance won of the vote in municipal elections against the ancs and formed a coalition with two smaller parties the anc were sore losers at a rally in a poor black neighborhood party activists hurled chairs at ms zille who is white forcing her to flee in a speech soon after the poll the partys provincial chairman james ngculu said "we in the anc strenuously reject any calls that we should allow the democratic alliance to rule " several months later the provincial government tried by fiat to strip the mayor of executive powers by ms zilles count the anc has sought to remove her on seven occasions add to that list the recent attempt to get the party and its coalition supporters in the municipal council to "cross over" to the anc and take away her majority offering ms zille tells me bribes of rand or &# each also this month police in a poor part of cape town arrested her for marching in a rally against the local drug lords ms zille accused the regional government of "using state resources to settle political battles" and trying to prevent her party from making inroads with black voters ms zille credits president mbeki for intervening on her behalf at critical moments last year its important she says "that an element in the anc recognizes they must learn to lose elections " after her arrest this month the ancs national secretary general kgalema motlanthe criticized the police for failing to treat ms zille with the "dignity that her office calls for " as a journalist ms zille helped expose anti apartheid activist steve bikos murder in police custody she later was active in cape town anti apartheid politics now ms zille follows in the footsteps of another helen who espoused liberalism helen suzman who for years was sole member of the old south african parliament opposed to apartheid as in those days ms zille says that "people are still judged by the color of their skin not the content of their character " the anc uses "nationalism and racial mobilization" to hold on to power keeping the country riven along sectarian lines in the way apartheid rulers did "its just as easy and tempting for the new power elite to use race just as the old one did " she says "the big issue here is are we going to descend into the closed patronage society in which your chances in life are going to be determined by your race and your closeness to people in power or are your chances in life going to be determined by your commitment your ability your work ethic " says ms zille "if we go the wrong way well end up like zimbabwe if we go the right way well end up closer to the united states " the outcome is sure to reverberate across africa for years now the democratic alliance has attacked the ancs corruption as well as its shortcomings on crime aids and health and education all issues of great concern to the black majority the mbeki government mostly marxists whove reconciled with business surprised by managing the economy well but the alliance wins the bulk of its support from white including former pro apartheid and mixed race voters it has barely dented the ancs near total hold on the black electorate "they say things that need to be said but because it comes from a white dominated party it is dismissed " says barney mthombothi editor of the financial mail weekly will the democratic alliance the countrys second biggest party ever win nationally "not in my lifetime " ms zille says "its a total miracle that im a mayor quite frankly we didnt think we had a hope in hell in the last election " if the anc splits on the other hand the democratic alliance might yet join forces with its liberally inclined moderates wholl be willing to cross racial lines she muses and put in place the foundation of a true multi party system perhaps then the "rainbow nation" will deserve the name mr kaminski is editorial page editor of the wall street journal europe
