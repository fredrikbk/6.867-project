sandisks new chip plant in shanghai set to open a new sandisk corp factory in china for assembling and testing flash memory products for mobile phones adds to an influx of semiconductor companies investing in high tech plants in the worlds biggest developing economy the new plant will churn out memory based chip packages that combine flash chips with a controller these packages are becoming more valuable in mobile phones where space is limited sandisk milpitas calif is one of the worlds biggest producers of flash memory storage devices flash chips are widely used in mobile phones digital cameras and music players the &# million facility which sandisk is scheduled to formally open today is in shanghais zizhu science park and initially will employ more than workers already sandisk has invested &# million to date and plans more to continue its investment sandisk said it chose zizhu science park for its proximity to two universities jiaotong university and huadong university where it was able to recruit a significant number of engineers "this is a major investment in back end manufacturing in china " sandisk chairman and chief executive eli harari said in an interview "the opportunity that we see is volume for our mobile cards that go into cellphones that volume is growing at a very fast rate and cellphones are becoming the biggest market opportunity for mobile cards " sandisk joins a growing list of global technology firms setting up a production site in china to tap rising demand for chips used in mobile devices and other consumer electronics china is the worlds biggest market for cellphones and the second biggest for personal computers and its factories produce many of the cellphones and pcs sold in other markets lower manufacturing costs and the chinese governments willingness to attract foreign investment in its chip sector have lured companies including chip makers intel corp of the u s hynix semiconductor inc of south korea and stmicroelectronics nv of switzerland intel this year said it would invest &# billion in a new factory in dalian china to make chips its first chip fabrication plant in the developing world hynix in agreed to set up a &# billion plant in wuxi in chinas jiangsu province through a joint venture with stmicroelectronics sandisks new plant will be a "back end" facility meaning that it wont make chips from silicon wafers like the plants from intel or hynix sandisk will test and assemble components that are manufactured at its plants in japan sandisk operates other chip manufacturing plants through an agreement with japans toshiba corp it is also in talks with hynix to build another chip manufacturing facility investing in its own back end facility in china is important for sandisk mr harari said because the production base will allow the company to be closer to its major customers and also serve as the center for sandisks operations for planning finance and basic logistics in asia sandisks move to build its own back end facility comes as many other global chip makers are relying more on third party vendors to assemble and test their products sandisk this month disclosed that it is being investigated by the u s justice department over alleged anticompetitive practices in the flash memory chip market mr harari said the flash memory market has been "a very competitive market "
