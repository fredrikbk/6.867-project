corporations shouldnt be democracies securities and exchange commission chairman christopher cox faces a critical decision oct is the deadline for comment on two different proposed sec rules for governing director elections in u s corporations one "proxy access" rule backed by the secs democratic commissioners would transform u s corporate law by requiring companies to pay the expenses of dissident shareholders seeking to replace the companys board or directors the other a "no access" rule backed by the agencys republicans preserves longstanding regulations that discourage shareholder activism by requiring that dissidents use their own funds to mount a proxy fight the chairman holds the swing vote that will determine which rule is passed mr cox should vote "no access " the proposed proxy access rule is driven by the emotional claim unsupported by evidence that american corporations benefit from "shareholder democracy " successful corporations are not and never have been democratic institutions since the public corporation first evolved over a century ago u s law has discouraged shareholders from taking an active role in corporate governance and this "hands off" approach has proven a recipe for tremendous success according to the economist of the worlds largest corporations are american japan which is also famously unfriendly to shareholders is runner up with six of the largest firms while germany and france tie for third place with three each no other nation on earth comes close in terms of nurturing great corporations companies seem to succeed best when they are controlled by boards of directors not by shareholders why one obvious advantage of board control is more informed and efficient decision making an even more important factor however is that board control "locks in" and protects corporate assets and investment capital corporations typically pursue projects that require huge sunk cost investments in the th and th centuries they built railroads canals and factories today they design complex software and electronics produce new drugs and medical treatments and create valuable trademarks and brand names board control over corporate assets protects those assets and gives them time to work allowing shareholders collectively to recoup the value of their initial investment and then some over the long haul conversely long term investment becomes impossible if shareholders have the power to drain cash out of the firm at any time say by threatening to remove directors who refuse to cut expenses or sell assets in order to pay shareholders a special dividend or fund a massive share repurchase program whether out of ignorance greed or short sightedness these are exactly the sorts of threats that todays activist shareholders usually at hedge funds typically make consider carl icahns demand this past spring that motorola undertake a massive stock buyback program at a time when the company desperately needed to invest in research and development to produce a successor product to its razr cellphone by giving activists even greater leverage over boards the secs proposed proxy access rule will undermine american corporations ability to do exactly what investors and the larger society want them to do pursue big long term innovative business projects for evidence of this we need only compare the u s experience with that of our anglo saxon corporate cousins across the atlantic american corporate law severely limits shareholders rights so does japanese german and french corporate law in contrast the united kingdom seems a paradise for shareholders in the u k shareholders can call a meeting to remove the board of directors at any time they can pass resolutions telling boards to take certain actions they are entitled to vote on dividends and ceo pay and they can force a board to accept a hostile takeover bid the board would prefer to reject in the u s boards can "just say no " yet the u k is headquarters to just one and a half of the worlds largest companies bp and the "royal" half of royal dutch shell even the tiny netherlands has nurtured more great corporations to the u k s if shareholder democracy were good for corporations and investors the u k would be a corporate powerhouse instead its an also ran in the global race for corporate competitiveness the sec shouldnt mess with u s corporate success shareholder democracy is a shallow idea based on a fundamental misunderstanding of what makes good companies tick chairman cox and the sec should reject it ms stout is a law professor at ucla and the principal investigator for the ucla sloan foundation research program on business organizations see related letters "letters to the editor the elected and the electors in corporate board governance" wsj oct
