retail security where customers are guilty until proven innocent let me see if ive got this right laura landro was willing to do business with her local kmart even though its display was unkempt and in disarray by taking it on herself to do what arguably a store employee should do find the packaging for the item she wanted "the accidental thief " personal journal sept a security agent witnessed this incident but made no effort to help her on the floor nor did he bring it to the cashiers attention while ms landro was checking out instead he detained her "conducted an investigation" that lasted over an hour refunded her purchase instead of charging her the difference banished her from the store for life and inadvertently generated negative publicity for the store in a national newspaper when presented with the details of this broken unhelpful and unprofitable system of loss prevention sears confirmed that their security "appears to have done its job correctly " from a business perspective wouldnt it be more advantageous to actually prevent the incident in its entirety with properly managed displays and proactive help rather than automatically assuming ones customers are criminals and we wonder why u s retailing is such a moribund industry trebor fenstermaker laurel md it is symptomatic of so many poorly run businesses particularly retailers and airlines to focus on internal operational issues rather than on good customers much like the circumstances of flying in coach class this form of treatment by retailers forces consumers to consider alternatives to the negative shopping experiences encountered today no online shopping isnt killing retail the retailers are committing their own form of suicide carey turoff monroe n y ms landros unhappy experience with the security people at kmart is indeed annoying and im sure that if it happened to me id also say im never going to kmart again however as one of the customers who has to help pay for the annual retail shrinkage i applaud kmarts aggressive efforts to stop it im tempted to say that ill start shopping at kmart now that i know theyre doing everything they can to prevent shoplifting in all its variations and to keep prices down lee dembart los angeles your article summarized what many people who shop at scrappy discounters experience on a regular basis a degrading interaction when a customer has to deal with understaffed and improperly stocked stores inefficient check out procedures and sometimes overzealous and ill advised security personnel in my opinion once ms landro placed all of the items she was purchasing on the check out counter it was up to kmart to determine proper pricing packaging and close the sale since she didnt conceal anything on her person she shouldnt be held responsible for an unorganized stores mistakes the fact that kmart would waste this much manpower not to mention goodwill on an &# price deviation especially since this customer spent &# indicates how foolish they are there should be laws protecting consumers from this type of false detention and humiliation if kmart is going to assume that customers are guilty until proven innocent they shouldnt be in the retail business in the first place carl g esposito brooklyn n y in a past life i was an executive in the retail industry while i wasnt specifically responsible for security and "shrink " i had plenty of exposure to it including many training seminars on its various forms emptying a box in the aisle and putting another item in it is one of the most common forms of stealing and those who do it are surprisingly bold about acting natural and they arent secretive when they do it in many locations not just "bad neighborhoods " it is quite possible for security personnel to observe several label switches or other forms of minor theft each evening you might consider writing an article after spending an evening with a store crew and see what they see barry horwit newton mass
