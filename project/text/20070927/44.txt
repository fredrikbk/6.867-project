helicopter parenting a breakdown among my many private worries as a parent ive wondered if i hover too much new research on helicopter parents confirms it i am one i have plenty of company an estimated to of college parents qualify as helicopter parents and they come from all socioeconomic groups based on a thought provoking study of officials professors and staff at universities the study which is drawing attention on campuses moves the helicopter parent debate onto new ground by identifying types of parental hovercraft ranging from benign to pathological theres room to disagree on the boundaries of healthy parental involvement with college age students the focus of the research nevertheless i found the typology a helpful lens for sizing up my parenting if youre wondering where you stand here are a few of the most distinct types the blackhawk parent among the most damaging types this parent "comes in with guns blazing " demanding action says patricia somers an associate professor at the university of texas austin and lead author on the study one problem says jim settle vice president student affairs at shawnee state university portsmouth ohio and a co author is that "they start at the presidents office regardless of the issue " blackhawk parents set bad problem solving examples and hamper their childrens independence the toxic parent these parents meddle in intrusive ways that imply the student is untrustworthy or ill equipped parents at several schools dr somers says obtained their childrens log on information researched prospective roommates on facebook then masqueraded as their children online to request roommate assignments one couple cited separately in the study installed a nanny cam in their sons dorm room the student was aware of the nanny cam but didnt know mom and dad also planted an electronic transmitter in his car when he strayed to a nearby city in his car they withdrew him from college the consumer advocate college officials tend to dislike these parents who regard higher education as a consumer transaction and negotiate tirelessly for discounts educators say providing an education is more than that and doesnt always mean keeping the customer happy but with the average total cost of a year in a private college topping &# according to the college board im not sure parents have a choice consumer advocates consider themselves "co purchasers" entitled to all the same information and staff access as their children researchers say many err in expecting a "warranty " the study says a post graduation job guarantee but they also can serve as valuable models of effective consumer advocacy nancy brown says she couldnt afford more than four years college tuition for her daughter and she doubts her daughter would have made it through that quickly without ms browns involvement her daughters email requests for her advisers help registering for classes during a semester abroad were ignored it took an email from ms brown of kansas city mo to spark a response the safety expert these anxious parents more numerous since the virginia tech shootings want to know about security plans and lockdown times dr somers says dr settle says he expects parents to ask about emergency plans but some cross the line by demanding copies of fire inspection records and confidential emergency operations manuals while such parents can be overprotective they also with some restraint can teach valuable safety lessons the traffic and rescue helicopters these terms coined by an official at saint josephs university philadelphia cover parenting types regarded as benign the traffic helicopter gives advice and guidance but leaves decision making up to the student the rescue helicopter my category rushes in to help with supplies and support in a crisis admittedly i may be on the phone with my daughter a sophomore too much several times a week last winter i hopped a plane to spend a weekend with her during a low time to me the complexity of todays campus life warrants extra parental support only time will tell whether my methods are wise email sue shellenbarger wsj com
