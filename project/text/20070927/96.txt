posh or not we check out hotel club floors hotels have long coddled patrons who want vip service in premium "club floors " now they are engaging in a pampering arms race club floors typically have given guests access to a private lounge and some free food and drinks they also often offer a bit more security restricting access to the floors to club guests only and now facing increased competition and rising demand from travelers major chains are adding more perks to the hotel industry equivalent of that exclusive space behind the velvet rope in december starwood hotels &amp resorts

hoyt h harper senior vice president brand management at starwood but staying on a club floor can be expensive about &# beyond the cost of a regular room in some cases hotels also use upgrades to club floors to reward their most loyal customers to find out if the vip pampering is worth the extra cash we checked into club rooms at hotels in new york chicago atlanta los angeles and austin texas while we certainly appreciated the gratis goodies especially the breakfast champagne in atlanta in some cases the fee seemed a bit steep for what we got we paid &# plus tax for a room on the club floor at the westin chicago river north also a starwood hotel compared with &# for a regular "deluxe" room we got a deal the hotel says a club floor room is normally &# more than a standard room the room was spacious and nicely decorated in a minimalist style we loved the chaise longue with a fantastic view of some of the citys skyscrapers club floor rooms are often on high floors but we could have had a virtually identical room on a nonclub floor without paying the higher rate still our club floor room did have some neat extras including an imac and a clock radio with a docking station for our ipod but the hotels club lounge left us underwhelmed it had the same sleek look as the rooms but the food and drink offerings were pretty skimpy and the background music was doctors office cheesy afternoon snacks consisted primarily of a couple of lukewarm pizzas a container of chicken wings and a fruit salad alcoholic drinks cost extra "it is just meant to be a nosh " said peter simoncelli the hotels general manager of the afternoon meal service breakfast was more extensive but still fairly modest with cereals pastries yogurt and a nice display of fresh berries at the ritz carlton buckhead in atlanta however we were constantly eating there are five different food "presentations" a day we started with afternoon tea with warm scones and tea sandwiches moved on to evening snacks with a selection of cheeses salmon "wellington" and sushi rolls and wound up the night with evening cocktails and desserts there was free flowing booze champagne was available even during breakfast the libations likely contributed to a friendly cocktail party atmosphere we were invited to join a group of gregarious strangers for a drink including a couple from los angeles who said they didnt eat outside of the club lounge during their entire trip another couple seemed to park themselves in the lounge all day and made liberal use of the champagne they became louder and gigglier as time went on we ended up staying up way past our bedtime the club floor lounge was comfortable and service was generally excellent the concierge made us a new key when we locked ours in our room so we didnt have to haul ourselves down to the reception desk but when we asked for help with a dinner reservation she pointed us to a large book of menus made a couple of suggestions but then said she hadnt eaten in the ones she recommended "the concierge should be knowledegable " said ritz carltons paul westbrook senior vice president product and brand management "pointing to a book is probably not the standard we are looking for " the premium for our club floor room here was the steepest we paid &# plus tax compared with &# for a regular "quality" room at times the club lounge at the sheraton new york hotel &amp towers was a nice respite from the frenetic lobby of this big busy midtown hotel there are rooms but several guests used it to make frequent and loud cellphone calls a television blared even when no one was watching still the lounge was spacious with a separate bar area alcoholic drinks cost extra a pleasant nautical theme and stunning views of manhattan breakfast was a fairly extensive

on one of the promised club floor amenities our robe was missing the first thing we learned about the club lounge when we checked into our club floor room at the hyatt regency century plaza in los angeles was that it was closed the desk clerk first said the lounge was shuttered for repairs but later said it was closed because there werent enough people staying on the lounge floor to justify opening it he apologized for the inconvenience and informed us that we would keep our room on the club floor but would be charged for only a standard room &# instead of &# a night we also got a &# voucher for breakfast at starbucks or the hotel restaurant for the next morning to make up for missing the continental breakfast offered in the lounge we appreciated the gesture but it did us little good as we had skipped lunch planning instead to grab a light snack and drinks at the lounge before a late dinner "we should have made an earlier decision to close the club and notified the customer of course " said david horowitz the hotels general manager we did stop by the lounge on a day it was open and it was serene and bright with flat screen television sets and several computers club floor
