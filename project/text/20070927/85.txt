operas new york season lucia and margaret garner lucia di lammermoor metropolitan opera through oct there will be three additional performances in march margaret garner new york city opera saturday new york director mary zimmerman making her metropolitan opera debut was the featured attraction of the companys opening night production of donizettis "lucia di lammermoor" on monday but natalie dessays incandescent performance of the title role stole the show the tiny french soprano possesses spellbinding vocal allure an intense onstage physicality and the uncanny ability to connect the two every vocal roulade and gesture reflected the developing and deteriorating character of the unfortunate heroine the ornaments of her act i aria were the joyous laughter of a young girl in love for the first time the wedding hallucination in the middle of her mad scene became a time stopping moment of dreamy eroticism ms dessays performance was of a piece with the production which lifted "lucia" out of the realm of operatic cliche lovers are divided by clan rivalry brother forces dependent sister to marry his own ally bride murders unwanted husband on their wedding night and goes mad into real theater ms zimmerman updated the opera to the late th century dispensing with kilts and baronial splendor in favor of victorian morning coats pearl colored ball gowns and gaslight chandeliers daniel ostling designed the set mara blumenfeld the costumes this made enrico ashtons savage treatment of his sister all the more vicious since it was concealed under a veneer of civilization the production also moved subtly between the very naturalistic a wild corner of the woods with bare trees a rustic fountain and a stunning purple sunrise courtesy of lighting designer t j gerckens for lucias act i encounter with her lover edgardo and the abstract the mad scene is played out in front of a curving wooden staircase with an enormous moon on the backdrop a few directorial touches also added depth when lucia imagines the ghost of a murdered girl in act i the specter appears touches her cheek and disappears into the spring lucia herself turns up as a ghost during edgardos final aria she guides the dagger with which he kills himself in despair over her death the director also had an ingenious solution for the famous sextet of act ii usually a moment of desperate stasis onstage a hired photographer set up a shot with his box camera and flash memorializing the most awkward moment possible without detracting from the singing tiny touches were also revealing as lucia agrees to marry the hated arturo she picks up a dagger from her brothers desk and slides it tosca like into her sleeve premeditation indeed and at the end of the mad scene a doctor gives lucia an injection but such is her strength that she sings the final verse of her aria before it takes effect mariusz kwiecien played enrico as a man at the end of his rope shamelessly abusing his sister his scenes with ms dessay crackled his forceful baritone battling with her silvery soprano marcello giordanis edgardo was more generic clarion and not always on pitch john relyea was sympathetic as raimondo the chaplain and lucias tutor stephen costello in his house debut was a severe and able arturo james levine who does not usually seem to have much affinity for bel canto operas conducted with great verve lightness and vitality new york city operas production of "margaret garner " which opened earlier this month was in many ways an improvement over the operas original outing in detroit in the piece with music by richard danielpour and a libretto by toni morrison is based on the same true story that ms morrison used for her novel "beloved" a runaway slave captured kills her children rather than allow them to grow up in slavery a central question at her trial is whether she is a murderer or a thief since she and the children are considered property not people mr danielpour insists a bit too much on the humanity of the slave characters the many lyrical moments that depict the familial love of margaret her husband robert his mother cilla and the children tend to go on too long and stop the action overall the musical language of the piece which is highly tonal and relies on spiritual like song and lush orchestration lacks the bite that its story needs however city operas director tazewell thompson and conductor george manahan deftly ramped up the dramatic pacing of the show making it tighter and more ferocious than it was in detroit most critically they brought out the evil in edward gaines the plantation owner creating clearer conflict and menace the big choral moments made more sense margarets trial scene for example recalls the structure of bachs "st matthew passion " with the angry crowd calling for margarets execution and a trio of judges debating with gainess proto abolitionist daughter caroline aided by robert wierzels careful lighting donald eastmans set doubled easily as a plantation mansion the classical columns and pediments of the proscenium and a slave cabin wooden walls with gaping holes at the rear of the stage merrily murray walsh designed the attractive period costumes several of the principals were new to their roles tracie luck made a passionate margaret especially compelling in the lower range of her voice and lisa daltrius unleashed a big dramatic soprano sound for cilla timothy mix ably infused gaines with selfishness and cruelty even in lyrical moments gregory baker repeated his powerful characterization of robert though his baritone sounded a little forced in the upper registers maureen mckay offered a bright caroline the large double chorus one black one white well prepared by chorus master gary thor wedow and bigger than the one in detroit provided some of the operas most effective moments ms waleson writes about opera for the journal
