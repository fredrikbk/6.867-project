drug law giveaway went to pharma not lawyers scott gottliebs attack on fda reform "trial lawyer kowtow " editorial page sept represents a cynical attempt to deprive americans harmed by drug company negligence of the ability to hold wrongdoers accountable through the civil justice system dr gottlieb further misses the mark by asserting that the fdas judgment is always superior to the judgment of the nations varied state governments he defends the practice of pre emption which essentially blocks the states from enacting laws and regulations that are stronger than those imposed by the federal government the article fails to acknowledge that americans need the states and the civil justice system as well as the fda to provide the protections they deserve dr gottlieb wants to deny states the authority to require pharmaceutical companies to place additional information on drug labels even though it would enable the states to provide further protections for their residents thankfully the house of representatives rejected that notion by placing people over profits jon haber ceo american association for justice washington dr gottlieb provides a creative but wildly misleading take on a provision that was included in pending federal drug safety reform legislation the fight was not over a giveaway to trial lawyers but whether a bill designed to enhance drug safety should include an industry backed provision that actually weakens safety protections what dr gottlieb failed to mention was an anti consumer measure slipped into the bill that would have prevented drug companies from voluntarily enhancing safety warnings on labels without prior fda approval even when the drug company itself believes a new warning is necessary it would have undone current law which allows a company that discovers a new safety risk to warn the public without prior fda approval that makes sense a drug company should let patients and doctors know of new risks without waiting on an agency notorious for foot dragging and equivocating congress was right to insist that the pharma giveaway be dumped from the bill and language restating industrys responsibility be included it had no place in legislation seeking to make sure our prescription drugs are as safe and effective as possible kim witczak minneapolis see related letter "letters to the editor fda reform threatens prescription for chaos" wsj oct
