passion and partition india remembered by pamela mountbatten pavilion pages &# indian summer by alex von tunzelmann henry holt pages &# the th anniversary of the partition of the indian subcontinent into india and pakistan has occasioned sweeping punditry and a host of narratives tracking the subcontinents fate both political and economic from that time to this "indian summer" and "india remembered" are by contrast intimate portraits of the partition moment itself as such they offer the compressed drama of a pivotal moment in th century history featuring oversize personalities and conflicting motives more than poverty statistics or geopolitical designs alex von tunzelmann in "indian summer " sketches the major figures in the drama conveying the prejudices ethnic loyalties and grand ideas that guided each and that did so much to determine the course of events pamela mountbatten observed the events themselves having as a teenager accompanied her father lord mountbatten to india as he discharged his task of winding up the british raj in "india remembered " she draws on diaries and reminiscences to piece together a personal account in ms von tunzelmanns telling mohammed jinnah the indian muslim who became pakistans first leader is steely and clever though aged and dying of tuberculosis he seems determined to realize his personal vision of a nontheocratic but dedicatedly muslim state and yet ms von tunzelmann suggests he may have at first championed such a vision as a kind of bargaining chip to secure a better status for muslims within an undivided india the idea of partition came relatively late in the debate over indias future the avatar of indian independence mohandas gandhi is shown as a startling contradiction a man capable of ruthlessly saying to the british on behalf of his countrymen and independence "you must face the bloodbath and accept it" and yet so apparently heartbroken by the partition triggered violence that he undertook a life threatening fast to curtail it his protege jawaharlal nehru emerges as an odd mixture of high ideals and ruthless realpolitik he was among other things a militant atheist and devoted socialist who was regarded suspiciously by british authorities as a possibly unreliable future ally as he proved to be his softer side is revealed in his loving relationship with lord mountbattens wife edwina who lacked nehrus learning but whose sophistication and cultivation matched his clearly the bond between the two was strong and they connected on a high plane ms von tunzelmann assumes with an uncharacteristic lack of sophistication that the liaison was sexual she even quotes pamela mountbatten saying "ive often been asked whether i think nehru and my mother were in love the answer undoubtedly is yes they were " it is only in a footnote that we read of pamela mountbattens further claim that the love was never expressed sexually in "india remembered " pamela mountbatten repeats this claim about the chaste relations between her mother and nehru even as she acknowledges that her mother had lovers if not nehru himself but the figure who dominates pamela mountbattens account and ms von tunzelmanns too for that matter is the last viceroy born prince louis of battenberg in mountbatten was the great grandson of queen victoria and thus a cousin of king george vi whose indian realm he had come to delhi to give away his royal background along with his matinee idol looks and vast wealth acquired through his marriage to edwina made him seem almost too good to be true and he was mountbatten was a favorite of the establishment but there were overtones of the peter principle to his career his meteoric rise from naval officer to supreme allied commander south east asia he held the position from to the end of world war ii had happened despite an appalling record that involved crackpot strategies and errors in command at one point when mountbatten declared an interest in remaining in the navy winston churchill had said to him "what could you hope to achieve except to be sunk in a bigger and more expensive ship " ms von tunzelmann does not mince words "it cannot be pretended that mountbatten was a brilliant sailor nor even that he was a competent one it cannot be pretended that he was a brilliant commander in chief and it is certainly true that he could be hasty negligent and easily distracted with trivialities " this was the man who had been sent off to india in march charged with handing over the reins of power by june but mountbattens arrogance was boundless his decision to bring forward the date of independence and thus of partition by months to august seems to have been unilateral his solution to an enormously complex task widely believed to be impossible in months was to do it in five there can be little doubt that this switch to fast forward cost countless lives and caused untold misery the border between the newly created nations of india and pakistan was actually delineated by an english judge sir cyril radcliffe who knew virtually nothing about india before coming there to do the job in the sweltering summer of incredibly as each nation celebrated its freedom neither knew the precise dimensions of its territory a pakistani minister described the partition as "the parting kick of the british " the divided regions of the punjab in the west and bengal in the east became immediate nightmares of ethnic cleansing sectarian violence and displaced persons sir cyril wrote that "there will be roughly million people with a grievance who will begin looking for me i do not want them to find me " ms von tunzelmann says that "he had the good sense to get on a plane to london on august and later burned all his papers relating to partition " as for mountbatten he did not to his credit cut and run like sir cyril he stayed on for nearly a year as governor general of the independent dominion of india and seems to have done everything he could to defuse the violent effects of his foolhardy haste his daughter unwittingly gives some insight into the complacency of his thinking when she writes that although some "thought everything had been done too quickly my father knew that only history could be the judge " well history has rendered its judgment and it is harsh mr rubin is a writer in pasadena calif
