a turning point for health care the labor agreement reached by general motors corp is the most striking example of a bigger trend sweeping u s health care employers renouncing their decades old role as chief health care buyer the auto makers iconic status in american industry and the example it sets as one of the biggest u s employers is likely to speed this shift and drive discussion in the presidential campaign about overhauling the health system polls find health care is the top domestic issue for voters as more americans are on the hook for getting their own coverage maneuvers such as gms are "driving greater insecurity among the middle class who are employed but feeling like their health care is not secure " said john rother policy director for the seniors group aarp which favors government action to secure universal health coverage the portion of firms offering health benefits fell to this year from in because of small employers retreat from providing coverage according to a survey released this month by the kaiser family foundation benefits packages are getting stingier too last year of workers had deductibles of &# or more up from in the foundation says the shift isnt only about dropping coverage or making workers pay more of the bill like gm many employers want to immunize themselves from the risk of rising health costs in many cases especially for retirees this means shifting to plans in which the employer provides a lump sum for health coverage and employees have to figure out how to spend it that way the employer knows ahead of time exactly how much it is spending in gms case an independent trust will assume the task of providing health coverage to the companys unionized retirees and spouses gm will put money in the trust as much as &# billion according to people familiar with the deal to get it going but its up to the trust to set and manage the benefits companies have several ways to offload responsibility for health care kellogg co this month informed about medicare eligible retirees from its keebler unit that their group coverage will cease at year end instead they will receive money under a health reimbursement arrangement or hra that they can put toward health coverage to supplement medicare the concept resembles k pension plans in which employers put a fixed amount of tax deferred dollars into employees retirement accounts but it is up to the employees to manage the money ford motor co also will stop providing group insurance in january to about salaried retirees and their spouses who are over years old each person will receive &# annually in an hra to help cover insurance premiums and other medical expenses chrysler llc began a similar plan this year for more than salaried retirees over bill haller a year old ford retiree says the changes come as a shock in part because the company fostered the belief that it would take care of workers health care when they retired he wonders whether the company contributions will still be there in years to come "the money could go away if times get tough " he says some active workers also face the prospect of shopping for their own coverage partly using money supplied by their employer as federal and state officials grant employers more latitude missouri passed a law earlier this year making it easier for small employers to give workers money toward individual health policies the internal revenue service has also endorsed the idea of employers reimbursing workers for individual health premiums lifting a regulatory cloud such trends explain why health care has become a big issue in the presidential campaign president bush and the leading republican presidential candidates generally embrace the idea of individuals shouldering more responsibility and risk for their health care albeit with help from employers or the government where needed mr bush sees individual health accounts as one pillar of an "ownership society " however such notions have proved a tough sell in congress mr bushs tax proposals to encourage a shift away from the employer based market never got off the ground currently people dont get a tax break when they use their own money to buy insurance and the federal tax system encourages employer based coverage shifting people to the individual market is problematic for other reasons at least under the current set up it is difficult for people to understand what theyre buying and those with existing illnesses have trouble finding any coverage the top democratic presidential candidates have built their health care plans around bolstering employer based insurance but they also envision more government action to help the uninsured or underinsured for example several would impose some kind of requirement on insurers to cover all comers in an interview last week sen hillary rodham clinton said people arent ready to cross employers out of the equation "we looked at every permutation of how you get to universal health care " said the democratic presidential candidate "theres great attachment to the employer based system even though it is eroding " one question now is whether gms move may spark consideration of a more radical break with the current reliance on job based insurance cutting off health benefits entirely is still unfathomable to most large employers that need to compete for talent instead more are embracing the middle ground of offering a fixed contribution toward individual coverage the new trust for uaw retiree health benefits is likely to hear pitches from consultants about such ideas by disbursing fixed amounts and limiting increases administrators of health care trusts can avoid running out of money extend health inc partly owned by america online founder steve cases revolution health group has built a team of insurance agents and a sophisticated web site to serve retirees at fortune companies with individual health accounts extend has signed six large clients including ford and chrysler that will be offering retiree health accounts next year it aims to triple that number by the chief executive at extend health bryce williams argues that the paternalistic group model is broken and that companies cant sustain a health care safety net "this is about making corporate america competitive again " mr williams says ford estimates its change for salaried retirees will save the auto maker about &# million annually and even more in future accounting liabilities on its balance sheet in ford spent &# billion on retiree health care for hourly and salaried workers more than half its total &# billion health care tab ford has estimated its u s health care costs will increase this year and could level off to growth by with some of the changes it is making now marcey evans a ford spokeswoman said the new health reimbursement accounts for salaried retirees maintain high quality benefits in line with the companys competitors while providing a way to control costs when asked about the health care changes at an august meeting with ford salaried retirees ford chief executive alan mulally noted that health costs averaged about &# for each vehicle the company manufactured last year "we simply cannot add that amount to a vehicle and remain competitive " mr mulally told retirees according to internal company documents jay savan a principal at towers perrin in st louis says he is working with a foreign owned company with u s employees that is adopting an account based plan he says there will be winners and losers depending on workers annual health care bill but over time most people should be better off because they can save up health care dollars when theyre healthy "there is a lot of activity going on with large employers in this area " mr savan says tricia neuman director of the medicare policy project at the kaiser family foundation says this represents a "big change in structure" for retiree health care "while companies limit their own financial liability they may end up shifting costs to retirees who may not be able to find comparable coverage on their own " she says that is particularly true when retirees receive a one time lump sum that they must stretch out over many years rather than an annual contribution from the company advocates of this individual market approach argue that many employers overspend on one size fits all health plans featuring bells and whistles most workers dont need or want they contend workers then indulge in unnecessary medical care because they are paying only a fraction of the total cost but turning individuals loose in the market carries risks older consumers will pay considerably more for coverage and many wont even qualify for a policy because of their medical history the individual market is also still plagued by deceptive marketing of coverage limits steep rate increases after low introductory prices insurers efforts to deny expensive claims and lax regulation in some states that is why retiree health care is the primary testing ground for individual accounts because medicare shields most retirees from crippling medical bills ford estimates the average salaried retiree and spouse spend about &# in premiums now for medicare and fords group medical and dental plan the auto maker says the average couple should save about &# on average under the new plan that gives them &# &# per person in a health reimbursement account some retirees arent so sure nunzio curcuru a year old retired personnel supervisor at fords dearborn mich framing plant begins radiation treatment for prostate cancer next week and worries about keeping his current doctors when he has to switch jan from the ford group plan to a private medicare supplement "having &# doesnt seem like much a few hospital visits can wipe that out " mr curcuru says "it is a very anxious moment at my age "
