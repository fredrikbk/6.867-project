if you are drowning in remote controls harmony is lifesaver our love affair with entertainment gadgets has caused an unfortunate epidemic of remote controls in my own house theres a wicker basket on a coffee table with a jumble of remotes for a television set a high definition television tuner a home theater receiver and a couple of videogame consoles and when that basket became flooded i added yet another device to contain the clutter there are "universal" remotes are designed to let you operate multiple electronics devices from a single control but most universal remotes if you can figure out how to work them at all dont help much with the tedious sequence of button pushes often required to do simple tasks like watch a movie in my case just turning on the tv can require up to six punches on two different remotes depending on what activity i happened to be doing on my home theater system the last time i shut it off logitech international the swiss computer accessory maker has come up with an answer to the problems of remote control clutter and excessive button pushing with its family of harmony universal remote controls that are relatively affordable and easy to use i tested two of the latest models of logitech remotes the harmony and and found that they greatly simplified using my home theater system despite a few flaws its a challenge just getting many universal remotes working considering all of the electronics gear that occupy many tv rooms the setup usually involves punching arcane codes into a universal remote corresponding to your electronics devices after looking the numbers up in a manual a tedious process with lots of opportunity for failure users configure harmony remotes through what i found to be a far more user friendly process by tethering them to a mac or windows pc with a usb cable a software program that comes with the remotes asks users what types of devices theyd like to set up such as a home theater receiver a television set and a digital video recorder users will need the model number for their devices once youve entered the model numbers into the harmony program the software automatically downloads all of the commands required to configure the remote so it works with your tv room gadgets from an online logitech database containing more than devices far more than youd find listed in the manual for a conventionally programmed universal remote control the harmony software easily located all of my devices in its database an important feature of the harmony remotes is something called activities which lets users reduce to one the multiple button pushes typically required to do basic functions with their entertainment systems such as watching a dvd logitech didnt invent this concept but it has made the setup process easy enough so users dont have to hire a professional installer to do it for them as is the case with many other high end universal remote controls based on the types of devices i told it i had the harmony software on the pc recommended a handful of activities for my remote controls including "watch tv " "watch a dvd " and "listen to cds " to watch a dvd on my entertainment system i normally need to turn on my tv and set it to the correct video input source turn on my home theater receiver which i use to play audio when watching movies and turn on my xbox game console through which i play dvds a process that requires up to seven button pushes on multiple remote controls the harmony remotes eventually allowed me to push one button to turn on all of these devices but there were hiccups when i hit the "watch dvd" activity button the harmony remotes initially turned on all of my devices except the xbox after a few minutes exploring the harmony software on the pc i was able to change a setting to correct the problem and update the remote in all it took me about minutes to configure the first logitech remote i used the harmony and half that time for the harmony after i had become familiar with the process the two models of remotes offered similar functions but in radically different industrial designs the harmony is a tablet shape control about the size of a small picture frame with a large touch sensitive color screen that displays large buttons for accessing activities and other functions on your devices the harmony is a more conventional wand shape remote with a smaller screen i preferred the design of the harmony finding it easier and more natural to use with one hand not to mention a better value i have found the harmony selling for as low as &# and the harmony for &# on amazon com the comes with a kit that lets you extend the range of the remote by using radio frequency instead of infrared signals both harmony remotes though made it much easier for me to use my entertainment system and cleaned up some of the clutter in my living room email me at nick wingfield wsj com walt mossberg is on vacation
