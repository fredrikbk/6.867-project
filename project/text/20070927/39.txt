fosters may be due for a happy hour obstacles of biblical magnitude are easing for australian spirits company a glut of wine and a rising australian dollar gave investors in fosters group a headache in the fiscal year that ended june but signs are emerging that the company may be getting past the worst of it chief executive trevor ohoy has described the challenges that have hit fosters in the past few years as "biblical" in proportion australias wine industry has been hit by drought fire and frost just as it was emerging from oversupply that saw cheap wine flood the market and sink prices analysts say if fosters can mitigate increased grape costs from drought and continue the recent momentum in its wine business the outlook is encouraging "its too early to say all the dramas are behind it but the indications are that margin expansion is happening again and with a bit of luck the bottom of the wine cycle is now behind fosters " says greg canavan an analyst at fat prophets an investment research firm based in sydney australia fosters the worlds second biggest winemaker by sales behind constellation brands inc has already begun raising prices across its brands which include penfolds lindemans and californias beringer wine estates "we put our prices up across the board in august between and those prices have stuck and competitors have followed thats a pretty good sign " mr ohoy told dow jones newswires for months some premium wine was at rock bottom prices as unbranded output known in australia as "cleanskins" was offloaded to cut inventories now mr ohoy is confident consumers will maintain their preference for better quality wine and accept higher prices fosters ceo was in the hot seat in february after conceding that a much maligned strategy to restructure the companys sales force doing away with separate wine beer and spirits teams had hurt sales in the six months that ended dec wine volumes slumped from a year earlier with the sales force issues getting sorted out analysts expect fosters to stabilize market share and benefit from improved pricing as the wine glut clears for the year that ended june fosters reported a fall in net profit to million australian dollars us&# million in line with analysts expectations profit before significant items rose and investors were encouraged by revenue momentum in the second half illustrating its confidence fosters announced a a&# million share buyback "they achieved what they said they were going to achieve i think the market is a little more comfortable now that actions will follow the words " says abn amro analyst david cooke who rates the stock a "buy " takeover rumors prompted a spike in the share price in august but the possibility of a buyout appears to have receded for now mr ohoy says several private equity firms had contacted the group but interest has dried up since the turmoil in the global credit markets fosters was an attractive target because of its vulnerability in tough industry conditions and its strong cash flows from its beer business which includes australias top selling brand victoria bitter now in the wake of the debt market rout mr ohoy says fosters is getting calls from parties trying to offload wine assets however some skepticism about fosters outlook remains while drought in australia was initially seen as benefiting the wine industry helping erase several years of disastrous oversupply it now threatens to cause a deep shortage of grapes "the anecdotal feeling at the moment is that the harvest is shaping up to be lower again " says lawrie stanford information and analysis manager at the australian wine and brandy corp he says spring rains will be critical for australias main grape growing region the murray darling basin which produces about of the countrys grapes mcguigan simeon wines australias second largest publicly listed winemaker by sales has warned that a lack of sufficient rain could see the vintage down another from which was already the smallest harvest in seven years the reduced throughput into its wine processing facilities helped push mcguigan simeon to a a&# million loss for the year that ended june while fosters isnt as exposed to the drought most of its fruit is from cooler climate areas higher grape costs still are an issue the industry as a whole is also at risk of losing export markets if supply is restricted mr ohoy says fosters has a competitive advantage in a tight market "our checks dont bounce so in a short market we will generally do better than most other players " he says still he acknowledges fosters "will be short some varieties without a doubt if this drought continues " merrill lynch analyst david errington who has a "sell" rating on the stock is more circumspect about the outlook last week he wrote that "it is likely to be a very tough couple of years for fosters australian business " mr errington says he expects the australian business to suffer from higher costs of grapes and lower volumes while the stronger australian dollar "makes it a tough export market " fosters shares which gained five australian cents yesterday to a&# are down for the year the average month target
