the daily fix mets yankees go opposite ways in tale of two gotham city clubs online edition new yorks baseball teams are going in opposite directions the yankees locked up the american league wild card with a win over the tampa bay devil rays capping an unlikely journey on may the bronx bombers were on july the team trailed by in the wild card race no matter the yanks dug themselves out of the statistical grave and will now play in their th straight postseason in the new york daily news john harper revisits his july column complete with that days back page declaring the yankees dead and buried "by the second week in august during a weekend sweep of the indians in cleveland i knew id written them off too soon " he writes "by then with the help of an infusion of youth they looked and sounded like an entirely different ballclub from the one that had dragged its tail through the first three months of the season the bottom line is that i should have known better usually its baseball writers like myself who are always telling fans to be patient reminding them in may and june that the season is longer than they can imagine that a team as talented as the yankees benefits from the six months it takes to sort out the best and the worst teams " then mr harper writes there were two factors he didnt predict the infusion of youth from phil hughes ian kennedy and joba chamberlain and the detroit tigers collapse "anyway its made for an interesting second half " he writes "at some point i stopped rooting for my prediction to hold up and just enjoyed watching the baseball the yankees gave us the last couple of months full of the energy and passion that was missing during the first half " the mets on the other hand are on the brink of an ignominious collapse last night their rancid bullpen blew another lead on the way to a loss to the lowly washington nationals the mets had a seven game lead in the nl east with games to go with four games left that lead is now a single game "the feebleness of the bullpen has put this met season on both endless loop and red alert " writes joel sherman in the new york post "the club seems to be playing the same game every night get lead lose lead lose more confidence lose game and move ever closer to losing face in an all time way this is what a bad bullpen does to a team it destroys the spirit by constantly turning wins into defeats it makes the manager feel like each choice in relief is like picking cancer or heart disease neither is good and both are likely to kill you " the american league playoff roster is set the al east crown is still disputed by the yankees and the boston red sox but both teams will go to the playoffs in the national league no spots are reserved the mets lead the philadelphia phillies by a game the chicago cubs are ahead of the milwaukee brewers by two the arizona diamondbacks are ahead of the san diego padres by one and the wild card should emerge from a tussle between the d backs padres mets phillies and the colorado rockies the fans having the most fun watching the wild card race it has to be the colorado rockie faithful the rockies win over the los angeles dodgers last night was their th straight keyed by todd helton the year old hitting machine the team tried desperately to trade to boston last winter "there is nowhere helton would rather be than right here in the middle of a colorado clubhouse full of players who love him like a big brother and in the heat of a playoff race he has toiled for more than a decade as a major leaguer to enjoy for the first time " writes mark kiszla in the denver post "in a fascinating tale of a team that seems to invent a new little miracle every day maybe the best story of all is the old man of the kid rocks " if met fans jump off the ledge cub fans could take their place lou piniellas team lost its second straight last night to the florida marlins "the rain came down most of the day bringing with it a steady drip drip drip of torture " writes rick morrissey in the chicago tribune "the cubs wanted to move to make something happen they wanted to use their legs to make a stand and their arms to throw caution to the wind after losing the previous nights game to the marlins they wanted to play ball and calm a jittery populace back home sure this is hindsight talking but the fact that it rained black cats and billy goats wednesday shouldnt that have been considered a bad omen this cant be happening of course it can " the cubs got help from not one but two unlikely sources their arch rivals and the team chasing them the brewers were trailing the st louis cardinals in the eighth when milwaukee reliever seth mcclung apparently retaliated for the cards hitting prince fielder mr mcclung hit albert pujols and the cards promptly erupted for four runs in the milwaukee journal sentinel tom haudricourt examines the feud between the two teams yet more proof that cards skipper tony la russa will do absolutely anything to get people to pay attention to him the race between the cubs and brewers is this years only guaranteed old style pennant chase the loser is going home with no wild card for a consolation prize on espn com robert weintraub chronicles "the last real race" the battle between bobby coxs atlanta braves and dusty bakers san francisco giants that season ended with the giants winning games and going home "it would take a transcendent pitching staff the midseason heist of a slugging first baseman the burning of a stadium and a comeback from a double digit deficit to beat dustys giants " mr weintraub writes adding "it was a campaign that featured combined wins between the two teams one of only two seasons in history in which two teams in the same division won more than games new york and baltimore won and respectively in and it would be the final time such a successful second place team would feel so empty at seasons end " william wirtz the owner of the chicago blackhawks died yesterday at a real estate mogul mr wirtz was decried by blackhawks fans as "dollar bill " keeping the teams home games off tv and letting its stars walk for bigger contracts elsewhere "tough stubborn to a fault stodgy " writes greg couch in the sun times "he was so much the image of the powerful old time chicago owner of halas wrigley reinsdorf you picture a guy doing business in a smoke filled back room working the political angles wirtz defied criticism and did things his way always his way no matter the result and we can respect that i guess its us but it didnt work for his hockey team and wirtz created his own failed legacy " time mr couch writes "passed wirtz by he didnt want to move into the big spending era of sports he wouldnt budge on that and tv has become such a part of daily life that wirtzs tv ban served only to take the hawks out of our daily consciousness now the team doesnt matter having slowly dwindled away wirtz stayed true to himself but the painful truth is that he killed hockey interest in this town " the "dollar bill" nickname came from the tribunes bob verdi but mr verdi writes that that moniker doesnt capture the other side of the man who was famously loyal to his employees and quietly generous tip of the fix cap to reader john falck found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and
