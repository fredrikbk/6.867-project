ibsen it is snowing hard in wales today well no it is not actually snowing hard it is snowing morosely which is much worse and is plunging us one and all into gloom nothing goes right for us these days we lose all our rugby matches the postal charges are going up the spring lambs are not gamboling but are huddled reproachfully in their mothers flanks this is not what they had been led to expect of the world the only being that seems to be perfectly settled in his circumstances is my cat ibsen is the cat creations supreme invention i rather think so whether it be one of the bigger models a siberian tiger say or one of the elegant boutique breeds like an abyssinian the feline range provides the perfect complement to any lifestyle some people detest all cats i know and come out in eczema when one approaches but the most rabid felinophobe must surely admit that as books furnish a room so cats complete any mise en scene take my ibsen he is not welsh at all being descended from a long line of norwegian forest cats some of his ancestors were probably some of those giant cats who as everyone knows pulled the chariot of the love goddess freya through the northern wildernesses of antiquity he is very large and hairy kindly intelligent smells of damp hay and has big feet he could not possibly be called anything but ibsen because if there is one thing more than another that he looks like it is a feline version of a norwegian playwright of course though being a true aristocrat he blends limpidly and genially into any background for centuries his ancestors expelled from valhalla with the decline of the old gods became regular norwegian farm cats tough fierce mousers mighty breeders like old fashioned human patricians in changing cultures ibsens forebears went back to the bog losing i would guess some subtleties of intellect or expression he does have a distinctly plebeian meow but retaining those grand old qualities of resolution and independent loyalty that so endeared them to freya fifty or years ago though connoisseurs of true breeding recognized in the workaday norwegian farmyard cats some echo of ancient distinction they were plucked from their humble hunting grounds given the lofty honorific of norwegian forest cats brushed by breeders displayed at cat shows neutered and sold for ridiculous prices did they care did they hell by sheer force of character mysteriously transmuted to their owners they resisted all preposterous ideas of selective breeding or mutation whisked as so many of them have been from haystack to palace they remain unaffected they dont come in fancy colors they are seldom dressed up in ribbons they prefer to be in the yard or the wood with an occasional dip in a river if theres one nearby if they could write they would certainly be writing majestic stage plays of psychological import no no i know not every cat is an ibsen but every cat in my view however pitifully it has been domesticated de clawed inbred emasculated or infantiled remains in its heart of hearts the animal it always was a cat is a cat is a cat the lambs may huddle the humans may grumble but the cat within whatever persona he happened to inhabit remains nobly impervious to the frivolities of time if freya herself in her foghorn wagnerian voice summoned ibsen to return to his chariot duties he might go in the end but only after a protracted yawn a stretching of front legs first back legs afterward and an apologetic flick of the whiskers to me ms morris is the author most recently of "the world travels " norton
