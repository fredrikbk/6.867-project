value strategies thirty some years ago little did i imagine that the creation of the worlds first index mutual fund would have such a profound impact on the mutual fund industry at the time it was proclaimed a flawed concept and described as "bogles folly" by its detractors after all they asked why would an investor settle for average returns the second index fund didnt see the light of day until eight years later by total index fund assets had grown to only &# billion just of the total assets of equity mutual funds but the trend has been steadily upward ever since the market share of index funds crossed in and in and now constitutes of equity fund assets more than &# trillion of the &# trillion equity fund total that first fund was founded on the idea of buying virtually the entire u s stock market eliminating all sales charges and advisory fees minimizing operating expenses and marketing costs and virtually obviating portfolio turnover such a market portfolio could be held "forever " said to be warren buffetts favorite time horizon but a funny thing happened on the way to the triumph of indexing the model changed the dominance of the classic index mutual fund came to a virtual halt that asset share of has grown to only today the extra seven percentage points in index fund market share have been accounted for by a mutant of that original investment form the exchange traded fund etf as the nearby chart shows see accompanying chart wsj feb currently etf assets total &# billion of the &# trillion total but they are growing at a far faster rate taking in net new capital of &# billion since compared to just &# billion for their traditional cousins etfs simply put are index funds that can be traded in the financial markets in fairness if they are not traded they can often be the equal of the classic index funds if they operate at lower expense ratios and provide potentially higher tax efficiency they may provide the same diversification at even lower costs provided that the initial brokerage commissions are amortized over a substantial span of years in this format used in that way etfs are solid competitors to their classic forebears ironically that first etf created in was modeled on the classic index fund i designed three decades ago now known as vanguard index fund tracking the returns of the standard &amp poors index holding s&amp ps depository receipts the shares of the original etf were quickly designated "spiders " but with one big difference as its advertisements said "now you can trade the s&amp p all day long in real time " but if long term investing was the paradigm for the classic index fund trading etfs can only be described as short term speculation and it was only a matter of time until trading overwhelmed diversification as the driving force in the etf world of the etfs in existence today including in registration at the sec only represent broad market segments such as the standard &amp poors the dow jones wilshire total u s stock market index and the morgan stanley eafe europe australia and far east index of non u s stocks with each passing day the market segments available through etfs seem to get narrower can you believe that we now have a "healthshares emerging cancer" etf these nouveau index funds starkly contradict each of the principal concepts underlying the original index fund if the broadest possible diversification was the original paradigm surely holding small segments of the market offers less diversification and commensurately more risk if the original paradigm was minimal cost then holding market sector index funds that may themselves be low cost obviates neither the brokerage commissions entailed in trading them nor the tax burdens incurred if one has the good fortune to do so successfully in addition to the certain penalty of expenses there is the less certain but omnipresent penalty of emotions performance chasing investors in specialized funds are their own worst enemies the most rapidly growing sectors of the etf marketplace are those no surprise that have been the leaders in the recent bull market indexes of small cap stocks energy emerging markets international real estate and most recently commodities especially gold and oil the annualized share turnover of these sectors averages an astonishing as to the quintessential aspect of the classic index fund assuring indeed guaranteeing that investors will earn their fair share of the stock markets return the fact is that investors who trade etfs have nothing even resembling such a guarantee in fact after all the extra costs the added taxes the selection challenges and the timing risks the typical etf investor has absolutely no idea what relationship his investment return will bear to the return earned by the stock market what accounts for the stampede into these nouveau index funds that march to such a different drummer surely the amazing growth of etfs says something about the focus of money managers on gathering assets the marketing power of brokerage firms the activities of financial advisers the energy of wall streets financial entrepreneurs and the willingness nay eagerness of investors to favor complexity over simplicity continuing to believe against all odds that they can beat the market to begin etfs are a bonanza for fund managers with &# billion of assets and an average expense ratio weighted by assets of about basis points etfs are generating some &# million in annual well management fees but as passive index funds they dont even require management in the conventional sense whats more since their shares are traded from one investor to another on the stock market their managers are largely relieved of the onerous costs of shareholder recordkeeping borne by traditional funds but those costs dont entirely vanish they are borne by investors in the form of commissions and bid asked spreads every time etf shares trade and they are traded with a vengeance with some million etfs shares changing hands each day by way of contrast the trading volume at the new york stock exchange is presently running at a daily rate of about billion shares if we assume that commissions and spreads run as little as three cents per share on these trades thats some &# billion a year so etfs are a gold mine to brokers too many financial advisers even those who have long favored the classic index fund strategy have also jumped on the etf bandwagon etfs enable their clients to bet on hot market sectors time purchases during each days trading and engage in short selling but to what avail yet if advisers oversee say &# billion in etfs for their clients their fees would come to at least &# billion and entrepreneurs have also profited from the stampede into etfs one relatively small provider powershares was recently sold by its owners to a large fund manager for some &# million assuming its targets for asset growth are met and the market capitalization of a brand new provider wisdomtree investments recently reached nearly &# million yet its etf asset base is relatively modest &# billion and its investment strategy betting that dividend paying stocks will outpace non dividend paying stocks is unproven in practice the return on the seed capital of the early investors so far is adding up these costs were talking about etfs earning billions of dollars for our financial intermediaries in a sense thats the american way who would dare fault our opportunistic free market system and yet there is another side to the argument that we seem to ignore it is the iron law of the markets the undefiable rules of arithmetic gross return in the market less the costs of financial intermediation equals the net return actually delivered to market participants to the extent that etfs increase intermediation costs it follows that they must reduce the returns of investors as a group put another way etfs are a dream come true for fund managers brokers financial advisers and entrepreneurs is it too much to ask whether they are a dream come true for investors so long as those relentless rules apply "forever" the idea that etfs will somehow enhance the returns of investors in the aggregate seems more like a pipedream whats more in a curious turn of events the etf format has been chosen by the new "fundamental" indexers offering portfolios following active strategies focused on portfolios weighted by each corporations corporate revenues profits and or dividends rather than the classic market capitalization based indexes such strategies proved enormously successful in the bear market so it is little wonder that such "value" strategies described by their creators as the "new paradigm" even though they have been acclaimed in academia for decades are brought to market only after their above market returns have been achieved by using the etf format their promoters seem to suggest that the ability to "trade them all day long in real time" will further enhance investor returns a dubious prospect on the face of it so long as the truism that "the more financial intermediaries take the less their clients make" remains in effect serious and intelligent investors ought to beware of moving their investments out of classic index funds focused on low costs broad diversification and long term buy and hold strategies into index funds nouveau with their overlay of costs limited diversification and short term trading strategies industry participants too should be concerned for in the long run any business that puts the interest of service to self before service to clients will ultimately pay for this contradiction mr bogle is the founder of vanguard and author of "the little book of common sense investing " forthcoming in march from
