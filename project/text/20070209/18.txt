coxs independent day sec chief will attempt to sway board on rule for funds directors though the securities and exchange commission remains undecided over whether to require mutual fund boards to be led by independent directors the agencys chairman is committed to finding a compromise rule to accomplish the goal people familiar with the matter said the sec first proposed and passed the independent chairman rule in but a federal appeals court sent it back for reconsideration the industry had expected sec chairman christopher cox who took over in the fall of to let the issue die but people familiar with his thinking said he wants to strengthen independent fund directors role and believes the commission should stand its ground by passing a version of the rule given that it had voted for a previous iteration albeit the issue will test mr coxs consensus building skills appointed by president bush the former republican congressman has managed to corral the panels two democrats and two republicans into unanimous votes for other rules the rule passed by the sec in under then chairman william donaldson required the chairman of each fund board and of its members be independent up from a majority two democratic commissioners and mr donaldson a republican voted for it the remaining two commissioners both republican opposed it the challenge for mr cox will be appeasing the old rules opposing factions the two commissioners who voted on that rule and remain in office are steadfast republican paul atkins opposes it and democrat roel campos favors it the two other commissioners republican kathy casey and democrat annette nazareth havent publicly stated positions observers expect the sec to keep the requirement opposition to that rule is more muted because the majority of the fund industry has moved in that direction about of fund companies that responded to a investment company institute survey said they met the standard bridging the divide over the independent chairman requirement will be trickier even though more boards have independent leadership now either voluntarily or forced by regulatory settlements stemming from fund industry abuses that helped prompt the sec rule the ici survey found that of the boards had an independent chairman a percentage industry experts said likely is higher today instead of requiring independent chairmen the sec could force fund boards to designate a lead independent director and give that person substantive responsibilities such as the power to set agenda items for board meetings "that would address some of the reasons why the sec thought an independent chair would be of use " said julie allecta a mutual fund industry attorney philip khinda also an industry attorney said another possible compromise would require prominent disclosure of whether funds have independent chairmen that would encourage funds to move in that direction lest competitors seem more reform minded to potential investors "the sec could say that they havent imposed a standard but still have done something that will affect behavior " mr khinda says the original rule was crafted in the wake of revelations that some large mutual fund companies had allowed big investors to profit from trading strategies that violated their fund rules and sometimes securities laws to the detriment of other investors that prompted calls for stepped up independent oversight of fund management companies though managed by companies that employ stock pickers analysts and other investment professionals mutual funds are overseen by boards whose duty is to protect investors interests in hiring management companies and deciding how much to pay them from investors money at the time of the trading scandals many fund boards were dominated by fund

rule in prompting a storm of industry opposition fidelity investments vanguard group and other large fund companies argued there was no evidence funds with independent boards outperformed other funds the u s chamber of commerce challenged the rule and won two appeals court victories the most recent victory forced the sec to reconsider the rule after the court found the agency didnt properly follow rule making procedures including a thorough cost benefit analysis mr cox a conservative with a strong pro business record in congress surprised the industry in june by not abandoning the rule instead the agency solicited public comment on its costs and "the underlying purpose of the independence requirements which is the protection of funds and fund shareholders " the deadline for submitting comments is march but the agency so far hasnt received any "we are very anxious to stimulate comment and suggestions " mr cox said in an interview corrections &amp amplifications vanguard group
