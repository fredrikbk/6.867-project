more than zero gilbert arenas isnt just an nba all star hes the st centurys first hoops hero online edition special to the wall street journal there are several names for the cant miss a man possessed state in which gilbert arenas the washington wizards star guard has spent most of this season "unconscious" is one "lights out" is another arenas has his own term for it "hibachi " a word he claims to have "bought" from its originator wizards center brendan haywood mr arenas falsettos "hibachi " after every jump shot and the word works equally well as a noun "gilbert brought out the hibachi against the knicks" and an adjective "no player is more hibachi than gilbert arenas" it is already admirably verb able for example one might have said after mr arenas scored points on the lakers in december in a game the wizards won in overtime and which he sealed with two deep opera star bows to a delighted home crowd that "the lakers got hibachid tonight " and its in that nickname yes its derived from the small japanese grill that mr arenas real appeal becomes clear even though hes an all star in the middle of a career season his rapidly rising profile has less to do with his on court brilliance than his off court appeal fans call it "gilbertology " the word refers to mr arenas circuitous uniquely open to the public thought process which then emerges unedited as he talks consider it the conversational equivalent of a backdoor cut along the baseline indirect but effective even if you know its coming before a wizards road trip for example mr arenas posted the following on his blog at nba com "the hibachi is coming to a city near you im cooking chicken and shrimp but if you want to throw a double team my way filet mignon gets cooked too " its may not be muhammad ali but in its free form verbosity and goofy braggadocio its a far cry from the typical nba caution and that maybe is why mr arenas besides being voted an nba all star starter for the first time has become the unofficial favorite nba player of the hoops blogosphere its not even close in fact the reason for this is simple mr arenas play and playfulness make for material that is for lack of a better term straight up hibachi while the nba doesnt lack superstar players it does suffer from a notable shortage of superstar personalities and that mr arenas incontrovertibly is he coins his own nicknames after being named as a last minute injury replacement on last seasons all star team he dubbed himself "the black president " on the grounds that the coaches who initially snubbed him had tried to "impeach" him but couldnt keep him off the team the nicknames and there are others pale beside his array of oddball behavior his dislike of voicemail messages leads him to fill his voicemail box with messages for himself along the lines of "its me" and "this is gilbert " a notoriously hard worker he also "trains" by sleeping in a hyperbaric chamber that rarefies the air to pikes peak thinness his affinity for all night video game sessions "halo" is a favorite rivals any year olds these are but the tip of an iceberg of quirk that has been revealing itself alongside his still blossoming hoops talent that oddball authenticity makes mr arenas the antithesis of todays brand managed nba star and something of a throwback to the charismatic recognizably human hoops superstars of the s and s those shaggy icons think of darryl dawkins naming his slam dunks and claiming planet lovertron as his place of birth or mvp bill walton looking as if hed just come from a grateful dead show gave way to nba personae as carefully managed as those of politicians or celebrities during the nbas moneymaking peak in the early s mr arenas subverts the ideal that emerged in that period that nba superstars should aspire to michael jordans multi platform media mastery while nba marketers have searched high and low for the next jordan mr arenas has become more popular the goofier he gets add his infectious apparently authentic joy of performance to his unique combination of self effacement and shameless self promotion media savvy and guilelessness and mr arenas emerges as the nbas first true st century star its fitting then that so much of mr arenas popularity involves the internet slam magazines lang whitaker recently called him "the nbas first blog superstar " its hard to disagree considering that mr arenas was given a favorite nickname by one blog "agent zero" originated with the wizards fan site wizznutzz adopted said nickname after he was told about it by another blogger dan steinberg author of the washington posts popular d c sports bog and now explains "hibachi" on his own blog actually a transcribed phone call with an nba com staffer but rich in blog style mental channel surfing of course bloggers love him james morris a co founder of wizznutzz has compiled "a notebook full" of prospective dazzlingly free associative arenas related sneaker commercials one of which "involves an elaborate magic realist sequence featuring zero mostel " mr morris is a wizards fan and loves mr arenas "because he is an nba superstar and he is our own " but also because he seems "very much his own man " more generally though bloggers love him because he is one of them in a way that prickly on message olympus dwellers like michael jordan could never be not just a fellow blogger but someone who wont stay on topic makes goofy jokes thinks out loud and delights in surprising those who expected less the zero on his jersey after all refers to the number of minutes doubters told him hed play at the university of arizona he wound up leading the team to the ncaa final four as a sophomore last months wizards game against the phoenix suns had several examples of mr arenas singular magic and the joy he brings to d c s long suffering fans the suns were in the midst of a game winning streak and thumped washington resoundingly mr arenas had a great game points five rebounds five assists but for fans many decked out in number zero jerseys the real show was in the stands a contest was held to pick the best arenas related sign from the audience the winner received of course a hibachi later on came a staple arena amusement the pa blasted a michael jackson song and the camera trolled the seats for dancing fans the best of whom would win an unnamed prize one man mid s balding very much the picture of business casual ordinariness stood out he danced with surprising rhythm and indefatigability for the whole song the camera cut to other contestants then back to the man once then again then a third time the announcement of his prize a gift certificate to an italian restaurant in the suburbs was drowned out by thunderous applause a few players on each team could be seen checking out the jumbotron during the mans recital after his win the man grinned high fived a friend and then exalting in his own arenas moment performed the exact same theatrical bow that mr arenas had offered after his point game against the lakers once again an inexplicably unexpectedly dazzling goofball soaked up the applause once again the crowd ate it up david roth is a writer living in new york he
