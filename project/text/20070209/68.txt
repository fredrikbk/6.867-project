a time limit " says gordon espinet macs vice president of makeup artistry when the time for new york fashion week arrived last february ms peck was crestfallen not to be assigned by mac to any shows as a last ditch effort she called macs show coordinator to reiterate that she was available she was offered a spot at a small show if she could get there in a few hours and work under the name of another artist who had canceled she took the job she got two more assignments under her own name at shows last fall last thursday she found out she had made the big time with the williamson show a committee of mac artists felt she was qualified enough to be the one beginner to work under ms tilbury a fixture on the fashion circuit who has done makeup for everybody from giorgio armani to calvin klein "i was so happy " ms peck says to prepare for the show she put on a plain black cotton shirt and toned down her eye shadow which she usually uses as a selling point at the store "they told us this isnt our fashion show so we shouldnt draw attention to ourselves " she explains backstage she waited to unpack her cosmetics as she has been taught to do until the head artist in this case ms tilbury arrived and chose her own place in front of the mirrors the models in the show would have dramatic dark green eyes with gold highlighting ms tilbury told the artists the skin would be natural with just a smudge of pink on the cheeks and lips "im known for checking every single model myself before she goes out " says ms tilbury "i like perfect " many of the models hurried in from another show where they had heavy raccoon looking eyeliner and hair extensions that had to be removed as she waited ms peck practiced brushing the loose powdery eye shadow onto her hand ms peck is accustomed to applying it with her finger but ms tilbury uses a brush so ms peck would have to do it that way two more experienced mac artists looked on as ms peck worked on a sullen model "the eyes need more intensity " said mac senior artist chantel miller who does makeup for fashion shows in new york milan and paris twenty minutes later ms peck thought her models face was ready for inspection she and the model pushed through the crowd to find ms tilbury "thats gorgeous gorgeous " she said sternly nodding "thank you " ms peck whispered walking back to her station and exhaling by the time her second model arrived time was short two hairstylists also worked on the model pulling the young womans head back as ms peck tried to apply eye shadow without scattering it all over the models cheeks macs ms miller urgently told her that ms tilbury had changed their marching orders and wanted the models eyes darker and greener a show coordinator rushed over and barked that they had to finish "now " ms tilbury inspecting the work said the eyes needed more green and gold and more mascara after a few quick brush strokes by ms peck ms tilbury gave her approval ms peck then hurried to the dressing area where she stood at the ready with two jars of eye shadow and two brushes "be careful around the clothes " scolded a stylist after the designer took his bow ms peck finally had a chance to speak with ms tilbury "you did a great job " ms tilbury told her "i hardly had anything to say to you about your work " turning then to a mac supervisor ms tilbury gestured toward ms peck and said "well work together again no youll make that happen " ms peck was elated but also realistic after fashion week she says "even if charlotte tilbury doesnt remember my name the people at mac will and maybe that
