weekend journal relationships say it with txt digital love letters are easy to send but hard to cherish heres how love letters are written circa a few weeks ago christopher anthony was on a plane about to take off from los angeles he began tapping out a cellphone text message to his girlfriend stacie harb "i love you beautiful thank you for everything you do for me us " a flight attendant firmly told him to turn off his phone but he couldnt stop "i need a kiss i need your lips " as the plane reached the runway the year old banking executive tapped his final thoughts "i just need you bye lover " he hit "send" and then the plane took off for paris ms harb now keeps his word declaration in her phones saved messages "it was perfect short and sweet " she says "its not some drawn out page letter professing his undying love that would be creepy " love letters arent what they used to be while young correspondents have committed their deepest feelings to paper for centuries the latest generation of lovers is coming of age along with new technologies that let them court each other on the run the passionate essays penned on valentines days past have morphed into bursts of instant message affection confessions once sealed in envelopes are now dashed off in email while romantics have bemoaned the end of the love letter for decades the latest generation of amorous americans is turning the language of love into shorthand the medium and message arent the only things changing as love notes go electronic they can also go public posted online or forwarded mockingly to thousands romantics with an exhibitionist streak post their missives online at sites like collectiveexperience org where the tongue tied can cut and paste just the right sentiment social networking sites offer shortcuts too at ecrush com a site for teens and young adults some million registered users communicate through prewritten lines that appear via drop down screens popular choices include "omg youre so hot " "if looks could kill youd be a weapon of mass destruction" and "your body is a wonderland and i wanna be alice " the immediacy of high tech love letters can be exhilarating theres no waiting for a ship to cross an ocean with news that someone finds you irresistible however while older generations have treasured handwritten love letters wrapped in ribbons many of todays young romantics will end up with little tangible proof that anyone ever cared about them unsaved emails disappear text messages are gone forever if a cellphone breaks or gets lost the implications are so stark that the federal government is now asking soldiers in iraq and afghanistan and especially their girlfriends boyfriends and spouses back home to print out loving emails if they dont future historians and soldiers offspring will have fewer insights into what love was like in this war "we encourage everyone the minute you get an email from a soldier overseas print it and put it in a file " says andrew carroll of operation homecoming the national endowment for the arts project that preserves war correspondences of course a lot of young people swear by the high tech approach shelley fulghum a year old event planner in atlanta cites the portability factor "im not going to carry a stack of love letters in my purse " she says "but its easy to save my boyfriends text messages on my cell and i can look at them whenever i need to cheer up " ms fulghum also has a backup in the past two years she has typed about messages from a previous boyfriend and from her current one into a file on her home computer to save them for posterity "i hope youre missing me as much as im missing you i cant wait to see you tomorrow i love you " read one the archive came in handy when her phone froze up and her saved text messages were lost she was sad however because she wouldnt be able to view them on her phone "i cried " she says "when id travel looking at them gave me a sense of peace " todays love letters mirror other societal changes too words of affection were once almost exclusively private exchanges between two smitten souls letters were "sealed with a kiss" and "for your eyes only " today love is often far less personal a reflection of the cravings in our culture for widespread attention millions of expressions of devotion as well as confessions about unrequited love are posted publicly on myspace and facebook given all the love poems pickup lines and profundities available on the internet plagiarism is easier than ever "all you have to do is cut and paste " says monica hernandez an year old student at wayne state university in detroit "i once sent a poem to my boyfriend that i found on the internet i told him i wrote it and it came straight from the heart he believed me " teens and twentysomethings need the constant back and forth messaging says jason ryan dorsey a year old corporate speaker and author who bills himself as "a generational liaison " "many people in my generation have a hunger for instant gratification " he says "we write it down we send it out we get the reply we want to know where we stand in a relationship right now " for help interpreting their love lives some people routinely forward suitors emails so friends and family can weigh in "people wouldnt take a handwritten love letter to kinkos make copies and then mail them to all their friends " says asia wong a new orleans artist "but with email you can just hit forward and there you go " for an art project on her web site sleeptrip com ms wong posted hundreds of love letters shed written to various people in her life such public displays of affection especially forwarded emails can lead to massive mortification in london last year year old joseph dobbie courted a woman by writing a flowery email with lines such as "your smile is the freshest of my special memories " the woman forwarded the email to her sister who sent it to her friends who sent it to their friends as the email kept getting forwarded mr dobbie ended up being mocked world wide mr dobbie reached in slough england says that for a while afterward women "were hurling themselves verbally at me by email " he wasnt sure which ones were genuine and which were just making fun of his prose and no romances resulted he has had no contact with the woman he originally tried to woo but vows that the episode wont stop his gushy tendencies should he ever meet the right woman he says hell have no qualms about sending her long romantic emails he is saddened that in a text message culture many young men show little interest in the language of love "my father is a terribly masculine enormously rugged individual " says mr dobbie "he was an offshore oil rig diver but he wrote my mom poetry if i want a relationship with somebody i believe that person is worth more than a text message " one woman who read mr dobbies forwarded email was karen loofs a government employee in ottawa canada she felt sorry that mr dobbie was being ridiculed but also thought his email deserved derision because it was filled with "red flags of narcissism" the words "i " "me" and "my " ms loofs and never married has had her share of serious relationships up until about years ago boyfriends traded handwritten letters with her she once dated a writer who sent her page love letters another boyfriend scented his in aftershave "i made the mistake of telling him i liked it " she says "so id get letters that were drenched " in her late s she had a boyfriend in his early s thats when the sweet nothings started coming by email with "nothing" being the operative word her young boyfriends messages were lazily written and filled with typos "your intellec impresses me and excits me " another contained just three letters "i l u " "i appreciated that he had feelings " says ms loofs "i just didnt really know what they were " people have been wringing their hands over the alleged demise of the love letter for nearly a century in the s there were fears that suitors would no longer have to woo their dream girls with their writings when it was easier to just phone it in the love letter survived by the s though email had led to a resurgence of written correspondence the number of people actually putting pen to paper had severely diminished though people of all ages still send traditional paper
