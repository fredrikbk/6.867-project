a better way not many in washington think president bushs military surge will solve iraq but there is plenty of enthusiasm for a diplomatic surge the iraq study group much of congress think tankers and media pundits urge diplomacy as the way out "give diplomacy a chance " they say "talk to everybody especially the bad guys and well find common ground " the general enthusiasm is not surprising given the decline of diplomacy during the bush administration we should be wary of quick fixes military or diplomatic surges reflecting desperation rarely turn out as hoped diplomacy cannot resolve iraqs internal conflicts though it may help lubricate a deal reached by iraqis or an american exit from iraq region wide diplomacy can help over the long term if based on a sound policy to re establish american power in the mideast gulf and world wide but diplomacy by itself rarely changes the facts on the ground and right now the facts appear to be a nonfunctioning central government half the country sunk in civil sectarian war and sunnis leaving iraq in droves despite optimistic rhetoric about diplomacy it is virtually certain that the neighbors wont step into this maelstrom rescue the u s and compel their various iraqi allies to buy a deal at this point no diplomatic enthusiast has explained convincingly what incentives syria and iran have to help the u s nor do the neighbors have the power to compel a settlement advocates of a diplomatic solution say the u s can do in iraq what it did in bosnia with the dayton accords but iraq is not bosnia at dayton the u s and eventually serb leader slobodan milosevic himself wanted the war to end and most importantly had the muscle to compel the parties to accept the territorial and political divisions produced by war in iraq the u s is not able to enforce its will and no neighbor or group within iraq has the power that milosevic had in bosnia regional diplomacy might prove useful if the iraqis gain momentum toward a power sharing deal but cant make tough calls without outside aid and pressure at that point the neighbors could help but as for arab israeli talks helping to settle iraq thats an illusion iraqi leaders dont care much about the palestinians they see them as past supporters of saddam hussein where serious american efforts to broker an israeli palestinian deal could help is not in iraq but in tamping down further inroads by iran among arab terrorist groups in fact this is where the real value of u s diplomacy comes in iranians and terrorists can stoke hatred and wars only the u s can lead the parties toward peace agreements and economic development but to do this washington needs a coherent policy before it can have an effective diplomacy the bush team first has to figure out realistically how to change the balance of incentives and pain for iran and syria and then translate this into diplomacy right now the u s is isolated widely seen as without a coherent policy and therefore without much power yet the ultimate paradox is that the u s not iran remains the major power in the area diplomacy with iran will take patience and the non hysterical application of american power iran is a politically divided and economically poor country it is not a regional superpower most iranians dont like their present political leaders and are open to the u s connection without giving up or giving in on key security concerns washington can let the great majority of iranians in and out of government see the benefits of better relations with the u s and allow that thought to settle in as for syria it causes a lot of trouble in the region but its leaders with their own internal problems also have demonstrated they can act on national self interest when washington gives them that choice if the u s puts the policy pieces in place working toward a realistic outcome in iraq toning down bellicose rhetoric pursuing arab israeli talks and letting americas economic and political power do the talking most nations will rally to us thats what happened in asia during the darkest days of vietnam president nixon and secretary of state kissinger put together triangular diplomacy with china and the soviet union giving the u s new global diplomatic leverage and they reaffirmed american military presence and security commitments to asian friends east asian countries knew they needed america for their peace and prosperity and quickly moved behind washington though different from asia arab leaders also know they need america probably the u s would have done better to try to establish and maintain diplomatic contacts with friends and enemies in the region all along but too much water and blood have now passed under the bridge for such wishful thinking jumping into diplomacy without a careful weighing of underlying policy and power could strengthen the bargaining hands of the tyrannical regimes confuse and unsettle friends and put all the pressure for making concessions on the u s better for the moment to let the saudis continue sounding out the parties and spend the next months figuring out exactly what to do in iraq how to use diplomacy to support that and how to re establish u s diplomatic power in that nasty part of the world mr abramowitz is a senior fellow of the century foundation mr gelb is president emeritus of the council on
