u s europe auto firms find no relief from weak yen u s and european auto makers are complaining about the competitive advantage a weak yen gives their japanese rivals but policy steps to prop up the currency are unlikely anytime soon the yen has touched record lows against the euro in recent weeks and is also weak by historical standards against the u s dollar that makes life hard for u s and european car makers which have a hard enough time matching the japanese in cost and quality without adding currency disadvantages according to the automotive trade policy council in washington the weak yen is giving japanese producers a cost advantage of between and over their u s and european counterparts "it is not fair game nor sound economic practice to allow or even encourage japan to ignore its domestic reforms rely on yen subsidized exports and ask its trading partners to pay the price " says steve collins president of the atpc european car makers are equally vocal "this one sided advantage due to currency effects has absolutely nothing to do with the actual competitiveness or attractiveness of products " says bernd gottschalk president of the german auto industry association vda "the yen rate develops more and more into an invisible price and cost advantage which german manufacturers have to counter with the power of their brands and quality alone " mr gottschalk says under pressure by some of their biggest industry groups european politicians have pressed to put the problem on the agenda of the meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the group of seven leading industrial nations in essen germany this weekend but they have yet to persuade the u s to form a common front in discussions with japanese officials without which action on the yen is unlikely u s and european automobile manufacturers recognize that they face a common problem the big three u s auto makers general motors corp ford motor co and daimlerchrysler ags chrysler unit are finding allies overseas where car makers also feel the weak yens impact gms chief economist mustafa mohatarem estimates that the company and its detroit counterparts suffer from a per vehicle cost disadvantage related to the yens weakness that ranges from &# for some smaller passenger cars built in asia to as much as &# to &# on luxury cars "if you leave the yen weak for a long time youll start to get a flood of imports from japan " mr mohatarem says "japans policy is to promote exports over domestic consumption " but there appears to be little hope of relief in the near future the main reason for yen weakness is the large gap between interest rates in the u s and europe on the one hand and japan on the other with the annual rate of inflation in japan still low and the outlook for domestic demand uncertain the bank of japan doesnt appear likely to have good reason to raise rates significantly in meanwhile u s policy makers appear to accept that the yens exchange rate is the product of market forces and isnt being manipulated indeed some european auto companies appear to be resigned to living with a weak yen for some time "the japanese auto industry has been helped by this situation both in the u s and in europe " says christian streiff chairman of psa peugeot citroen sa "the advantage that the japanese have is a bit like the weather its something over which we have no control it rains it snows " with the g unlikely to agree on a common statement that would focus on the yens weakness in an effort to talk the currency up auto makers and other exporters on both sides of the atlantic will have to live with strong competition from japanese counterparts for some time to come michael brendel david pearson and john d stoll contributed to this article
