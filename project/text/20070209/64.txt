playboy archives go digital that means its articles too in hugh hefner bought a nude picture of marilyn monroe from a local chicago calendar company and published the first issue of playboy the magazine took erotica out of the back alleys and placed it in a stylized package helping to usher in the sexual revolution which quickly left the publication behind today playboy in an attempt to get back in step with the present is unveiling plans to make its entire text and photo archive available digitally the new venture will allow consumers to peruse playboys articles and photos on dvd all issues of the monthly will be rendered page by page on six discs one for each decade the first two discs will hit stores in october each disc will retail for &# is meant to be viewed on a computer screen and will be accompanied by a page book in an age when consumers are accustomed to quick google like searches on the web the scanned pages of old playboys are likely to seem more like a quaint time capsule than a technological breakthrough magazines that feature nudity have given way to an internet where all manner of raciness is a button push away but mr hefner in an interview seems untroubled by the ups and downs of the playboy legacy and the challenges posed by the web the year old founder of the magazine has been trying to reinvent the playboy ethos since the late s when the counterculture and the feminist movement gave it an anachronistic feel almost overnight circulation is less than half of what it was at its early s peak "the seventies was the pinnacle of the magazine business and we had huge issues with a breadth of talent " says lee froehlich playboys executive editor during this era the magazines signature interviews featured such luminaries as tennessee williams muhammad ali and jimmy carter who famously said in a article "ive looked on a lot of women with lust ive committed adultery in my heart many times god forgives me for it " the magazine has also featured nude pictorials of a number of women who were either famous at the time or went on to become so including sharon stone jane fonda and anna nicole smith who died yesterday jamming some of playboys email system with requests for reprints of her image "part of the great charm of revisiting the magazine " says mr hefner "is the combination of the words the pictures and the advertising the entire sense of the pop culture of any particular era people remember these issues at a particular point in time its like a part of coming of age " playboy is hoping consumers will see the dvd as a collectible playboy has a web site but almost no archive to speak of says mr froehlich "like most places this old it was really an ad hoc setup " he says old copies of the magazine were kept in bound volumes but until editors seeking an old article had to riffle through annual print indexes that kept track of hand written cards outlining the content of various issues for the dvd project playboy enterprises inc is working with the same company that created the complete new yorker a digital version of the new yorker magazines archives released in the fall of some critics found fault with the new yorker dvds search functions users couldnt search for keywords within the text of articles only within titles and abstracts among other difficulties the new yorker has come out with a revised digital archive on a hard drive that it says vastly improves the technology and solves these issues this time playboy and partner bondi digital publishing promise better search functions "ill be able to type in norman mailer and see every reference to him since the start of the magazine " says mr froehlich converting the magazine requires painstakingly scanning pages of playboy magazines and then doing a "text conversion process " which involves manually typing all the text on the page bondi is using two typists per page to copy the text into a database to improve accuracy then bondi will break each page down into its elements cartoons editorial content advertising photos and captions playboy feels that by duplicating the magazine exactly as it existed complete with ads and in the same format as they appeared on the pages of the magazine that they dont need to seek additional rights from writers or artists featured in its pages its a loophole the new yorker exploited as well for its project the tactic has drawn scrutiny from some writers groups "in this case id have to take a very hard look to see where this goes in the context of commercial advantage " says gerard colby president of the national writers union the nations only trade union dedicated to freelance writers "even if this does fall within the supreme courts parameters of allowed reproduction wed still want to take a look at this whole issue of remuneration for writers if the publisher is taking commercial advantage " the images from the dvds will be printable but cant be passed from one computer to another "we did a lot of thought about security issues and there was a lot of debate about it " says mr froehlich in the end the system will be used not only to sell the dvd packages but also will be used to create a web based system within playboy that editors can use to search the magazines archives today even as so called lad mags such as emap plcs fhm closes down and penthouse emerges from bankruptcy playboy maintains a circulation of about three million with a median age of down from around circulation of seven million in the circulation has held fairly steady since more recently mr hefner says the magazine has benefited from the resurgence in cocktail culture and rat pack nostalgia the tv show "the girls next door" on e is gearing up for its third season in march the reality tv series stars three female companions who live with mr hefner in the playboy mansion "something remarkable has happened to the playboy brand in the past few years " says mr hefner "it is hot again we have a hit tv show we just opened up the playboy club casino in vegas and the brand is very hot in clothing " he adds "it all connects to the future and the retro cool phenomenon " but playboy like other magazine publishers is fighting lower advertising and newsstand revenue as more readers migrate to the internet and other media the chicago based company has taken several steps to improve its performance including extensive licensing of its famous "bunny" logo on clothing and accessories playboys third quarter net income fell to &# million from &# million in the same quarter a year earlier
