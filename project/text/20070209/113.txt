weekend journal review film berlin spy thriller lives of others is brilliant debut taut sly tale has soul breaking and entering steals audiences time stalin as someone notes in "the lives of others " liked to call writers "engineers of the human soul " it was an ignorant notion as well as a malevolent one souls resist engineering and writers at least those worth getting excited about work best as soul stirrers thats what the writer of this superlative political thriller turns out to be and wonder of wonders he has directed his own original script with all the flair and gravity it deserves "political thriller" hardly hints at the scope of florian henckel von donnersmarcks debut feature in german with excellent english subtitles but youve got to start somewhere the filmmaker seems to have started at the top of his profession his film nominated for an oscar is as good as contemporary cinema gets first and foremost he has turned a bright light on a dark squalid domain of the former east germany the stasi or secret police whose declared goal was "to know everything" in that communist nation of million souls and whose employees working with as many as informants sustained a reign of pervasive terror from until when the berlin wall fell rather than dwell on the darkness and squalor however he has fashioned a genuinely thrilling tale leavened with sly humor that works ingenious variations on the theme of cat and mouse speaks to current concerns about personal privacy and illuminates the timeless conflict between totalitarianism and art the story begins in east berlin five years before the fall of the wall when the stasi puts a celebrated playwright under intense surveillance georg dreyman is suspected of nothing in particular indeed he has long been considered politically reliable still a cultural commissar has his own reasons for targeting him so the full apparatus of official snoopery is brought to bear on the handsome relatively affluent writer and his equally prominent actress girlfriend christa bugging his apartment tapping his phone listening to what he says day and night and transcribing his conversations in minute detail the excellent actors who play georg and christa sebastian koch and martina gedeck are german celebrities in their own right the presiding snoop is a stasi expert and true believer captain wiesler hes played with chilling brilliance by ulrich muhe wieslers stare is lethal his small smile could curdle cream his body is trim and his mind seems to have been trained for maximum suspicion with minimum introspection alone in his listening post head encased in earphones he monitors dreyman and christa with preternatural intensity but then something strange starts to happen the more deeply wiesler enters the vibrant lives of those others the more his eavesdropping turns to empathy i dont want to spoil the suspense or the austere fun by revealing the outcome suffice it to say that nothing can be taken for granted but this unlikely hero is endlessly more interesting than he first seems to be and the remarkably supple script allows the spirit of arthur koestlers "darkness at noon" to co exist with that of woody allens "bullets over broadway " "the lives of others" is very much a filmmakers film with a rigorously controlled outwardly somber tone gray buildings stone faces baleful light a few shabby trabis spewing tailpipe smoke on deserted streets the cinematographer was hagen bogdanski at the same time the drama is full of life and closely connected to life then and now its most obvious relevance to our world is its depiction of state sanctioned surveillance just as its most obvious movie reference is to francis coppolas masterful "the conversation" we may see surveillance as a troubling necessity in a time of unprecedented danger while struggling to set its proper limits the stasi saw spying as a natural way of life and informers as a necessary good the human equivalent of pistachio shells used to pry other shells open the films enduring value though lies in what it has to say never didactically always inferentially about the power of art the strength and fragility of artists one scene in a cafe involving christa and a hitherto secret admirer is as heartbreaking as it is breathtaking and what it means to be human artists baffle the stasi thugs and therefore frighten them wieslers superior a lubricious lieutenant colonel named grubitz believes all artists can be reduced to five categories the vast stasi bureaucracy keeps track of every typewriter owned by every writer in the land the better to identify an author if subversive literature should surface grubitzs superior the porcine culture minister hempf scorns the playwright georg dreyman with a special passion "thats what we all love about your plays " hempf tells him condescendingly "your love for humanity your belief that people can change dreyman no matter how often you say it in your plays people do not change " but one person changes quite miraculously in "the lives of others " its a life changing movie breaking and entering anthony minghellas "breaking and entering" starts busily and soon becomes a bafflement such an interesting cast such technical excellence so many intricate details and parallel plot threads yet so little clarity or urgency jude law is a successful london architect will francis who lives not happily with a swedish beauty named liv shes played by robin wright penn his design firm is in the process of transforming kings cross an area described by a cop perhaps charitably as being in flux soon after the firm puts down roots where its project is the flux materializes in the form of a gang of young thieves who break in at night and steal all the new computers but the movies title covers more than material theft will whose long term relationship is at the breaking point partly thanks to livs emotionally disturbed daughter breaks into and enters the life of a beautiful bosnian refugee amira juliette binoche working awfully hard in the role whose child is also troubled in her sons case its an existential anger that has led him to join the very gang that purloined the computers from wills shop this plot summary may sound silly but i didnt mean to use it as a tool of ridicule the problem with discussing the film is the problem with watching the film its all over the place two dysfunctional families two betrayals several transformations everything makes sense if you parse the plot but the proceedings remain remote notwithstanding benoit delhommes vivid photography the only one having any fun is vera farmiga as oana a russian whore "if you work with nature " oana asks the professionally green will who resists her blandishments "why are you against nature " a non sequitur perhaps but welcome relief from overworked sequiturs an unreasonable man depending on ones point of view the democrats lost the presidential election because ralph nader was a crazy zealot who wouldnt drop out because ralph nader harbored a leninist belief that things must get worse before they get better because ralph nader couldnt betray his principles by dropping out or because the democrats couldnt figure out how to win all of the above theories are examined in "an unreasonable man " a substantial if overlong documentary feature by henriette mantel and steve skrovan and which theory is favored the tip off can be found at the start of the film in the passage from george bernard shaws "man and superman " that provides the title "the reasonable man adapts himself to the world the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man " many things are well known about ralph nader and the film honors them appropriately his corvair crusade against general motors which put him on the map by sending detectives after him and getting caught at it his ardent advocacy of such consumer causes as seat belts air bags clean air and pure food he once called hot dogs "missiles of death " "an unreasonable man" also contains its share of oddments and revelations a glimpse of his office through a barely open door suggests the document choked lair of a certified pack rat during an exquisitely ill at ease appearance on saturday night live he wore an airbag that was supposed to deploy but didnt george mcgovern wanted to consider him as a running mate in but mr naders influence declined precipitously during the reagan years when support from the democrats waned as well and that influence didnt begin to rebound until he reinvented himself as an ever more outspoken outsider "an unreasonable man" doesnt polish its subjects reputation his detractors call him deluded or worse or soften his hard edges he calls the nations political system "one corporate party with two heads " but the film contends admiringly and convincingly that ralph naders authentic sense of outrage is the reason he persists when he cant prevail dvd tip east germany never looked bleaker i mean more atmospheric than in "the spy who came in from the cold" the screen version directed by martin ritt of john le carres classic cold war thriller richard burton is alec leamas the bleak souled british agent who stalks an east german operative played by oskar werner
