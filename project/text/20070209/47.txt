irs urges companies to pay taxes owed by workers unaware of backdated options washington the internal revenue service has come up with a plan to help rank and file employees who owe taxes because they unwittingly received backdated stock options have their employers pick up the tab the irs initiative which is voluntary proposes that companies with backdating problems pay the steep additional taxes due from lower level employees who exercised backdated stock options in the theory employees who had nothing to do with receiving backdated options shouldnt be penalized top corporate officials of companies with backdating problems will remain on the hook for taxes on exercised stock options that were backdated "were sending the message here that a proper penalty has to be paid but allowing it to be resolved by the companies so lower ranking individuals arent swallowing the penalty " irs commissioner mark w everson said in an interview "we think its appropriate to pursue more directly individuals who were manipulating and benefiting from the untoward conduct " the irs program comes as more than companies are facing potential problems about how their stock options were dated more than companies are under investigation by the securities and exchange commission and the justice department has charged five executives with criminal wrongdoing in connection with stock options backdating robert salwen a compensation attorney and consultant in scarsdale n y said the irs announcement isnt a major concession by the government but is really "a way for companies to minimize the embarrassment of having failed to comply" with tax rules on stock options under irs regulations each affected employee is required to go through the task of calculating the penalties and interest due on improperly dated options then report that on their individual s what the irs is doing mr salwen says "is allowing companies to take on the burden of having to report and calculate the penalty taxes " some lawyers say it is hard to imagine many companies taking advantage of the new irs program since paying employees taxes doesnt resolve any corporate tax issues and there is no penalty to corporations for not participating in the program the initiative comes in response to a request by a group of lawyers and accountants who sought to develop a settlement program where companies would pay something less than the full tax that employees would be charged "we proposed the irs develop a program where companies can say were not sure we have a problem but wed be willing to pay something to make it go away " said mary b hevener a partner in baker &amp mckenzie llps washington office "im a little surprised its this tough for them to announce settlement terms that are the maximum conceivable amount that anyone will pay people arent going to take them up on the settlement " another obstacle a number of companies havent completed internal investigations looking into whether options were backdated so they may not know if they have a problem or the potential cost to fix it the irs has given companies until feb to notify the agency of their intention to participate in the program and until march to contact employees about their participation the program applies only to options that vested in and and were exercised last year mr salwen said he expects some companies will take up the irs on its offer and he figures the irs would benefit too instead of having to audit hundreds of individual filings from employees at a particular company to ensure compliance it only has to look at information filed by the company itself under irs rules employees have to pay regular income tax on income they have received from exercising stock options based on the difference between the options strike price and the market value of the stock when the option is exercised for employees who received backdated options they may have to pay an additional tax plus an interest tax under deferred compensation regulations the rules dont apply to options that vested before while companies cant resolve their top executives taxes through this program some have taken steps to spare them from the tax on any options they havent yet exercised by repricing the options to fix the backdating in some of these cases the companies have paid the executives a special bonus to compensate them for the repricing mark maremont and charles forelle contributed to this article
