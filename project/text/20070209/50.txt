latest report shows climate pessimists were climate realists in the great climate debate those who argue that the world is not warming or that if it is its warming naturally dont like being called "greenhouse skeptics " theyre none too fond of "climate contrarians" or "greenhouse deniers " either instead james taylor of the heartland institute a libertarian research and advocacy group in chicago calls himself a "climate realist " now some years after scientists first warned that greenhouse gases would alter the planets climate in dangerous ways it is possible to assess who is being more realistic starting with the first report of the u n sponsored intergovernmental panel on climate change in critics have called its projections foolishly apocalyptic some earlier reports did miss the mark on a few counts but not in the way the "realists" contend in some cases the reality of climate change has been even worse than the alarming forecasts a number of greenhouse projections were spot on while others underestimated how radically gases such as carbon dioxide emitted when fossil fuels burn would alter climate by trapping heat in the atmosphere the worlds surface temperature has increased one third of a degree celsius since the upper end of projections according to scientists led by stefan rahmstorf of the potsdam institute for climate research in germany their analysis appeared last week in the online issue of the journal science with sea level climate change has outpaced the projections satellite measurements show that the waters around the world rose millimeters per year averaged from to the ipcc foresaw millimeters per year "the main message of our analysis is to those who have claimed that ipcc is exaggerating climate change or is painting unduly grim future scenarios " says dr rahmstorf "unfortunately this is not true the real climate system is changing as fast as or in some components even faster than expected by ipcc " ice in arctic seas also is melting faster than expected though that doesnt raise sea levels melting ice on land does it now covers less area than it did in and less in the late summer "thats about double the mean model projection " notes physicist joseph romm author of a new book on global warming "hell or high water " to be sure ipcc scientists keep refining their forecasts narrowing the range of predicted sea level rise and global warming and in some cases settling on a less dire "best estimate " the first report in had degrees celsius as the best estimate for global warming by the best estimate had fallen to degrees celsius in the report and is now degrees to degrees the statistic that heartened mr taylor was the best estimate of sea level rise by it was centimeters in the report and centimeters in the report with a range of to centimeters the current report released in summary form last week gives a range of to centimeters by the centurys end "we see a retraction of the most extreme global warming scenarios" in regard to sea level says mr taylor "it bears out what climate realists have said" about the cassandra ish tendencies of climatologists who study the greenhouse effect whatever brings however sea level rise today has exceeded forecasts that doesnt mean it will continue to sea level rise is the most difficult greenhouse effect to predict but so far ice sheets at the top and bottom of the world in greenland and antarctica have behaved in ways models failed to predict disintegrating faster than even the ipcc report anticipated "we dont have models of ice sheet behavior that we have faith in " says michael oppenheimer of princeton university an ipcc author "they didnt predict what the ice sheets have done over the past years " the models fall short in their representation of ice streams rivers of ice that despite being solid flow from ice sheets out to sea the streams have been speeding up carrying ice to the ocean more quickly than expected "there has been a revolution in our knowledge of how major ice sheets respond to climate change " says kevin trenberth of the national center for atmospheric research boulder colo "this isnt incorporated fully into the models but observations show the response is happening and faster than expected " the ipcc got it right when it projected more downpours and droughts already precipitation falls less often but when it rains it pours the basic idea that global average temperatures would rise has also been spot on with of the past years among the warmest since instruments began recording temperatures in because climate models cant zero in on extreme weather events though except to say they will occur more often they failed to foresee disasters like the heat wave in europe that killed some people in focusing on global averages climate projections make the coming changes sound gradual slow sedate thats how ozone loss was originally portrayed too no one foresaw the sudden "ozone hole" over antarctica it remains to be seen if climate reality too can suddenly tip into an extreme you can email me at sciencejournal wsj com
