ahead of the tape todays market forecast for fortress a perfect time to go public today marks another ironic wall street moment private equity and hedge funds have been gobbling up publicly traded companies and taking them private but the private money investors themselves are going the opposite way last year private equity giants kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co and apollo management lp publicly listed investment companies in europe debt rating companies like s&amp p and moodys have begun publicly rating the debt and operations of a few hedge funds now fortress investment group a &# billion money manager is listing shares on the new york stock exchange fortress is raising &# million in the ipo to compensate top people and finance deals among other things private money funds have been one of wall streets great mysteries and great fads they have accordingly received a mixed reception from investors kkrs fund still trades below its &# initial offering price fortress earned a cool &# million in the first nine months of through a collection of investment vehicles that make big private equity bets and fast hedge fund trades not to mention dabbling in real estate and other investments as is often the case in a listing prospectus its discussion of the risk factors in its business read like a long russian novel investors are making a bet on the handful of savvy investment pros running the company if the brain trust leaves or falters it would have as lawyers like to say "a material adverse effect" on the business investors also could get plenty of volatility investment banks for instance trade at low multiples to their earnings because investors are unsure of whether trading and banking profits are sustainable from one year to the next in the case of private equity earnings can fluctuate because it is difficult to predict when investments will pay off down years on wall street make it hard to exit long running investments they also make it hard to raise new cash something money managers depend upon still the fortress offering seems likely to be greeted warmly the market is hot and private money is in vogue a perfect time to go public useless fiction heat miser wins the day ideas taken too far get investors wrong footed take the price of oil yesterday oil for march delivery jumped &# to &# a barrel in new york driven by a california oil field fire and worries about cold weather the idea that it might get cold this winter seemed farfetched a few weeks ago oil inventories were rising and global warming was in the news the easy conclusion was that mister heat miser had won the day another idea making the rounds was that saudi arabia worried about irans expanding role in the middle east would keep crude production high to drive prices down and hurt its rival the saudis after all can profit even when prices are low instead last week saudi arabia said it would cut production opecs back was no more broken than winters and the price of crude rallied on the news leaving anyone who bet it was going the other way out in the cold justin lahart send comments to scott patterson wsj com or justin lahart wsj com
