review &amp outlook editorial andy stern hearts wal mart as unlikely romances go the match between wal mart ceo lee scott and union chief andy stern ranks with rosie and the donald or dick cheney and pat leahy so the press was understandably abuzz this week when the antagonists joined with other business and labor types in washington to announce a new coalition to work toward "universal" health care whats really going on here we can understand mr sterns joyful presence on the stage the service workers chief has made it his lifes ambition to pass "national" i e government run health care and enlisting a couple of big shot corporate executives to his side gives the effort a political boost mr stern is nothing if not a shrewd operator and he all but laid out his business co option strategy last year on these pages the presence of hillary clinton supporter john podesta was another sign of his political calculation what is less clear is what mr scott intel chairman craig barrett and at&amp t hope to get out of this liaison like mr stern they all realize that todays employer based health insurance system is showing signs of strain and at the level of self interest they might also agree with mr stern that someone other than their companies should pay for their workers health care costs but if they think theyre buying some larger political reprieve by joining mr stern theyre surely mistaken wed have thought wal marts mr scott of all people would know this mr stern is the man behind wal mart watch the union financed harassment operation that has made life miserable for the company across the country hes berated wal mart in particular for its lack of health benefits for employees even though its rate of insured workers at is higher than the retail industry average most of the rest are insured through spouses parents and the like mr scott has already tried to appease these critics retaining a bevy of beltway and former clinton administration pr operatives one of their bright ideas was to have mr scott endorse a minimum wage increase which wouldnt hurt wal mart but would hurt its smaller less profitable competitors who cant afford to pay more and the company made a media splash out of inviting al gore to arkansas to inspect its "green" initiatives most of which save wal mart money in any case we havent noticed any reduction in anti wal mart union animus as a result as for health care the stakes are far higher the country stands at a policy crossroads on health care and the choices arent merely between the status quo and some gauzy concept of "universal coverage " at issue are the policy choices that would best provide that coverage while maintaining the incentives for innovation and high quality care and on that score the political and intellectual divide is very wide mr stern knows what he wants which is a steady march toward a government run system the alternative is to move via tax and regulatory reform to a more consumer friendly individual marketplace more than a few american businesses are tempted to go the government route because it would allow them to toss their liabilities on the taxpayer the big three car makers were among hillarycares most vocal supporters in for precisely this reason and some ceos are toying with similar notions now on grounds that it would improve their global "competitiveness " but any money government spends on health care has to come from somewhere read taxpayers health care is a big reason that the overall tax burden is as high as it is in most of europe according to the oecd the "tax wedge" as a share of all labor costs was only in the u s in it was above in most of europe and above in france and germany these countries spend little on defense so "national health care" and other social services explain the high tax burden we havent noticed these economies being especially "competitive" of late to his credit intels mr barrett spoke in favor this week of precisely the kind of market reforms that are needed but he and the rest of the business community could do far more good if they started to educate americans about the virtues of plans that devolve more health care control to individuals most workers are unaware that the cost of providing them with health insurance is keeping their wages lower than they would otherwise be one of the beneficial effects of president bushs recent and innovative proposal would be to make that trade off transparent as for mr scott and wal mart mr stern freely admits that a major goal all along has been to pressure mr scott into endorsing national health insurance given this weeks love fest the union maestro might be forgiven for concluding hed finally gotten his man we hope were not seeing a case of business stockholm syndrome in bentonville
