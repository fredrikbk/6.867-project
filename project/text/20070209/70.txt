politics &amp economics dissent in tehran buoys west unrest infighting grow as sanctions take toll an element of theater iran is likely to showcase the expansion of its main nuclear plant as another advance toward large scale production of enriched uranium just in time for sundays th anniversary of its islamic revolution but dont expect the bush administration or its european allies to get agitated about the news officials in washington london and paris say that for the first time in several years tehran is showing signs of both political and economic unease in the wake of international moves to sanction irans nuclear program added pressure these officials say could nudge opinion in iran closer toward favoring a deal to suspend its uranium work no one is predicting victory anytime soon in the high stakes feud with iran over its alleged ambitions to develop nuclear weapons still western officials have been cheered by reports of rising political dissent in tehran as well as debate within government circles there over the wisdom of stirring more international opposition to the nuclear program even sundays festivities which are expected to focus on irans nuclear developments are being seen in washington as a sign of weakness iran has been scrambling for months to assemble thousands of centrifuges at its main nuclear facility in natanz so it can claim to have made a technological leap toward enriching large amounts of the uranium needed to fuel nuclear power plants or in the eyes of the west to produce nuclear weapons u s and european officials say the natanz work remains shoddy and is largely being done for domestic effect "there is a large element of theater in all this " said one senior bush administration official for now "there is little reason to believe that iran is actually leaping to a new technological level " iranian officials have denied they are pursuing nuclear weapons and argue they have the right to enrich uranium under international rules amid rising tensions with the u s irans supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said on state television yesterday that iran would go after american "interests around the world" if attacked by the u s after months of haggling the united nations security council agreed just before christmas to impose limited economic restrictions on iran it gave the country until feb to suspend its uranium enrichment program or face another round of sanctions the u s has used the resolution to push europe irans largest trading partner by far to take independent actions such as cutting off bank lending and curtailing hefty government backed export guarantees to iran some european countries have been quietly warning their banks about the risk of doing business in iran last week france said it was imposing some limited restrictions on its export guarantees to iran with possibly more to come "for the first time really iran is paying a price for its nuclear work and also showing some strain " said one senior european diplomat "and also for the first time there is a sense of real unity among the key players who are working this issue " u s and european officials say there is ample evidence the u n resolution and other moves have hit home in iran president mahmoud ahmadinejad who has been irans loudest voice of defiance against the international community since his election months ago has become a target of criticism over his handling of domestic and foreign policy former president hashemi rafsanjani in the past two weeks has criticized mr ahmadinejads confrontational approach toward the west more than half of the countrys parliament members slammed the president last month for his domestic stewardship and jomhuri islami a conservative newspaper loyal to mr khamenei warned last month that iran should stop provoking the u s and take the u n resolution seriously mr ahmadinejad just days before had dismissed the resolution as "a piece of torn paper " mr ahmadinejad who previously denied the holocaust took place and threatened to wipe israel off the map is also coming under increasing fire on the economic front inflation and unemployment are picking up european officials said while investment in irans critical oil and gas fields is plunging european and u s officials note iran has begun to reach out to saudi arabia and other countries in what they describe as a bid by tehran to deflect mounting pressures on the country recent u s actions against iranian officials in iraq including the arrest by u s forces of five suspected security officials there last month has heightened friction between the u s and iran leading the recent talks with the countrys neighbors has been iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani who mr ahmadinejad sidelined in september at a critical moment in negotiations with europe over avoiding u n sanctions mr larijani is now planning to meet with european officials on the periphery of a security conference in germany this weekend potentially the first such talks since the summer european officials said that while they dont expect meetings with mr larijani to amount to much his overture is significant as it may portend a softening in irans stance in the meantime the bush administration said it is prepared to push ahead on a second sanctions resolution against iran within the u n nuclear standoff irans president mahmoud ahmadinejad has resisted international pressure to suspend some of his countrys nuclear activities recent events in the conflict february a month after iran broke the seals at its natanz nuclear research facility the international atomic energy agency votes to report iran to the u n security council april iran claims to have enriched small amounts of uranium at natanz june in a significant policy shift the bush administration offers to join direct talks with iran and presents other incentives if tehran suspends enrichment august a u n security council
