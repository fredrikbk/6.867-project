away with me " all vaulted into the multiplatinum stratosphere after being embraced by the barnes &amp noble set the latest act aiming for this elusive demographic target is rodrigo y gabriela an acoustic guitar duo from mexico by way of dublin rodrigo sanchez and gabriela quintero use their two instruments to conjure a frenetic blend of international influences that includes spanish flamenco anglo american heavy metal portuguese fado and traditional irish music beats the shtick includes instrumental renditions of songs by metallica and led zeppelin plus intricate percussive thumping on the guitar body by ms quintero and has drawn an improbably strong following when such an oddball act takes shape its often unplanned rodrigo y gabrielas path to their unorthodox mix begins in mexico city metal bands continues through lounge gigs for tequila soaked tourists at the beach and gets its finishing touches on the streets of dublin "id like to say i thought about it " mr sanchez says "but no it was totally an accident we never planned it " in ireland the band first came to prominence after singer songwriter damien rice tapped them as an opening act in in october their self titled debut album entered the sales chart there at no now the group is gaining traction in the u s thanks to a deal with ato records owned by rocker dave matthews moving rodrigo y gabriela from hipster phenomenon to mainstream success is likely to be an uphill battle the band is arraying the support for such breakouts influential public radio stations such as kcrw in los angeles and san franciscos kfog have begun playing the band while fan posted video clips on youtube have attracted hundreds of thousands of viewers rodygab as fans call them have played high profile television gigs on the "late show with david letterman" and "the tonight show with jay leno " nic harcourt music director at kcrw believes the new album could join "buena vista" and "o brother" in the sales stratosphere when such albums succeed he says they "seem just come out of nowhere and nobody in the industry would have predicted they would be gold or platinum " after sold out concerts in los angeles san francisco and denver local sales of "rodrigo y gabriela" doubled says jon salter marketing director at ato and the disc has crept into the billboard album sales chart in a sign of their relative market strength their debut slightly edged out a new album by one of the buzzier alternative rock acts in the pipeline these days the los angeles band silversun pickups now ato is hoping to vault the act to the masses target stores signed on to push the disc at its stores most likely at a priced to move &# a disc while the label is starting to push the disc to commercial rock radio stations mr salter describes the ultimate target as "that adult buyer who buys one or two records a year " connecting with such buyers is more desirable than ever thanks to rampant online piracy and competition for young peoples dollars from videogames ipods and other new devices according to the recording industry association of america people older than age made up more than of music buyers in up from barely in rodrigo y gabriela got their start playing in heavy metal bands in mexico city after years of fruitless struggle the pair packed it in and moved to ixtapa where they got gigs playing for tourists in restaurants and busking on street corners "for the first time we found we could make money " mr sanchez says by telephone from ixtapa where he was home taking a break from u s promotional activities the pair also discovered that their new gigs didnt always mean abandoning the music they loved "although we had some jazz standards we were able to play all our metal repertoire without being annoying to people " mr sanchez adds "the tourists were just eating and they didnt recognize if we were playing metallica or whatever " the groups cover of "stairway to heaven " a favorite on the new album was first trotted out under these circumstances after decamping to dublin to visit friends including a group of traditional celtic musicians rodrigo y gabriela refined their act inspired by a kind of local drum called a bodhran seeking to emulate the instruments rapid fire beat ms quintero began thumping on her guitars body likewise seeking to give his new musician friends a taste of his roots mr sanchez for the first time began writing songs with latin and flamenco flavors busking on the streets of dublin one day the pair played "diablo rojo " their first composition incorporating all these musical elements "when we finished people gave us a lot of money " mr sanchez recalls a career path spread out before their eyes "it wasnt like we wanted to have a project we just said were going to write another tune and were going to make more money its kind of an honest approach " now ato is hoping to make something similar happen on a much larger scale "i hope this is another one of these phenomena " mr salter says "like o brother where art thou and buena vista social club " there is one audience rodygab emphatically isnt courting serious flamenco fans "we say it all the time we dont play flamenco " says mr sanchez who still acknowledges growing up with and loving that music "we dont want to cheat anyone if they buy tickets for our concert thinking its flamenco they will be very very surprised a crazy flamenco lover would be annoyed "
