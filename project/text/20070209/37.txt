emi mulls lifting online music restrictions in a move that could signal a shift in the music industrys antipiracy strategy emi group plc has been holding talks with several online retailers about the possibility of selling its entire digital music catalog in the unprotected mp format which can be freely copied and played on virtually any device according to numerous people familiar with the matter if emi strikes such deals it would become the first major music company to embrace a burgeoning effort to expand the digital marketplace by removing restrictions on the ways consumers can listen to music they purchase online earlier this week apple inc s chief executive steve jobs endorsed the idea of selling music without copy protections arguing that they have done little to slow the piracy that has beset the music industry the idea is that removing such barriers will help boost digital music sales because consumers would be able to play music purchased from any online store on any digital music device currently for example music purchased at apples itunes store can only be played on the companys ipod device a problem that has caused much griping from record companies and competing music services one person familiar with the matter said that several major music companies have floated the idea of scrapping copy protections in recent months however none appears to have gone as far down the road as emi and others are clearly still opposed because they say that copy protection software is critical to stop piracy on thursday warner music group corp chairman edgar bronfman jr said his company continues to believe that such protections are essential the london based emi is believed to have held talks with a wide range of online retailers that compete with apples itunes those competing retailers include realnetworks inc emusic com musicnet inc and viacom inc s mtv networks people familiar with the matter cautioned that emi could still abandon the proposed strategy before implementing it a decision about whether to keep pursuing the idea could come as soon as today an emi spokeswoman declined to comment on what she called "speculation " for emi the move represents a chance to shake off the notion that it has been a laggard in developing a digital music strategy while other music companies have experimented with different online endeavors emi for example is the only major music company that has not struck a licensing deal with google inc s youtube emi is the worlds third largest music company by sales while the company is home to acts ranging from the beatles to radiohead and the beastie boys not all of its acts notably the beatles sell their music in any digital form yet with a few minor exceptions the major music companies so far have insisted that their online music offerings come with copy protection software that software known as digital rights management or drm is not always compatible between music players for example the drm software in apples dominant itunes store isnt compatible with other companies digital music players causing some to wonder whether it might be hampering sales continued growth of digital download sales is generally viewed as a key to the music industrys ability to survive the ongoing decimation of sales of its core product compact discs cd sales began dropping in when the original napster file sharing service made it simple for people to access free digital copies of songs online cd sales represent about of u s music sales but they have fallen more than this year alone compared with the same period in according to nielsen soundscan sales of digital tracks continues to rise but the rate of growth has cooled in recent months and has not kept pace with the decline in cd sales that is a source of concern for the music industry the argument in favor of drm holds that with cd sales quickly fading and digital track sales still on the rise albeit more slowly than in the past it is critical for the music industry to protect itself in the new digital age according to people familiar with the matter emi initially began exploring the issue in earnest in late december when it circulated proposals to online music retailers part of its proposal was a request for a one time multimillion dollar "risk insurance" payment that would not be tallied against future sales three people familiar with the talks said online retailers generally balked at the request emi then returned with a new proposal in late january around the time of a music conference in cannes france emi asked the online retailers to tell it what size advance payments they would offer in exchange for the right to sell its music as mps those proposals were to be submitted yesterday said one person familiar with the matter this person understood that emi would decide whether to forge ahead with the mp strategy based on the offers aggregate worth the music industrys trade group the recording industry association of america has continued to call for copy protections it endorsed one alternative that mr jobs outlined but dismissed in which apple would license its own drm to competitors riaa chief mitch bainwol said in a statement that this would "enable the interoperability that we have been urging in the marketplace for a very long time " people within the music and technology industries believe mr jobs might have written his essay after learning of emis proposed plans but a person familiar with the matter said mr jobs began work on the essay three weeks ago in response to actions by european agencies to pressure apple into making its music products work with hardware and online music service made by other companies in his essay mr jobs encouraged those groups to turn their attention to major music labels several of which are partially or wholly owned by european companies "perhaps those unhappy with the current situation should redirect their energies toward persuading the music companies to sell their music drm free " he wrote aaron o patrick contributed to this article
