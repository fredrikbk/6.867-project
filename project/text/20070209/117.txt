weekend journal taste de gustibus a surfeit of soffits the lavoies have been building homes in westchester county n y since so it was only natural that when my husband and i decided to find a new place to hang our hats we turned to my father in law phil following his advice to look at several existing houses for sale so we could see what you get for your money in this overheated real estate market answer not a lot we agreed that our hats belonged in a house constructed for them why pay an extortionate price for someone elses house when we might build one for ourselves with the help of family know how and wholesale lumber my first thought aside from gratitude for phils can do spirit was one of well lets call it trepidation i had watched pbss "this old house " and tlcs "trading spaces" is a favorite i had seen many band saws and nail guns do wonders with sheetrock and window frames i had been peripherally involved as phil and my brother in law restored a victorian barn and converted it into a home but i had also seen "mister blandings builds his dream house " the classic movie based on a novel by eric hodgins describing a black comedy of overcosts delays and mislaid plans while i trusted phil and his many years of experience surely i thought there was reason to tread carefully into new home ground it turns out that my nightmare imaginings were misplaced yet the experience has been one of those rare ones in modern life a moment of reckoning with the nuts and bolts of existence im sure im not alone when i say i simply dont think about the plumbing until it doesnt work or what kind of windows i have until i need to clean them its not as if were building xanadu yet there are it seems a million decisions to be made to get a house from blueprint to move in and each one involves thinking about details that most of the time we simply take for granted do you know what a soffit is mine are going to be white why because early in the building process phil said that he thought white was best and i agreed without having the foggiest notion of what a soffit was i know now of course that soffits are "the material forming a ceiling from the top of an exterior house wall to the outer edge of the roof i e bridging the gap between a homes siding and the roofline " thank you wikipedia but never mind the challenge of "soffit" imagine the challenge of "white " sherwin williams alone has different whites in its "white family" of paint just try picking between white off white navajo white brilliant white decorator white dove white china white and pearl white without going snow blind weve spent hours wandering slack jawed through the lighting departments of home depot and lowes trying to determine which exterior ceiling mounted pendant and chandelier lights we wanted weve debated whether the planks of the wood floor should be two inches wide or three weve spent hours deciding not only what doors to put in place but what the knobs hinges and escutcheons should look like what the heck is an escutcheon you ask people who know their heraldry will know it used to be something that noble families cared about on their coats of arms its now something just as important the decorative metal back plate thingie on a door knob or lock there are a mind numbing variety of options ranging from simple round silver discs to elaborately carved shapes in a wide range of patinas the smallest things matter hugely the handles on your kitchen cabinet drawers for instance after selecting ones we loved from a book the size of the oxford english dictionary we discovered only after theyd been installed that they stick out too far from the face of the cabinet and that one of them is making it impossible to open the dishwasher door thank goodness we had phil to save us from some of these choices by just running with our generic requests like "no brass fixtures" and "make the guest bathroom green " there are even more practical concerns we walked around the house when it was being framed to decide where exactly we wanted light switches electrical outlets and cable connections when you consider how people live these days such choices are far from simple if a few months from now we prove unable to toast bread watch the history channel and surf the web all at the same time we will have only ourselves to blame im loath to even discuss the local building codes they are as byzantine as one might imagine and as bullying why should we have to spend thousands of dollars to put catch basins in our driveway to "redistribute" rainwater or have at least four electrical outlets in every room each within six feet of the doorway and no more than feet apart i really ought to have paid attention in geometry class and shouldnt it be my prerogative not to put a railing around my front porch if i dont want one if i fall off town officials are welcome to come by point laugh and say "i told you so " in the end though it all seems worth it weve had the privilege of designing our dream house even if we did have a few "mister blandings" moments and more important its been a true labor of love well always know when we sit on our front porch drinking coffee that my husband and his father made the beams holding up the roof over our head and four generations of lavoie knowledge went into making our house a home ms lavoie is the
