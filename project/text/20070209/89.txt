sky patrol u s air marshal service navigates turbulent times armed secret agents have gripes after dress codes blow cover on sept the federal air marshal service an undercover squad trained to stop or kill hijackers on u s carriers consisted of just agents scattered on more than daily flights around the globe none were aboard any of the hijacked planes on six days later congress passed legislation calling for a massive expansion of the law enforcement service as part of the nations mobilization against terrorism more than people applied to become agents soon thousands of recruits were quietly training in hand to hand combat advanced marksmanship and techniques for discreetly defusing onboard disturbances without ever identifying themselves as marshals the service swelled to a current force somewhere between an estimated and the exact number of marshals is classified their presence combined with new provisions allowing u s pilots to carry guns in the cockpit has changed the equation of onboard security would be terrorists now must enter into their calculations a fair chance that a fellow passenger is a well trained policeman concealing a semiautomatic weapon but building and maintaining the force in recent years has been an uneasy ride marshals have griped that its unhealthy flying four or more flights a day and say the job is a monotonous rut that doesnt lead to advancement another big complaint their cover can be easily blown particularly when they go through special boarding procedures budget issues led to a hiring freeze and in some cases resulted in heavier schedules and fewer flights covered government oversight bodies including the house judiciary committee and homeland securitys inspector general raised concerns as to whether the marshals were able to do their jobs effectively some marshals say many of their colleagues have quit although agency officials say defections have been minimal but dana brown the current director concedes that the programs &# million budget wasnt enough to sustain any new hires between july and fall in an interview mr brown said the agency challenges are largely due to growing pains "its the equivalent of having a mom and pop or good small business that worked very well and overnight it turned into a large fortune type corporation with many more issues than it had previously " he said mr brown is now taking steps to address the marshals complaints the job is a stressful mixture of tedium and high pressure marshals have made arrests since and drawn their weapons only twice once shooting a man dead in the end none of the incidents were found to be related to terrorism last summer their secretive operations came into rare public view after northwest airlines flight lifted off from amsterdams schiphol airport on aug for a nearly nine hour flight to mumbai india less than two weeks earlier british authorities had foiled an alleged trans atlantic airliner bombing plot and officials were on high alert a group of indian passengers on flight attracted the attention of flight attendants and one undercover marshal when they allegedly didnt follow crew member instructions while boarding shortly after the dc left the runway one of the indian men allegedly handed several cellphones to another while a third member of the group appeared to be deliberately obstructing the view of what was happening within minutes as the plane continued to climb three air marshals on board broke cover and took control of the cabin moving into the aisles revealing badges and assuming defensive positions according to an internal federal air marshal service report on the incident and accounts from passengers and crew a pair of dutch f fighter jets scrambled to escort the plane back to amsterdam half an hour after takeoff flight touched back down and the indian men were detained by netherlands law enforcement the incident was a classic demonstration of the marshals daunting and often imprecise task a potentially dangerous situation was defused with no injuries but in the end there had been no security risk at all the cellphones were just cellphones all of the suspects were quickly released some passengers particularly indian nationals believed the marshals overreacted to plainly innocent conduct "we were not passing cellphones " said shakil chhotani a year old mumbai exporter of womens garments who was among the arrested men "just because one of us was wearing kurta pajamas and four or five of us had a beard they thought we were terrorists " mr brown backed up his officers actions "im comfortable that the federal air marshals did exactly what they thought they should do under the circumstances " he said noting that the decision was made in consultation with the crew president kennedy launched the air marshal program in in response to a wave of hijackings of u s flights to cuba in the years prior to its ranks rose and fell amid various threat levels and bureaucratic shuffling today after obtaining top secret security clearance marshals undergo weeks of preparation for the job divided between facilities in artesia n m and atlantic city n j each is issued a sig

full time positions pay salaries starting at about &# and average just under &# a year with a premium for working in certain cities marshals travel in teams of at least two often sitting in first

control room each one representing a plane with a marshal on board officials here relay intelligence to marshals in the field and are poised to redeploy marshals if need be while marshals train for the most dangerous criminal scenarios the job is usually uneventful many spend their hours in the sky reading at the same time they must stay constantly alert marshals say that after flying four or more flights in a single day they experience fatigue headaches and other maladies compounding their frustrations marshals mostly in their s and s have little opportunity to advance in or diversify their careers "federal air marshals cannot sustain a career in an airborne position based on such factors as the frequency of flying their irregular schedules and the monotony of flying repetitive assignments " the government accountability office concluded in november report since the post expansion marshals have protested that their anonymity hasnt been adequately protected agents are required to check in at airport ticket counters and in most cases display oversized credentials until recently a jacket and tie dress code was mandated on all flights even those filled with tourists headed for disney world they also were instructed to stay in designated hotels where they had to display their marshal credentials to secure a discounted rate to bypass security checkpoints where notice would obviously be taken of their guns marshals typically enter concourses through the exit lanes but they often wait for several minutes while a security guard checks their ids a process that sometimes draws attention from passengers in some cases they must enter via alarmed exit doors "the lights and sirens go off everyone turns and looks " one marshal said in an interview at the gate at least one marshal must board the plane or minutes before passengers to check for hidden weapons and meet briefly with the crew marshals report being thanked and given the "thumbs up" from passengers who had obviously figured out who they were "without anonymity an air marshal is reduced to a target that need only be ambushed and eliminated or an obstacle that can be easily avoided " wrote former air marshal william meares in a letter resigning from the service in "there is no question that terrorists using known tactics and methods can easily determine whether or not a particular flight is covered by air marshals " don strange the agent formerly in charge of the atlanta field office says he repeatedly complained about the stuffy dress code internally and to the house judiciary committee "my views were not well received " he said in an interview mr strange was subsequently dismissed in october the federal air marshal service wouldnt comment on mr stranges termination federal law prohibits marshals from unionizing but in mounting discontent prompted them to organize and seek affiliation with the federal law enforcement officers association that gave them a unified voice to deal with management in october frank terreri the groups newly elected president wrote to the agencys then director thomas quinn complaining about issues including boarding procedures dress code transfer policy and scheduling in the spring of the house judiciary committee launched its investigation into the service mr quinn a retired secret service agent who took over the service a few months after told the committee that the problems were exaggerated and that complainers were "disgruntled amateurs" who were bringing the whole organization down in february mr quinn retired from the federal government three months later the judiciary committee issued its findings saying that mr quinn included "factual inaccuracies" in his responses to the committee the committee also concluded that the check in and boarding procedures were "unacceptable to ensuring the anonymity of federal air marshals" and criticized the formal dress code and hotel policy now a private security consultant mr quinn dismissed the report in an interview he called those who voiced complaints "insurgents" and "organizational terrorists " so far few marshals or security experts believe that the tensions inside the agency have affected the performance of the agents flights or their judgment in the most critical question they face when to blow cover and intervene in a situation on board the decision is more art than science one air marshal says that officers get drawn into onboard conflicts so often they seem more like in flight security guards says another "you have to wait until it seems bad before you do anything youre not a bouncer " false alarms are sometimes inevitable marshals must quickly judge if suspicious behavior is criminal or just odd they also have to weigh the need to remain undercover as long as possible against the needs of passengers who might be under distress "we dont want to be drawn out only to find out there was a situation designed specifically for that purpose and now our presence our positions have been compromised " says mr brown but even if a situation is not necessarily life threatening "were not going to let anyone get hurt on that aircraft " in the first of the two incidents when marshals drew their weapons in august an agent held the entire coach section of a delta flight to philadelphia at gunpoint while his partner restrained an unruly passenger once the plane landed the disruptive passenger and a second flier were detained by authorities but later released and not charged the second came in december when rigoberto alpizar a year old paint salesman from maitland fla frantically ran off an american airlines flight about to leave miami with his backpack strapped to his chest "im going to blow up this bomb " he said as he reached into the pack according to two air marshals who were on board when the man later determined to have been mentally ill advanced toward the marshals they shot him nine times killing him state prosecutors later concluded that the shooting was legally justified calls to mr alpizars widow anne buechner werent returned after flight from amsterdam the air marshal services investigative and training divisions reviewed the incident according to standard policy and determined that it had been properly handled according to a federal official familiar with the process "it was textbook that was really the bottom line " the official said mr brown a year veteran of the u s secret service took over after mr quinns retirement he initially saw the complaints from marshals much as his former boss had but soon after taking office he began inviting marshals to small dinners in washington and soon came to a different understanding in july he sent an email to all air marshals "candidly the morale was much worse than i thought " he wrote mr brown has begun taking steps to deal with some of the discord in august he loosened the dress code instructing marshals to "dress at your discretion " a new pilot program allows them to check in for flights at airports using kiosks rather than ticket counters the marshals are also free to choose their own hotels mr brown has set up working groups to address such matters as scheduling and promotions hes also opened up a dialogue with the officers association meeting with its leaders to hear their complaints still he said he hasnt found a way to change the boarding procedures in a december memo he noted that the agency was able to reach its hiring goal for the year but didnt specify how many new marshals were recruited meanwhile some marshals who had been highly critical of management "are more optimistic that things are going to get better " says mr terreri daniel michaels and binny sabharwal contributed to this article protecting the skies the
