weekend journal taste houses of worship the hypocrisy hunters guide the announcement this week that the rev ted haggard has embraced therapy and discovered his true heterosexuality rounds off a year of scandals that have plagued the powerful religious right republican party alliance it began with revelations about disgraced lobbyist jack abramoffs back room dealings with ralph reed former golden boy of the christian coalition gained momentum with mark foleys emails and peaked with mr haggards spectacular gay sex scandal among republicans there has been much hand wringing over the moral decline of the partys leadership and a continuing theme our waning days as a christian nation in turn democrats and hypocrisy hunters have offered gleeful "i told you sos" and redoubled their calls for a return to an era before the rise of the moral majority before religion thrust itself into the political sphere unfortunately both sides are nostalgic for "good old days" that never existed sex politics and religion have been regular if cantankerous bedfellows since when the rev timothy dwight then head of yale college warned voters that if they didnt toss thomas jefferson out of office the president "would make our wives and daughters the victims of legalized prostitution " in fact as the historian john h summers has observed the th century suffered many more scandals than the th when evolving standards of personal privacy political professionalism and objective journalism brought a new decorum to public discourse ironically a resurgence came in the s as the evangelical christian movement began its political ascent suggesting that mixing religious righteousness with politics may cause more imbroglios than it prevents the biggest of the th century scandals during the presidential election of offers a case in point after a decade of government corruption outrages including the whiskey ring and boss tweeds tammany hall the country had what wed now call "scandal fatigue " thus many republicans were infuriated when their partys presidential nomination went to james g blaine the former secretary of state who was dogged by rumors of graft and profiteering the rev henry ward beecher at the time americas most celebrated preacher and the republican partys most influential religious champion was particularly incensed by blaines nomination the minister had campaigned aggressively for every republican presidential candidate since the partys founding in the s he promoted candidates from the pulpit of his seat "mega church" in brooklyn n y and spoke at rallies nationwide urging all good christians to vote republican for beecher blaines nomination was the final straw after years of growing disgust with both the ethical shenanigans in washington and the gops shift from being the party of moral reform to the party of big business this time he declared he was backing the democratic candidate grover cleveland the former governor of new york had won a reputation for rare rectitude earning the nickname "grover the good " just as beecher announced his defection a firestorm erupted newspapers reported that as a young bachelor in buffalo n y cleveland had fathered a child out of wedlock cleveland responded by confessing that he had indeed paid support to the childs mother for the past years most ministers would have abandoned the accused sinner but beecher was not like other men of the cloth only years before he had faced down his own national sex scandal after being accused of seducing a married woman in his congregation when the cuckolded husband sued beecher in civil court the story generated more press coverage than the entire civil war unlike cleveland however beecher denied all and the trial ended in a hung jury allowing the minister to retain the mantle of innocence however muddied when the cleveland illegitimate child story broke beechers friends urged him to back off and save his own reputation instead he threw all his weight behind the democrat who was continually taunted for his peccadillo during the unusually nasty campaign including the famous ditty "ma ma wheres my pa gone to the white house ha ha ha " beecher seemed to take these slings personally indeed to be invigorated by them as the campaign grew uglier his rhetoric grew more reckless "if every man in new york state tonight who has broken the seventh commandment voted for cleveland he would be elected by majority " he shouted at rallies shocking even his most devoted followers and rekindling rumors of his own infidelity beechers instincts about the electorate were right however cleveland won by a tiny margin put over the top by new york the victory came partly because voters believed that cleveland had honorably confessed his mistake and partly because they found the republican candidates alleged financial and ethical transgressions slightly more repellent than the democrats sexual misdeed if history offers a lesson in these matters it is that leaders take a large risk when they embrace the rhetoric of religious righteousness americans are awfully forgiving but they harden their hearts to coverup and hypocrisy cleveland was saved from his sin by candor beechers role reminds us that the task of a great moral teacher is not to condemn others from on high but to show us that we are all sinners and that the only figures worthy of public trust are those who have the courage to grapple honestly with their flaws as beecher so aptly put it "cant is the twin sister of hypocrisy " ms applegates "the most famous man in america the biography of henry ward beecher" doubleday is a finalist for the national book critics circle award
