weekend journal bookmarks the hippie guide to climbing the corporate ladder by skip yowell naked ink pages &# most people would feel theyd been dealt a fair hand by life if they could spend it doing something they enjoyed if that is there were no divide between what they did to earn a living and living even better would be managing this feat with stunning success and without the need for a major personal transformation to be the same person years and millions of dollars later that you were when you first started thinking "hey i could make a few bucks doing this and have some fun too groovy " meet skip yowell the author of "the hippie guide to climbing the corporate ladder &amp other mountains " a man whose entrepreneurial success is undeniable if he does not actually still use the word "groovy " he is nonetheless an unrepentant flower child and son of the s in mr yowells cousin murray had an idea for a better backpack it would be built around a lightweight adjustable aluminum frame cousin murray formed a company the woman he was dating at the time happened to be a virtuoso on the sewing machine murray promised that if she would marry him hed name the company after her "she did and he did " mr yowell writes "and jansport was born " the big cultural effect of what became the companys signature product a little pack now worn by students in every part of the world was not even a dream the jansport team was just "three hippies no business plan even less money all we had was murrays innovative design jans skill my creative instincts and a shared affinity for dylan music and beer " the jansport pack was an improvement over the standard packs of the day and the little entrepreneurial band had timed it right nature was hot outdoor adventure was in people were buying "walden" and occasionally even reading it still success was no sure thing and the story of how jansport went from its first "big order" of packs to one of the most recognizable brands in the world is full of learning experiences the kinds of big breaks and near misses that are common to business epics mr yowell tries gamely to synthesize the principles that have guided him but there is no sunburst of business wisdom here "well succeed because we will work the hardest we value and appreciate each person we believe there is more to life than a days work well make fun a part of everything we do " sounds fine but such words will probably not be chiseled in marble anytime soon lessons aside the narrative is delightful this is one thinks what success feels like it is in part the experience of every start up and every growing company that has had to endure "cash shortages bank credit line hassles fire damage legal minefields theft machine failure bad beer " one message is clear enthusiasm matters we never really learn from reading the book just how much money mr yowell has made or how big his company is answers a lot and very but we do learn about how he took dealers on climbs of mount rainier joined an everest expedition and got involved in goofy promotions like the "bak a yak" fundraiser for a himalayan excursion it was not all smooth climbing in almost lavish detail mr yowell tells the story of a great business blunder after nearly freezing to death while testing a prototype tent he and his partners came up with a new concept and design the dome tent that became the standard across the industry in their enthusiasm they neglected to apply for a patent mr yowell estimates that the oversight has cost him &# million he doesnt seem to mind how groovy is that geoffrey norman
