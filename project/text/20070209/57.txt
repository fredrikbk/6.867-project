lots of vehicles big dealer to detroit fix how you make cars autonation ceo sees inventories rising fast the big wheel problem michael j jackson chief executive of the u s s largest chain of auto dealers wants detroit to change how it makes cars and he may have the clout to succeed at one autonation inc location in delray beach fla scores of "orphan" vehicles have been sitting on the lot for months one hulking silver dodge ram pickup has languished unsold for days an eternity by automotive standards the problem chrysler equipped the truck with a v engine instead of the v requested by most buyers of big trucks parked nearby is a red jeep grand cherokee with four wheel drive a feature popular in snowy climes but not sunny florida one chrysler sebring convertible is so loaded with options that its sticker price is &# nearly as much as a bmw series "no customer would have asked for these vehicles that way and they never should have been built that way " says mr jackson "this has to change " one of the toughest problems facing the ailing u s car industry stems from detroits century old business model which dates to henry fords mass production of millions of largely identical model ts rather than build cars to suit customer tastes u s auto makers churn out what makes sense for their plants and then use incentives and rebates to lure buyers the thirst for revenue to pay for mounting health care and pension costs has further encouraged companies to keep plants running regardless of demand in years past it was dealers who suffered as this excess inventory in the form of unsold cars sat idly on their lots but the rise of powerful national dealership chains exemplified by mr jacksons autonation has changed the equation hes pushed detroit to cut production more than it wants and has cut orders when it hasnt responded last year when daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group pressured dealers to take thousands of unwanted cars autonation and other chains led a revolt that forced the car maker to backtrack at the detroit auto show last month mr jackson had private meetings with the chiefs of general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler a dance card few in the industry could match and offered to help last year autonation began sifting through its trove of data to identify the best selling configurations of every vehicle on the market he wants gm ford and chrysler to join the effort and use the information to produce vehicles customers actually want officials at the big three companies are publicly supportive of mr jacksons efforts "hes absolutely right on " says ford chief executive officer alan mulally "when you have big inventories you get further and further away from that customer decision " mr mulally says excess inventory "hurts everybody " but there are limits to how far detroit is willing to go adopting a system in which market intelligence drives manufacturing would represent a profound and wrenching change for the industry and many industry executives say theyre comfortable with the current inventory levels "its not like we have some crisis " says mark laneve gms head of north american sales and marketing gm has more than one million unsold cars in the pipeline by contrast toyota motor co has the increasing clout of the dealers is one part of a broader restructuring of the u s auto industry as it faces a historic challenge alongside dealer pressure suppliers are less willing to give car makers price concessions often because they are in bankruptcy proceedings or have been bought by hard nosed financiers the combination has left domestic auto makers in a painful financial crunch thats forced them to close plants mortgage assets and rewrite labor pacts u s auto makers say theyve been working for some time to be more responsive to customer tastes "today we are much better in balancing production and demand than we were two years ago " says troy clarke president of gm north america "if the trend continues we will be right where we want to be " until the s auto retailing was dominated by entrepreneurs who relied mainly on selling one detroit brand for their livelihoods though often among the wealthiest citizens in town traditional dealers couldnt match the economic power of gm or ford whose managers could make their lives easy or very hard since then as the pioneers of the s and s retired or died a new breed of dealer has emerged these new auto retailers some of which are publicly traded own multiple stores in multiple cities and sell an array of models they no longer rely on a single manufacturer indeed detroits battered brands are often the weakest links in their diverse portfolios big retailers like wal mart stores inc and target inc long ago learned to use information they accumulate daily to influence manufacturers of food cosmetics or clothes mr jacksons company has showrooms accounts for about of new vehicles sold in the u s and is in the vanguard of auto retailers starting to do the same the chains have good reason to fight back because dealers borrow to buy their inventory rising interest rates after a long swoon have increased the cost of handling slow selling models autonations share price has doubled over the past five years but has made little progress in the past months its price to earnings ratio of is higher than that of u s auto makers and suppliers but trails retailers such as target to which autonation is often compared "mikes got to do this " says h wayne huizenga the businessman who founded autonation and remains a major shareholder "wal mart wouldnt operate this way " another big shareholder with a stake is hedge fund billionaire and current chairman of sears holdings corp edward s lampert the son of a refinery engineer and a homemaker mr jackson years old grew up in moorestown n j miles east of philadelphia at he got a job shoveling manure at a horse stable earning a dollar a stall after getting a political science degree he married bought a used mercedes sl roadster and drove to cape cod for the summer when the car broke down in hyannisport mass mr jackson scrounged a job at a mercedes dealership to pay for repairs his wife landed a spot as a cook and the use of a bungalow at the nearby kennedy compound after the summer mr jackson got a job as a mechanic trainee worked his way into sales and management and eventually saved enough to buy a stake in a bethesda md mercedes dealership in mercedes hired mr jackson to run sales and marketing in the u s by he was president of u s operations and mercedes was losing money and market share in a preview of his prescription for detroit mr jackson dumped inflated sticker pricing stopped discounting and cut the number of dealers by by mercedes was the top luxury brand in the u s market by sales "this is very difficult for people to understand but you can sell more cars if you have less inventory and fewer dealerships " mr jackson says "by keeping the supply tight your product becomes more desirable and you create future demand " in mr jackson was hired to fix autonation a company created four years earlier by mr huizenga the founder of waste management inc and blockbuster video mr jackson shut down its used car megastores sold underperforming dealerships added stores selling luxury cars and imports and streamlined back office operations still selling cars isnt the same as selling television sets or toothpaste for one thing it takes up to three years for a car company to design and build a new vehicle consumer tastes can shift almost overnight as gasoline prices rise or fall or as one automotive fashion fad gives way to another the big three are trying to be more market driven but it isnt easy because they have big and rising costs for union health care and pensions they need to maintain revenue which means they often keep plants open and build more cars than the market demands their operations and those of their suppliers many of whom are also ailing tend to be older and less flexible than those of japans toyota and honda motor co while u s car companies often offer a large number of options theyre not always geared toward particular buyers japanese companies by contrast typically manufacture a small number of variations tailored to specific groups of customers minivans with leather seats for retirees for example and can move quickly to adjust if sales are poor detroit often misses when it tries guessing the market chrysler thought buyers of its redesigned jeep wrangler would want two doors and a canvas roof dealers say the four door model with a hard top is a big seller michael manley chryslers vice president for sales and dealer operations acknowledges the company built many vehicles in that were not equipped the way dealers wanted he says the company has dramatically improved its forecasting system predicting demand for the wrangler he says is "tougher" because the vehicle is "such a runaway hit " mr jackson acknowledges the big three have pressing issues to address including health care costs and union contract talks but he says tightening stocks is a critical step "they are used to selling what their factories can produce not what the customer is asking for " he says at autonations ford store in fort lauderdale a recent drop in gasoline prices spurred sales of the expedition a big sport utility vehicle just a few months ago expedition sales were in free fall amid &# a gallon gasoline the stores general manager mike devan thought of ordering more but couldnt get expeditions with inch wheels "seventy five percent of the people who come in for the expedition want the big wheels " he griped waving a hand at his computer screen in frustration "i cant get them i can only get them with inch wheels its been this way for two weeks " walking through his lot he patted the hood of one of three large wheel expeditions "i have to make a choice " he shrugged "do i stock the vehicle with inch wheels or just not have it in the store " that day he chose the latter option a ford spokesman blames the shortfall on a problem with a supplier and says the large wheel model is now available autonations toyota and honda stores typically carry enough cars to last to days its gm ford and chrysler locations used to have to days of inventory these days as domestic manufacturers have continued to lose market share that number has climbed to between and days frustrated the big three arent moving fast enough mr jackson is taking matters into his own hands about a year ago autonation hired mckinsey &amp co and two other consulting groups with retail expertise to mine consumer data the goal is to identify the few versions of every vehicle that are big sellers among the thousands of possible variations gms mr laneve says his company is seriously considering joining with mr jackson to create a "predictive modeling" system the project got under way just as an inventory crisis was brewing at chrysler in late chrysler had a stockpile of more than "unassigned" vehicles it pushed dealers to stock more vehicles than they needed and many complied but the combination of options and features selected by chryslers production planning staff was off the mark last summer rolfe tessem a tv producer in new york went to lease a new jeep grand cherokee he wanted the most luxurious interior possible but coupled with a relatively small v engine to save on gasoline his dealer said chryslers top of the line interiors came with v engines only even though hed owned four grand cherokees in succession chrysler "couldnt make what i was looking for " mr tessem complains he leased a lexus instead by august the higher cost of stocking extra vehicles was becoming too much for many dealers autonation group automotive inc of houston and lithia motors a medford ore chain all but stopped taking cars from chrysler in september chrysler said it would have a loss of &# billion in the third quarter lithia and autonation saw earnings fall in the same quarter partly because of higher inventory costs mr jackson told his board he would push the big three harder to cut inventory in october he gathered the companys top executives at a resort in aspen colo and passed on the word since then autonations gm ford and chrysler dealerships have been cutting back orders to lower their stocks after last years fiasco chrysler apologized to dealers promised to stop building cars without orders and agreed to cut production "the bottom line is we will never be in the same situation again " says tom lasorda chryslers chief executive mr lasorda says the company made another significant production cut in january but wouldnt specify its size the fort lauderdale ford dealership run by mr devan now has enough cars to last days compared with more than in the fourth quarter hes under orders to get the number down to days he recently pulled up data on expedition sales on his computer although ford offers about a dozen versions two and four wheel drive long and short wheel base mr devan says just three types account for of the sales in all of south florida "those are the ones ill order " he said touching a finger to his display screen "anything else ill pretty much stay away from " joseph b white and gina chon contributed to this article dodges orphan ram a v ram pickup at autonations delray beach fla dealership was one of in chryslers inventory at the end of that unsold inventory is the equivalent of  days of sales a half a years output of a truck plant &# billion in potential revenue
