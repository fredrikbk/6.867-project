playing at professions jobs theme park for children is huge success in japan tokyo on a recent afternoon misaki ando lined up behind a long row of children at an indoor theme park here but the nine year old girl wasnt waiting to play videogames or ride bumper cars she wanted to test her skills at pumping gas at a make believe gas station "i wiped the cars clean and filled them up with gas " misaki said afterward excitedly recounting her experience "i enjoyed this job the most " misaki was spending the day at kidzania a acre theme park dedicated to offering children a fun taste of what working life is like the park is packed with company sponsored pavilions that offer a chance to try a dizzying range of jobs including pilot dentist electrical engineer and package delivery messenger while trying out dentistry for example children pretend to be dentists in training learning about how cavities form then inserting a filling in the tooth of a doll representing a patient a theme park that focuses on some careers may not sound like fun and games but the park which can accommodate children a day has been a huge success since it opened in october advance tickets for weekends are already sold out through the end of april weekdays are packed with students on excursions from all over japan some parents are so eager to get their children into the park that they line up early in the morning to snare the to nonreserved tickets available each day behind the parks popularity is the nagging worry in japan that many young people lack the diligent work ethic of which japan has been so proud more young japanese are dropping out of jobs and some cant even be bothered to look for their first one about single japanese between the ages of and are neither at work nor at school compared with about in according to the government some education specialists say the slacker trend is happening in part because young japanese are so focused on studying that they have little opportunity to interact with society and no idea what they want to do when they grow up few japanese companies organize events like take your daughter to work day internships are still rare and summer jobs tend to be limited to working at restaurants and convenience stores worried japans education ministry launched a campaign in called career start week which encourages students ages to to gain some kind of job experience but few companies have participated in the program with many saying theyre too short staffed or arent properly set up to accommodate the students kidzania which is based in mexico was brought to japan two years ago by einosuke sumitani a retired manager of a japanese restaurant company the year old mr sumitani who was responsible for bringing such american restaurants as spago and il mulino to japan first heard about the career theme park from an american friend and thought it was exactly what japan needed "kidzania has the potential to make up for something thats missing in the current society and education system " says mr sumitani whose company kids city japan k k signed a licensing agreement with the mexican company kidzania de mexico sa in besides the tokyo park and parks in mexico city and monterrey mexico kidzania has signed franchise deals to open parks in jakarta in july and in lisbon and dubai next year deals in south korea and china are also likely there are no immediate plans for a park in the u s corporate sponsors eager to increase brand awareness strive to make the tokyo park look just like a kid size version of the real world after paying the entrance fee which can be as high as &# for a five hour session the children receive a boarding pass and travelers checks at an imitation all nippon airways check in counter they then go to a replica of a sumitomo mitsui bank branch to convert the checks into the parks own currency called kidzos the children who range in age from to can rent real mobile phones at a reproduction of a shop of ntt docomo japans biggest mobile carrier and perform surgery on dolls at a johnson &amp johnson hospital for every job experience which usually takes half an hour children earn extra kidzos that they can spend on food and drinks in the park kidzania doesnt allow any parents inside pavilions they can either watch their children through glass windows or wait in the adults only lounge increasingly public schools around japan are making the park a destination for school trips on a recent day sixth graders from narayama minami elementary school in shizuoka about miles southwest of tokyo visited the park as part of their career education program the students did research beforehand analyzing their personalities to try to figure out which jobs might suit them best teacher minako hatono stressed the importance of preparation "children would otherwise tend to choose the easy jobs or jobs in which they can eat " she explained mr sumitani says he plans to open kidzania at six more locations in japan he also aims to set up smaller scale parks in conjunction with local governments across japan "kidzanias concept is universal " he says "we could develop it anywhere " ricardo
