the daily fix cowboys turn to wade phillips as replacement for bill parcells online edition after days and candidates the dallas cowboys have a replacement for head coach bill parcells its wade phillips son of bum most recently the defensive coordinator for the san diego chargers and whose nfl career includes head coaching stints with the denver broncos in playoffs buffalo bills in playoffs and interim tenures with the new orleans saints and atlanta falcons no playoff record mr phillips is familiar with life as a replacement for higher profile coaches having followed dan reeves in denver and marv levy in buffalo now can he follow mr parcells in the fort worth star telegram gil lebreton is not convinced "for probably far too many cowboys fans it was like staring underneath the christmas tree for almost three weeks only to find out that the present from owner jerry jones was a new tie " he writes "a bolo tie at that meh " mr lebreton sees mr parcells fingerprints on the decision wondering if thats why the cowboys opted against an offense minded coach such as rejected candidate norv turner "its not the choice that all cowboys fans would have made " he writes "it places newfound pressure on in no particular order assistant coaches jason garrett and tony sparano to accelerate the ascent of quarterback tony romo garrett gets a month free pass because a he was troy aikmans backup and b we love him but it leaves sparano as a key figure he has to not only coordinate the offense but also coordinate it well enough that romo shines under whatever degree of polishing garrett is able to give him defense over offense dont forget that the owner made that call " so what happened to mr turner the star telegrams jennifer floyd engel ponders that mystery dont miss her exchange with mr jones as she tries to pin him down "what ultimately doomed norv was owner jones has fallen in love with jason garrett " ms engel writes "typical jerry letting a man crush influence him only this time unlike with c hutch and henson and q he is crushing on a coach a coach who has exactly two years of nfl coaching experience and exactly zero as a coordinator a coach whom he is trusting to develop his most prized asset in romo a coach who in less than eight months is going to be flying without a net as he calls plays for the first time " at espn com gene wojciechowski shakes his head over the ways of valley ranch "this is so jerry jones " he writes "go against the grain just to go against the grain dont let the outsiders tell you how to run your business dammit jones can rationalize all he wants but in the end there isnt anything about the decision that is defining instead its an uninspired choice disguised as prudent it worked for him before jones canned the only head coach the franchise had ever known tom landry then hired former arkansas teammate jimmy johnson and then won two super bowls then he hired another arkansas buddy barry switzer and won another super bowl and then he entered the abyss phillips becomes the fifth cowboys head coach in the last years the sixth in the last jones cant help himself he always wants his hands on the steering wheel phillips bill parcells dave campo chan gailey switzer johnson they all can sit in the front seat but make no mistake jones is the guy driving the cowboysmobile and the guy who keeps getting into these fender benders " forget poor steve bartman forget the goat mike downey of the chicago tribune has an idea about the fell curse hovers over the cubs it involves the composer george m cohan "yankee doodle dandy" the world series then cubs owner charles w murphy and nearly a century of futility and grant deporter who runs harry carays restaurant and has plans for a special dinner next week one thats not so much a meal as it is an exorcism the philadelphia flyers sent mark recchi packing in finding no use for a year old right wing whod played in every game putting up regular season points and six more in the playoffs so hows that decision look now not so good mr recchi now is the right wing for the pittsburgh penguins playing on the first line with phenom sidney crosby hes played in all games and has points "sent to carolina in a trade deadline deal last season recchi scored seven goals and added nine assists as the hurricanes won the stanley cup " sam donnellon writes in the philadelphia daily news "after seasons of near misses and not so near misses his name was etched into the cup for the second time bridging the young man with the older version providing a perfect setting for his trot into the sunset except hes not built that way never has been back when most people couldnt spell the word recchi was a plyometric machine a guy who seemed to work as hard before and after games as he did during them it has allowed him to survive career threatening concussions shoulder injuries and the usual pains that can grind the talent from aging players it is not unique that a year old man is playing effectively in the national hockey league what sets recchi apart though is that his game has undergone no adjustment he is still about speed stops and smarts " gilbert arenas of the washington wizards is more than just a superb basketball player hes also a superstar personality beloved of fans and bloggers alike "while nba marketers have searched high and low for the next jordan mr arenas has become more popular the goofier he gets " david roth writes in our own pages "add his infectious apparently authentic joy of performance to his unique combination of self effacement and shameless self promotion media savvy and guilelessness and mr arenas emerges as the nbas first true st century star " the most formidable high school girls basketball dynasty belongs to nazareth texas the swiftettes boast state championships more than any other public school in the nation rival schools complain about families moving to get their kids in the district and their tradition of excellence has been passed down through generations but as wright thompson writes on espn com the team might be the only thing keeping nazareth on the map "last year the school ran a deficit budget " he writes "with virtually no tax base to build any reserves that simply cannot happen run in the red several years in a row and theyll have to close this building tradition be damned when schools consolidate towns often shrivel up and die it terrifies me superintendent keith langfitt says school finance flat out terrifies me how many bad years could we have id say two right now we dont have the fund balance to live off of if it werent for the swiftettes and the culture of greatness they helped spawn the school might have gone long ago there are no local industries some districts have oil others have wind farms or natural gas some have all three nazareth has people with pride that keeps them going but thats it " and it might not be enough as mr thompson writes "three years ago the town stopped running the well beneath the water tower every day during the summer settling for every third day for a decade people havent been able to irrigate east of town scientists are working on dry land corn man that would save a lot of folks supposedly its eight years away thats heartbreaking math eight years before the corn is ready five years of water " keep reading for a
