weekend journal tastings no dont decant our ten pointers for restaurants with wine service we visited one of our favorite restaurants the other day an elegant place with an extensive well priced wine list we ordered a burgundy for &# a bargain as these things go we figured it would be a fairly light wine but perfect with dinner the sommelier came by to show us the bottle which was lovely then a few minutes later to our surprise he returned with a carafe full of our wine he had decanted it he poured a taste for us the wine was beautiful but we couldnt help wonder if it might have lost some of its fruit before we got to taste it the more we thought about our experience the more we realized that there are many little things that restaurants at all levels could do in the coming year to improve their wine service to be sure wine service in restaurants has come a long way in our lifetimes with many restaurants offering outstanding selections and knowledgeable servers more of them are making wine a fun and integral part of the dining experience with cleverly designed wine lists and interesting wine tasting menus to pair with the food still we figured the time was right for suggestions of how restaurants could make life even better for wine drinkers of course the top item on any wish list like this would be "lower your markups " but we also want world peace lets stick here to some small easy to attain goals for the year and lets start with the one based on our own recent experience  ask us if we want our wine decanted before you do it our guess is that restaurants often decant wine because many diners want the whole show and those decanters are often beautiful to look at if a sommelier simply said "i think your wine would benefit from decanting shall i " were sure most people would say yes but we prefer to taste a wine before its decanted to see if we think it really needs it in the case of our burgundy we would have known that our hunch about it was right it was light and ephemeral and that would have led us to keep it in the bottle because it could lose an important chunk of its fruit if decanted if you taste first and then decant youve lost nothing if you decant first and then taste and suspect that the wine may have lost something to the air you cant go back as it happened we enjoyed our burgundy to the last drop but we still wondered what if of course sometimes very old wines are throwing a lot of sediment and simply need to be decanted for that reason but thats another matter  dont overchill many white wines continue to be served so cold they hurt our teeth and of course too many reds are served at room temperature which is too warm this should be easy to fix  offer more half bottles more good wines now are available in half bottles and they are fun to have at restaurants but many restaurants have a small tired selection of them these days theres no reason not to do better offering well priced interesting halves encourages experimentation and adds to the enjoyment of the meal it also solves the problem of tables at which some diners prefer whites and some reds  keep open bottles well if youre going to offer several wines by the glass invest in a system to keep the wines in good shape overnight or offer a day old glass gratis to good customers or just pour them out this should be a common practice especially at any place that calls itself a "wine bar " paying wine by the glass prices for a glass of wine from a bottle that has been opened and uncared for for who knows how long is infuriating  show me the bottle we understand this isnt always possible but when we order a wine by the glass how about bringing over the bottle and then pouring the wine into the glass we like to see what were getting and this also allows us to make sure that were not getting the bottom of the bottle which could be a problem if you havent kept it well since opening it  offer "wine doggie bags" and know the laws most states now allow diners to take home unfinished bottles of wine restaurateurs need to make sure patrons know they can do this and they need to know the relevant laws in their state for instance many states require a sealed tamper evident bag wine doggie bags are a good thing for many reasons restaurants need to promote this trend  stop abusing the wine while fancy restaurants these days generally seem to keep their wine well were really talking here to all of those thousands of friendly marvelous neighborhood places where wine is unfortunately too much of an afterthought its amazing how often we see their wine displayed standing up high on the walls of the dining room or even in the kitchen its always astonishing to us when we order a bottle of wine and see the waiter grab it right off a shelf near the ceiling of the dining room where it has been slowly cooking for weeks or months this is crazy if you want to display wine bottles put out some empty bottles or wines you never plan to open but keep the real wine someplace cool wine refrigerators now are more and more affordable invest in one  offer more interesting stuff yes fine restaurants are providing fascinating wine lists from across the globe but too many everyday restaurants the kind of places where most of us are more likely to eat on a regular basis still offer the same old same old americans are increasingly comfortable experimenting with unusual wines from around the world and youd better keep up with us we were at a little indian place recently that offered a wine from lebanon and at a good price just last week at another indian restaurant we had a tasty sauvignon blanc from india theres no reason these days why all restaurants cant have something interesting  dont overpour wow heres a really easy one if you want to leave the bottle on the table and let us pour the wine ourselves wed be delighted but if you are going to pour for us remember that there should just be a small amount of wine in a glass to allow the wine to breathe and the drinker to swirl and sniff too many places fill it up like a glass of water which makes us think theyre trying to empty the bottle so they can sell us another on the other hand dont clear away wine glasses with wine in them unless youve asked if were finished we tend to linger over wine and if its a good one we enjoy smelling the glass with the very last sip in the bottom its always amazing to us that waiters look at a plate thats completely empty and say "may i take it away " but dont hesitate to clear away the wine glasses with a few precious sips and plenty of great smells still in them  get better glasses many fancy restaurants now have excellent wine glasses but fine glasses are so affordable even costco has some good ones at low prices that theres no reason why that casual neighborhood joint down the street cant pour wine into good glasses trust us on this diners will appreciate the nicer glasses because they will enhance the whole dining experience by better displaying the wines characteristics diners will be happier with their wine choices and when people walk in and see wine in those pretty glasses theyll be more likely to order wine themselves everyone wins that way you can contact us at wine wsj com be sure to look for our wine notes column every saturday in the pursuits section of the journals weekend edition
