cope as delinquencies rise lenders quickly sell most subprime mortgage loans to packagers of securities such as investments banks or directly to investors the riskiest of those securities those that absorb some of the first losses from defaults are typically sold to money managers and hedge funds in the u s and abroad "the thing none of us know including the federal reserve is who is holding this stuff " richard kovacevich chief executive of wells fargo &amp co one of the nations biggest mortgage lenders said in a recent interview "the assumption is that it is well diversified if its concentrated its going to be a disaster " for now most people in the &# trillion u s mortgage market argue that the current slump in housing and surge in loan defaults wont lead to a disaster "the mortgage market is vast and the vast majority of the mortgage market is fine " says lewis ranieri a pioneer in mortgage backed securities in the s when he was a star trader at investment bank salomon brothers but some investors are getting singed and jitters are growing about how widespread the damage will be and where it will show up next the number and variety of investors in u s mortgage securities has mushroomed in recent years even as lenders made riskier loans to help stretched consumers afford pricier homes "theres been a sea change in the market " says mr ranieri by packaging loans into securities lenders can spread their risk and issue more loans than they might otherwise but they arent fully insulated investors have been forcing lenders to buy back many dud loans creating a sudden financial burden that has led to the closure of several smaller subprime lenders in the past two months a report issued by credit suisse on wednesday found that nearly one in four

sponsored companies fannie mae and freddie mac dominated the market for mortgage loans purchased from the original lenders fannie and freddie package loans into securities and guarantee that holders of those securities will receive principal and interest payments but as fannie and freddie found themselves hobbled by accounting scandals other investors flooded into the market snapping up loans that the two companies otherwise might have bought as a result the two companies share of the market has plunged to about at the end of last year from in according to inside mortgage finance a trade publication when fannie and freddie dominated the market mr ranieri says they generally set the standards for what types of loans would be made now those standards are largely set by the risk appetites of thousands of hedge funds pension funds and other money managers around the world emboldened by good returns on mortgage investments they have encouraged lenders to experiment with a profusion of loans many subprime borrowers arent required to prove their financial health with tax forms or other documents lenders also sometimes rely on computer programs rather than human appraisers to estimate the value of homes "we dont know how much the guy makes or what the house is worth " says mr ranieri the housing boom of recent years held defaults to very low levels because borrowers who fell behind on payments could easily sell their homes or refinance into a loan with easier terms but as house prices have flattened or dipped in many parts of the country far more borrowers are falling behind in november payments were at least days overdue on of subprime loans packaged into mortgage securities up from a year earlier according to first american loanperformance a research firm in san francisco another innovation of recent years the collateralized debt obligation or cdo has made it possible for far more investors to make bets on u s mortgages they are akin to mutual funds by investing in a single cdo investors can gain exposure to hundreds of different mortgage securities of varying quality cdos buy the bulk of the lower rated rungs of subprime mortgage securities those that take some of the first hits if defaults are higher than expected says kedran garrison a cdo analyst at j p morgan chase &amp co cdos are especially attractive to investors in europe and asia as well as many in the u s but there is no way to identify the biggest holders of cdo notes and shares or to know how well they understand the risks and have hedged themselves that could be a problem for regulators in the fed convened investment banks and worked out a rescue plan for hedge fund long term capital management lp which was on the verge of collapse but in todays splintered mortgage securities market the fed wouldnt be able to "get the involved players into a room" to work out a plan to help a distressed institution sell off assets in an orderly manner says josh rosner managing director of graham fisher &amp co a new york investment research firm a spokeswoman for the fed declined to comment cdos arent the only ones on the hook hedge funds mortgage real estate investment trusts and the trading desks of wall street firms are among those that could be hurt if their bets on the mortgage market dont turn out as planned
