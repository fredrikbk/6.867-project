weekend journal review television affairs of state there was much public sympathy for edward who became king in january when he renounced the throne to marry the twice divorced american wallis simpson in december of that year that wave of sympathy and adulation for a man who had so famously sacrificed all the world for love wasnt destined to endure those who had once been his protectors and sympathizers chief among them winston churchill soon began to detest the former king edward viii now the duke of windsor as a vain pest who was concerned in a time of immense danger and hardship for the british mainly with himself and the attentions to which he considered himself entitled worse in british government circles the duke and duchess came to be viewed as security risks following edwards abdication when it became clear he would not be allowed to marry wallis the couple wandered the continent as celebrities their lifelong occupation the duke and duchess had long hobnobbed socially with emissaries from the reich and had attracted considerable attention as honored guests of hitler in the late s when war with germany came they began to pose a greater problem than ever for the british wartime papers declassified in the s show just how great a worry they now were the duke for one thing was given to making speeches predicting german victory churchill and colleagues made it their business to deposit the windsors where they could do the least harm thus did the duke become governor general of the bahamas a role in which the monumentally self centered windsor proceeded to enrage the wartime british government with his nagging demands requests for huge sums for refurbishing his quarters churchill biographer roy jenkins records churchills icy note instructing the duke "i regret there can be no question of releasing men from the army to act as servants to your royal highness " an even icier churchill communique warned the duke in polite language to keep his lips zipped about his views of the war the germans and hitlerism churchill never forgave the duke either his abdication or his attitudes no hint of this history is allowed to intrude on "wallis &amp edward " in which edward steven campbell moore is portrayed as a heroic figure committed to social progress and the good of his people a dashing sort as opposed to his brother bertie bill champion a stutterer as the real one indeed was bertie is also portrayed here as a slobbering wreck this brother would of course become george vi the king who along with his wife elizabeth would serve as a dauntless symbol of resolve throughout the war while the dashing duke sat in the bahamas counting his grievances mr moore injects intentionally or otherwise a faintly dark note in his portrayal of edward a tone that suggests a character not nearly as enticing as his good looks status and social charm should be there is in fact something repellent in the princes hard breathing pursuit of mrs simpson something this cant be intentional decidedly unsexy in the couples ardent meetings which alas for valentines day induce distinct feelings of clamminess in a viewer thats even without the dukes weeping fits and hysteria when wallis tries to leave him in her wonderfully deft wallis simpson a more interesting character than the real mrs simpson ever seemed joely richardson manages a fine reticence a sort that leaves hanging in the air alas again for valentines day just what if anything she felt for her importuning lover it is ms richardson looking a good bit like the real mrs simpson those shoulders help who in the end breathes life into this couple and for that matter this production it doesnt take long to be drawn into the drama that was richard nixons political life however familiar most of it is by now a single line of the right kind is enough and there are no lack of these in "nixon a presidency revealed " thursday p m est on the history channel its enough to hear egil krogh the former nixon white house deputy remembering the moment in april a period of violently escalating antiwar protests when he got the message "flashlight is on the white house lawn " flashlight was the code name for the president what was the president doing on the white house lawn at four in the morning he was making his way to the lincoln memorial pursued by his guards and unnerved aides to try to talk to the protesters one after another members of nixons inner circle henry kissinger al haig charles colson to name a few show up on camera to bear witness to the condition of the president in his darkest hours so does a parade of nixon historians we have heard almost all of it before yet it feels nonetheless new the reopening of memories inexhaustible in their power and mystery and even if no witnesses were here there are the presidents tapes the smallest selection of which can bring the feeling of the times back in full flood but the filmmakers make clear the nixon presidency led to major foreign policy achievements not least among them nixons visit to china the beginning of detente with the soviets in his domestic policies nixon leaned to the progressive he wanted to understand the causes of crime bob dole delivers perhaps the best last word on nixon in this admirably thorough documentary when he observes with characteristic dourness that richard nixon "could never be the nominee of the republican party today the conservatives wouldnt have him " he was mr dole explains too liberal
