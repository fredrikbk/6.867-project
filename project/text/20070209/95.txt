the afternoon report tehran tangles online edition iran is preparing to mark a national anniversary with a celebration of its nuclear advancements and yet the west may hold off voicing its chagrin as it waits to see how political infighting in tehran plays out complaints over irans role in iraq are growing louder however the bush administration turned up its rhetorical heat on iran another click this morning after defense secretary robert gates who is in spain for a meeting of nato defense ministers said that serial numbers and other markings found on explosives used in iraq suggest that its neighbor is providing weapons and other technology to sectarian militants the administration has made the claim before that iranian agents are providing the materials iraqs splintered militias need to make improvised explosive devices or the so called roadside bombs that have claimed so many lives and limbs from u s and iraq military forces mr gates said that iran is "very much involved in providing either the technology or the weapons themselves for these explosively formed projectiles " but also said that iran provided workings for only a small percentage of such attacks meanwhile mr gates said while many had long suspected iranian hands were at work in iraq he was rather surprised that u s raids had snared real live iranian agents those remarks by the defense secretary a onetime member of the baker hamilton iraq study group which endorsed diplomatic engagement with iran and syria as an avenue to quell the sectarian bloodletting in iraq were just the latest in a series of public comments from the administration suggesting a hawkish stance toward tehran president bush has maintained that he has no intention of invading iran but he has said u s forces will "respond firmly" if iran or its agents escalate their activity in iraq and endanger u s forces underlining that a second u s navy carrier group has deployed to the persian gulf but mr gates swatted at suggestions that the u s was taking a sharper line against the islamic republic he said that he in fact perceived an effort to "tone down" tough talk on iran and said that he didnt know "how many times the president secretary of state condoleezza rice and i have had to repeat that we have no intention of attacking iran " tensions between washington and tehran have been on a roiling boil for some time as the two sides square off over irans nuclear ambitions this weekend as the country celebrates the th anniversary of its islamic revolution iran is expected to show the world it has expanded its main nuclear power plant the last time iran announced a big nuclear advance it put on a show with doves and dancers twirling around holding tubes of nuclear glop theres no been no word on what kind of celebration awaits this time if washington and allies are upset about irans newest atomic achievements they might decide against showing it there have been signals that president mahmoud ahmadinejad who rattled the west with his denial of the holocaust and threats to eradicate israel seems to be losing favor with iranians and perhaps more importantly with its clerical elite western leaders may hope that eventually leads to detente on irans pursuit of the worlds most dangerous weapons but the increasing war of words over iraq may prove to be the fly in the ointment blue chips
