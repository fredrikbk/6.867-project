the evening wrap king lear online edition many investors would rather suffer through a gory drivers ed film than buy into an auto parts company but lears acceptance of a takeover bid today indicates one billionaire isnt spooked by a wreck of a sector the supplier of seats and other auto parts agreed to accept a &# a share buyout offer from carl icahns american real estate partners in a deal that values the company at &# billion or &# billion including the assumption of debt but a handful of powerful shareholders are certain to lobby lear to make full use of a day window during which the company is free to consider the attentions of other suitors pzena investment management lears third biggest shareholder shouted its alarm over mr icahns offer when it first landed this week and fired off a letter to the companys independent directors pleading with them to stomp on the brakes arguing that lear is worth something on the order of &# a share deutsche bank analysts wrote in a note that it was "surprising that the company is agreeing to sell itself at a discount to its current price" and described the offer relative to lears earnings targets as "very low " lear had just gunned its engines to a week high of &# earlier this week mostly on the hopes someone would come along and leave skidmarks all over the icahn bid while that could still happen wall street wasnt betting on it today as lear shares dropped mr icahn has of course built an empire out of making shrewd bets on sagging businesses and few are as distressed as the auto parts business he already had a slice of lear and has previously made investments in dana and federal mogul both of which are now up on the blocks at federal bankruptcy court for the casual observer its difficult to see the attraction buying big chunks of auto parts companies seems as solid a wager as shopping for a new family ride down at rudy russos lot auto parts companies face all the same problems that their biggest customers in detroit do high materials costs heated global competition and all the margin compression and labor unrest that comes with their crushing pension and health care burdens but where other investors may see nothing but an onrushing disaster mr icahn sees opportunity earlier this week he explained for the wall street journal the joy he feels in making such a gamble "whats exciting is when you buy them when no one wants them " mr icahn said the thing is lear hasnt been a leper around wall street its shares plunged to around &# early last year but have since recovered plenty of ground trouble in parts land may make some wonder whether lear bulls have been exposed to exhaust fumes but the company hasnt fared as badly as some peers it booked a wider loss for the fourth quarter due to a bundle of charges but operating earnings came in better than forecast and its struggling interior systems unit is being offloaded into a joint venture with investor wilbur ross and thats what angers the dissidents who think mr icahn is lowballing lear pzena investment the money managers who dashed off the letter on the icahn bid thinks earnings are likely to grow to more than &# per share in coming years auto industry fortunes may well improve if detroits restructuring efforts pay off today deutsche bank upgraded general motors and ford motor saying the worst health cost storms may have lifted for the auto giants gms accounting remains in a fog it said today it still doesnt know when it will produce its delayed fourth quarter earnings report but the improvement could take some time and if
