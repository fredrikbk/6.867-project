spits out polish in as beijing primps for the olympics beijing china wants to lower great expectorations before the olympics on the streets of the countrys capital spitting often complete with loud throat clearing gurgling and an arc of phlegm is a frequent occurrence the deeply ingrained habit is found among young and old and crosses class lines now chinese officials are mounting a renewed campaign to abolish this custom and other less than appealing practices including cutting in line and littering all to get the city camera ready for the games this week beijing city authorities announced they will step up efforts to fine spitters as much as yuan or &# when they are caught doing the act in public a hefty sum by beijing standards and equivalent to a days wages for many laborers laws against spitting have existed for years but havent been strictly enforced at the same time municipal authorities also announced queuing day on the th of each month city residents will be encouraged to stand in line at subway stops post offices and various other public places the th was chosen because the two ""s look like they are standing neatly in line until relatively recently chinas history of scarce resources discouraged people from waiting their turn in line crowds fighting to get onto buses and subways are a common sight as are drivers abruptly cutting into different lanes many chinese people are afraid of fighting back against line jumpers "you never know when that person might be some important official " says beijing resident jason chang a something teacher and beijing resident "fighting for your rights its still new in china " for decades public etiquette campaigns have periodically surfaced sometimes spurred by concerns about health dangers of practices such as spitting however this latest push reflects beijings high hopes for the olympics games next year widely seen as chinas coming out party and its fear that rude habits could mar its chance to prove it is a world class city these initiatives are "an urgent demand to build a more civilized city and to improve peoples behavior " says zhang huiguang director of the capital ethic development committee an etiquette group in the beijing government that is focused on readying the city for the olympics ms zhang who has been dubbed beijings "miss manners" by local media came to the group in from her previous post as vice director of the chinese governments "anti obscenity and anti illegal acts department " to raise olympic spirits the etiquette committee has created a slogan "i participate im devoted and i will be happy " activities will include poetry competitions and the selection of goodwill ambassadors who will be lauded as "top stars with high social morality " the anti spitting initiative targets a long held habit in beijing the citys dry desert air and high levels of pollution can cause a rapid buildup of stringy phlegm which is almost as swiftly deposited on sidewalks drains and just about anywhere thats partly because traditional chinese medical philosophy centered on ideas of balancing "hot" and "cool" elements in the body encourages expectoration as a healthy habit as it theoretically removes a "hot" element from the body even the etiquette police dont go as far as recommending people swallow not spit instead they recommend discreet deposits on tissues or scraps of paper rather than on the ground or someones shoe under ms zhangs direction beijing officials have come up with their own way to empirically measure its civilization building progress two years ago the group sponsored an initiative by chinas renmin university to develop a "civilization index " a measure that aims to measure beijing residents civility through a set of questionnaires while there appears to be progress its gradual according to the index of beijing folk sampled describe themselves as more civic conscious last year higher than the year before while the self reported rates of littering and spitting decreased of course spitting and other off putting habits arent exclusive to beijing last month for example shanghais municipal government outfitted the citys taxi cabs with what they called "spit sacks" to encourage drivers not to discharge on the streets earlier this month the china national tourism administration launched a campaign encouraging the nations outbound tourists to behave appropriately and to avoid "talking loudly in public places " said li renzhi a senior official with the tourism body during the sars epidemic chinese authorities stepped up efforts to discourage spitting using publicity campaigns and posters with some success fears of infection helped curb the practice in southern china and hong kong where the epidemic was most widespread however the effect was relatively short lived in northern china this inspired beijing resident wang tao years old to become an anti spitting activist last year mr wang an administrator set up the web site jintan org loosely translated as "forbidden spit " to spread his message "i thought that during sars everyone knew not to spit and not to litter but after sars people seemed to forget their good behavior you can see spit on the ground everywhere especially at the bus stations and pedestrian overpasses " says mr wang a thin man whose broad forehead gives him the air of a scholar the forbidden spit web site has drawn over volunteers mr wang says the group has made outings to wipe spit off the ground and pick up garbage when mr wang spots someone in the act of spitting he gives them a piece of paper and tries to persuade the person to wipe it up not surprisingly he doesnt always win friends last summer for example a commuter shook his fist at mr wang yelling "mind your own business " "then i had to give up " said mr wang sighing "i feel awful " sue feng and kersten zhang contributed to this article
