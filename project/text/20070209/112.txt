weekend journal review books market full of posies flower confidential by amy stewart algonquin books pages &# the arrival of valentines day might coax a smile to your face or a desperate hope in your heart that you will not forget your beloved on this most important day of the year but for amy stewart valentines day is the occasion for something approaching ecstasy and the feeling has nothing to do with love in the romeo and juliet sense amy stewart loves flowers to her ecuadorian roses are as dazzling as a tiffany diamond even a crumpled violet can brighten her day "ive always had a generalized smutty sort of lust for flowers " she blurts out such horticultural passion usually gets channeled into verse or still life painting thats the prudent choice poets and artists can adore the bright blossoms before them without worrying how they arrived on the table ms stewart however is a danger seeker in "flower confidential" she tests her love by grabbing her reporters notebook and her passport and traveling to latin american farms and dutch markets to explore the commercial flower business the result is a quirky but entertaining book each chapter becomes a test of wills can our happy narrator keep her faith as she learns the ugly truths of an industry with &# billion a year in global sales or will disillusionment set in causing ms stewart to curse the profiteers tricksters and pesticide sprayers that she meets along the way the book starts with tales of flower breeding and its zany champions people have been fiddling with nature since at least the s trying to create new strains of plants that showcase certain features opposition started early with an th century scientist declaring that "sex in flowers was not only scientifically unconvincing but morally revolting as well " no matter progress has been unstoppable in for example lily breeders hit upon a way to make their plants stronger and sturdier by dousing seeds with an alkaloid that turned chromosomes into even steroid crazy baseball players dont have it so good ms stewart introduces us to leslie woodriff a disheveled genius whose breeding schemes led to the graceful star gazer lily in the s he was known for bad teeth precarious finances and a penchant for writing long letters to jimmy carter about flower breeding right in the midst of the iran hostage crisis yet his constant experiments with lily hybrids produced beautiful results unfortunately mr woodriff kept having trouble paying the bills so he allied himself with a major california grower ted kirsch who took over production of the star gazer as the lily became a huge hit the two men had a nasty falling out the book skillfully shows how both men battled in court each wanting full credit for an achievement made possible only by their short lived cooperation romantic to a fault ms stewart finds lots to cherish in her visits to the modern day flower farms of northern california and holland the flowers are gorgeous and the owners good natured the experience of polish laborers picking flowers on their knees in holland doesnt concern her much they look "mildly bored the way you might look if you were working at a coffee shop " she writes "but that wasnt enough to incite stirrings of moral outrage in me " when she gets to ecuador though indignation blazes forth this time we dont hear uplifting stories of how growers built their businesses out of nothing the loudest voices come from social activists speaking on behalf of faceless workers who complain about environmental hazards uneven economic development and sexual harassment in the fields yet ms stewart acknowledges at least briefly that there are two sides to this argument as one ecuadorian grower tells her its easy to imagine that rural life was gentler before flower farming "but ive never had to scrape by with a bare patch of land a few chickens and only marginal access to electricity " she says "would i like to try it some time no i had to admit i wouldnt " besides in our modern global economy she notes u s consumers want beautiful flowers at bargain prices that means offshore production and cheaper labor costs for most flowers in more than of the two most popular flowers roses and carnations were grown abroad and then flown into miami or other hub cities for distribution throughout the u s ms stewarts best reporting comes in a visit to the miami airport where as many as million stems a day arrive in the runup to valentines day inspectors hunt for any trace of bugs and yet dont test for illegal pesticide residues what is the growers quite rational response douse flowers with pesticides as one grower warns her never bathe in rose petals shaken by what she sees ms stewart regains her optimism in the final few chapters hanging out with her favorite florists a funky neighborhood shop in santa cruz calif wins her approval so too does the flower department of costco where prices are low and quality standards are high only supermarkets come in for steady contempt they keep flowers too close to the produce department fruits and vegetables artificially ripened by ethylene end up spewing that gas into the air where it speeds flowers demise for anyone who has wondered why a grocery bouquet dies so quickly ms stewart has the answer ms stewart never explains her books title but presumably it pays homage to the best selling "kitchen confidential" by the chef and restaurateur anthony bourdain its a clever but slightly misleading cue mr bourdain wrote the wicked memoir of an insider with lots of scores to settle ms stewart by contrast is the good natured outsider occasionally dishing dirt but usually celebrating the beautiful things that grow in it mr anders is a california based journal reporter
