weekend journal review theater we are all hypocrites now new york broadway is for big budget musicals celebrity revivals and the annual snob friendly british import if you want to see new american plays you pretty much have to go off broadway nowadays even an author of such demonstrable commercial appeal as alan ball the creator of "six feet under" and the author of the screenplay for "american beauty " opened "all that i will ever be " his first stage play in a dozen years not on broadway but way downtown at the new york theatre workshop not that it deserves an uptown run though i wont be surprised if it gets one like all of mr balls work "all that i will ever be" is glib pretentious and very well made a sure fire recipe for success mr ball describes his play as "a twisted little look at cultural imperialism as refracted through a relationship between a trust fund stoner and a male prostitute " one of the problems with "all that i will ever be" is that he seems to think thats a fresh idea putting aside for a moment his tic like use of the cant phrase "cultural imperialism " this is the second play ive reviewed in the past three months about a bisexual but more gay than straight hustler who falls for a rich client indeed "all that i will ever be" even contains one of the same jokes used by douglas carter beane in "the little dog laughed" "people dont pay your kind for sex they pay you to leave " it also bears a definite family resemblance to john guares "six degrees of separation " another better play about a good looking young mystery man of color who seeks in vain to reinvent himself politics the usual omar the hustler peter macdissi is an armenian passing himself off as an arab which makes his client austin lysy soooo hot thus proving that us poor dumb americans are imperialist hypocrites or sexual hypocrites or some sort of hypocrites as for mr balls putatively satirical jabs at the media driven culture that has made him rich we hear such stuff every week or so on the new york stage most recently in theresa rebecks "the scene " another i hate pop culture jeremiad by an amply compensated hollywood refugee jo bonneys staging as ever is crisp and brisk and pointed and her excellent cast aided and abetted by neil patels modish quick change set gets more out of mr balls script than he put there to be sure i happily acknowledge that he is a super slick craftsman who knows how to set a plot in motion and keep it spinning for yawnless minutes lubricated by a steady stream of one and two liners he "i think youre kind " other he "im highly medicated " i also freely admit that "all that i will ever be " like "american beauty " contains flashes of real emotional depth what irks me about mr ball is that these flashes never add up to more than that i keep wanting him to be more serious than he lets himself be if you liked "six feet under " go if you didnt dont ive never much cared for yasmina rezas brand of what i think of as boulevard surrealism and "a spanish play " her latest effort strikes me as an especially wan specimen of that clever clever genre its a pretentious play about a pretentious play meaning that the real life actors play made up actors who are acting in a play within a play whose progress they periodically interrupt to give imaginary interviews about the art of acting or something like that i was so bored that i lost track especially when it turned out that one of the characters in the play within the play linda emond is an actor who is rehearsing a play within the play within the play did i mention that "a spanish play" is two hours long with no intermission i checked my watch five times wondering at one point whether i might possibly have died over dinner and awakened in hell what finally persuaded me otherwise was that the cast of "a spanish play" is extraordinarily fine the great zoe caldwell who hasnt set foot on a manhattan stage for more than a decade was the unquestioned star of the show but i didnt see any flies on ms emond katherine borowitz denis ohare or larry pine either john turturro the director has staged ms rezas imaginary interviews as actual on camera interviews projected on the back wall of the theater a once modish device that adds to the productions musty air of half remembered trendiness david ives translated ms rezas script from the original french and his immaculately speakable prose has nothing in common with the stilted translatorese with which christopher hamptons english language version of "life x " her previous new york outing was encrusted would that mr turturros cast had been acting in one of mr ivess own witty plays instead mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com all that i will ever be new york theatre workshop e th st &# closes march a spanish play classic stage company e th st &# &# closes march
