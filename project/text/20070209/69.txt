pixar pay package to lasseter included well timed options pact jobs helped arrange had grant date months before deal was signed steve jobs helped negotiate an employment contract with a top film director that included a large stock options grant with an especially well timed date according to a person familiar with the matter the options grant part of a employment contract reached between pixar inc and noted animated film director john lasseter carried the lowest share price of the previous year on a date more than three months before the employment contract was actually signed mr jobs then pixars chairman and chief executive signed the agreement on behalf of pixar it remains unclear what role if any mr jobs played in selecting the prior grant date of the agreements stock options the grant is one of several the emeryville calif movie company awarded at yearly lows a pattern that has raised questions about whether the pixar grants were improperly backdated pixar was bought last year by walt disney co which is conducting an internal investigation into pixars options granting practices federal prosecutors in san francisco also are looking into pixar options and are awaiting the conclusion of the disney probe according to people familiar with the matter mr jobs sits on disneys board and is its largest individual shareholder mr lasseter is disneys chief creative officer of its animation studios disney declined to comment beyond its previous statements disney referred all questions for mr jobs to apple inc where a spokeswoman said he wasnt available in november disney chief executive bob iger said that "we arent aware of any basis under which stock options that were issued by pixar would have a material impact on our financial statements " the company declined to make mr lasseter available for comment mr lasseter appeared yesterday at a disney analysts meeting in orlando fla where he unveiled plans for a third "toy story" movie the prosecutors and the securities and exchange commission already are examining mr jobss role in stock options backdating at apple where he is chief executive an internal probe by apple recently cleared him of any wrongdoing but said mr jobs "was aware or recommended the selection of some favorable grant dates " pixar and apple are two of nearly companies under federal investigation for possible stock options manipulation options let recipients buy company shares some time in the future usually at the price on the day they are granted meaning recipients profit when shares rise above their grant date price backdating involves pretending that the grant was made earlier than it actually was at a lower price thus enhancing potential profit sec filings show that on march mr jobs signed a new year employment agreement with mr lasseter a two time oscar winner whose directing credits include "toy story" and "a bugs life " the contract superseded a seven year contract that pixar had signed with the director in by late after two "toy story" hit movies mr lasseter had become the animation worlds biggest superstar and was seen as pixars most valuable asset mr jobs was therefore anxious to lock him into a long term contract according to a person familiar with the matter he may have been concerned that a competitor might try to poach mr lasseter indeed disney appeared interested in the animator then ceo michael eisner had wooed mr lasseter and another person familiar with the matter says that within disney there was discussion of whether he could be hired the new pixar contract included a &# million signing bonus a &# million annual salary and one million stock options but the options werent priced on the date of the contract "in connection with the employment agreement mr lasseter was previously granted an option to purchase shares of our common stock at the fair market value on the date of such grant " according to pixar documents filed with the sec the options were dated dec carrying a strike price of the stocks close the day before that price marked the yearly low and was at the bottom of a months long slide by the close of trading on march the day before the contract was signed pixars shares had climbed increasing mr lasseters potential profit by &# million between and last year mr lasseter exercised and sold about of the options adjusted for a two for one split at various prices before converting the remaining shares to disney shares when the acquisition took place sec records show mr lasseters dec grant featured several peculiarities that raise questions about when he actually received them according to a review of sec filings under sec rules at the time mr lasseter was required to report the options grant to the sec no later than days after the end of pixars fiscal year which meant a deadline of mid february but the grant wasnt reported until may days past the deadline for disclosing the options to the sec and days after the new contract was signed moreover on april pixar told the sec that mr lasseters filing "will be filed late " without any explanation according to a person familiar with the situation pixar prepared and filed sec filings on behalf of its executives in his contract mr lasseter also received stock options he reported those to the sec within two weeks of the grant date nearly a year before the agencys deadline he included them on a form reporting the exercise of some earlier options he had received at the time the sec gave corporate insiders a choice of reporting option grants either on so called form s in which they reported other stock transactions or on separate annual form s which could be filed later mr lasseter had a similar opportunity to report his options grant with the december date on march nine days before he signed his new employment contract mr lasseter filed a form with the sec reporting the sale of some pixar shares but he didnt include any mention of the options dated in december mr lasseter wasnt the only pixar employee to be awarded options with the timely dec grant date and a strike price the day before so was edwin catmull who co founded pixar with mr jobs mr catmull received options as it happened mr catmull reported exercising on dec some other options he had and reported that exercise to the sec in a form filing on jan but the filing made no mention of the option grant of dec he reported that grant to the sec in a form filing on feb mr catmull had recently been promoted on jan pixar announced that he had been named president disney declined to make mr catmull who is now president of the combined disney and pixar animation studios available for comment another peculiarity that raises questions of when mr lasseter actually received the grant is contained in the wording of the employment agreement according to his new contract his december options vested or became exercisable "on an equal monthly basis over the ten years of the employment agreement " since the agreement wasnt signed until march that would mean that the options began vesting in april yet mr lasseters form filing seems to contradict this stating that the options carried an expiration date of dec or years after the grant date and that they will "vest each month over a year period " that suggests they began vesting in january merissa marr contributed to this article
