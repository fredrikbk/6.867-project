new japanese merger rules clear path to more local deals tokyo new guidelines in japan will make it easier for local competitors to merge paving the way for even more and larger deals in years ahead analysts say the regulations set to take effect in april will lower the antimonopoly hurdle for many potential mergers between japanese companies that would have faced keener scrutiny by japans fair trade watchdog under current rules the rules also give japans antimonopoly policy more clarity helping companies that might have hesitated to pursue mergers and acquisitions out of fear of their being blocked or delayed by regulators the changes could unleash another round of deal making in japan where the number of m&amp as has already been rising rapidly as companies maneuver to increase competitiveness and grab new markets steel pharmaceutical and chemical companies are likely to be particularly sensitive to the new regime because they will be able to team up to vie against larger global rivals or bid for a local one facing a takeover threat from a foreign company analysts say "the possibility for driving mergers forward has increased quite a bit " said kei amemiya an antitrust attorney at morrison &amp foerster in tokyo and a former investigator at japans competition regulator "the psychological hurdles have come down considerably " the new japanese fair trade commission guidelines bring the nations competition rules more in line with those in the u s and the european union rather than just taking into account domestic market share which is the case now the new rules call for consideration of a merger deals impact on world wide market concentration that would allow combined companies with significant clout in the domestic market to merge if they face competition in the global market specifically regulators will now use a measurement called the herfindahl hirschman index a gauge of a markets concentration rather than just the share of individual companies when assessing pending deals regulators in the u s use the index when reviewing the potential impact of a merger the planned changes come at a time of increased m&amp a deals in all sectors of japans economy as the domestic population shrinks and companies seek new markets to spur growth the move also comes amid increasing concern within japans corporate world of unbridled foreign takeover activity that could see some of the nations marquee corporate names and technologies snapped up by foreign players the value of m&amp a deals involving japanese companies has steadily risen over the past five years hitting trillion yen &# billion in according to recof corp which tracks m&amp a deals there were deals last year up from and much higher than the in some other industries potentially affected by the new guidelines are automotive parts food integrated circuits optical equipment and retail analysts say an executive at japans most powerful business lobby group the nippon keidanren who lobbied the government for the changes said the new guidelines will help japanese companies such as those in the drug and chemical industries increase their scale to compete better on a global market "the issue was how to battle u s and eu firms that are no and no " in the world he said richard jerram an economist at macquarie securities in tokyo said the looser rules on domestic mergers might be related to legal changes for foreign takeovers coming into effect in may with the new antimonopoly rules domestic companies will be able to compete more readily with foreign firms in a buyout bid for one of their local competitors he said the new rules "would make a white knight approach more realistic in the event of a bid from overseas " mr jerram wrote to clients they "could be interpreted as a barrier to foreign investment into japan and could lead to an attempt to create new larger national champions " he wrote under the new guidelines fewer proposed mergers would come under close scrutiny during the past five years of the mergers in japan required a review by regulators under the new rules that number would have fallen to he said tokyo market ends flat europe is
