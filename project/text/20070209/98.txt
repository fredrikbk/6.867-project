every business day sign up for the e mail here the risks are real as hsbc was forced to acknowledge yesterday the london based global banking giant admitted that the rising bad debts at its u s mortgage business would force the whole company to issue its very first profit warning and chairman stephen green who took over last may said risk management and other controls at the unit hadnt been sufficient as the financial times reports "this wasnt supervised as closely as it should have been " mr green said in reference to household the consumer lender hsbc bought nearly four years ago and which has been rapidly expanding since late hsbc now fears rising default rates for u s mortgages in will have reached &# billion much higher than expected hsbcs warning is just one of many from industry rivals with lots of loans to consumers with poor credit records and shares in such lenders were tumbling on the news new century financial which disclosed late wednesday its expectations for a fourth quarter loss and some accounting errors for previous quarters saw its shares fall yesterday new century as the wall street journal points out is one of the biggest u s specialists in "subprime" mortgages and it blamed a growing trend of "early payment defaults " or loan defaults that occur soon after the loan is made what makes the problem a lot bigger is that the risks from making such loans have been spread far and wide by investor hunger for the kind of high returns to be found in mortgage backed securities a way for lenders to reduce their exposure by farming it out now "many in the industry are wondering how well investors in mortgage backed securities will cope as delinquencies rise " the journal says "the riskiest of those securities those that absorb some of the first losses from defaults are typically sold to money managers and hedge funds in the u s and abroad " warnings about the risk of default and not just by consumers arent new and yet borrowed money is still cheap even two and a half years since the u s federal reserve began to raise its benchmark lending rate a total of four percentage points the year treasury rate has risen only three quarters of a percentage point since while the yield of year euro bonds is no higher than it was four years ago as businessweek notes as the magazine says while high risk borrowers used to have to pay

lawmaking budget writing and campaigning on top of the inescapably tangible role played by the war in the daily lives of the u s troops deployed in iraq and their families so the report due out today from the pentagon inspector general on the use of prewar intelligence is likely to resonate especially since its findings go to the crux of how the war was and still is sold as key part of the post fight against terrorism the report says former undersecretary of defense douglas j feith buttressed the white house case for the invasion with "reporting of dubious quality or reliability" that backed political views of senior bush administration officials rather than use conclusions of the intelligence community the washington post reports mr feiths team drew on "both reliable and unreliable" intelligence to come up with a link between al qaeda and iraq "that was much stronger than that assessed by the intelligence community and more in accord with the policy views of senior officials in the administration " the report says still the inspector general also found that mr feith and other officials working for former defense secretary donald rumsfeld didnt violate laws or mislead congress the new york times reports but john d rockefeller iv the new chairman of the senate intelligence committee said that since the inspector general considered the work of mr feiths group to be "intelligence activities " the committee would investigate whether the pentagon violated the national security act of by failing to notify congress about its work suspect options dating at pixar the
