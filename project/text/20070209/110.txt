weekend journal nobodys home a growing number of manhattans choicest homes are owned by out of towners who use them infrequently troy mcmullen on forgotten holiday tips and the &# million pied a terre five fifteen park avenue has everything one could want in a manhattan home sprawling floor through apartments unobstructed views and concierge and maid services but on most days the limestone and beige brick tower at the elegant upper east side address lacks one thing many of its residents more than half of the buildings units belong to absentee owners whose main residences stretch from tokyo to wichita kan city deeds and mortgage documents show some spend little more than a few weeks a year at their apartments say other owners and building staff it can feel a little empty " says las vegas developer and billionaire phillip ruffin who stays " a day or two" a month at his &# million home at park wealthy jet setters have long maintained cozy manhattan pieds a terre but the citys choicest properties are increasingly being scooped up by out of towners more than of manhattan apartment sales are second home purchases up from about eight years ago estimates jonathan miller of miller samuel one of manhattans largest real estate appraisal firms donald trump says that more than half the condo owners at his buildings on central park west and park avenue are part timers these people "may not even know the address" of their new york holdings says mr trump but "theyd still rather own a place in new york than schlep to a hotel " the lavish part time spreads underscore a shift among the wealthy who increasingly split their time among three or four homes the investment potential of the citys blue chip real estate also appeals to rich people looking to diversify their portfolios developers are targeting these absentee owners by packing buildings with amenities such as housekeeping limousine services and even dog walkers making it simple to ease in and out of town maids at ian schragers gramercy park north even will stock the fridge with groceries before the owners arrive but the occasional occupants are troubling to some full time residents who say their buildings are left depressingly hollow and the popularity of the costly apartments helps boost manhattan prices for everyone draining away developers interest in erecting middle class buildings on the citys few available parcels and making one of the worlds most expensive real estate markets even more forbidding to average buyers to have so many apartments sitting empty when there is an affordable housing crisis in new york city raises a "political question " says mitchell duneier a professor of urban sociology at princeton university new york of course has long attracted out of town buyers and its certainly not the only city luring highfliers paris london palm beach and aspen also attract wealthy part time owners but whats new is the enormous amount of money individuals are forking over for part time manhattan residences and their ballooning size and scope at the one beacon court tower in midtown for instance a room apartment on the market with five bedrooms and baths is described in its marketing materials as "the perfect pied a terre " price &# million though he spends less than two weeks a year in manhattan italian financier and formula one team manger flavio briatore owns a square foot apartment at one beacon court where his neighbors include part time resident and former general electric chief jack welch yet because he wants more space mr briatore says he recently agreed to buy a &# million home at the plaza hotel part of which is being converted to apartments the new five bedroom flat measures square feet and overlooks central park and fifth avenue "i travel to countries a year for business " mr briatore says "im sick of hotels so when im in new york i want to sleep in my own bed " a number of the plus residences at the time warner center condominium twin story towers overlooking central park belong to absentee owners according to city deed transfers and other public records among the out of towners thomas siebel founder of software maker siebel systems who paid &# million for his full floor home has rarely been there since buying it early in say real estate professionals and others with knowledge of the apartment the condo fees and taxes on the th floor unit total almost &# a month mr siebel who also owns properties in montana florida and northern california couldnt be reached for comment out of town buyers like messrs siebel and briatore have traditionally tended to stick close to central park the string of hotel residences along central park south is known among some brokers as "absentee row" because of the areas strong appeal to foreign buyers but downtown is gaining currency a three tower glass and steel complex along the hudson river in greenwich village designed by architect richard meier is filled with out of town owners from los angeles to london public records show among them sun microsystems co founder bill joy who paid &# million for a duplex in and uses it infrequently say people at the building reached by phone mr joy whose main home is in colorado declined to comment in general these part time residents arent speculators angling to make a quick profit by flipping their units instead they view manhattan property as an excellent asset especially since it has largely escaped the real estate downturn that has hit much of the country manhattan real estate prices rose on average in over the previous year while the median price of a home went up according to a report by the real estate firm prudential douglas elliman the average sale price for manhattan apartments in s fourth quarter was more than &# million up in a year and in the years from to manhattan real estate prices rose says mr miller the appraiser michael linn founder and chief executive of linn oil in houston and his wife cate recently spent about &# million for a manhattan residence the couple grew tired of booking hotel suites on their occasional trips to the city for shopping and business so they bought the two bedroom apartment with a concierge and empire state building views mr linn years old splits his time via the company jet between houston and the couples main residence outside pittsburgh he says he bought the manhattan home for convenience but "putting money in new york real estate was an important investment for us " another building popular with out of town buyers is fifth ave an story limestone building facing central park bruce toll says he spends less than a week there each month while splitting his time among homes in nantucket mass palm beach and a property near the horsham pa headquarters of his company home builder toll bros the rise in absentee owners worries some manhattan residents and urban affairs experts who say too many out of towners can sap the vitality out of buildings "it deadens the whole neighborhood " says society decorator keith irvine a long time upper east side resident "you sometimes get a sense that whole streets are deserted " antonio "l a " reid chairman of universal music groups island def jam label calls park ave a "wonderful place" for him and his family mr reid owns three homes but says hes a full time resident at the building and his three children are enrolled in nearby schools mr reid says the building can "go dead" some weeks when many residents are gone leaving hallways empty and his kids without playmates "lets just say that my kids arent going next door to borrow a cup of sugar " he jokes condominiums which make up about of manhattans apartments that are owned rather than rented are the purchase of choice for out of towners prickly boards at cooperative buildings the most prevalent form of apartment ownership in manhattan rarely allow absentee owners out of concern they may let noisy relatives or friends use their units and that a leaky pipe in an empty apartment could do major damage and unlike condo buildings many co ops forbid or strictly limit owners in renting out their homes mr duneier of princeton and others believe manhattans building boom over the past few years is contributing to the rise in wealthy part time residents developers completed more than condo units in manhattan between and compared with in the prior three year period according to the real estate board of new york because the bulk of these units target the upper end which often attracts out of town investors many buyers in the middle are being priced out but not everyone is bothered by the perpetual out of towners vicki been director of new york universitys furman center for real estate and urban policy says parts of manhattan are beginning to resemble other affluent second home areas "for the second or third home buyer manhattan is just like any other beachfront or winter retreat location " she says "their neighbors have almost come to expect not to see them year around " of course even some longtime new yorkers who consider manhattan their home are in effect part time residents "they own country houses and summer estates and travel to europe in the summer " says sharon baum a broker with corcoran a major manhattan real estate firm "every weekend theyre out of town " some see an upside to the empty apartments michael holtz who owns an square foot unit at the richard meier towers says the lack of neighbors limits competition for the buildings amenities "i go to the pool and the gym a lot and theres almost no one ever there " says mr holtz who owns a travel agency "its great for me but the pool attendant doesnt have much to do all day " yet while the dearth of full time residents can mean less work for building employees it can have a downside for them as well a doorman at one of the meier designed towers blames these virtual owners for a shortfall in holiday tipping "this christmas was probably the worst for me in years " he says "i guess when nobodys here most of the time a lot of people just forget to tip "
