moving the market heard on the street oil company cushion italian energy firms natural gas business protects profit margins from falling crude as crude oil prices are returning to earth so too are the stratospheric stock prices and profit margins of many of the worlds major oil companies giants such as chevron corp and exxon mobil corp reported year over year declines in fourth quarter earnings after more than two years of spectacular growth but for eni spa of italy the worlds sixth largest oil company by market value the recent plunge in the price of crude may have a good side eni is the sole member of the big oil club also to have a large natural gas business it controls of gas sales in europe the division is now acting like an insurance policy against shrinking margins especially since most of its gas contracts are set for years in advance giving the company ballast against a volatile market for crude "the gas business is really defensive " says mario frontini a fund manager at fidelity investments which held more than four million eni shares at the end of last year "it generates cash and in a scenario of falling oil prices eni is more stable than the other big oil companies " though oil prices have begun to rise over the past few weeks they are well off their highs of last year oil futures on the new york mercantile exchange have dropped since aug even after yesterdays rally and the dow jones stoxx oil &amp gas index a measure of the worlds largest oil and oil service companies is down but enis stock is up in a year of record oil prices second only to

accounted for billion euros or of those total earnings now analysts are again recalculating the strategic value of enis gas business "i think the gas &amp power business differentiates eni from the other oil and gas companies and the value hidden in that division makes it our top pick in the sector " says michele della vigna a london based oil analyst for goldman sachs &amp co who has a "buy" rating on the stock goldman provides investment banking services to eni and its asset management division holds a stake in the company exane bnp paribas analyst irene himona noted in a report published in january that enis overall profits have been less volatile than the european oil sector average "stability of profits may have been a negative as oil prices surged " she wrote "however on a longer term perspective of more stable commodity prices we think this feature deserves a premium for reflecting lower risk " she has a "buy" rating on the stock with a two year target price of euros or above the thursday closing price in milan of euros in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange enis american depositary receipts were up cents to &# giving the company a market value of &# billion eni is hardly free of risk the showpiece of its exploration and production business the kashagan oil field in kazakhstan which is the largest "elephant" find of the past years is behind schedule and facing major cost overruns in addition despite chief executive paolo scaronis stated intention of expanding enis refining capacity refining and marketing account for just of operating profits far below the average of its peers but analysts feel these minuses are more than compensated for by the value of enis natural gas portfolio for years the former state owned company which was trying to climb the ranks of the oil majors was almost embarrassed about its gas business but eni was able to increase its overall gas sales by diversifying into other european markets even as it shrank its italian business more significant concerns about reducing carbon emissions have resulted in a spike in demand for cleaner burning gas throughout europe as power companies have come to rely on it instead of coal to generate electricity total gas sales in europe are slated to rise to more than billion cubic meters by from more than billion cubic meters currently "there is a convergence between gas and electricity " which will make the price of gas more dynamic says domenico dispenza chief operating office of the gas &amp power division overall gas supplies remain limited partly because producing countries are struggling to increase output and because it is difficult to build the pipeline infrastructure needed to transport gas last year however eni pulled off what seems like an attractive deal with russias oao gazprom which controls the worlds largest gas reserves eni was already gazproms single largest customer in exchange for ceding some of its own downstream market in italy to gazprom eni extended its supply of gas from the russian company for some contracts through as gas imports to europe are expected to more than double over the next years enis gas transport infrastructure which includes pipelines from north africa russia and the north sea will be in increasing demand marco alvera senior vice president of enis gas &amp power division says enis scale and expertise give it an advantage in the gas trading business "banks are playing with this mainly on paper " he says "we have significant physical assets and all the information to do it as well "
