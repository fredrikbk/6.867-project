talking b school haas takes new tack on investing m b a students to run fund focusing on socially responsible firms these days more business schools are teaching students about corporate social responsibility and more are establishing investment funds for m b a s to manage now the haas school of business at the university of california berkeley is melding the two trends in what may be the first student managed investment fund to focus on social and environmental responsibility m b a track columnist ron alsop interviewed kellie mcelhaney adjunct professor and executive director of the center for responsible business at the haas school this month about the new fund wsj why do you want to establish a fund dedicated to socially responsible investing dr mcelhaney our no goal is to give students a unique learning opportunity we believe this will be the first student run fund ever that makes investments using a social responsibility screen so well be pioneering it as we go along right now about of haas m b a students dont take our elective courses on social responsibility if we can teach some of them about corporate social responsibility through practical investment experience that will be great theres been a strong desire to get an investment fund off the ground at haas hopefully finance students will join ours until haas gets a traditional investment fund like some other schools offer at the same time we will provide hard core quant experience to the students in our social responsibility classes second were hoping to advance the investment methodology out there we want to run our own quantitative analysis on methodologies to generate more knowledge for wall street about socially responsible investing we can produce research from our funds performance and we also can send our students to work at both sri funds and major wall street firms third this will hopefully be a fund raising vehicle for the center for responsible business we plan to keep a minimum of &# million in the fund and any returns will go to help support this self sustaining academic center q what sparked the creation of such a student run fund a three years ago my center ran a conference on metrics for corporate social responsibility along with london business school and boston university charlie michaels and his wife doris came to the conference and during a break we started talking about how great it would be to run our own sri fund charlie a haas alumnus and president of sierra global management now has made that possible with an initial investment of &# q when will you launch the fund a thus far theres the &# in the door and were in discussions with other potential donors we want to start investing when the fund reaches &# we think we can get there in about two months but we want to get to &# million as quickly as possible because at the &# million level we will be able to produce better data on our investment criteria and our effectiveness we just put out the call for applications from our m b a and master of financial engineering students there will be about five m b a s initially as portfolio analysts and managers and we hope eventually theyll be responsible for researching companies making investment recommendations with the help and oversight of haas faculty a committee of investment professionals and haas alumni and then monitoring the investments we think each m b a should be responsible for recommending two investment positions one long for companies with a good social responsibility record and one short for those with a poor record there will also be two m f e students who will run quantitative modeling and analysis looking at portfolio optimization models q what criteria will students use in making investments a we will invest in companies with both a strong record of social responsibility and financial performance we wont sacrifice one for the other the team of portfolio managers will develop specific criteria they will study corporate financial and social responsibility reports augmented with third party perspectives on the companies we dont plan to conduct surveys or interview executives q will there be a connection between students course work and the fund a this year were offering our first elective around socially responsible investing techniques its fortuitous timing that the fund will launch at the same time we will require our portfolio managers to take the course so theres some classroom content and theory behind the fund q will this experience give students the skills they need to land jobs with funds that have a social responsibility focus a absolutely it will give them a competitive advantage over students with just course work on social responsibility or just investment experience there have been a lot more sri funds created in recent years and i see an increasing number of job opportunities out there what i have yet to see are the traditional investment houses posting jobs for professionals with sri experience but i hope i will be able to send more knowledgeable students into the traditional wall street firms where they can raise social responsibility issues from inside the companies q does this take corporate social responsibility to a new level in academia a it definitely will because well have data it may be negative positive or inconclusive but there will be data we in corporate social responsibility are still really in the throes of proving ourselves to other academicians and the only way we can do that is through research and data q are there any concerns about letting students run such a fund a investing is a risk for sure but this is a learning laboratory students wont be proud if theres a negative return but they also wont forget the lesson there was some concern that we could run into a situation where students short a company because of a weak corporate social responsibility record and the university happens to have a partnership with that company it could create a challenge for the university but then the university is not managing the fund the students are and after all education is all about varying viewpoints
