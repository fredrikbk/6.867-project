lead concerns spread to more products federal agencies widen focus beyond chinese made toys to mexican dishes cookware vinyl goods scrutinized too the government is taking its concern about lead in consumer products beyond toys new efforts by health and safety officials are looking at potential lead hazards in imported ceramic dishes and cookware made in china and mexico as well as lead in lunchboxes and vinyl baby bibs later this month the consumer product safety commission the food and drug administration and other government agencies will launch a campaign to educate hispanic communities around the u s about lead hazards in the home including traditional ceramic pottery made in mexico the commission also is helping to develop a voluntary standard to limit lead in vinyl consumer products used by children such as baby bibs and consumers union a nonprofit consumer advocacy group is also looking at ceramic dishware and lunchboxes as part of a research project on lead hazards the growing concern over lead in household products comes after several recent recalls involving childrens toys that were made in china mattel inc last month recalled million toys believed to contain lead paint or other hazards and in june rc corp recalled about million thomas &amp friends railroad toys that were made in china because the surfaces also contained lead there are other concerns from imported products besides lead earlier this year the deaths of at least a dozen dogs and cats were linked to tainted pet food that came from china but lead is a chief concern because of its potential to cause serious health damage especially in children if ingested it can cause learning disabilities behavioral problems growth retardation and hearing problems and other problems in children in adults lead poisoning can cause abdominal pain reproductive problems high blood pressure and heart and kidney failure experts say the greatest lead hazard in the home comes from peeling or chipping lead paint the recent spate of recalls has left many consumers wondering about the dangers of lead in everyday products karlyn berg a year old wildlife consultant from bovey minn recently went into a big box retailer and bought some colorful plastic drinking cups and an ice bucket for entertaining friends on her patio then she had second thoughts about using them "i thought these are so cute but its such an unknown " she says "its made in china and it just hit me that this could be another dangerous product " u s safety officials however say that the major concern among food related items is ceramics ceramics can be a problem because the glazes often contain lead which can help maintain rich color and shine if the glazes are properly fired the final product is usually safe but if the glaze isnt sealed at a high enough temperature lead can leach from a plate or vessel into the food or liquid according to scott clark a professor of environmental health at the university of cincinnati research that mr clark has done abroad also found brass pots being made in india lined with lead instead of the usual tin the fda says the lead tainted ceramics are usually brought into the u s from mexico by individuals a frequently used vessel or pot that leaches lead could poison a whole family or end up being resold the agency says the new program aims to raise awareness through fliers posters and public service announcements in u s cities with large hispanic populations in the u s the fda has the authority to regulate food contact surfaces and has tight limits on the amount of lead that can leach into food the agency subjects the imported ceramics it screens to a hour leaching test says michael kashtock an agency senior adviser for regulatory policy mr kashtock pointed out that while ceramics made in small workshops can pose a risk most of the imports are factory produced and sealed appropriately companies often conduct their own tests as well a spokeswoman for retailer crate &amp barrel for example says the company has a network of laboratories all over the world that tests dishes for safety yet consumer advocates express concern that some of the unsafe products can slip through u s controls and be brought in small quantities from abroad turning up in peoples homes or specialty shops "when you have a market as global as ours has become its very difficult to regulate these things" says alex fidis a staff attorney for the u s public interest research groups a federation of state consumer advocacy groups meanwhile u s safety officials are also giving vinyl products increased scrutiny lead can be found in polyvinyl chloride a type of plastic especially in older products when products like vinyl miniblinds deteriorate they create lead dust that is hazardous if ingested in may the consumer product safety commission warned that baby bibs with cracked or peeling vinyl surfaces could pose a hazard to infants if pieces were swallowed some states such as illinois and connecticut have limits on the amount of total lead that is permissible in childrens products federal law looks at the amount of accessible not total lead in childrens products this year the cpsc came under fire from some consumer groups after it didnt take action on soft vinyl lunchboxes that contained lead because they said the lead levels were low and inaccessible now however the commission is working with an international standard making organization that could create a voluntary standard to limit total lead in vinyl childrens products recent legislation would give the commission more funding a more streamlined recall process and create greater penalties for retailers who knowingly sell tainted products consumer advocates advise worried consumers to purchase ceramic dishware made in the u s or europe if possible where safety standards are tighter they also suggest using cookware made of other materials if consumers are concerned about their pottery mr kashtock of the fda says people can test the product with a home lead test kit consumers union is studying the efficacy of lead testing kits and plans to publish the results in november household hazard some ways to avoid lead poisoning at home maintain the paint in pre homes but dont scrape or sand without proper safety equipment test imported ceramic dishes and cookware with a home lead test kit or use them for decorative purposes only dont let your child use vinyl bibs that are cracked or peeling get rid of old plastic mini blinds which can create lead dust
