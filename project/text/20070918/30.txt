finding a cure will sharing ideas advance cancer research hedge fund managers offer &# million prize to combat scientists culture of secrecy after hope goldstein was diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer in her family wanted to help her husband and two sons started researching the disease and quickly realized that even with surgery and chemotherapy the prognosis wasnt good so they went in search of the one thing they believed still might help mrs goldstein new ideas they started calling cancer researchers doctors at leading academic centers specialists in ovarian cancer in their conversations they ran into an unexpected obstacle many people did have new ideas but frequently they werent willing to share them friends who worked in medical research tried to explain companies often will not pursue an idea for commercialization unless it is patented requiring secrecy in the early stages in addition the grant process is competitive and no one wants to get scooped perhaps most notably professional advancement depends on publishing ideas in scientific journals in mrs goldstein died but her son robert goldstein continued to think about the issue it seemed to him that what was holding back cancer research wasnt only a lack of money but a culture that discouraged the sharing of promising leads "if you have a great idea but someone else publishes it first you get no credit professionally or financially " says gary curhan of harvard medical school one of the researchers who spoke with robert goldstein about the issue of sharing "ideas " says dr curhan "are our currency " a managing partner at the hedge fund gotham capital in new york mr goldstein recognized similarities with his own profession money managers also were reluctant to share investment ideas a few years earlier mr goldsteins business partner and friend joel greenblatt the year old founder of gotham capital had created an online selective group called the value investors club to spur idea sharing members shared investing strategies and commented on each others research a cash prize was awarded for the best idea of the week the two men thought that perhaps a similar model would work in cancer research so this year they agreed to put up &# million of their own money every year to fund the gotham prize for cancer research modeled on the value investors club the annual prize will go to the person who posts the best new cancer research idea judged by a board of respected scientists at the prizes web site by the end of december the winner of the gotham prize doesnt have to present a shred of evidence that the premise will work to attract ideas from people outside the field of cancer research there is no requirement that the winner be capable of seeing the idea through and the prize money is earmarked for personal use to be spent on anything the winner wants even a fancy car or a bigger house this concept has been met with some skepticism even by the scientific advisory board that will judge the ideas board member meir stampfer of harvard medical school said that when he was invited to join he asked "is this really a good use of their money maybe there is something better they can fund " but the unusual nature of the prize illustrates the lengths to which patients and patient advocates are increasingly willing to go to boost research into their disease especially rare illnesses for which there is little funding patients have hired their own experts to conduct research in particular diseases and even helped to fund their own clinical trials efforts are also focused on overcoming the reluctance to share ideas avichai kremer a year old who has als the neurodegenerative illness also known as lou gehrigs disease is co founder of the prizelife which is awarding a &# million prize for als biomarker discovery the national institutes of health announced this year a program called the new innovator award offering grants of up to &# million over five years for innovative research projects that dont have extensive preliminary data in addition the national cancer institute is helping companies find a way to collaborate in drug testing without worrying about intellectual property issues the medical journal the oncologist is encouraging the publication of failed medical trials in order to bring the ideas behind these trials which otherwise would never see the light of day to a broader audience and mr goldsteins father alfred with help from the familys other son mark also developed a venture that aims to improve idea sharing through "project hope " named for his late wife alfred goldstein guarantees certain funding for specific projects and requires the researchers share results with each other on a regular basis the gotham prize is a particularly ambitious project that is attracting attention the foundation of the ira sohn investment research conference which runs the conference as a benefit to raise money for cancer will fund an additional &# prize for the best pediatric cancer idea submitted to the gotham site ephraim gildor founder of axiom investment advisors is also providing financial support for the prize in setting up the prize mr greenblatt and mr goldstein knew that they couldnt evaluate the new ideas themselves so they set up a board of pre eminent scientists and researchers they include people to whom they have a personal connection like dr curhan who is also mr greenblatts brother in law others such as michael kastan director of the cancer center at st jude childrens research hospital in memphis tenn said they had received letters "out of the blue" inviting them to participate dr curhan the head of the advisory board says all ideas submitted are vetted by at least two members of the board before being posted as a result although there are over registered users only ideas have been posted about of the submitted ideas have been rejected so far dr curhan says the tension is always how to eliminate ideas "not because they are new or different but because there is no scientific basis for them " says mr greenblatt "it cant become a free for all we want quality ideas or the site wont work " to submit an idea applicants need supply only a to word explanation of their concept and the reasoning behind it they dont have to supply any data or evidence that the concept has been tested some of the ideas accepted so far are very unusual someone who described himself as a businessman and former guitar player in a rock band proposed searching for the resonant frequency of cancer cells and then applying subsonic sound waves to cancer patients in order to trigger the bodys immune response dr curhan says that idea sparked debate on the board but it was posted in the end because some members argued that it couldnt totally be ruled out and was novel and outside the box there was also a proposal for a sort of pap smear for early detection of breast cancer by a scientist who runs a major university lab but says it would be very difficult to get funding for such an early stage project another comes from an aids researcher who discovered an idea about brain cancer and thought as an outsider in cancer research he was unlikely to get funding from traditional sources a survivor of testicular cancer posted an idea about an algorithm he created that he believes could lead to better early detection of recurrence dr kastan of st jude says that even after reading all the ideas "i am still waiting to see if it works " he says that most important scientific discoveries are made by "someone who was doing an experiment that had an unusual result that took them in a different direction it is data that shows us the way not a wild idea that comes out of nowhere " but he says he agreed to get involved because he recognized there werent many places for scientists to share an early idea bert vogelstein of johns hopkins university school of medicine another advisory board member says he isnt sure he totally embraces the "anyone can have a great idea" approach that seemed to drive the initial concept but he says that getting grants from government agencies like the nih sometimes "forces people to do somewhat mundane experiments that follow up on other experiments rather than thinking creatively in cancer in particular we need more things that have never been done before because i think thats the only way were going to beat the disease " similar thinking was behind the efforts at the oncologist a journal for cancer specialists to publish online the results of so called negative trials those that dont end up supporting the initial hypothesis these trials dont result in the drug getting approved and arent typically published "a font of information" is being lost that could be helpful if looked at a new way says martin j murphy jr founding executive editor of the oncologist at the nci scientists found that investigators at different companies wanted to share ideas and test different drugs in new combinations but often they "couldnt do so because their own legal departments wouldnt let them because of intellectual property issues " says james zwiebel of the ncis cancer therapy evaluation program the nci stepped in and crafted an agreement that each company signs that lets the nci test a drug in combination with other companies agents the companies share in any information and other ideas that arise from the experiments not everyone supports the premise that theres some great idea out there today waiting to be heard "i dont sense a lot of holding back of exciting information " says robert ozols senior vice president of medical science at fox chase cancer center and one of the oncologists the goldsteins felt was willing to share ideas "if we knew something worked wed be doing it " but the prize applicants believe otherwise mark kantrowitz the publisher of finaid org a web site about student financial aid and director of advanced projects for fastweb com came across a posting about the prize while scouring the web in may at age he was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer after completing treatment he was put on a surveillance schedule of regular ct scans to pick up any possible recurrence "the schedule seemed totally arbitrary " says mr kantrowitz who has a background in mathematics he wrote an algorithm for a computer program that creates a surveillance schedule based on the greatest likelihood of catching a relapse as early as possible "i know it needs a clinical trial but i come from outside the field and wouldnt know how to start it " he says even if he doesnt win the &# million he says he hopes an oncologist sees the idea online and likes it enough to test it all of the ideas posted for the prize can be seen at www gothamprize org by users who register as guests david rimm a tenured professor of pathology at yale university school of medicine runs a large grant funded research lab where he says he can get money for his mainstream research but things that are very early or "more out on the limb are very difficult to get funded " he says so he posted an idea to develop a kind of pap smear for early breast cancer detection using spectral spatial imaging technology on breast tissue samples to detect cellular changes beyond what the pathologists eye can see dr rimm says a colleague told him about the prize but that he was surprised when he learned that the &# million was for personal use at the site the founders had explained that one of the goals of the prize is to fill in current research gaps "if theyre just giving us money to buy a boat it wont lead to filling the gaps " he says mr goldstein and mr greenblatt recognize that there is no guarantee that the winner will spend the money on shepherding the concept into a clinic what they hope is that the prize site can serve as a kind of marketplace of ideas where additional investors might see something interesting and decide to invest in some of the other projects as well the prizes true value mr greenblatt said will come from jump starting that process in the end says dr curhan "if you get even three or four really good ideas the first year that would be a huge success "
