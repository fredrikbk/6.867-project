burden of proof as costs rise new medicines face pushback insurers limit coverage to fda approved uses &# drug denied may chin louis years old has a ballooning brain tumor her doctors wanted to attack it with a colon cancer drug that has shown promise in treating brain tumors but for four months ms chin louiss insurer wellpoint inc refused to pay for the drug called avastin it costs about &# a dose every other week a wellpoint spokesman says it denied coverage initially because there isnt sufficient medical evidence proving avastin is effective against brain tumors "shes a young patient with a family who has run out of options shes just looking for a chance " says her oncologist susan chang patients with ms chin louiss condition typically live for only about four months doctors particularly oncologists rely on medicines approved for other diseases to try to save patients for whom all other treatments have failed but as new medicines come to market at ever higher prices insurers are pushing back limiting coverage of these drugs to only the diseases for which they are specifically approved by the food and drug administration or for which there is extensive evidence of efficacy in clinical trials "a lot of patients are being denied potentially effective therapies " says james vredenburgh an oncologist at duke university medical center "whats happening is totally arbitrary and its correlated to when the prices went up ten years ago we never got questioned on our medical decision to prescribe the medicine with the best chance of helping our patients " insurers say they must limit use of the most expensive drugs to control health care costs which are surging at a to annual rate and continue to outpace inflation it makes sense they say to require proof that a drug works in a patients particular disease before doling out tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars "were trying to bring new drugs to consumers but trying to do it with employers getting the best value of every health care dollar spent in the system " says mohit ghose spokesman for americas health insurance plans an industry trade group high priced medicines used to treat relatively small groups of patients categorized as "specialty pharmaceuticals" comprise one of the fastest growing parts of health spending insurance officials say by pushing generics insurers have clamped down on spending on other types of medicines which rose in according to express scripts inc one of the largest pharmacy benefit managers by contrast spending on specialty drugs soared last year they accounted for nearly a quarter of total drug spending in the u s according to health strategies group a new jersey consulting firm insurers have little leverage in negotiating the prices of many specialty drugs because they often extend lives and lack competition drug companies have the freedom to price these medicines almost as high as they like the companies say the prices are needed to fund research of new medicines and to compensate shareholders genentech inc charges &# a month or &# for the average treatment course of avastin for colon cancer patients higher doses are used in treating brain tumors raising the cost once a unique life saving drug is approved by the fda for a disease insurers almost always are required to pay for it regardless of price but insurers have leeway when a medicine isnt specifically approved for a particular patients disease coverage varies among companies "as an insurer you go where the money is to try to cut costs " says abbie leibowitz former chief medical officer of aetna inc who runs health advocate which advises employers and employees on health insurance spending on specialty drugs is "where there is the greatest opportunity to affect cost " wall street is seeing the effects of the pushback in lower than expected revenue from some of the hottest new cancer drugs genentechs avastin is fda approved for certain kinds of colorectal and lung cancers but the drug should also be a big seller in breast cancer based on a large study reported two years ago showing efficacy in that disease says steven harr a morgan stanley analyst his research shows less than of breast cancer patients are using the treatment for which genentech charges &# per month for the average patient with prices so high insurers "wont pay until its fda approved " dr harr says "for the first time ever theres elasticity in demand " karen kacures who owns a lawn care company in st francis minn found that out the hard way ms kacures was diagnosed in january with pompe disease a rare genetic disorder it is caused by a deficiency in an enzyme that leads to progressive muscle weakening and an early death along with the devastating diagnosis her doctors brought some hope genzyme corp a cambridge mass biotech company recently brought to market the first treatment for the disease the drug called myozyme replaces the enzyme deficiency that causes muscle degeneration dosed by weight the drug is priced at an average of &# a year for a patients entire life in march ms kacuress insurer preferredone community health plan a golden valley minn nonprofit with members refused to pay for the drug "we consider that for adults the evidence is not there to support its use " says john frederick chief medical officer of preferredone he noted that genzyme conducted its clinical trial to win approval of the drug only in infants in approving the drug the fda required genzyme to conduct another trial which is under way to prove safety and efficacy in adults dr frederick acknowledges that the fda didnt restrict approval of the drug to infants but he says it was "a little fuzzy " drugs that are high priced and treat smaller populations have "just kind of taken over" the pharmacy budget dr frederick says in the most recent fiscal year his companys spending on specialty drugs rose over the previous year spending on other pharmaceuticals was almost flat he says generics are helping "stem the tide" of spending he says but specialty medicines are "a concern to us from a cost perspective " calling ms kacuress case "wrenching " dr frederick says he wishes there were "a big systemic cure i dream of a big super insurance plan to cover these tragic cases " ms kacures who has appealed the denial says she doesnt have time to wait until genzyme finishes its study in adults "i want to get treated while i can still walk and breathe on my own during the day " she says she uses a cane to walk and a breathing machine at night some adults do receive the drug mark lingenfelter of eau claire wis started taking myozyme in november after medicaid the governments health insurance program for the disabled and poor agreed on appeal to cover the cost of the drug for the first time in three years mr lingenfelter says hes been able to stand up out of his wheelchair his breathing has improved enough to be able to talk on the phone for a few minutes sometimes to offer encouragement to ms kacures "its made a complete difference in my life " he says gideon sofer a freshman at the university of california berkeley was turned down last year when he tried to get approval from his mothers new jersey insurance plan to pay for a new medicine the drug revlimid was approved by the fda to treat a rare blood disorder and not yet tested in mr sofers condition crohns disease an inflammatory disorder that causes severe digestive problems mr sofer had been using thalidomide the only medicine that had helped control the mouth and intestinal sores caused by his disease but thalidomide caused such drowsiness that he says he couldnt take morning classes and he experienced nerve damage causing him to lose sensation in his feet revlimid made by celgene corp is billed as an improved thalidomide minus the drowsiness and nerve damage at first horizon blue cross blue shield of new jersey covered it for him "i felt so much less fatigue my anemia improved it was just great " mr sofer says his doctor in new york maria abreu director of the inflammatory bowel disease center at mount sinai school of medicine in new york city says mr sofers weekly blood reports showed gains in his iron levels but in august mr sofer received a letter saying "it was determined that you do not meet the horizon blue cross blue shield of new jersey established medical necessity criteria for this drug " it noted revlimid was approved for patients with a blood disorder and not mr sofers disease "although benefits are denied you may elect to receive the medication at your own expense " the letter said neither mr sofer nor his mother a social worker could afford the drug which retails at about &# for a months supply mr sofer called celgene and asked if the company would donate the drug he was connected to a celgene program called patient support solutions which provides free revlimid to patients who meet certain guidelines in a letter mr sofer was told he didnt qualify for free drugs he says an employee told him that crohns disease patients werent eligible last year not long after his prescription ran out mr sofer was hospitalized severely dehydrated he withdrew for the semester feeling too sick to continue "this has depleted me physically and spiritually " he said at the time celgenes patient support solutions says that this year the free drug program was expanded to include patients regardless of diagnosis as long as they meet certain financial criteria which the company declines to publicly detail in april mr sofer began receiving free revlimid his iron levels rebounded though he continues to struggle with infections related to his disease "for people like me for whom nothing has worked access to new treatments is absolutely critical " says the year old mr sofer "its the only thing that keeps me hopeful that keeps me living " ms chin louis was diagnosed with a brain tumor in late she had been working as an administrator at an accounting firm and raising two boys in danville calif when her speech periodically became jumbled a surgeon removed the tumor which initially grew slowly last year the tumor returned she underwent radiation and took a chemotherapy drug approved by the fda to treat brain cancer early this year a magnetic resonance imaging or mri showed a bigger spot on her brain suggesting the drug she was using no longer was working at the same time researchers at duke university medical center were reporting a promising study of avastin in combination with chemotherapy for brain tumors in a small trial of patients on treatment were alive at six months of them with no progression of their tumors about double what would be expected for patients with ms chin louiss kind of recurring brain tumor "it was early data but it was very exciting " says dr chang director of the division of neuro oncology at the university of california san francisco medical center in april dr chang asked blue cross of california to cover avastin for ms chin louis blue cross owned by wellpoint an indianapolis company with more than million members denied coverage on may saying in a letter "studies are ongoing to determine the role of this agent in the treatment of brain tumors " ms chin louis and her husband a supervisor in sales at united parcel service inc say they couldnt afford the treatment her sister linda tong says she and her brother offered to cover the cost but ms chin louis initially resisted "i really felt that i had been paying for insurance for years for a reason and when i needed medical care my insurance company should pay " ms chin louis says "i didnt want to put that burden on my family " in june the doctor says she put ms chin louis on a chemotherapy drug and appealed the denial for avastin telling insurance officials she wanted to use the drugs in combination on july a brain scan showed the chemotherapy wasnt working ms chin louiss tumor had grown by she immediately agreed to allow her siblings to pay for avastin and she underwent her first treatment early last month in early august asked by the wall street journal about the avastin denial james kappel a spokesman for wellpoint said "while this patients condition is very unfortunate there is no medical evidence that supports the use of the drug" in brain tumors but mr kappel called back the next day saying wellpoint had approved avastin for ms chin louis he said the company denied coverage at first because dr chang sought to use the drug alone because dr chang subsequently requested to treat ms chin louis in combination with chemotherapy as in the duke study wellpoint approved it mr kappel said dr chang says the ucsf center has participated in a trial comparing avastin on its own for brain tumors and in use with chemotherapy avastin alone appeared effective in some patients in the study which has yet to be published she says dr chang says ms chin louis has responded well so far to the avastin treatments "shes awake and feeling good and able to engage with her family " the doctor says ms chin louis is due for a brain scan later this week which she hopes will show the tumors growth in check "i know none of these treatments works forever " ms chin louis says "but i definitely want a little more time " shed like to celebrate her th birthday on sept she said shes eager to see her sister lindas baby girl due to arrive by cesarean section on nov and a small part of her is even daring to hope she will be in the audience when her eldest son andrew graduates from high school this june
