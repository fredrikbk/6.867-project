yield curve is banks silver lining steepening poses lift to profits and shares despite credits woes with the tough news about credit trouble for banks and other financial companies in recent weeks it has been easy to overlook an important variable for bank profits that has turned positive the yield curve that variable is the difference between short term and long term interest rates on treasurys the "yield curve" matters for the bottom line of financial companies especially banks they can borrow or take in deposits at lower short term rates and lend that money out long term at a higher rate and pocket the difference for banks the greater the spread between short and long rates the better in anticipation of the federal reserve announcing a rate cut after todays meeting the yields on the treasury two year note and year note have reached their widest gap since april though at percentage point its a smaller gap than at many points in the past the yield curves recent steepening is positive for banks even if many are now less directly reliant on profits from lending legg mason inc money manager bill miller says "anytime you get some steepening it points to improved profitability" for financial stocks he says of course snapping up bank stocks right now runs counter to widespread concerns about the near term impact that mortgage lending and other credit market woes will have on the bottom lines of banks but some say that is what makes this a buying opportunity "credit fears are overblown" when it comes to bank earnings says richard pzena co chief investment officer of pzena investment management  short term rates were higher than long term rates an unusual situation called an inverted yield curve the impact on a banks bottom line works as follows it pays interest on deposits or on money it borrows on a short term basis then lends that money at a more profitable rate of after subtracting the costs of making the loan it keeps the spread when the yield curve is "flat" where long term rates are similar to short term rates there is little profit but should the gap widen the additional spread translates into bigger earnings flat and inverted curves create head winds for banks balance sheets last year for example even big diversified banks such as wachovia corp saw profit crimped by the inverted yield curve one wild card for banks is an unusual situation resulting from recent credit market woes in which some short term rates that have a direct impact on their cost of financing are unusually high the london interbank offered rate or libor in early september rose to nearly a half percentage point above the u s federal funds rate when other market rates were falling normally libor moves largely in step with other short term rates such as the funds rate a combination of those short term financing costs write downs related to bad mortgages and the toll taken by the recent turmoil in the stock and bond markets could put a dent in banks earnings for the third quarter still in recent days libor has begun to ease back down toward the funds rate and now stands just percentage point above fed funds as libor returns to its more traditional link banks can better benefit from the steeper yield curve how much steeper the yield curve gets will depend on the course of the economy and expectations for fed policy later today it is widely expected that the feds policy board will cut the fed funds rate by at least a quarter percentage point from the market is expecting more to come down the road "the treasury yield curve is priced for a fairly aggressive easing " says lou crandall chief economist at wrightson icap for a time last year some questioned the yield curve as a predictor historically when the yield curve is inverted it is viewed as a predictor of a slowing economy a possible recession and a fed easing when that was the case last year the economy appeared so healthy that many questioned whether the yield curve was flashing a false warning but a year later there are questions about the health of the economy and the fed is on the verge of cutting rates the yield curve still has predictive powers says james hamilton a professor of economics at the university of california san diego and even though there are concerns about the health of the credit markets and in particular real estate lending "the same news that is causing long term yields to be higher than short term yields is favorable to financials " he says over the long term the year notes yield typically ranges from about a half percentage point to one point above the two year legg masons mr miller acknowledges that thus far the steepening of the yield curve has been modest by historical standards but argues that the trend is now in place "the yield curve will return to more normal levels over the next couple of years " he predicts against the backdrop of the credit market crunch mr miller likes shares of big global banks such as citigroup inc and j p morgan chase &amp co that have access to capital and strong balance sheets others say that a better strategy is to look for banks that will more directly benefit from a steepening yield curve financial titans such as j p morgan they argue also have big parts of their business tied to investment banking which is vulnerable in the wake of this summers market turmoil "my focus " says james swanson chief investment officer at mfs investment management "would be on banks where lending is their bread and butter " such as regional banks
