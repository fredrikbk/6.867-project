eyes on the road niche marketing drives trends in auto industry the frankfurt auto shows unofficial theme last week could have been "niches go nuts " take the bmw x concept unveiled at frankfurt i sadly couldnt attend but i saw the photos videos and news releases and like most ordinary people my first question about the x concept is what the heck is that see the video http online wsj com article sb html is it a crossover that is a sport utility vehicle built on the chassis of a car yes but it doesnt look like a conventional suv the roof line has a fastback as if the designers went to bed dreaming of nissan zs or old ferraris the concept has four doors which to americans generally means sedan yet bmw calls it a "sports activity coupe " in keeping with the hybrid theme the vehicle had a gas electric hybrid powertrain bmw ag is developing a hybrid powertrain in a partnership with general motors corp and daimlerchrysler ag soon to be called daimler ag the x which will go into production at bmws spartanburg s c factory within the next year illustrates just how finely auto makers are slicing and recombining their traditional product niches in the scramble for sales and consumer attention remember about years ago when the car business was simple sedans came in small medium and large or rather "full size" models some cars came with just two doors some companies sold pickup trucks for farmers and trades people if you had a family perhaps you bought a big station wagon maybe one of those funky international harvester travelalls a chevy suburban or conversion van hippies and other nonconformists bought vw microbuses or bugs a few folks tried out those cheap little cars that were coming from japan so simple so quaint so yesterday todays market is a kaleidoscope of segments that are splintering into niches and fracturing again along lines of price form function and technology the industry hasnt gotten to the point where every car sold is unique a segment of one but it is working in that direction at least in terms of what consumers see frankfurt offered a gaggle of tiny cars jumping into the niche that bmws mini brand and daimlers smart car had to themselves for a little while toyota motor corp s tiny iq concept had a face that might have been inspired by something from a tropical aquarium ford motor co s verve concept was a more conventional looking take on the minicar fiat spas cinquecento not available in the u s is the minicar as retro fashion accessory fiats web site boasts the fiat can be had in combinations that is headed toward an individual fiat for every customer every year another trusty constant that isnt looking so certain the internal combustion engine general motors used frankfurt to show off yet another variation of its "e flex" electric drive concept this time a hybrid electric drive mated to a liter diesel this was europe after all diesel hybrids are a long way from being economically viable especially in the u s where there are no significant tax incentives for diesel as there are in europe already customers can choose between several different kinds of "hybrid technology " plus engines that burn fuels blended with ethanol reprocessed cooking oil diesel natural gas or in very limited quantities hydrogen another sign of the times is the sudden widening of the spectrum of prices car makers think are realistic for their wares go back a decade or so and cars costing more than &# were exotic rarities executives at some auto companies complained that there wasnt much oxygen above &# now the worlds wealthy will have to expand their personal staffs to keep track of the price and selection available above a mere &# at frankfurt volkswagen ags lamborghini turned heads with a model called the reventon which sells for million euros &# million lamborghini said it has orders for the reventon an effort to redefine exclusivity ferrari spa has a similar aim in a different way with its ferrari scuderia a variant of the f the scuderia also unveiled in frankfurt is a pound car with a horsepower v motor and technology from ferraris formula program that is one horse for every pounds of car by comparison a corvette z has one horse for pounds a toyota camry v has one horse for every pounds on the other end of the spectrum soon could be indian cars costing around &# alfred p sloans strategy for general motors in its heyday was to provide a car for every purse and purpose he probably didnt mean that literally his successors in the auto industry seem intent on making his vision come true
