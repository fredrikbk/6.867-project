enterprise new franchise idea fewer rules more difference freedom to alter menus prices may help chains compete better locally customers going into one of the two dozen wings over buffalo style chicken wing franchises across the country wont find raspberry chipotle sauce on the menu unless they are in florida whats unusual though isnt the florida establishments sauce preference its that shawn rouse the co owner of the two franchises in the state was allowed to put the sauce on the menu to begin with and the sauce is just part of it wings over restaurants can incorporate the city or region where theyre located into the name say wings over washington d c "to make it feel more homey " says mark simonds president of the agawam mass based wings over franchise chain in addition stores in college towns where wings over is popular dont have to open until p m and can close at a m to a m usual weekday hours are a m to midnight "we really endeavor to let our franchisees have more of a say in the company " mr simonds says franchises are sticklers for the cookie cutter approach rules and processes are set down for owners buying into a uniform system the decor has to be set just so the products have to be prepared a certain way and all signage needs to be consistent but a crop of franchisers are taking a very different approach they are giving their franchisees some freedom to run their own operations much like an independent small business from personalizing store names and menus to fiddling with prices part of the strategy is to give franchisees the flexibility to compete against independent businesses but many franchisers also see it as a way to attract franchisees who have a growing number of businesses to pick from more than new concepts have begun franchising since according to the international franchise association based in washington d c there are nearly franchised businesses in more than different industries nationwide of course this un franchise way of doing business has its risks with personalization customers may not necessarily get the same level of service or quality in each of the franchises they patronize and individualization can dilute brand recognition for a franchise "there are usually strict franchise agreements so that you can maintain the integrity of the brand " says gary findley chief executive of findley group a waco texas franchise developer "thats what youre trying to do and if you give people a lot of latitude out there you lose the branding and in my opinion you lose value " kat tidd founding partner of kat tidd p c an addison texas franchise law firm says "generally what i tell clients is that you can pretty much frame out a franchise relationship to be whatever you want that you can conceive of but the question is does it make good business sense " it does for mike ferretti president and chief executive of great harvest bread co who calls the approach to running his business "freedom franchising " a term the company recently trademarked he describes it as a culture in which the best ideas in running the business come from the bottom up not top down the dillon mont based company encourages its franchise bakers to come up with new ideas such as a recipe for chicken salad and share it with other franchise owners through an internal company web site if the idea works then it can be rolled out in other markets perhaps tweaking some ingredients he says there are only a few stipulations bakery owners must use approved wheat which the company supplies respect territorial rights and pay the royalties which range from to of total sales other than that "we encourage bakeries to make decisions on a local basis that works for them " says mr ferretti that kind of thinking appealed to michael kenny who runs a great harvest franchise in lititz pa "with great harvest " says the year old franchisee "there are great resources and a collective knowledge to draw upon but you know youre not required to do any of it you can digest it and take from it what you will and make your own independent decision " that means mr kenny doesnt have to make pumpkin nut spice cake just because its october but if he does he can add nuts or an extra spice to it also while not all great harvest stores have hard crusted bread on the menu mr kenny added it to his store because he couldnt afford to ignore northeastern customers clamoring for it he also uses local honey dairy and fresh herbs from farms that dot the lancaster county countryside in addition while other franchise eateries around the area "dont even get to decide where they can buy their napkins from " mr kenny says he has the freedom to shop around for the best price for supplies pricing freedom is key for beef o bradys inc franchisees four months ago the tampa fla based sports pub franchise unveiled a new corporate menu with a price increase to &# for chicken wings with bleu cheese and celery the increase was in response to a jump in the price of wholesale chicken wings in florida to &# per pound from &# but don bosko owner of five beef o bradys franchises in the state decided the jump wasnt large enough for his establishments whose buffalo style chicken wings account for of total sales so he checked with competitors as well as other franchisees in his region and decided to raise his price to &# "we dont like a jump like that either " says mr bosko of the price increases still hes taking the gamble even if it means answering to his loyal customers "weve had it in place for three weeks now " he says "weve only had two complaints that i know of " nick vojnovic president of beef o bradys says the company was concerned about losing business in that market because of the higher prices but he says his franchisees knew the market better there so he let them change the menu price "we are kind of unique in the latitude we give our partners " mr vojnovic says still with locations and more slated to open this year the franchise is going through some growing pains "as we grow we do feel that we need to be tighter and do more streamlining to create a clear brand for our guests so that they know what to expect " mr vojnovic says he says for example that some franchisees havent done a good job with store decor some havent put up pictures of local sports teams on the wall that reflect their community better "some customers dont realize that its a chain " he says "they figure its locally owned and operated "
