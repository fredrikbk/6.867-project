goldman sachs china partner discuss a split potential breakup comes as firm gains traction in surging ipo market goldman sachs group inc and its investment banking partner in china are in discussions about parting ways potentially ending the tie up that gave the wall street firm its entry into a major market for new share issues and raising questions about control of goldmans business there fang fenglei goldmans partner in a three year old joint venture goldman sachs gao hua securities co has told people inside and outside the bank about his plans to start a private equity fund that might raise as much as &# billion according to people familiar with the situation it is unclear whether mr fang chairman of goldman sachs gao hua will maintain a formal relationship with the wall street firm though he would be expected to retain at least an advisory role according to one person familiar with the matter "its still fairly early on " this person said adding that "in terms of day to day operations hes not as heavily involved" as he once was in the joint ventures business mr fangs departure would signal a major turning point in china for goldman which got a big break in the chinese securities market nearly three years ago by lending mr fang &# million to set up a brokerage with which goldman could team up goldman had long been a major underwriter of overseas offerings by chinese companies but the deal with mr fang gave it access to the domestic securities market on the eve of an extended bull run that began in goldmans decision to partner with mr fang raised some eyebrows at the time the wall street banks sophisticated culture and emphasis on subsuming individual egos to the firms collective good seemed an odd mix with the headstrong mr fang who helped set up goldman rival morgan stanleys own joint venture chinese investment bank in the s an ambitious deal maker with an earthy manner mr fang saw his status rise considerably through his new association with yet another powerful wall street firm mr fang couldnt be reached for comment goldmans business may not take a hit if mr fang and the firm part ways while mr fang enjoys a reputation as a "rainmaker " or deals generator it is unclear how much business he has won for goldman since they joined forces some at the firm note that goldmans brand name carries more than enough clout to open doors and other goldman investment bankers such as fred hu have been instrumental in china deals many goldman senior executives particularly former chief executive henry paulson who now is treasury secretary have had close ties to the country goldman and mr fang appear to be aiming for an amicable separation it is unclear whether mr fangs securities firm which is believed to still owe goldman money it borrowed as part of the original deal would want to maintain its share in the joint venture and if so whether it might try to exercise control against goldmans will changing joint venture partners meanwhile also could be tricky business mr fang is believed to be seeking partners to invest in his private equity fund including temasek holdings pte ltd singapores state owned investment company a temasek representative said it was "inappropriate for us to comment on market rumors " according to a person familiar with the situation temasek has made no commitment to investing in a fund with mr fang any such investment would ordinarily need to be reviewed by a committee comprising temaseks senior investment officers goldmans most successful deal in china to date remains its &# billion purchase of a stake in industrial &amp commercial bank of china ltd the countrys biggest bank by assets on paper the value of that stake has risen several times over both messrs hu and fang have claimed credit for the deal a soldier during chinas cultural revolution mr fang later went to university in the southern province of guangdong and then served as a provincial government trade official before working his way up through positions at several chinese financial institutions in the s mr fang helped found china international capital corp which part owned by morgan stanley was the first joint venture investment bank established by a wall street firm in china while at cicc mr fang helped engineer several groundbreaking initial public offerings of stock by chinese state owned companies in new york and other overseas exchanges but he sometimes clashed with the firms u s managers in for example mr fang orchestrated an ipo by chinas biggest telecom company an offering that would be chinas first huge investment banking deal after morgan stanley bankers indicated scant interest mr fang helped arrange for goldman to be lead underwriter dealing morgan stanley an embarrassing blow morgan stanley retains a stake in cicc which remains one of chinas top investment banks but it exercises little influence over ciccs business the likely departure of mr fang from goldmans day to day business in china comes as the bank just starts getting traction as a share underwriter for chinas domestic markets this year goldman had its china debut as a lead underwriter by helping bank of ningbo co list on the shenzhen stock exchange in a deal that raised billion yuan &# million it also was one of three banks involved in a &# billion share offer from ping an insurance group co of china ltd in february
