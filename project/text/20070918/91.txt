the banker looks back the age of turbulence by alan greenspan the penguin press pages &# at one point during his long interview on " minutes" sunday evening alan greenspan could be seen autographing dollar bills for his smiling fans meanwhile off camera unautographed greenbacks continue to depreciate against a variety of metals and foreign currencies a century ago the pound sterling anticipated the dollars role today as the pre eminent global monetary brand but the pound was exchangeable into gold at the bearers demand not since has the dollar been collateralized by gold or exchangeable at the u s treasury into anything except nickels dimes and quarters sooner or later the dollar will lose its luster and finally its value as paper currencies always do striving to understand why people trusted it in the first place historians will naturally reach for the memoirs of the foremost central banker of his day but mr greenspans "the age of turbulence" will leave them just as confused as they ever were the first reports of the books contents trumpeted mr greenspans criticism of the current administrations spending habits and his approving sense that the iraq war had something to do with crude oil but the real news in "the age of turbulence" is what it reveals about the greenbacks to which mr greenspan affixed his celebrity signature and the ways in which the currency has been managed and especially mismanaged a more self knowing memoirist might have titled this book "the age of credulity " the great public drama of mr greenspans life is of course the work he performed as chairman of the federal reserve from to that work in all but name was price fixing it consisted and under his successor ben s bernanke still consists of setting an interest rate and shoving it down the throat of the worlds largest economy it is a mighty strange work for a "libertarian republican " as the maestro styles himself here let alone a former worshipful member of the inner circle of the radical individualist ayn rand "it did not go without notice " the author writes of his swearing in as chairman of the presidents council of economic advisers in "that ayn rand stood beside me as i took the oath of office in the presence of president ford in the oval office " the fantastic irony of mr greenspans career path from gold standard libertarian to federal interest rate fixer seems hardly to have registered on mr greenspan himself the closest he comes to acknowledging it is his description of how the fed looked to him from the outside it was he writes a "black box " having watched his mentor arthur burns struggle with the chairmanship mr greenspan notes "it did not seem like a job i felt equipped to do setting interest rates for an entire economy seemed to involve so much more than i knew " a deeper kind of libertarian might have added "maybe nobody can know enough to set interest rates for an entire economy " so mr greenspan a consulting economist of no special attainments on the eve of the stock market collapse he was quoted in the new york times saying "it is rare that you can be as unqualifiedly bullish as you can now" agreed to perform the impossible succeeding paul a volcker he became americas monetary central planner in all but name mr greenspan ruled the roost in fiscal quarters of which recession darkened only five under his direction the fed became a kind of first responder to the scene of financial and economic distress it soothed taut nerves following the stock market break nourished a crisis ridden banking system with cheap money in helped to lead the clinton administrations rescue of the mexican economy in and engineered the so called soft landing of the u s economy also in it famously trimmed its interest rate three times during the long term capital management crisis of succeeding so well in one artfully timed intervention that the stock market in the final hour of a single session leapt by and the market kept right on leaping all the way to the nasdaqs own mount everest in march one of those rare recessions followed after which came the campaign to scotch what mr greenspan was pleased to call "deflation " to fend off the peril of low and lower everyday prices the fed pressed its interest rate all the way down to in and kept it there until mid now it was house prices that went into orbit they were just beginning to return to earth when mr greenspan retired from public life readers who got one of the fancy new teaser rate mortgages in or and who have lived to rue the day are unlikely to find much nourishment in mr greenspans discussion of the theory of financial bubbles or in his self exculpating account of the feds role in financing them with artificially low interest rates nobody can identify a bubble as it is inflating mr greenspan has long insisted though as you will not read in these pages mr greenspan was so certain that he detected a stock market bubble in that he tried to prick it by pushing interest rates up strangely the authors bubble sensor failed him later in the decade he did in utter the innocuous phrase "irrational exuberance " but that was as far as he went in attacking sky high equity valuations mr greenspan now writes that the enlightened central banker will let speculation take its course following the inevitable blow up he will clean up the mess with low interest rates and lots of freshly printed dollar bills thereby gassing up a new bubble only one of the troubles with this prescription is that it requires an enlightened central banker to carry it out nowhere in this book does mr greenspan own up to his role of underestimating the severity of the credit troubles of or of cheering on the tech stock frenzy in or of dangling the most beguiling teaser rate of all during the mortgage frolics of i e that federal funds rate in february only months before the fed started to raise its rate in a speech titled "understanding household debt obligations " mr greenspan demonstrated next to no understanding his advice to american homeowners was not that they lock in a fixed rate mortgage while the locking was good but rather that they consider an adjustable rate model he who set the rates got it backward an only child of divorced parents growing up in new york city in the s mr greenspan had seemed destined for better things than a career in interest rate manipulation he was an exceptional clarinetist a morse code enthusiast and the developer of a personal system for scoring baseball games the boy who would date barbara walters marry nbcs andrea mitchell and be knighted by the queen of england was above all things lucky in a dark spot on the x ray of his lung made him undraftable he spent the late war years in the reed section of the henry jerome orchestra luck still with him he gravitated to economics thence to ayn rand and thence what could rand have thought to the security of the federal payroll admirers or detractors of mr greenspans central banking record will turn the pages of the first half of this book the story of his life his loves and his economics without once having to stifle a yawn but few will remain alert while toiling through the public policy ruminations that pad out the final pages as fed chairman mr greenspan had a habit of inflicting on captive audiences his not always original views on such topics as rural electrification education in a global economy and the bright promise of technology such ponderations are no more scintillating now that he is out of office "as fed chairman " mr greenspan writes "i was queried by fellow central bankers with large holdings of u s dollars about whether dollars were safe investments " the monetary bureaucrats will find no reassurance in these all too many pages mr grant is the editor of grants interest rate observer
