chinas state controlled mercantilist sins zachary karabell insists "watch out for the china bashers " editorial page sept that if you object to chinas mercantilist trade policies you must be a protectionist " rubbish the only real protectionist is china china grossly manipulates its currency which acts as a stiff tariff on u s goods violating world trade organization regulations it lavishes a broad array of illegal subsidies on its export industries rampant piracy provides additional cost advantages to chinese producers who save on r&amp d marketing and it costs meanwhile chinas pathetic environmental and health and safety standards have turned china into the most polluted and dangerous place in the world to work such lax standards also provide additional cost advantages mr karabell insists that chinas protectionist policies are just fine because consumers pay less for cheap chinese goods he conveniently neglects to note the high hidden costs of chinese mercantilism in jobs lost a significantly weakened american economy and rising product safety concerns mr karabell insists without resort to facts or logic that the "uproar over the toys isnt really about product safety " well tell that to the millions of american parents who know that lead isnt one of the four major food groups to feed their kids mr karabell also insists that "the actual number of faulty products is proportionate to how much it produces " in fact china has a higher rate of product and contamination problems than other countries relative to its market share across a wide range of goods and foodstuffs peter navarro business professor university of california irvine irvine calif i find amusing the castigation of "china bashers" on the foundation of capitalism while never mentioning that china is a communist country somehow a communist nation controlling the worlds manufacturing platform along with a huge monetary reserve and the fastest growing economy is much less of a threat than a s era economically suppressed soviet block type of system also i would like mr karabell to explain to me how our country can compete with a communist system that he claims is capitalist when chinas currency is controlled and many companies are state owned and subsidized are we to expect that american companies can compete with slave labor wages no benefit costs lax pollution controls and government collusion george gotch gainesville fla mr karabell is correct in pointing out that the american economy faces a host of problems some explicitly related to the economic rise of china his analysis goes astray however when he paints all political responses to the "china problem" with the same brush there are palpable differences in the protectionist approach adopted by sens chuck schumer and lindsey graham and the constructive responsible approach proposed by sens charles grassley and max baucus one proposes unilateral non wto compliant across the board tariffs the other aims to bolster the u s government and international organizations mandate to deal with complex economic issues furthermore mr karabell incorrectly states that the grassley baucus bill sets a "free floating currency" as the benchmark for currency manipulation in fact the bill targets "misaligned currencies" based on their value not currency regime choice its not as correct to say that the u s has a "china problem" as to say that it has a globalization problem while china may serve as the most convenient target for politicians the bills aimed at sanctioning china essentially serve as a proxy for growing public anxiety over a number of objective economic trends such as stagnant median wages and a rising u s trade and current account deficit in order to deal with these concerns the current debate must transcend the dualistic china is good bad dynamic and also address critical underlying issues such as reform of the nations social safety net innovation policy and international economic institutions erik tollefson seoul south korea
