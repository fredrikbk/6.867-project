mukasey leanings hard to decode independent streak evident in rulings backed patriot act washington during the trial of several conspirators who plotted to bomb new york city landmarks judge michael b mukasey issued a stiff year sentence for one defendant who was described by his attorney as a simple minded follower "people who are killed by people with limited capacity are just as dead " the judge replied today that attorney wesley serra says he admires mr mukasey despite the ruling "my guess is that judge mukaseys politics are very different than mine " mr serra says "but hes a very smart man he gave everyone a very fair trial and he is a man of integrity " yesterday mr mukasey years old was nominated to the post of attorney general to succeed alberto gonzales who resigned last month under a cloud a look at his years as a federal judge in new yorks southern district suggests he has a legal philosophy in line with the bush administration on issues from the patriot act to terrorism related detentions at the same time as the trial shows he has earned the respect of many including courtroom adversaries who call him independent minded and evenhanded "hell be a superb attorney general " says mary jo white a lawyer at debevoise &amp plimpton llp who served as u s attorney in the southern district from to "i think he will hit the ground running and be an instant shot in the arm for the morale and reputation" of the justice department not well known in washington mr mukasey carries little of the partisan political baggage that bedeviled his predecessor mr gonzales a friend and longtime adviser of the president how mr mukasey is treated during his confirmation hearings in congress will depend largely on what legislators learn from his years on the federal district court bench in new yorks southern district especially his rulings since the sept terrorist attacks democrats in congress say they want to find out more about him before scheduling hearings and staffers are now combing through his cases sen patrick leahy the vermont democrat who leads the senate judiciary committee said that in tandem with any hearings on mr mukaseys nomination he wants the white house to provide information his committee has requested on issues including surveillance programs and the firings of several u s attorneys controversies that damaged mr gonzales an administration official said the white house was working with sen leahy "the president certainly would hope that political issues or extraneous issues dont come in the way of swift confirmation of someone whos so qualified " the official said mr mukaseys record may be enough to win over skeptical conservatives who had been rooting for another candidate washington insider and former solicitor general theodore olson for example mr mukasey has defended the patriot act once saying the worst thing about it was its name one question mark is mr mukaseys lack of administrative experience many senior positions at the justice department are unfilled a consequence of the ill fated gonzales era and morale is low frank partnoy a law professor at the university of san diego who clerked for mr mukasey in the early s says such concerns are less important than his broad legal experience "his expertise spans virtually every area of the law from antitrust to terrorism to white collar to civil rights " mr partnoy said mr mukaseys position on the law is also hard to pin down at his chambers in new yorks historic foley square judge mukasey hung pictures of his personal heroes abraham lincoln george orwell and former supreme court justice robert h jackson known for espousing the philosophy of judicial restraint a core issue among political conservatives at the same time justice jackson wrote an influential concurrence in a case that serves as a check on executive authority one that has been the bane of the bush administration in october mr mukaseys courtroom a stones throw from the demolished world trade center was operating in secrecy randall hamud a san diego attorney recalls representing three men detained as material witnesses because they had known some of the hijackers in the sept attacks one of his clients osama awadallah complained of being beaten by guards mr hamud said he asked judge mukasey to order a medical examination "your client looks fine to me " mr hamud said the judge replied "you can file a lawsuit " in an interview mr hamud said mr mukaseys "objectivity succumbed to the passions of the moment and thats precisely when judges should refrain from succumbing to the passions of the moment " mr mukasey allowed mr awadallah to continue to be held without bond he was acquitted in late of charges that he lied to a grand jury mr mukasey didnt respond to requests for comment in mr mukasey allowed the government to continue using the material witness law to detain those believed to hold information important to terror cases some democrats including sen leahy have been critical of the governments use of the material witness law a year after that he made a decision in the case involving so called dirty bomber jose padilla ruling that the government could hold mr padilla as an enemy combatant the decision which was later overturned became a key post sept legal decision determining how the government could treat detainees democrats critical of the bush administrations approach to national security can find something to like in mr mukaseys record in the padilla ruling mr mukasey also ruled that the defendant should be allowed to see his lawyers overruling the administration "at the time it was a bold ruling " recalls donna newman one of mr padillas attorneys "the attitude then was if were wrong then fine at least were safe " ms newman said that while she disagrees with the former judges positions especially on sentencing the padilla ruling "demonstrates independent thought and concerns for the system " the government appealed the padilla ruling to the second u s circuit court of appeals in new york and lost the portion of the decision that allowed it to hold mr padilla as an enemy combatant in an opinion article published last month in the wall street journal mr mukasey argued that the padilla case which eventually ended with a conviction "shows why current institutions and statutes are not well suited to even the limited task of supplementing what became after sept principally a military effort to combat islamic terrorism " president bush named peter keisler an assistant attorney general who had previously announced plans to leave as acting attorney general while mr mukasey awaits senate confirmation
