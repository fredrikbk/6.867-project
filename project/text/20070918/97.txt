the new motorcycles bigger faster deadlier trend toward outsize power and lighter weight coincides with increase in fatalities bigger faster more powerful machines are helping to make the deadliest year yet for motorcycle riders say safety officials and a new insurance industry study in the past few years a horsepower battle in the cycle industry has produced bikes that have the power of a car but often weigh less than ever sophisticated suspension and braking systems and other electronics make them easy for inexperienced riders to handle up to a point but the bikes potential speed and violent acceleration can quickly overwhelm all but the most skilled riders these high performance machines often called "superbikes" or "supersports " accounted for less than of motorcycle registrations in but accounted for more than of rider fatalities according to data collected by the national highway traffic safety administration and analyzed in a study released last week by the insurance institute for highway safety the total number of rider deaths has more than doubled since at the current rate some safety experts say fatalities in could surpass the previous peak of set in superbike riders suffer much higher death rates than riders of other kinds of bikes and while superbikes still arent as popular as the larger more laid back cruiser style bikes made by harley davidson motor co such bikes have been one of the fastest growing segments of the industry they represented of the market in compared with for cruisers but superbike registrations jumped between and in addition to more powerful machines an influx of inexperienced riders is also helping to drive accident rates higher and as more middle age consumers return to motorcycling often after not having ridden for years or more more older riders are being killed in crashes another contributing factor a trend toward more liberal helmet laws "these guys start riding again in their s and dont realize that they arent the same physical specimens they were in their s " says david livingston director of the new jersey trauma center at university hospital in newark n j who has recently seen an increase in motorcycle related injuries "during june july and august about one in four patients hurt in traffic accidents have been motorcycle riders " he says motorcycles much like cars have gradually become more powerful and nimble over time but the more rapid run up in engine size and performance has occurred in only the past few years as overall sales of motorcycles have boomed new construction techniques and the widening availability of lightweight materials like carbon fiber and titanium "have made it easier to reduce weight and increase power cost effectively " says ted miller director of the pacific institute for research and evaluation a research group "the stoked sport bike " he says is a fairly new development bike makers across the industry are conspicuously boosting power italian manufacturer ducati motor holding earlier this year began selling the a superbike with horsepower a big jump from the horsepower the companys racy model put out years ago the bike has about as much power as a honda accord ex sedan bmw ags motorcycle unit had a reputation for building sedate bikes with less than horsepower until it rolled out the horsepower ks about three years ago even harley davidson long known for its slow cruising and touring models recently released the night rod special a fast low slung bike with a horsepower engine developed with sports car maker porsche ag in the late s and early s the last time motorcycle fatalities were this high the hottest bikes included machines like kawasaki motors corp s z a fearsome bike at the time its or so horsepower and total weight approaching pounds seem benign compared with the nearly horsepower generated by the companys new zx or rival bike maker suzuki motor corp s gsx r the suzuki weighs barely pounds with a full fuel tank and can accelerate to mph in about seconds it even comes with a switch so the rider can select low medium or high power settings other bikes have adopted electronically controlled brakes transmissions and traction control to keep the rear wheel from spinning out of control under acceleration many supersport bikes are actually built for racing in popular racing events like the american motorcyclist association superbike series riders use bikes that are modified versions of those available to the public at dealerships in order to compete in the races cycle manufacturers have to build hundreds of the bikes for sale to consumers the process called "homologation " is meant to guarantee that the bikes found on the track are roughly the same as those widely available to the public the bikes sold this way are sometimes touted as "race replicas" or "homologation specials " although a tripling of motorcycle sales over the past decade accounts for some of the rising death rate fatal motorcycle accidents have also risen proportionally over the time period of the iihs study from to the death rate for motorcyclists rose to deaths per registered motorcycles from in the same period the percentage of motorcycle deaths among all highway fatalities rose to from superbike riders had a death rate of for every registered motorcycles in riders or older accounted for of motorcycle fatalities compared with years earlier in the same period the fatality percentage for riders younger than years of age fell to from safety officials attribute this in part to a tendency of "returning" riders to overestimate their ability to handle the latest powerful bikes "you have a lot of people saying im in my s and i want to start riding motorcycles again " says daniel lonsdorf director of the wisconsin bureau of transportation safety "but these arent the same motorcycles they remember from years ago "
