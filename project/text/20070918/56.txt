new orleans museum of art heals the wounds of katrina new orleans as someone who has spent many years working in art museums im among those who have long argued for the power of art to remind us of essential human values if you think that sensibility has been waning of late try the new orleans museum of art for a reintroduction to basics as well as a crash course on post katrina issues that are far more complicated and nuanced than the citys more visible and horrific physical destruction founded in by isaac delgado a jamaican immigrant who became a millionaire sugar broker and who wanted a "temple of art for rich and poor alike " the museum sits in still beautifully lush city park the relatively simple neo classical building designed by chicago architect samuel marx was opened in and eschewing celebrity architecture subsequent additions have retained the elegant primacy of the original central wing developing an encyclopedic collection in a relatively small southern city has not been easy and yet appropriate to the citys heritage among the over works there are wonderful examples of french art by monet gauguin and of course degas painted in while he was visiting new orleans relatives as well as other european american african asian and pre columbian works the decorative arts collections are among the best displayed in the country with an exceptionally rich array of american and european glass and american art pottery the latter another local specialty newcomb pottery bucking the musical chairs trend that characterizes museum directorships the new orleans museum of art can also boast that its highly respected director john bullard has been at the helm for a record years beating out the metropolitan museum of arts philippe de montebello as americas longest serving art museum director sitting on slightly higher ground the museum was spared the most serious damage from katrinas winds and the breaching of the flood wall the plantings in the beautiful adjacent sydney and walda besthoff sculpture garden which opened in were not so lucky but serious damage was sustained by only one sculpture kenneth snelsons foot virlane tower a celebration of the artists engineering skills with delicately balanced steel tubes connected by taut cables that create a splendid floating composition all that finely calibrated engineering was no match for katrinas wind force but after a &# insurance covered repair job the snelson is back in place ironically it was when the flood waters began to recede that the museums troubles increased pressure from the rising water table forced cracks in the concrete foundation floors causing serious interior flooding in lower levels because power outages kept the sump pumps from working that the damage to the collection was only minimal is a tribute to the museums thoughtful preparatory measures devoted security guards stayed on duty throughout despite total lack of communication with the outside world a skeletal staff of only employees eventually battled their way through a city under siege from both weather damage and national guard troops ensuring the ultimate safety of the collections and then spending days bailing several feet of water from the basement subsequently the museums insurer axa paid for retired new york city police officers to occupy the building for several months happily almost none of that is now visible to nomas visitors and amazingly the museum has been able to maintain its illusion of normality with a staff of pre katrina there were and an operating budget for this year of just over half its pre katrina &# million demonstrating continuing strong city support and a loyal membership that understands the museum as a vital part of the regions recovery these museum stalwarts soldier on because they understand that the art museum can bring added value to the injured lives of new orleanians wound salving that may be more critical for locals than for tourists the traditional french quarter with its honky tonk attractions looks intact but feels sadly underpopulated reservations at the best restaurants are now easily available so a convention visitor might even wonder what all the fuss about katrina was about the ability of a semitropical climate to make everything look lush and green is too happy a mask for what is actually a series of endless tragedies optimists speak of "opportunities" even whats left of the lower ninth ward is largely hidden by acres of profuse green weeds the ghoulish may find that picturesque those of us who are day trippers end up feeling guilty about our obvious voyeurism ive always found an art museum visit to be the ideal escape from whatever oppressive realities might be confronting me kudos to this museum for maintaining that illusion as a reminder of how community based the museum has always been membership at is almost back up to pre katrina numbers and high category memberships are actually increasing despite half the museums volunteer corps still being displaced most of them maintain their memberships from afar disasters can tear people apart or bring them together the initial shock of confronting todays new orleans is not just about numbers deaths homes destroyed displaced lives but about the fact that two years after americas worst natural disaster people are still trying to pick themselves up and rebuild not just their physical surroundings but their still fragile psyches disasters also remind people of essentials what really matters in their lives the new orleans museum of art might well serve as an inspiration for those of our museums that have grown fat and self satisfied forgetting their missions of protecting the public patrimony and providing education pleasure and even diversion for their visitors its still too early to say how this will ultimately play out director bullard insists that "we are not going to admit defeat in fact we are going to make the museum bigger and better than what it was before " yet this is a city plagued not only by physical destruction but by personal stress depression and pessimism not easily alleviated in a city with almost nonexistent mental health services the new orleans museum of art is a microcosm of the regions woes three senior staffers who returned have now decided to leave because of serious damage to their homes and family life but mr bullard describes the museum as now being "beyond recovery" with plans for a major capital program for which the louisiana state legislature has already approved &# million many of our other museums are capitalizing their collections setting auction records with what used to be thought of as public patrimony while engaging celebrity architects to design destination buildings that reflect a lack of confidence in those increasingly raided collections buildings that will require unsustainable amounts of money to run concurrently the lure of the for profit worlds salary structure is attracting museum workers who would rather make big bucks than beg for contributions from those who have already made them but at the post katrina new orleans museum of art there are other priorities all of which are reminders of what used to be the primary activities of most museums two years after katrina this museum might well be the most vibrant silver lining in the big easys still hovering cloud mr freudenheim a former art museum director served as the assistant secretary for museums at the smithsonian institution
