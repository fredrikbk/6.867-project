discount rate is also on the feds table washington when the federal reserve meets today a cut in its main short term interest rate target the federal funds rate wont be the only thing on the table officials will also have to decide what action to take on the lesser known discount rate at which banks borrow directly from the fed normally banks pay a "penalty" to borrow from the feds discount window of one percentage point over the target for the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another in a market heavily influenced by the fed banks seldom borrow at the discount window because they can borrow federal funds more cheaply the direct loans also have carried a stigma because they were often a last resort for troubled banks on aug in a bid to improve the flow of cash to clogged credit markets the fed cut the discount rate to a penalty of half a percentage point above the federal funds target it also extended the term of such loans to as long as days from one day and declared that using them would be regarded as a sign of strength not weakness its hope was that banks would use discount loans or the knowledge that they were available to finance customer holdings of hard to sell securities such as asset backed commercial paper and jumbo mortgages many on wall street feel the fed has yet to make the discount window attractive the actual penalty they note is larger than the normal half point because the fed has allowed the federal funds rate to fall to a quarter point below its target many market participants recommend that the fed cut the discount rate so it sits just a quarter point above the fed funds rate or even matches it david greenlaw chief fixed income economist at morgan stanley said that while he doubts the fed is about to make such a move it could take the place of a deeper cut in the fed funds rate that the fed fears could look like a bailout of investors peter hooper chief economist at deutsche bank securities said the fed could compromise by cutting the fed funds rate a quarter point and the discount rate a half point mr hooper said the problem in the money markets is that banks which normally lend and borrow for as long as days now do so for only a single day or a few days at a time "its difficult for banks to have to roll over all of their funds every day its manageable but if something interrupts this funding whether a crisis of confidence or because of a major failure youre much closer to the edge " the fed could limit that risk by encouraging banks to get day discount loans wall street officials say they are still reluctant to borrow at the discount window because if their identity became known it could make counterparties skittish or hurt share prices if the penalty were cut or eliminated they say banks could argue they were using the window because it was profitable discount window loans have typically been about a few hundred million dollars each week after the feds aug changes loans jumped to &# billion mostly the result of four banks each publicly announcing a &# million loan in hopes of eradicating the stigma last week the total jumped to &# billion which money market participants attribute to a technical shortage of funds related to the feds management of bank reserve balances that jump might reassure fed officials that banks are overcoming the stigma of borrowing from the discount window negating the need for lowering the penalty officials also worry that cutting the discount rate too much would prompt many banks to fund all of their needs from the window instead of the money market that could make it harder for the fed to manage the fed funds rate with open market operations
