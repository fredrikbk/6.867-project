a century after his death a jules verne revival before his career took off like a rocket to the moon jules verne was a stockbroker and he is said to have made a boast to his pals at the paris exchange "ive just written a new kind of novel and if it succeeds it will be an unexplored gold mine in that case ill write more such books while youre buying your stock and i think ill earn the most money " vernes friends may have laughed but they would have been wise to invest in the budding author his first book "five weeks in a balloon " was published in and it provided a taste of what would come within a decade verne wrote several of the worlds greatest tales of scientific adventure "journey to the center of the earth " " leagues under the sea " and one of the best selling novels of all time "around the world in days " these titles have never been out of print and they remain popular among readers who marvel at vernes knack for storytelling he invented iconic characters such as captain nemo and phileas fogg fans also credit him with an uncanny ability to anticipate future events and technologies everything from the apollo space program to cellphones what verne probably couldnt have predicted was his revival a century after his death in yet were in the midst of a verne renaissance brought on by new manuscripts improved translations and scholarly reassessments biographies by william butcher and herbert r lottman have helped too the trends latest manifestation is tomorrows publication of "lighthouse at the end of the world " by the university of nebraska press more precisely its the first english translation of this minor work from vernes original manuscript it had previously appeared only in a form posthumously altered by vernes son michel who was guilty of perhaps nothing more than trying to extend the commercial life of the family jules critics disagree about which version is better but in truth neither shows off verne at the top of his game when long gone authors enjoy new respect however their most obscure books come back into view which is precisely whats happening to the prolific verne last year nebraska released "the meteor hunt" and next year it plans to put out "the golden volcano " wesleyan university press is issuing its own set of rarities including "the kip brothers " which had never appeared in english before a few months ago yet the main problem for translations of verne hasnt been scarcity but quality unesco ranks verne as one of the planets most translated authors along with agatha christie and whoever wrote the bible oftentimes however readers have had to settle for hackwork without even realizing it "most of the standard english translations were bowdlerized " says arthur b evans a depauw university professor who has studied the texts "they suffered from errors abridgment and even censorship " in "the mysterious island " a semi sequel to " leagues " verne observes that "the british yoke had weighed perhaps too heavily on the hindu population " a popular translation into english actually reverses the meaning of this comment the people of india are described as full of "ignorance and gross superstition" and their colonial masters as having "brought them out of a state of anarchy and constant warfare and misery " many translations werent exercises in political correctness instead they were slapdash efforts to dumb down the prose verne always has had a reputation as an author of books for boys and therefore as a writer sophisticated readers were supposed to outgrow it didnt help that disney world once featured an attraction based on " leagues " complete with an attack by a giant squid one of the reasons for vernes initial popularity in france sprang from the fact that parents saw his stories as educational tools in this sense "journey to the center of the earth" is a geology lesson embedded in a potboiler verne isnt merely a figure from the early days of science fiction but a founding father of a subgenre known as "hard sf " because it emphasizes technological accuracy and scientific detail whereas many science fiction writers set their stories in the distant future verne typically placed his in the present a significant exception involves one of the first novels he ever wrote his editor actually rejected it and the manuscript lay hidden in a safe until when vernes great grandson hired a locksmith to crack it the subsequent publication of "paris in the twentieth century" showed that vernes editor was probably smart to snub the story it isnt a gripping page turner and its bleak view of scientific progress contrasts with the optimism of vernes best books despite its dystopian sensibility it was a literary time capsule and readers were fascinated by its vision of cars powered by gas and computers linked by telegraph "paris in the twentieth century" fueled vernes reputation as a prophet and there apparently arent any major gripes with the translation something that still cant be said for many of the verne titles commonly sold today mr evans of depauw recommends the oxford university press translations by mr butcher who is also the translator of nebraskas "lighthouse at the end of the world " in his introduction to the new book mr butcher speculates that verne was drawn to the image of a lighthouse at the forsaken tip of south america because late in life he was going blind thanks to efforts such as mr butchers however its now possible for the rest of us to see verne more clearly than ever before mr miller writes for national review
