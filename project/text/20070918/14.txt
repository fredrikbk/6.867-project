can cranberries treat bacterial infections cranberry juice has long been used to treat urinary tract infections but marketers of cranberry drinks and cranberry flavored dental hygiene products say researchers have found cranberries combat a wide range of bacteria including those that cause stomach ulcers gum disease and food borne illnesses scientists say the research is interesting but preliminary the cranberrys much reputed role in preventing and treating urinary tract infections had long been attributed to its acidity more recent research suggests that astringent compounds in the berry called proanthocyanidins may actually be working to prevent infection causing bacteria from adhering to cells in the urinary tract that realization has led to studies to see if the cranberry can keep bacteria at bay in other areas of the body a chinese study looked at patients infected with the ulcer causing h pylori the bacteria was eradicated in of patients who drank two eight ounce boxes of cranberry juice daily compared with only who drank a placebo drink but a patient study published earlier this year found that when patients are treated with antibiotics adding cranberry juice to the regime didnt result in a statistically significant difference in eradicating bacteria compared with those who were on a placebo drink "the cranberry does something but it doesnt come close to what antibiotics can do " says study author itzhak ofek a scientist at tel aviv university researchers did find cranberry juice boosted the antibiotics effect in women but so far it isnt known why both studies were supported by ocean spray cranberries inc of lakeville mass several studies have suggested that ingredients in cranberries may help prevent cavities or gum disease but most of the work has been in the laboratory not in humans for example two studies published last year by canadian researchers found a specially prepared cranberry extract inhibited the cellular process that lead to gum disease dental products infused with cranberry include cleure toothpaste and mouthwash sold by grace products inc of camarillo calif and dental floss sold by radius inc of kutztown pa so far none of these products has published trials to back them "youd have to do a clinical trial" to see if the results from the lab tests have real significance in humans says gary hildebrant clinical associate professor of dentistry at the university of minnesota school of dentistry in minneapolis scientists are also finding that mixing cranberry extract with meat or fish can reduce levels of dangerous bacteria in a study presented at a food industry trade group this summer university of maine researcher vivian chi hua wu found adding cranberry extract to ground beef deliberately contaminated with e coli significantly reduced the amount of bacteria after five days compared with a control sample the reasons it works are so far unknown says dr wu an assistant professor of food safety and microbiology a hamburger containing cranberry extract amounting to of its weight was well tolerated by testers dr wu says but when the cranberry mix reached some people didnt like the flavor if you can stomach oregano with cranberries that combination might be even more effective according to research at the university of massachusetts oregano has been shown independently to have antimicrobial activity but all the work on food safety is still preliminary and even if adding cranberry really does work it may not be enough "you still have to cook burgers to degrees fahrenheit and use proper refrigeration " dr wu says email aches wsj com
