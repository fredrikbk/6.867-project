ahead of the tape surprises loom regardless of feds move no matter what the federal reserve does somebody is in for a surprise the fed is expected to cut the target rate it sets for overnight loans between banks today but by how much is an open question although most firms are looking for a quarter point cut to a significant minority including goldman sachs and merrill lynch are looking for a half point futures that price off of interest rate expectations suggest that investors are evenly divided between a quarter point and a half point reduction that means that if the central bank follows the base case cutting by a quarter point there will be plenty of investors who think it is behind the curve if it cuts by a half point some wall streeters may worry that things are worse than they look a half point cut also would raise hackles among those who think the fed shouldnt bail out speculators who took on too much risk and lost if the fed cuts its overnight federal funds target rate by a quarter point it could cut the rate that it charges banks to borrow money at its discount window by more as a signal to market participants that it stands ready to prevent credit markets from seizing up many market participants expect a large discount rate cut but there is a caveat that the fed might find too large to ignore if such a cut leads to a substantial increase in borrowing at the discount window the influx of cash onto banks reserve balances could push the federal funds rate well below its target perhaps investors would be better off today by not overthinking about the fed and instead ask the bigger question is the economy on the cusp of recession if it is there will be many more fed cuts and profit disappointments to come if it isnt then it might be a fine time to buy will lehmans earnings shed light on its lbo debt lbo may soon become a four letter word for lehman brothers holdings the wall street firm is stuck with more leveraged buyout debt relative to its size than any of its rivals according to a study released last week by fitch ratings lehman has committed to provide &# billion of debt in connection with the top pending lbos the fitch study says though there are three other firms ahead of lehman led by citigroup they all are banks that have much larger balance sheets than the new york securities firm as a percentage of its shareholders equity lehmans commitments on the same deals amount to a huge that is leaps and bounds ahead of the other wall street firms none of which is even close to the next largest is deutsche bank at fitchs numbers are estimates as lehman and the other banks have left the true size of their commitments to themselves fitchs view is consistent with the view of many on wall street that the collapse of the buyout financing market will weigh more heavily on lehman than on its peers whether that assessment is fair or not investors may finally find out this morning that is when lehman will report its third quarter results it also will answer investor questions on its first conference call since the storm in credit markets began this summer dana cimilluca email to justin lahart wsj com and dana cimilluca wsj com
