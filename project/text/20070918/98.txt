the right to dry a green movement is roiling america clothesline has neighbors bent out of shape in bend an illegal solar device bend ore it was a sunny degree day here in awbrey butte an exclusive neighborhood of big modern houses surrounded by native pines to susan taylor it was a perfect time to hang her laundry out to dry the year old mother and part time nurse strung a clothesline to a tree in her backyard pinned up some freshly washed flannel sheets and with that became a renegade the regulations of the subdivision in which ms taylor lives effectively prohibit outdoor clotheslines in a move that has torn apart this otherwise tranquil community the developments managers have threatened legal action to the developer and many residents clotheslines evoke the urban blight they sought to avoid by settling in the oregon mountains "this bombards the senses " interior designer joan grundeman says of her neighbors clothesline "it cant possibly increase property values and make people think this is a nice neighborhood " ms taylor and her supporters argue that clotheslines are one way to fight climate change using the sun and wind instead of electricity "days like this i can do multiple loads and within two hours its done " said ms taylor "it smells good and it feels different than when it comes out of the dryer " the battle of awbrey butte is an unanticipated consequence of increasing environmental consciousness pitting the burgeoning right to dry movement against community standards across the country the clothesline was once a ubiquitous part of the residential landscape but as postwar americans embraced labor saving appliances clotheslines came to be associated with people who couldnt afford a dryer now they are a rarity purged from the suburban landscape by legally enforceable development restrictions nationwide about million people now live in about "association governed" communities most of which restrict outdoor laundry hanging says frank rathbun spokesman for the community associations institute an alexandria va group that lobbies on behalf of homeowners associations but the rules are costly to the environment and to consumers clothesline advocates argue clothes dryers account for of total electricity consumed by u s households third behind refrigerators and lighting according to the residential energy consumption survey by the federal energy information administration it costs the typical household &# a year to run a standard electric dryer according to a calculation by e source cos in boulder colo which advises businesses on reducing energy consumption alexander lee founder of clothesline advocacy group project laundry list in concord n h says the clothesline movement is "an outgrowth of interest in what can i do environmentalism " mr lee says he gets more and more email seeking advice on how to hang a clothesline despite neighborhood covenants restricting them ten states including nevada and wisconsin limit homeowners associations ability to restrict the installation of solar energy systems or assign that power to local authorities says erik j a swenson a washington d c based partner at law firm king &amp spalding llp who has written about the policies he says its unclear in most of these states whether clotheslines qualify as "solar" devices only the laws in florida and utah expressly include clotheslines in prescott ariz jessie bourke a year old mother of two grown children strung her first outdoor clothesline this past spring "i had been thinking about it a long time " she says "we live in northern arizona and it gets hot here " using a dryer started to seem absurd she says recalling the deed restrictions she and her husband signed when they bought their house years ago she decided to install a clothesline under her deck in the backyard "i dont want my neighbors to be offended if they see laundry hanging out " she says she has been using it several times a week kelly guess a mother of two teenage children who lives on a golf course development in holly springs n c uses a retractable clothesline that she tucks behind a wall when its not in use "im definitely breaking the covenants " she admits ms taylor in bend had always used a clothesline before moving to the subdivision in awbrey buttes covenants conditions and restrictions established by local developer brooks resources corp require that "clothes drying apparatus shall be screened from view " not an easy task in a community where fencing is also "discouraged" in the covenants the clothesline ban gave ms taylor pause when she moved here she says but she and her husband decided they could live with it then in may she heard an environmental lawyer on the radio who "talked about this narrow window of opportunity for us to respond to global warming " ms taylor recalls "i said dang it thats it my clothesline is going up " then the trouble started one neighbor asked if it was temporary next came a phone call and then a series of letters from brooks resources the first letter dated june warned that "laundry lines are not permitted in the awbrey butte subdivision " adding that "many owners in awbrey butte take great pride in their home and surrounding areas " ms taylor responded two days later with a letter asserting that the rule is "outdated " she requested a change in the rules to "reflect our urgent need and responsibility to help global warming by encouraging energy conservation " the awbrey butte architectural review committee "appreciates your desire to make a difference for the cause of global warming " responded brooks resources owner relations manager carol haworth but she pointed out that homeowners agree to the rules before they buy their homes "and therefore the arc is required to uphold those guidelines as they now exist " the letter more sternly asked "that you discontinue this practice by july to avoid legal action which will be taken after that date " ms taylor responded by pointing out that the subdivision is "blatantly full of noncompliant owners" who display everything from plastic play equipment to exterior paint colors that dont meet the requirement of "medium to dark tones " she added "who am i hurting by hanging clothes out to dry " brooks resources repeated its threat of legal action and then advised ms taylor to "develop a plan to screen your outdoor laundry and submit the plan to the arc for review " it also suggested the possibility of formal proceedings to get the rules amended which would require of homeowners support in writing the following month ms taylor constructed a fabric screen to conceal her clothesline the committee which included brooks resources chairman michael p hollern gave it a thumbs down "it doesnt blend with the home or the native surroundings " says ms haworth mr hollern says "personally i think people probably ought to screen their laundry from other peoples view if you feel differently you should probably be living somewhere else " many neighbors agree when ms grundeman first noticed the taylor clothesline she assumed it was temporary "my first thought was oh gosh her dryer must have broken " says the interior designer then it became a regular occurrence and she called brooks resources to complain ms taylor does have supporters "i dont think its unsightly " says john mclaughlin a former sporting goods executive who lives down the street from ms taylor "i like the values that go along with it " he says he may hang his own clothesline facing the threat of legal action ms taylor has in recent days resorted to hanging the laundry in her garage with the door open slightly but she says that denies her laundry the direct benefits of the sun and the fresh mountain air she is thinking of moving to a less restrictive neighborhood see related letters "letters to the editor hanging out in the neighborhood" wsj sept
