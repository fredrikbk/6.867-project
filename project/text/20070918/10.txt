business technology best of the business tech blog excerpts from recent entries at wsj coms tech blog disaster plan study finds firms less prepared than they think one would think that after all of this decades hurricanes floods and terror attacks companies would have adequate disaster recovery plans but theres a good chance they dont most of the software that a business depends on everything from email to sales automation to the systems that process online orders runs on computers located in a companys data center you would think that having a backup plan in case something goes wrong with the data center would be a top priority and in fact of tech leaders surveyed by forrester research inc said that their companies are "prepared" or "very prepared" for a disaster but their practices tell another story stephanie balaouras the analyst who led the survey says twenty seven percent of the companies surveyed dont have a backup data center these arent rinky dink companies with limited resources the survey was limited to companies with over employees of the companies that do have backup facilities of those backups are located within miles of the primary facility ms balaouras says that miles was the smallest distance she included in her survey a decision she now regrets because she has talked to companies that have a backup facility across the street from the primary one thats fine if the reason the primary data center goes down is a broken pipe but it wont help a company survive a natural disaster "a backup center should be far enough away so that it isnt subjected to the same regional threat " ms balaouras says the news gets worse forty percent of companies only practice disaster recovery procedures once a year and dont test their plans at all "unless you test your plan a lot the chances are you wont be able to execute in a real disaster " ms balaouras says ms balaouras thinks one reason businesses havent invested more in their data recovery plans is that they dont think its a worthwhile investment business people dont want to spend money on an it project unless its likely to cut costs or add revenue a backup plan does neither until disaster strikes an it litmus test do you know what the heck your companys information technology people are talking about its easy to justify not understanding its latest project on the grounds that youre not a techie but whether you can understand turns out to be good way to tell if it is doing its job a good it department should be able to explain its projects in language that the average business person understands says andrew baer cio at comcast corp for example comcasts billing software was written back when the companys customer was someone who subscribed to cable television and needed to be sent a monthly bill but the business has changed comcast now sells movies provides internet service to businesses and has one of the most visited web sites in the country these are new kinds of relationships with new kinds of business partners some of whom should be considered customers certainly balancing the ledger is now more complicated than just sending a bill to cable subscribers mr baer says a good it department should be able to describe the business problem in this case that the companys definition of a customer is changing and explain that the project its working on will update the systems to reflect that if instead the it guys start talking about a new data warehouse that can rationalize customer records it might be time to worry says mr baer
