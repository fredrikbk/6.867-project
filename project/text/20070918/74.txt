politics &amp economics how mecca uprising helped give birth to al qaeda new book documents u s participation in mosque siege the wave of islamist violence that culminated in the sept attacks can be traced to a sunny november morning almost years ago then hundreds of islamist radicals from several countries seized at gunpoint islams holiest shrine the grand mosque of mecca with nearly pilgrims inside this first ever operation of global jihad an inspiration to al qaedas future outrages sought to spark a world wide clash of civilizations and restore the glory of islam as the rebels turned the mosques minarets into sniper nests saudi arabias shaken royal family imposed a near total news blackout and sent in the troops the siege lasted two weeks crushing the rebels who were led by saudi preacher juhayman al uteybi required the use of artillery heavy armor and poison gas as well as assistance from the central intelligence agency and french commandos hundreds if not thousands of people paid with their lives osama bin laden whose family had constructed much of the mosque has cited the bloodbath as a major reason for turning against the house of saud a new book by wall street journal foreign correspondent yaroslav trofimov tells the story of this drama and of the world wide upheaval it presaged the excerpt below shows how americans were involved from the first days of the crisis on both sides of the barricades when the shooting began at dawn on nov american diplomats stationed in jiddah picked up the first signs of trouble from anxious danish and british legations the european diplomats had found themselves unable to communicate with their capitals saudi arabias king khaled eager to keep the news of unthinkable violence in the sacred mosque secret had just cut off all of saudi arabias phone links with the outside world intrigued political officer mark hambley a rare arabic speaker among american diplomats in saudi arabia began making inquiries of his own saudi contacts in a position to know were either impossible to track down or proffered highly implausible answers "theres nothing going on in mecca " said one "its just a training exercise " assured another "there is a typhoid outbreak " went the most imaginative reply in different circumstances an american diplomat or cia agent would have hopped into a car and driven to the scene of reported unrest just one hours ride away but though tantalizingly close mecca is a forbidden ground for non muslims and in neither the cia station nor the american embassy in saudi arabia employed any muslims who possessed the required security clearances and could be entrusted with such a mission as a frustrated mr hambley kept scouring for tidbits of news from the holy city his phone rang the man on the other end of the line had an unfamiliar voice and he spoke with an american accent "i know you you dont know me " he said "i have information of great interest " whatever he knew was too sensitive to be discussed on an open phone line probably tapped by saudi intelligence the caller however was ready to meet a short time later at jiddahs sands hotel mr hambley rushed to meet him once the diplomat entered the lobby the mystery caller started out by establishing his bona fides as mr hambleys distant cousin after a stint flying uh "huey" choppers in vietnam the cousin drawn by saudi arabias lucrative expatriate pay had moved to the kingdom and now piloted the heavy twin rotor chinook helicopters for the saudi civil defense he had been told through the family grapevine that mr hambley was also posted in the kingdom now he told the startled diplomat it seemed like a good time to establish contact he and fellow american pilots of the civil defense had been roused that morning at at the helicopter wings jiddah base the urgent order was to fly to mecca and to pick up two saudi intelligence officers for a reconnaissance sortie the chinook reached the grand mosque by a m the pilot said the shrine clearly seemed to be under control of a rebel group on the second overflight at around a m as the chinook approached the northeast corner of the mosque three rifle shots were fired by the rebels who would improve their aim with every such overflight the aircraft surged skyward performing evasive maneuvers the pilot had brought several photographs from the battle scene this was evidently not a typhoid outbreak mr hambley realized he held in his hands a piece of intelligence that would provide american policy makers with reliable information about the drama at islams holiest shrine the pilot who would repeatedly come under fire and ferry wounded troops in following days agreed to provide daily updates that were forwarded to washington through classified cables what american pilots flying in mecca didnt know at the time is that the gunmen who fired at them from below included americas own citizens converted to a violent brand of uncompromising islam saudi arabia has been reaching out to the african american community ever since malcolm x went on a hajj to mecca in abandoning the nation of islam for more mainstream muslim faith in the late s hundreds of black radicals including some former black panthers flocked to saudi funded islamic academies in the u s and in the kingdom itself a handful followed juhayman al uteybi into the grand mosque in november putting to use the skills of urban guerrilla warfare that they had learned at home almost a week into the battle for the grand mosque the saudi armys american made m armored personnel carriers pushed deeper and deeper into the shrine thats when one of the african american converts remembered a recipe from "the anarchist cookbook " fellow rebels recall pilgrims had abandoned hundreds of glass bottles by the holy spring of zam zam under the mosque the american convert taught how to turn them into molotov cocktails as one of the saudi m s tried to drive in through blasted out gates its antenna got stuck in the frame rebels who lurked nearby seized their opportunity thrusting rolled carpets into the threads of the armored personnel carrier they locked the vehicle in place then as fellow rebels recall one of the americans jumped on the roof igniting the fuse he opened the hatch and threw a flaming molotov cocktail inside seconds later the insides of the apc turned into a blazing oven the unlucky crew was carbonized in a flash of fire gunmen rejoiced with a powerful cry of "allahu akbar " the american embassy became aware of such participation in the mecca uprising by at least two african american converts only on dec four days after saudi security forces finally overran the sacred compound this embarrassing information had been kept under wraps by the american and saudi governments alike on dec u s ambassador john c west met with interior minister prince nayef to discuss american security help in the mecca affair and to inquire about the fate of the two americans one of them prince nayef replied according to mr wests diary was "definitely a terrorist" and no longer alive the second american was still under investigation "i believe that means a head will be lopped but thats the best we can do " ambassador west jotted down dryly at a follow up meeting with the american ambassador on jan prince nayef who still serves as saudi arabias interior minister today mentioned again that the second american suspect remained in custody ambassador west was surprised "i thought he had been hanged last week " the envoy wrote that day in his diarys last entry on the issue in fact most of the adult male rebels caught in the mosque were executed either in public beheadings in january or in secret in following months but according to american officials deployed in saudi arabia at the time the second prisoner was spared the executioners sword after a debriefing by u s officials he was allowed to return home to the u s a free citizen once again after all one former diplomat recalls he had broken no u s law adapted from "the siege of mecca " by yaroslav trofimov copyright by mr trofimov published by doubleday a division of random house inc used by
