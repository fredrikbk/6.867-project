the daily fix eagles lose to redskins in nfc east showdown online edition not that philadelphia fans need a reason to boo but last night the eagles gave the fans filling lincoln financial field plenty of reason to express their displeasure a week after they handed the green bay packers a victory thanks to two muffed punt returns the eagles failed to score a touchdown en route to a lost to the washington redskins that dropped them to interestingly they are the fifth team that made the playoffs last year to fall to "a few years ago the eagles started the season with two losses both at home to tampa bay and new england " writes the philadelphia inquirers phil sheridan "at the time those were the two most recent super bowl winners this is different this is worse these eagles lost a game they should have won at green bay then lost a game they should have won to washington " the eagles now have lost six of the last seven games donovan mcnabb has started "maybe it is too soon to judge mcnabb fully this season he isnt even one year removed from his knee operation yet but the tendencies that were merely annoying against the packers blossomed into a full fledged headache in the shocking loss last night " inquirers bob ford writes the philadelphia daily newss rich hofmann offers up this piece of advice to eagles fans "deep breaths now there you go the eagles season is not over really it isnt if the eagles are going to pull themselves together it is going to be a long brutal slog " but while the eagles are the washington redskins join such teams as the detroit lions the san francisco ers and the houston texans at though the season is still very young the washington posts michael wilbon points out "through two games the redskins have played contentious defense run with power and purpose made field goals and demonstrated in two close games something that actually resembles willfulness all characteristics of every good joe gibbs team over time " the washington timess dan daly figures the ball just might be bouncing the redskins way this season last week they won the coin toss at the start of overtime against the dolphins and proceeded to march down the field for a winning field goal "last night it was the comedy of errors at the end of the first half the three yard penalties that had the redskins retreating from the philadelphia to the that suggested better times might be ahead for this joe gibbs team " mr daly writes "what made it a comedy of errors rather than a tragedy of errors was what happened next jason campbell drifted back and with the eagles closing in fired a touchdown pass to chris cooley for a lead in an eventual victory " at least philadelphia baseball fans have something to cheer about it wasnt long ago that the national league east seemed all but wrapped up and the phillies sole chance of making the playoffs was the wild card berth but then the phillies went into new york and swept the mets they dont seem to be cooling down either in a thrilling victory last night the phillies built an run lead only to see it almost disappear it was a game that proved phillies manager charlie manuel is in good health writes the philadelphia daily newss sam donnellon "he took a stress test last night and passed then he took another one and another one and another one so by the end of the night the phillies manager sat slumped back behind a desk in the visitors clubhouse shirt soaked wearing the look of a man whose parachute finally opened a hundred feet from the ground " now the phillies have won five straight and sit just games behind the mets the phillies arent the only team suddenly with their sights on the divisional crown instead of a wild card berth the new york yankees are now behind the boston red sox and almost assured a spot in the playoffs as the new york daily newss filip bondy writes that leaves yankees manager joe torre with a tough question to answer what to do with rookie pitcher philip hughes in october "hughes looks like an eventual no type starter but who knows hes ridiculously young and has a great attitude "is that package good enough to convince torre to give hughes an october start " mr bondy continues "the kids audition went ok against the orioles neither here nor there mussina performs for the cameras tonight " maybe it will be the chicago cubs year after all entering the bottom of the ninth inning and clinging to a one game lead in the national league central the cubs trailed the cincinnati reds by two runs but then aramis ramirez smacked a two run triple to tie it up and mark derosas base hit drove in the winning run for a victory the chicago tribunes mike downey doesnt know how the season will end but last nights victory points to one thing it will be a wild finish "the two weeks to come could end with wrigleyville making off with disneylands title as the happiest place on earth " mr downey writes "or the bitter end of this chicago baseball administration could be at hand " the victory also impressed one potential owner mark cuban was at wrigley field last night watching the game from the bleachers "in a perfect world the cubs would win their first world series in years and then be purchased by cuban whose proven commitment to spending and winning in the nba would ensure more championship forays in wrigleyville " the chicago sun timess jay mariotti writes "for now cubdom better concentrate on surviving the lowly reds who have tortured the cubs before in the final weeks in fact so far so good but carlos zambrano is pitching tonight on three days rest " while the leads are shrinking for the mets and red sox the cleveland indians thanks to casey blakes inning home run last night essentially knocked the tigers out of the playoffs for detroit fans the loss was disheartening not just for the loss but for who gave up the tigers lead joel zumaya all season fans had hoped for mr zumayas return from the disabled list just in time for the teams playoff push "just wait the people would say until the big guy comes back " writes the detroit free presss jon paul morosi "on monday they all saw exactly what they wanted joel zumaya on the mound ruptured tendon reattached with detroits pennant dreams riding on his broad capable shoulders " the nfl might be considered the king of sports now but in that was hardly the case "twenty years ago a players strike turned the football world upside down " writes mike tanier over at football outsiders "owners and coaches fought with players players sparred with one another fans battled picketers outside of stadiums when nfl owners fielded teams of strikebreakers so called "replacements" bartenders became quarterbacks and hall of famers became picketers " the piece is part of a series about one of the most tumultuous periods in the nfls history russia a team few expected much from captured the eurobasket basketball title this weekend upsetting a jose calderon and pau gasol led spanish team the victory exemplifies the challenges facing team usa as it prepares for next summers olympics in beijing writes espn coms chris sheridan mr sheridan offers up this piece of advice for usa basketball "make or copies of the game tape from sunday nights final and send them to every single player in the team usa program and the team usa pipeline include a little note that says guys take a look at this tape and keep one thing in mind as you watch it crazy crazy things can happen in international basketball and giants really do fall and do not ever ever take any opponent lightly
