microsofts waterloo lawyers are often the biggest winners in big court cases and the climax of the eu microsoft saga proves the rule yesterdays appeals court decision against the u s software giant will open the way to a legal bonanza in brussels the european regulators and microsofts rivals who rushed to declare victory may rue the day they got what they wished for the ruling by the european unions second most powerful court was a judicial slam dunk for brussels the court upheld the european commissions judgment that microsoft had abused the dominance of its windows operating system the company illegally "bundled" its media player program with windows and refused to provide rivals with the information they needed to create software that worked with microsoft programs the court agreed with the commissions argument that microsoft limited competition and affirmed the record million euros fine that brussels levied on the company the decision was clear and emphatic leaving global companies with little doubt about where the eu stands on policing the technology industry we cant think of anything else good to say about this outcome in their campaign against microsoft european regulators have put technology companies on notice about daring to improve their products microsoft itself felt compelled to consult the commission last year about add ons to its new vista program before bringing it to market this hardly encourages innovation or benefits consumers but then again thats not the point of eu antitrust law brussels main concern is the well being of bill gatess competitors yesterdays legal rout will surely be felt and closely studied elsewhere along americas west coast if europe can bring mighty microsoft to heel then no ones immune the brussels antitrust cops are already investigating intel and might find good reasons in yesterdays decision to check in on those innovative folks at google and apple too the eus competition chief neelie kroes discounts "scare stories about the supposed negative consequences of this ruling for other companies " she also says that she is "not expecting a number of companies to come for coffee" and a chat about how their rival is hurting their business though such firms would be "quite welcome " all of which suggests this could get out of hand faster than the click of a mouse microsofts general counsel brad smith points out that apples ipod dominates the mp player market in which microsofts zune is the underdog and that googles search engine has whipped microsofts msn and all other comers not to mention the near monopoly in some mainframe computer markets held by ibm which joined sun microsystems in pushing brussels to take on microsoft in mr smith seems to be implying that two can play at this game of making "strategic complaints " firms that do so risk little of their own time energy or money once it takes up a case the commission does the heavy lifting the targeted companies incur huge costs to defend themselves european regulators and now judges apparently believe that the proper venue for competition among technology companies is in the courtrooms rather than research labs everyone will be worse off except of course lawyers the court yesterday concluded that microsoft hadnt proved that sharing its technology with rivals would "have a significant negative effect on its incentives to innovate " the commission may have followed the letter of the law here though the way it was applied still seems questionable in any case the law is out of tune with todays high speed of technological innovation and should be changed the u s justice department yesterday noted the outcome could "harm consumers by chilling innovation and discouraging competition " the technology industry has shown itself able to regulate itself through competition but the judges in luxembourg yesterday put brussels at the center of the action the regulators and the industry may come to realize this news isnt worth cheering
