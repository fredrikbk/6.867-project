free ibm software is bid to challenge microsoft office resuming an old rivalry international business machines corp is launching a software giveaway that takes aim at microsoft corp on the office desktop today ibm plans to post on the internet a package of its own software with applications that square off against components of microsofts ubiquitous office suite a word processor to rival word a spreadsheet to go up against excel and business presentation software as an alternative to powerpoint the ibm package called symphony can be downloaded free of charge the home edition of microsofts office lists for &# on internet retail sites ibm will also give away the symphony software to customers who buy the latest version of its notes collaboration software which costs &# per user older versions of symphonys components which lotus development began selling in were crushed in the marketplace by microsoft ibm which bought lotus in has challenged microsoft products with free alternatives such as linux an operating system used to run servers in corporate and government computer rooms now ibm sees an opportunity to continue that strategy in a different marketplace ibms latest move is aimed chiefly at boosting its notes software which includes email and instant messaging as a rival to microsofts outlook email software by introducing symphony in an internationally recognized information display standard called the open document format ibm also hopes to boost acceptance of that standard which doesnt work well with microsoft products the stated aim of the international standard is to allow documents to be read by multiple software applications rather than requiring any one system symphony is based on software available from open office a development project that also provides the basis of sun microsystems corp s star office and a google inc desktop software suite last week ibm announced it would join openoffice org which offers a microsoft office alternative that can be downloaded for free though symphony wont be available at that site ibm said it would give open office code developed by ibm engineers that makes it easier to use by people with limited vision the symphony introduction comes on the heels of microsofts failure last week at the geneva based international organization for standardization to have its own document coding approved as an international standard steve mills ibms software chief said that "something we deliver for free wont be a moneymaker " but if buyers of corporate computers give symphony to some employees it might free up budgets to buy other software from ibm he said microsofts hegemony in corporate offices isnt likely to change anytime soon analysts say microsoft says it has million desktop customers and sold million licenses of its latest version of office in the fiscal year ended june but ibm hopes the move could open buyers eyes to alternatives users of symphony software will be able to view and edit most documents created in microsofts word ibm says "this is the moment if ibm ever wants to do this " says amy wohl an office software consultant in narberth pa with buyers evaluating a potentially expensive upgrade to microsofts recently released office many will be willing to consider using ibms alternative for users like call center employees who have limited desktop needs she predicts at microsoft betsy frost general manager of office said she doesnt believe ibms embrace of open office will affect customer plans she said customers she works with expect to stick with office because of "ease of use lower training costs and to ensure reliability and security " mr mills said that ibm had been backing open document format for several years and felt it is important to provide with symphony software that supports it he noted that ibms embrace of the free linux operating system and other open software products helped make them successful and said he hopes for similar results with open desktop products mr mills said that he expects some ibm employees and departments will continue to buy new versions of microsoft office as they become available because "microsoft office delivers a lot of features and open office doesnt deliver all of those features " however he said many users who arent creating fancy documents or slide shows for clients are likely to rely on the desktop products inside notes because they "dont need all the features" microsoft provides for example he said thousands of software developers in his organization arent likely to need to upgrade to office melissa webster an analyst with market researcher idc in framingham mass says that even though open office has been available as a free download she thinks ibms entry will boost corporate demand for a free system "with open source theres always the question of which version to pull and if theres a bug how long it will take to fix it theres no throat to choke " in case of problems she says "ibm erases all those concerns in one fell swoop " she added ibm says it will provide support for symphony but it hasnt determined at what price because symphony will be available free in the latest edition of notes it should get a look from organizations around the world which have million notes users users will be able to use symphony to view and edit a spreadsheet or write a presentation without having to open a new application doug heintzman director of technical strategy for ibms software group says putting symphony inside notes reflects his view that collaboration software now provides the greatest value in software for workers "spreadsheets and word processors and presentations have been around a long time theyre pretty static the real value is in how people work together " he says that is certainly reflected in the price when lotus introduced the first symphony in it priced it at &# corrections &amp amplifications the latest version of microsoft corp s office software package is microsoft office and the company said it sold a combined million copies of all versions of office in the year ended june a marketplace article tuesday incorrectly called the latest version office and said microsoft sold million copies of the latest version in that year wsj sept
