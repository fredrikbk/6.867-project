business technology vista looks to pioneers feedback is crucial to microsofts plan for latest system companies planning to roll out microsoft corp s windows vista operating system can thank people like eric craig mr craig a managing director at continental airlines inc started moving his company to vista early this year far sooner than most businesses for continental and other early vista adopters being first meant wrestling with an array of challenges that include security programs that werent ready and problems with "driver" software for running printers and other devices such pioneers are an important part of microsofts strategy which employs customers feedback to help improve vista and the software universe designed to work with it "were happy to share our experience " mr craig says that is good news for the followers many of whom remain daunted by the prospect of moving to vista indeed a recent forrester research survey of companies in the u s and europe with more than employees showed that only plan to start rolling out vista this year with expecting to begin the process next year some of respondents said they didnt any have plans yet to move to vista why the reticence by the time microsoft first made vista available to businesses last november five years after its predecessor windows xp companies had built or bought many layers of software on earlier versions of windows including security software to guard against viruses and other malicious computer code moving to vista requires modifying those software layers running the risk of creating new problems and there is simply no substitute for actually installing vista in real businesses to find the glitches and to fully test the attendant software like the drivers that has been tweaked to run with vista microsoft provides free software tools and programs to help with the migration but those programs also must be enhanced based on experience gained through their use roughly nine months after vista was made broadly available information technology professionals say installing vista is gradually becoming easier "if youre an it person sitting down to do this you have much better information available than you did six months ago " says steve kleynhans an analyst at gartner group "six months from now its going to be even better " continental since may has replaced nearly personal computers at two of its three reservation centers with vista pcs the work was delayed a bit as continental waited for certain vista compatible drivers security software and other software from microsoft partners mr craig said continental is now working with cisco systems inc to rejigger the network equipment makers call center software to work better with vista mr craig says by sometime in the first quarter of next year mr craig expects to have converted up to of his companys pcs to vista another organization that experienced the trials is the australian customs service which decided to shift a fleet of aging pcs to vista earlier this year by dumping old machines for new ones that come with vista the agency avoided some onerous chores associated with upgrading existing hardware but it still had problems with a security feature in vista called bitlocker the customs service was able to get hewlett packard co the pc supplier to provide a revised piece of software that fixed the problem such fixes are typically shared with microsoft and other makers of software tools to help vista buyers "the third party support has been a little bit slow but thats progressively gotten better " says murray harrison the customs services chief information officer microsoft provides a free downloadable software kit businesses can use to upgrade existing pcs to vista the kit called the business desktop deployment tool automatically transfers information over the internet about companies it systems and technical problems to microsoft the data are used to help improve the upgrade kit so far customers have downloaded about copies of it microsoft executives say customer feedback has also aided the process of modifying the driver programs microsoft executives say the number of driver programs for vista has swelled to million from million in january another critical issue is application compatibility whether vista can run the business programs that companies now use some are sold by software companies and some are internally developed by users companies may have thousands of different applications that need to be tested for compatibility before a new operating system is introduced microsoft runs a program for certifying software applications for vista as of last week about applications had been certified up from in january microsoft executives say meanwhile many it managers are waiting for vista improvements that will be included in service pack a set of software enhancements for vista that will have new drivers security features and bug fixes microsoft says the software will be available in january still some businesses dont see enough benefits from the new software to go through all the trouble "we dont have any plans for rolling out vista in our environment in the near future " says gentry ganote chief information officer of golf and tennis pro shop inc which runs sports shops around the u s instead mr ganote says his company is shifting more of its employees from pcs to more simplified devices known as thin clients which he says will be easier for his it group to manage earth tech inc though a big user of microsoft software doesnt see enough new value in vista itself to justify upgrading its pcs says jim walsh its chief information officer mr walsh whose company handles infrastructure work that includes building roads and airports and managing water treatment facilities is studying whether software that runs on vista including the new version of microsofts office software and software called sharepoint offer enough benefits to justify a move to vista and like his peers at many other companies mr walsh is concerned about problems arising from adding vista to his companys it system which has a mix of both microsoft and software from some other companies "im generally personally afraid of the integration issues " he said "can the existing software i have run on it i have to make sure it does " such thinking is one reason why a significant number of businesses wont start the transition until next year says benjamin gray an analyst at forrester research still with the gradual improvements to the infrastructure around vista for most businesses "its not a matter of if its a matter of when and how " he said
