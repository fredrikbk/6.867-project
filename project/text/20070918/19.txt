chinas car price wars dent profits discounting takes toll on auto makers puts brake on stock gains chengdu china at the sprawling e kingo automobile dealership here which stretches for about a quarter of a mile along an expressway prices are falling general motors corp is knocking &# or off the price of its small chevrolet sail station wagon chinas chery automobile co has marked down the price of its new crossover by nearly every brand is on sale "the discounting is getting more and more fierce " said lou li a manager at the e kingo in chengdu capital of the southwest province of sichuan "and we expect prices to keep going lower " competition in chinas auto market has intensified in recent months calling into question its image as potential supplier of steady profits for the global industry cost controls and lower prices for locally produced components cushion some but not all of the blow from the discounting china the worlds second largest passenger car market behind the u s is an increasingly important growth source for auto makers car sales last year rose gm which makes buicks chevrolets and cadillacs with a local partner is offering interest free financing on some models after watching its market share in china slide in the first half of the year south koreas hyundai motor co has cut prices by as much as while germanys volkswagen ag lowered the price tag on some passats by the price cuts by both domestic and international auto makers are pinching industry profits said john bonnell of market researcher j d power &amp associates automotive resources asia unit in bangkok he said things will get worse before they get better "people arent willing to give up as long as they have the resources to stay in the game they will keep cutting " predicts mr bonnell "but its not leading to a healthy industry " the toll is beginning to show in the results of chinas domestic industry in which a host of new players in recent years has ratcheted up competition geely automobile holdings ltd the hong kong listed arm of chinas geely group this month said its first half net income fell in part because of intensified domestic competition shares of geely one of the countrys fastest expanding auto makers are up this year but have fallen from their week high in july charles cheung an auto industry analyst with citigroup inc in hong kong said discounting and weaker than expected sales volumes are holding back chinese car companies shares "most companies including the listed ones are not meeting their sales targets " he said "its been across the board " for chinese companies "cost advantages are obvious " said dong jianhua an analyst at southwest securities in beijing "foreign companies will be pushed to the upscale end of the market and some may be driven out eventually " in the short term he said international car makers are able to make sacrifices in china while earning profits elsewhere twin forces are driving the trend first cars are no longer the preserve of the very wealthy and the newly middle class chinese buyers have more modest means they are much more price sensitive and far less concerned about brand names second manufacturers are racing to expand production and gain the economies of scale and critical mass they need to survive companies are basically betting that slim margins and even losses are a worthwhile price of admission to the china market of the future complicating the situation is that many local players are owned at least in part and subsidized by provincial and municipal governments that see the automobile as critical to local economic success central government planners would like to see fewer stronger firms but said mr bonnell "it seems like theyve lost the power to force a consolidation " in the meantime these state controlled companies propped up by subsidies keep pressure on other manufacturers to continue lowering prices this month byd automobile a subsidiary of hong kong listed byd co introduced a new version of its flagship sedan a four door compact known as the f which comes with leather seats wood paneling and power everything the list price about &# down more than &# from the start of the year liu zhangyong a year old salesman for a paint company bought a silver f after looking at a chevrolet lova and a geely sedan "its roomy and it looks great it just

ago byd automobile didnt exist it was created after its parent a manufacturer of cellphone batteries bought an old state run car factory in northwestern china the company sold nearly vehicles in the first seven months of the year up nearly from a year earlier but still a very small number by modern auto manufacturing standards "the local car makers need to grow" to benefit from economies of scale and they need to "move up" to bigger more expensive cars if they hope to survive said yale zhang an analyst at auto industry consultancy csm "at the very low end the profit margins are just so slim " the combined market share of chinas own car makers is rising it was in the first seven months of the year according to automotive resources asia up from in "chinese brands have done very well they are gaining popularity very rapidly " said e kingos mr lou "they are well equipped more fashionable and have very low prices compared to foreign brands " those attributes give chinese brand autos an edge with the latest wave of car buyers middle class people with an annual household income of about yuan or about &# "for this group price is the no consideration " said mr lou "they want a car that looks good and is still inexpensive " price was a critical concern for song xiaoguo when he shopped for a sport utility vehicle in april after looking at a hyundai santa fe he opted for an suv from chinese company great wall motor co the hover priced at about &# the hover was about &# less than a comparable hyundai mr song said the year old mr song a drug company sales representative who drove his hover
