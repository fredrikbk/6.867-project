nicotine buzz u s farmers rediscover the allure of tobacco end of subsidy system brings higher profits lessons for mr barbre carmi ill tobacco is back in the american farm belt three years after the federal government stopped subsidizing it the leafy crop is gaining new popularity among u s farmers cheaper u s tobacco has become competitive as an export and china russia and mexico where cigarette sales continue to grow are eager to buy since u s tobacco acreage has risen fields are now filled with it in places like southern illinois which hasnt grown any substantial amounts since the end of world war i for decades martin ray barbre who farms the lush rolling hills here was not eligible for federal price supports to grow tobacco under a program dating back to the depression making it economically infeasible for him to do so the same was true for many farmers in other states now the tarry plant is the most profitable crop mr barbre grows on his acre spread "if somebody told me seven or eight years ago that id be growing tobacco today id say they were crazy " said the gruff year old farmer plucking a yellowing leaf from one of his plants and taking a deep smell of the raw woody aroma as laborers from mexico and honduras used axes to chop down foot plants and hang them on wooden planks to dry in the sun mr barbre explained the attraction of the crop even factoring in higher labor and other costs hes netting up to &# an acre from his acres of tobacco compared with &# an acre from his corn he credits tobacco with boosting his annual income by about since he started planting the crop three years ago although corn is flirting with near record prices at around &# a bushel "theres no way corn can get high enough" to compete with tobacco says mr barbre shaking his head "theres just too much money in tobacco " mr barbres profitable tobacco business adds a wrinkle to the debate over the farm bill congress is preparing to take up many farmers say that without the system of subsidies for commodities like corn cotton and soybeans theyd be at risk of going under but critics say the system fosters inefficiency distorts international trade and supports mainly the wealthiest farmers now these critics can point to tobacco as evidence that subsidies are unnecessary with tobacco "we are finding that farming can be done without subsidies " says david orden a professor at virginia tech and an agricultural economist at the international food policy research institute in washington for more than years subsidies were as integral to tobacco farming as rich soil and a damp climate in congress passed the agricultural adjustment act a new deal era law crafted to support the thousands of small farmers of all sorts who had been financially devastated by the depression the law guaranteed tobacco farmers in many states a minimum price for their crops it allotted quotas to farms that produced tobacco at the time the law was enacted which dictated how many acres they could plant tobacco buyers were penalized for buying from growers without quotas growers who didnt own a quota had to buy or rent one from those who did the system propped up prices and limited production to narrow geographic areas and to plots of land rarely larger than acres the system was junked in through a &# billion buyout of tobacco growers and farmers who owned quotas with tobacco companies funding the payments thousands of tobacco farmers many reaching retirement age collected their checks and stopped growing the crop some farmers planted strawberries or tried to raise catfish in their farm ponds in tobacco acreage dropped from the year earlier to acres with the government no longer supporting prices those dropped too to &# per pound from &# according to the u s agriculture department cigarette makers worried that they wouldnt have enough supply but predictions from some quarters that tobacco farming was headed for extinction in the u s proved incorrect today farmers can grow as much tobacco as they want wherever they want economies of scale have kicked in arnold oreilly for one figured it made sense to grow even more before the buyout he says the tobacco he grew on his hardinsburg ky farm was selling for about &# a pound but he paid up to cents per pound to rent a quota knocking down his effective price to as low as &# these days he says his tobacco fetches about &# a pound and theres no quota payment taking a bite out of it "before the buyout i couldnt expand " he says as a result "we werent competitive on the world market " today he is growing acres double the acres he grew just before the buyout he has invested more than &# in new farming equipment barns and land "im unlimited in my opportunities " says mr oreilly "i have nobody that can hold me back now " will snell a tobacco economist at the university of kentuckys department of agricultural economics says its not uncommon now for tobacco farms to exceed acres tobacco production he says has shifted to places with large tracts of land where the leaf can be grown more efficiently nationwide the tobacco crop has been rebounding today there are acres under cultivation still down from the acres in but on the rise some farmers reinvested their buyout cash in their tobacco operations in big tobacco producing states such as kentucky and in smaller ones like wisconsin and pennsylvania many tobacco farmers are enjoying renewed prosperity tobacco production in pennsylvania has more than doubled since in illinois production has gone from practically none to at least acres tobacco companies are recruiting new farmers and offering financial assistance to farmers who invest in new curing barns drying racks greenhouses and machinery "u s tobacco is really the backbone of our blends " says henry long a vice president at philip morris usa a unit of altria group inc "our job is to ensure we have a stable supply of u s tobacco to meet current and future needs " t j vaughan a year old grain farmer in carmi started growing tobacco last year with his father randy after meeting some representatives of philip morris at a local farm supply shop upon hearing that he could grow tobacco in illinois mr vaughan recalls thinking "yeah right " he says "then they started talking about profitability and we were more interested " mr vaughan signed a one year contract with philip morris this year representatives of philip morris held a preseason meeting with about farmers in mr vaughans equipment shed where a combine and a boat called "hillbilly deluxe" were moved aside to make room for long banquet tables mr vaughan decided at that meeting to triple his tobacco acreage to acres and he signed a new contract he has since bought a machine to bale tobacco steel and wood drying racks and a greenhouse philip morris has provided about &# to help cover those costs mr barbre a stout man who sports sunglasses and walks with a swagger has taken a winding route to tobacco road he grew up on his fathers cattle ranch in carmi population and began farming corn soybeans and wheat in he made a decent living building himself a simple wooden house right across the street from his childhood elementary school but he was always on the lookout for ways to pad his retirement nest egg in vector tobacco inc of north carolina enticed mr barbre to plant acres of a genetically modified low nicotine tobacco for a cigarette called quest because the tobacco was considered a specialty product that didnt fall under the governments quota system it was permissible to grow in illinois vector built some drying structures on mr barbres land and it sent an agronomist named farrell matthews to teach him how to grow tobacco but the project quickly wound down a vector spokeswoman says the company stopped growing in illinois because it had an "adequate supply for our needs at that time " mr barbre was disappointed it didnt work out he found it exciting to try a new crop and he got a taste for how much money there was to be made in tobacco he decided to keep the drying structures intact after hearing about the buyout he recalls "i thought something might happen and i decided to roll the dice " in the year the quotas disappeared mr barbre heard again from mr matthews "farrell called me one day that spring and said you want to raise some tobacco " he recalls the two went into business together in exchange for teaching mr barbre how to grow tobacco and for managing the day to day business in the fields mr matthews gets half the profits mr matthews is a lifelong tobacco grower a chain smoking ox of a man he was raised in kentucky and remembers hauling tobacco in a tractor to wooden barns when he was years old he sold his tobacco farm in after realizing his children had no interest in farming he now lives in carmi part of the year helping at least nine farmers grow tobacco his local nickname "the kentuckian " the partnership proved propitious for both men mr barbre says that at the time he had "no clue" how to go it alone he says he wasnt accustomed to dealing with unfamiliar pests like giant green hornworms or to walking the fields to gauge the health of his crop rather than "windshield scouting it" checking it while driving down the road mr matthews says that in grain country farmers like mr barbre arent used to tending crops the way tobacco needs to be tended tobacco planting starts in march and harvest doesnt end until december a longer season than for most crops mr matthews jokes that local farmers are used to driving x trucks "they only drive them four weeks in the spring and four weeks in the fall " corn soybeans and wheat are the dominant crops around carmi the town sits atop the oil rich illinois basin so some farmers also make money drilling for oil beneath their corn fields as more farmers start raising tobacco a new culture is taking root the tobacco growers lend each other advice and supplies they get together fridays for lunch at a local cafe called billy bob and ninas to talk about their crops and to feast on a buffet featuring fried catfish coleslaw and baked beans but tobacco has brought new challenges while grain is harvested by machine tobacco is picked mostly by hand for mr barbre that means relying for the first time on migrant laborers most of them mexican he says with the harvest in full swing he currently has about laborers he houses them all in rented rooms and in an old army barracks outside carmi that he helped rebuild he says the town is still getting used to the influx of foreigners some local residents are unhappy that farmers are growing a crop used for a product that causes cancer mr vaughans mother carol says when her husband and son started growing tobacco she resigned from the board of a local tobacco free coalition that passed out literature about smoking "to me it would have been a conflict of interest" to stay says mrs vaughan but mr barbre says the opposition has quieted overall he doesnt have any moral qualms growing tobacco he says "somebodys going to grow it " he maintains "people are smoking it "
