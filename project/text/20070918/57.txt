microsoft loss in europe raises american fears brussels microsoft corp s stinging defeat in a european courtroom rewrites the rules for competition in europe promising tighter scrutiny for dominant companies including several american giants the luxembourg based court of first instance said the european commission acted properly in when it found that microsoft had abused its near monopoly position the commission taking a significantly tougher line than u s antitrust authorities have done recently said microsoft improperly bundled a media player with its windows operating system and denied competitors information needed to make their computers work with microsofts software microsofts total bill in fines and penalties could reach billion euros or &# billion the company said it will quickly hand over the information to its rivals as the commission wanted in europe the case was followed with the attention normally paid to the travails of royals or the fate of national soccer teams lawyers for microsoft the european commission and groups supporting both sides went to luxembourg to hear it read from the bench reporters thronged the courtroom eu officials praised the decision which asserted broad powers for the eu to regulate industry dominating companies for protecting consumers microsofts backers said the ruling will stifle innovation by making it tougher to design products with new features some lawyers raised the specter of a regulatory nightmare as technology companies struggle to adapt to differing standards across the globe "if i were a leading company in any sector id be really concerned about this " said ted henneberry an antitrust lawyer at heller ehrman llp in london who wasnt involved in the microsoft case chip makers intel corp and rambus inc are among the u s companies that may be affected as antitrust regulators in brussels are emboldened by the ruling the european union brought a case against intel in july accusing it of using marketing incentives to deter customers from dealing with rival advanced micro devices inc the eu is investigating rambus over alleged manipulation of standard setting bodies to assure itself of patent royalties rep robert wexler a florida democrat who is chairman of the house foreign affairs subcommittee on europe called yesterdays ruling a "dangerous precedent " he said he intends to call a hearing to review what he described as a "new form of protectionism" by the eu the u s justice departments chief thomas barnett contrasted europes approach with americas he said that in the u s even dominant firms "are encouraged to compete vigorously " while europes stance may end up "harming consumers by chilling innovation " european regulators hailed the court decision as a victory for consumers who in the words of competition commissioner neelie kroes are "suffering at the hands of microsoft " ms kroes said she would like to see a "significant drop" in microsofts nearly market share in operating system software in the last big europe antitrust case the luxembourg court found the commission employed shoddy legal reasoning when it blocked the planned merger of general electric co and honeywell international inc the two companies never did merge this time the court seized the opportunity to outline a broad interpretation of the eus power to regulate dominant companies it brushed aside microsofts argument that traditional antitrust tools arent appropriate for fast moving technology industries the eu said microsoft illegally bundled windows media player inside its windows operating system hurting independent makers of media player software realnetworks inc the maker of an alternative player joined the case but settled with microsoft in for &# million the bundling allegation resembled the crux of the u s antitrust case against microsoft settled in which was built around complaints about microsofts bundled web browser the second part of the eus case involved protocols or procedures for transferring data between computers the eu alleged that microsoft by not disclosing its protocols was making it too hard for servers running different software to communicate with certain microsoft based machines these machines are used for tasks such as maintaining a directory of users and controlling their access to a network the ruling could hurt microsofts profitable business of software for servers or big corporate computers by forcing it to disclose the protocols at little or no cost the information could help "open source" competitors such as the linux operating system separately the eu is reviewing complaints about microsofts office software and concerns over how microsoft bundled encryption and other features in its new vista operating system the courts president bo vesterdorf first announced that the court had rejected the eus appointment of a trustee to monitor microsoft a minor aspect of the case then he said the court "dismisses the remainder of the application" microsofts appeal brad smith microsofts general counsel said microsoft is weighing whether to appeal to europes highest tribunal the court of justice he said microsoft has licenses to its protocols available to competitors but it charges for them the eu has suggested the information should be free the eus case dates to when sun microsystems inc complained that microsoft wasnt sharing some computer code needed to make computers running suns solaris operating system talk to machines running windows the european commissions investigation snowballed and the commission rebuffed microsoft chief steve ballmer when he flew to brussels for settlement talks europes competition commissioner at the time mario monti said he wanted a clear precedent defining the eus powers in dealing with dominant high tech companies in the commission called for a million euro fine against microsoft and ordered the company to disclose its server protocol information with additional fines including a million euros a day penalty the bill grew to about billion euros microsoft which has plenty of cash has put much of the money in an escrow account and it will be released to the eu once the case is concluded unless the company wins an appeal the eu would then distribute the money among member states mrs kroes who succeeded mr monti had close ties to the business community in her home country the netherlands and was expected to be gentler on companies but microsoft stuck in her craw her staff expressed frustration that the company was snowing it under with documents instead of complying with the order even though microsoft had lost a court bid to stay its implementation microsoft did eventually remove media player from windows in one version but few people bought it because it was the same price as the version with media player emotions flared again last year when microsoft said the commissions objections to windows vista would delay its release a tactic meant to bring customer pressure to bear on mrs kroess office in the months leading up to yesterdays ruling the situation had mellowed some as the two sides came closer on the issue of the protocol disclosures also microsoft gave ground to google inc in a new version of its internet explorer software microsoft included a small window that directed computer users to microsofts internet search service prior to the softwares debut late last year google argued to regulators in the u s and europe that the "toolbar" was anticompetitive before introducing the new browser microsoft made it easier to set the window to other search engines including google in advance of mondays ruling court of justice precedents suggested that a refusal to license copyrighted material is abusive if a dominant company seeks without justification to eliminate competition and if the competitor wants to make a new product not just a copy microsoft argued that sun and other vendors wanted to make a replica of a windows server to drop it into a network and werent developing anything novel microsoft presented the case as a battle over the sanctity of intellectual property and the right to profit from inventions the commission said its expert determined the protocols were of such minor value that they would be given away free of charge in a normal market marleen van kerckhove a lawyer in brussels for arnold &amp porter llp which has done work for microsoft in other matters said the court had taken a "big leap" by agreeing that the commission could order a compulsory license when a competitor had merely the "possibility of a new product " she added "we are moving further away from the u s " "the refusal to deal and the refusal to supply is larger than the high tech world " said david anderson of law firm berwin leighton paisner llp dominant companies across the spectrum "need to be very careful " he said robert a guth and john r wilke contributed to this article on the defensive some u s companies involved in european antitrust fights intel eu says intel used abusive tactics including selling chips below cost and using rebates to coerce customers to thwart smaller rival advanced micro devices rambus eu says rambus sprang a patent ambush on competitors by working with them to make an industry standard then saying its patents covered the standard qualcomm rivals complained to the eu that qualcomm is abusing its patent portfolio by charging excessive royalties apple eu says apple and record labels are restricting choice by forcing consumers to buy recordings from country specific internet stores
