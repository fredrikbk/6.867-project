the mukasey nomination if the legal issues that have most preoccupied washington the past six years are suggestive then president bush has found the right man to be attorney general in michael mukasey from the moment the white house proposed and congress passed the patriot act after september washington has struggled to create a set of policies for the war on terror that weighs the role of civil liberties with the need to fight a determined and mortal enemy mr mukaseys professional life stood at the center of these tough legal issues six years before september as a federal judge in the southern district of new york judge mukasey presided over the trial of sheikh omar abdel rahman the "blind sheikh " whom the government charged with a plot to blow up the united nations building the george washington bridge and the lincoln and holland tunnels after a nine month trial and conviction judge mukasey sentenced abdel rahman to life in prison in rejecting an appeal of that conviction the circuit court said of judge mukaseys handling of the blind sheikh case that he "presided with extraordinary skill and patience assuring fairness to the prosecution and to each defendant and helpfulness to the jury his was an outstanding achievement in the face of challenges far beyond those normally endured by a trial judge " afterward along with judge kevin duffy who handled a related case judge mukasey for years received protection from the u s marshals service in response to credible threats against him that is to say judge mukasey as well as any lawyer in the u s understands what is normal and what is not normal about the war on terror as such he has more than adequate standing to discuss these matters with congress in good faith and then preside over the justice departments administration of them it remains to discover whether senate democrats will be willing to engage judge mukasey at this level of seriousness or whether their primary target remains the bush presidency itself after ted olsons name was floated for the job last week judiciary committee chairman pat leahy put out a statement that the ag nominee must be willing to "act as an independent check on this administrations expansive claims of virtually unlimited executive power " we thought senator leahys party had to win the presidency before writing justice department policy in the past judge mukasey has shown he can push back hard against arid accusations in william kunstler argued that mr mukaseys judaism demanded recusal in the trial of an accused muslim terrorist citing similar attempts against black judges and even mormons judge mukasey wrote "the objection here is not based on race or sex or the mormon religion but the motion in this case is in all relevant ways the same as the motions in those cases it is the same rancid wine in a different bottle " judge mukasey has written op ed articles for the wall street journal defending the patriot act and describing the limitations of existing legal institutions and statutes to handle terrorist cases on the latter judge mukasey wrote that shaping an adjudicatory framework suitable for handling this special class of terror defendants is congresss job congress he said needs to "fix a strained and mismatched legal system before another cataclysm calls forth from the people demands for hastier and harsher results " if there is reason at all for concern in the mukasey nomination it would be that the level of seriousness he has brought to bear on these problems from the bench and in his writings has become largely alien to life in official washington thus we wonder whether judge mukasey realizes how poisonous washington has become and whether he has the hide to survive it inside the administration he can probably resist those at the state department who want to close guantanamo largely because they havent offered a credible alternative the bigger test will be the democratic demand for a special counsel to investigate the u s attorney firings hell have to resist this assault on executive authority even at the risk of not being confirmed notwithstanding judge mukaseys past support from senator chuck schumer with the presidents announcement the senators inevitable caveats are already landing the nomination is going to need active political cover from the white house its behavior the past several days makes that an open question after ted olsons name floated out of the washington vapors last week he was subjected to an absurd attack on his "partisanship" from harry reid and mr leahy set aside that mr olson is widely regarded as one of the nations top constitutional lawyers arguing cases before the supreme court or that he served as solicitor general without a peep of partisan accusation shorn of the rhetoric mr olsons offense was providing legal services to one partys political opponents a standard that would disqualify half the d c bar from serving in a clinton administration the upshot was that mr bush angered natural allies by letting a loyal conservative take it in the neck for days and he opened himself to the appearance of backing down against mr reids threat to block an olson nomination against all this michael mukaseys nomination to be attorney general is salutary for the democrats it offers an opportunity to set aside wheel spinning obsessions like the u s attorney firings and focus on the manifestly more serious issue of thwarting terror plots as for the bush presidency it at last may have an attorney general who has the heft to make the legal case for the tools needed in this war earth to washington you finally have the right man for the right job at the right time try not to screw this one up
