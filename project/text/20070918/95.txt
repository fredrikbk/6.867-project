every business day sign up for the e mail here a federal district court late yesterday dismissed californias effort to sue the worlds six biggest automakers for "nuisance" damages created by the global warming their products have helped create but the decision could embolden the state to take more direct action the suit against general motors toyota motor north america ford motor honda motor the now separated daimler chrysler and nissan north america was filed a year ago and it sought recompense for the melted sierra snowpacks prolonged droughts and dying forests the state blamed in part on greenhouse gases emitted by auto tailpipes as the los angles times explains the auto makers asked judge martin jenkins of the u s district court for the northern district of california to dismiss the suit arguing that california and federal law doesnt allow their products to be characterized as nuisances and that the issue should be left to policy makers not the courts "our bottom line point is that global warming presents exceedingly complex policy issues that must be addressed at the national and international levels by congress and the president not through lawsuits seeking damages in the federal courts " ted boutrous lead attorney for the auto companies tells the times judge jenkins essentially agreed that californias complaint was "non justiciable " but while the result may seem to conflict with recent decisions backing government regulation of greenhouse gases judge jenkins suggested his court was simply the wrong venue for the state in april the supreme court chastised the bush administration over the environmental protection agencys refusal to regulate tailpipe exhaust and other emissions blamed in part for global warming a decision california tried to muster in its argument against dismissal judge jenkins wasnt convinced "while the supreme court did not expressly address the issue of justiciability it certainly did not sanction the justiciability of the interstate global warming damages tort claim now before this court " he wrote "rather the supreme courts analysis on the issue of standing counsels with convincing force to the contrary as noted above a state has standing to pursue its procedural right through administrative channels " last week the auto makers lost in a different federal district court but in a different way the judge in that case backed vermonts regulation of tailpipe emissions as the new york times notes in a decision widely read as encouraging for california the vermont precedent which offered support to a similar regulatory effort in california may signal that lawmakers in the golden state can accomplish what the states lawyers couldnt do in court in the meantime former california attorney general bill lockyer who began the suit against auto makers last year is now tackling global warming in his role as state treasurer mr lockyer as the l a times reports plans to submit a petition to the securities and exchange commission asking the agency to ensure that investors "get more information from oil companies insurers and other publicly traded companies about how global warming might affect their bottom lines " watching the fed there is never a shortage of reasons for why a given market goes up or down on any particular trading day today the rise in oil prices to a new high above &# a barrel is widely being attributed to expectations that the u s federal reserve will lower interest rates at its policy setting meeting this afternoon thus bolstering u s economic growth and in turn boosting demand for petroleum however much of a stretch that reasoning may be when deciding what to pay for light sweet crude for october delivery there is an awful lot of attention being paid to the fed meeting there is still plenty of debate over whether the fed should even address a liquidity and confidence problem by lowering the cost of borrowed money and whether that unjustly rewards speculating banks funds and investors who help led the markets to this point as the wall street journal reports but the fed will probably focus less on liquidity and confidence than on how those issues have affected the economic

deaths but this is the last and the biggest mistake " iraqi brig gen abdul karim khalaf said yesterday in announcing the government was revoking the security companys license to operate in iraq following a shootout in baghdad that killed nine people that decision echoing many other sovereignty issues raises questions about whether iraq or the u s should regulate the tens of thousands of civilian hired guns operating in the country as the washington post notes especially since blackwater guards the likes of u s ambassador ryan crocker and other diplomats but as gen khalafs comments illustrated several violent episodes involving blackwater have infuriated iraqi officials "security contracts do not allow them to shoot people randomly they are here to protect personnel not shoot people without reason " write to joseph schuman at joseph schuman wsj com some links in this column are to sites that require a subscription or registration
