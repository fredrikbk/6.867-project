business siv fund gives banks an unnecessary break when lee iacocca ran chrysler in the s he complained about a double standard for enterprises in trouble ailing industrial companies got no sympathy he said economic darwinists urged them to make drastic cutbacks or even perish in the name of market discipline and it took many months of struggle before chrysler got u s loan guarantees when banks stumbled it was a different story no matter how foolish their mistakes they were rescued in the name of protecting the global financial system some things never change several of the worlds biggest banks are going through strange gyrations to avoid owning up to missteps in the london market for structured investment vehicles sivs are funds the banks set up as a way to make money without taking the risks involved onto their balance sheets the banks have dropped hints that if they dont succeed in raising a &# billion rescue fund dangerous ripples could spread into the broader commercial paper market and beyond such talk roused the u s treasury earlier this month to help citigroup inc bank of america corp and j p morgan chase &amp co draft the rescue plan the big banks are proposing a fund that would buy troubled siv assets helping liquidate mortgage related investments that otherwise might be dumped on the market at a loss the government isnt putting money into the plan but its role could be crucial in persuading investors to buy debt issued by the rescue fund as part of the plan for all the drama of late night rescue talks though the banks have danced around two crucial questions first is the siv market so important to world economic health that it should be saved in its own right second are global markets in such perilous shape that a shakeout in sivs could trigger collapses in other capital markets its hard to say "yes" to either question sivs exist mostly as a way for banks to do business without putting up their own capital the market hardly existed years ago today its total assets amount to &# billion theres nothing special about how sivs invest their money they own the usual assortment of bank debt mortgages and other asset backed instruments whats striking is how they are set up with huge amounts of leverage on a slim capital base with bank sponsors that dont own them but instead collect management fees for running them and with their funding derived mostly from short term commercial paper put those three factors together and its clear that sivs can make tidy profits for banks when things go well but they are vulnerable to a liquidity squeeze if the commercial paper market dries up thats what happened this summer even citigroup one of the most active siv sponsors isnt portraying these conduits as the bankers equivalent of the eight essential amino acids without which we cant live in a research report last month citigroup analyst birgit specht wrote that its too early to tell whether all such conduits will survive regulatory changes are dimming the appeal of conduits to the point that banks may revert to traditional balance sheet placement for many such holdings so if sivs arent vital per se do we still risk armageddon if they fade away too quickly anyone familiar with the depression era wave of bank failures has to be mindful of the risks that panics can spread crippling sound institutions but this time around banks world wide are in remarkably robust health for the first few years after the september terrorist attacks interest rate trends made almost any lending profitable their trading desks have done just fine in recent years and most corporate clients have been models of good behavior if banks ever could absorb a few hits now is the time current conditions differ sharply from when the latin american debt crisis hit as major u s banks were struggling with a recession and the aftermath of lofty short term rates that squeezed lending margins in regulators had good reason to worry about a domino chain of defaults theres more padding in the system today hasty rescue plans amount to an amnesty for sloppy banking and an invitation for it to continue japans experience in the s is a case in point rather than owning up to banks poor judgment in real estate lending japanese authorities tried for years to shore up shaky loan portfolios that produced economic stagnation even worse painless rescues protect the careers of bankers who ought to pay the price for their poor judgment so far no ceo of a major u s bank has been held accountable for the siv mess there havent even been any widespread purges of their lieutenants people involved in the siv rescue fund say it will buy troubled funds holdings at prices that both shore up the market and are economically rational hmmn it was fascinating to hear alan greenspan former federal reserve chairman weigh in last friday with doubts about how investors would feel if "some form of artificial non market force is propping up the market " but if the siv rescue fund tries too hard to make prices levitate thats just throwing good money after bad
