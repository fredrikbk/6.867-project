afghan homecoming why has everyone forgotten about us " an afghan village leader asked me last month he was a refugee who had returned from pakistan to the village of dar khat in northern afghanistan three years ago today his people still live in dire poverty they have little food no home no school no water and no work this past winter members of his family were cooped up in a hole in the ground covered with wooden boards and mud "why are we forgotten " he asked "are we animals " afghans are a resilient and courageous people but they live in perpetual fear of being forgotten they point to the post soviet years and cite at least in part global inattention for the ensuing civil war chaos and religious extremism now afghans fear they are being forgotten once again and wonder what the consequences will be this time since nearly five million afghans have returned home from neighboring pakistan and iran this past month i went to afghanistan with the united nations high commissioner for refugees to visit some of the returnees in the center in kabul where returnees are registered i met families who had made the tiring journey home from pakistan the day before i spoke to them as they descended from the brightly colored trucks loaded with women children wooden beams and bundles of bags they were weary from the road but i found their mood positive and hopeful "we are happy to be home " one smiling man told me "we have helped the economy of pakistan for years now we can help the economy of our own country we are happy " for how long i wondered i had sat down a few days before with the leader of jeloghir a small uzbek village whose people had returned five years earlier from iran they too had come home buoyed by hope and the promise of opportunity but the disenchanted leader a father of five told me that jeloghirs children go uneducated because the nearest school is a two hour walk each way his people live on bread and drink water from a nearby muddy river when the children get diarrhea they must ride a donkey for hours to get to the nearest clinic he told me he missed the comfort and opportunity of his life in iran "here no one looks after us " he said with a tired wave of his hand in a settlement of nomads on barren desert land between the cities of kunduz and mazar i saw hundreds of homeless returnees still living idly in ragged tents and makeshift mud shelters a full three years after returning to afghanistan the village elder told me that quite predictably his village loses children every winter from exposure to the unforgiving elements he said he was indignant and humiliated that his people were still homeless "beg for bread if you must " he told me ruefully "but may you never ever beg for a home " i spoke about these people with president hamid karzai during a luncheon in kabul he told me that afghanistan would welcome any afghan who wants to return home it was an honorable position to take but historically even in the far more stable era of royalty the central afghan government has never been able to provide adequately for its people today the country is still recovering from a year nightmare of war famine drought displacement and massive human suffering by all indications the government is overwhelmed with the task of providing even basic services and does not have the capacity to absorb the millions of afghans who have come back in the villages that i visited the presence of the government was simply not palpable severely testing the self sufficiency in which afghans take so much pride the situation is likely to worsen pakistan is closing down its refugee camps and wants the two million afghans living in pakistan to be repatriated by the iranian government burdened with illegal afghan migrant workers is taking increasingly aggressive measures to send home the nearly one million afghans living in iran so far this year iran has deported more than unregistered afghans no official that i spoke to in kabul believed that afghanistan can accommodate these additional returnees the return of millions of afghans can be seen as an encouraging indicator of progress in afghanistan but repatriation will falter unless the international community makes a sustained commitment to help reintegrate the returning refugees and provide them with a livelihood and basic services failure to do so will have destabilizing effects beyond afghanistan it will increase illegal movement across the iranian and pakistani borders as destitute afghans seek economic opportunity they cannot find at home i could imagine all too easily the villagers i met turning to poppy cultivation to provide for their families and there is always the specter of disillusionment with the afghan government and by extension the promises of the west not to mention the taliban waiting in the wings eager to welcome the disillusioned into their insurgent ranks with the global focus on iraq i have watched with dismay as my native country continues to recede from the headlines the returnees i met in northern afghanistan may languish in obscurity but their homeland remains vitally important a failed state would be a catastrophe for both afghanistan and the west this is a very critical juncture for afghanistan beset as it is by rising insecurity a stout insurgency in the south and an alarming increase in narcotics production i hope that international will does not falter during this difficult period now more than ever the global community must make a genuine long term and comprehensive commitment to the afghans and ensure the future of the coming generation in other words the world must not forget the afghans again mr hosseini a goodwill envoy to unhcr is the author of "the kite runner"
