started alli user support groups on myspace com and youtube her myspace page now boasts members who can log on to see videos ms jordan posts every few weeks describing her progress and post their own diet stories and messages of support glaxosmithkline plc which makes alli has begun an ambitious online television and print campaign to increase sales of the drug the only diet pill approved by the food and drug administration for sale without a doctors prescription in its market research the company found that dieters like to get advice and support from other dieters and that the web helps them interact so glaxo is putting particular emphasis on the internet it has set up several alli themed sites and is also trying to tap into independent groups like ms jordans whether glaxos alli marketing strategy is working will become clearer today when the company reports third quarter results yesterday glaxo said it has sold more than two million packages of alli since the drug went on sale june in the u s mike ward a pharmaceutical analyst with nomura code securities in london called the figure "encouraging " glaxo based in brentford england is the worlds second largest drug company by revenue after pfizer inc and it needs some good news its earnings are expected to be hit by a fall off in sales of its diabetes drug avandia which is facing safety concerns the market for weight loss pills is huge in the u s alone about half of the women and a quarter of the men try to diet each year according to jean harvey berino a weight loss expert at the university of vermont and million americans are overweight or obese but diet pill sales usually soar at first and then plummet because most people give up on their diets the internet is changing weight loss and in some cases increasing the odds of a dieters success studies show online programs that advise people on eating and exercise habits can help them lose weight dieters also say they use the web to find support groups to help keep them on their diets alli known by the generic name orlistat works by blocking the gut from absorbing some fat from food an alli starter kit with a bottle of pills sells for about &# at wal mart to try to keep people on alli glaxo designed a marketing strategy that relies heavily on its own internet sites and tapping into the more casual blogosphere in april to seed the market glaxo started a web site that offered dieting tips and collected email addresses among other details from visitors glaxo used the site to recruit people to what it called the alli first team a group that got the drug first once the fda approved it in february glaxo encouraged team members to talk about their experience with others in person and online when glaxo set up a blog in june many members posted glowing comments about the drug some also created an alli support group on sparkpeople com a health and fitness web site when it began selling the drug in june glaxo set up an online counseling program called my alli plan dieters who register agree to report their weight calorie and fat intake and exercise levels each week the site sends them customized feedback such as advice on how to control eating urges or avoid negative thinking if people dont check in they receive an email reminding them to log on says gary foster an obesity researcher from temple university in philadelphia who helped glaxo and its ad agency imc develop the site "people do better with structure than without " mr foster says so far more than people have enrolled in my alli plan says steve burton vice president for weight control and head of alli marketing at glaxo some research suggests that online counseling can help people lose weight and maintain weight loss a study published in the journal of the american medical association in divided overweight adults into two groups one got access to an internet site offering information on weight loss the other group got access to the same site plus weekly online counseling sessions with a weight loss expert twice as many people in the latter group lost of their body weight after six months glaxo is also trying to get alli users to support each other with a message board on its site that approach carries some risks for glaxo if dieters give bad advice such as too quick weight loss tips mr burton says glaxo has hired a group of dietitians to monitor postings and correct misinformation ms jordan started posting online because "the support you get from everybody else is what everybody needs " she said in a telephone interview ms jordan who is five feet tall says she has dropped to pounds from pounds while taking alli she aims to get down to pounds glaxo has also set up a blog called alliconnect com on it mr burton and his marketing team post weekly on such topics as unrealistic weight loss goals blood pressure or herbal supplements that promise to melt away pounds they use the blog to defend alli from criticism and to gather comments from readers and they link to other blogs being written by dieters taking alli in doing that glaxo connects potential customers to information it cant control in one blog "anna lightens up " the author annaliese lee told readers this summer that she would stop taking alli because she couldnt "justify the added expense of another bottle of alli right now " a few weeks later she started taking the pills again but since then she has often acknowledged that she isnt eating well or exercising which glaxos marketing emphasizes are important parts of the alli plan
