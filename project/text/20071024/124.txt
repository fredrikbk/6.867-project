the perils of being a child prodigy when year old hungarian pianist ervin nyiregyhazi arrived in the u s in for a concert tour that included his carnegie hall debut photographers documented the occasion in europe the slender prodigy had won acclaim for his keyboard prowess and youthful compositions giving his first public performance at the age of playing at buckingham palace at and appearing as soloist with the berlin philharmonic at by then he had developed a taste for caviar and an unshakable sense of his own importance many children who manifest exceptional musical talent at an early age develop justly celebrated sustained careers but despite his initial success here and abroad nyiregyhazi pronounced nyeer edge hah zee never achieved his full artistic potential performing only sporadically after he moved to los angeles in and his life unsparingly but empathetically recorded in "lost genius the curious and tragic story of an extraordinary musical prodigy " by kevin bazzana illustrates other patterns all too commonly seen among those promoted as wunderkind these include use of the childs gifts to raise the familys economic and social status and emotional damage inflicted by a critical controlling parent in this case young ervins mother in "lost genius " mr bazzana provides an extensively researched nuanced account of a spectacularly dysfunctional life nyiregyhazi married times more than once for financial benefit he cheated compulsively on his wives patronizing massage parlors or prostitutes and having casual sex with both genders he consumed vast quantities of alcohol he was embarrassed about bodily functions "unusual gifts generally take a psychological toll on artists even those who develop as adults " observes mr bazzana author of an award winning biography of the legendary and eccentric pianist glenn gould "in prodigies that toll is compounded because the gifts manifest themselves during the most impressionable formative years mixed with the normal stresses of growing up and in nyiregyhazis case the added pressure of stage parents " in fact "musical wonder child " part one of "lost genius " might easily have been subtitled "how not to raise a prodigy " the child of an amateur pianist and a tenor in the chorus of the royal hungarian opera nyiregyhazi was paraded around europe performing for the social elite although his parents arranged quality musical training for their son his mother banished his chess set for fear it would lure him away from music she urged him to play chopins "minute waltz" in less than seconds and insisted he perform in short pants to heighten his marketing appeal he finally rebelled at the age of moreover the pianist later claimed that his otherwise beloved father beat him because of his clumsiness like some of the musically gifted he had difficulty executing simple tasks he struggled to button his shirts or open sugar packets throughout his life mr bazzana a canadian with a doctorate in music history from the university of california at berkeley became interested in nyiregyhazi while researching a possible book on piano mavericks if in his personal life nyiregyhazi was as the author puts it "the classic wildean hero lying in the gutter but looking at the stars " in his music making he was a genuine exponent of th century romanticism unfortunately nyiregyhazis musical tastes he once played a transcription of the entire "symphonie fantastique" by berlioz at a private concert and style of playing were out of step with the burgeoning modernism of his times like liszt and certain other romantics nyiregyhazi took considerable liberties with the score changing notes doubling octaves or indulging in sudden tempo fluctuations at his peak his technique was described as "uncannily gigantic" his thunderous fortissimos reportedly left traces of blood on the keys not surprisingly nyiregyhazi failed to attract the support of a potential mentor in when composer arnold schoenberg arranged an audition for him with german maestro otto klemperer klemperer a stickler for adhering closely to the composers score was not impressed by nyiregyhazis playing particularly after the pianist unwisely substituted the more exciting finale to chopins b minor sonata for the ending of that composers b flat minor sonata transposing it to the correct key on the spot this may have been self sabotage as mr bazzana suggests of a later incident or a refusal to compromise his artistic preferences but the pianist also might have been seeking approval by showing off a quality applauded in child prodigies but deplored once they grow up beginning in nyiregyhazi worked intermittently for united artists and other studios serving as score reader hand double for actors in piano playing close ups or anonymous contributor to soundtracks his only credited appearance was a brief portrayal of liszt in a horror film "the soul of a monster " he hung out with fellow hungarian bela lugosi he pursued a relationship with gloria swanson who arranged two concerts on his behalf and he rubbed shoulders with other hollywood celebrities by necessity and preference nyiregyhazi lived in the seamier sections of los angeles and san francisco often without a piano even after a well publicized but short lived comeback during the s amazingly two of his ex wives continued to assist him financially and his fifth wife allowed him to live with her for a time because his sixth wife lacked a private bathroom the author deconstructs each union the only time this otherwise gripping biography sags at his death in at the age of he left more than a thousand largely unknown works "i wouldnt make too many claims about nyiregyhazis compositions nor do i dismiss them " says mr bazzana "but as a pianist he belongs at the very top " this book and a two cd set of live recordings from coming in december from the music &amp arts label www musicandarts com may reignite interest in nyiregyhazi for a new generation for brief sound clips and additional information on the pianist visit www fugue us ervin html but in my view he will likely remain a specialized taste by the time the performances on the music &amp arts discs took place the pianist was well past his prime his tempos can be laboriously slow and one hears more technical precision in conservatory practice rooms yet his sound is ravishing in intimate lyrical pieces by chopin and scriabin and his ability to shade a phrase or communicate emotion to the listener is too rarely heard today we can only intuit nyiregyhazis greatness and mourn all that he lost ms jepson writes about classical music for the journal
