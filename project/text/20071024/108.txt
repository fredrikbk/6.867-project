qualcomm has plan to widen web access new chip will let laptop pcs utilize competing networks qualcomm inc today is announcing new chips to let laptop computers use multiple cellular data services hoping to outflank a high profile alternative called wimax the cellular services are proving popular among laptop users who want to stay connected wherever they go but there is a hitch many carriers built their networks on a technology called gsm or global system for mobile communications they typically use a technology for delivering data that is known by yet another acronym hspa for high speed packet access another camp of carriers use code division multiple access or cdma a technology pushed by qualcomm and favor an associated data network dubbed ev do for evolution data only the two kinds of networks arent compatible so laptop computer makers hoping to offer long range internet access now have to buy two kinds of chips to support each service consumers typically choose one technology and one service provider and have to stick with them qualcomm of san diego says its new gobi chips can use either ev do or hspa and their variants that means pc makers can build laptops that can tap into the internet virtually anywhere says sanjay jha qualcomms chief operating officer and president of its chip division the technology also could make it easier for users including corporate technology departments to switch among data service providers says philip solis an analyst at abi research easy access around the world was a central premise in the development of wi fi the short range wireless technology included now with most new laptops it is also a major selling point for wimax a long range wireless technology that is expected to compete with the cellular data services wimax backers include companies such as intel corp motorola inc and samsung electronics co sprint nextel corp and clearwire corp plan to begin installing networks based on a mobile version of wimax in april with widespread u s availability expected by the end of qualcomm expects gobi equipped laptops to go on sale in the second quarter of bringing the promise of ubiquity sooner "this delivers that vision today " mr jha says competitors see reason to wait unlike promoters of wimax qualcomm typically requires hardware companies to pay patent royalties as well as pay for its chips which would add to the cost of making a laptop anand chandrasekher an intel senior vice president and general manager of its mobility group said the qualcomm chips bring some benefits but the royalty issue remains "it doesnt get over the fundamental economic hurdle mr chandrasekher said another issue is that many carriers dont make it easy for users to roam to networks operated by their key competitors particularly in the united states so a consumer who signs up for ev do service at home may not easily use an hspa network operated by another carrier in another city mr jha said he is expecting more carriers to begin offering "day use" plans that will allow roaming users to pay to get internet access when they visit a new coverage area
