trouble at sea free agent doctors in october during her th wedding anniversary cruise aboard royal caribbean cruises ltd s legend of the seas janice sullivan slipped and hit her head on a buffet table briefly knocking her unconscious the ship doctor gave the year old cape coral fla retiree an over the counter pain reliever but didnt scan or x ray her head despite continuing pain over the next several days according to mrs sullivan after she got home mrs sullivan went to an emergency room where a neurologist found a blood clot concerned it could cause a stroke he performed invasive brain surgery but mrs sullivan had a surprise in store when she sued the cruise line and the ship doctor most ship doctors despite typically wearing a crew uniform are classified as independent contractors and cruise companies contend they are no more liable for the doctors competence than a landlord who rents office space to a physician on land thats also a likely surprise to many of the millions of cruise passengers who will board ships during the coming peak cool weather season in the caribbean in the eyes of many the ship doctor is an integral part of the crew like actor bernie kopells amorous dr adam "doc" bricker on the long running television show "the love boat " in her suit mrs sullivan contended she was injured as a result of negligence on the part of the cruise line and the physician who treated her the company declined to comment on the case royal caribbean like most cruise lines says it cant be held liable in court since the doctor is not its employee the wall street journal was unable to locate the doctor who mrs sullivans lawyer says is swedish born royal caribbean wouldnt provide contact information for the physician or attorneys representing him mrs sullivans suit was one of at least medical malpractice cases filed over the past decade against florida cruise companies by passengers alleging that they were hurt as a result of poor medical care at sea or that ship doctors made other injuries suffered on the ship worse according to maritime lawyers in south florida nearly all of those lawsuits have been dismissed or floundered in the courts because of a little understood aspect of u s law under legal rulings going back to a landmark case in the owners of ships are considered responsible for the health care provided to members of their crew but not for medical services provided to passengers sometimes the quality of services has been questioned in the s the american medical association raised concerns about onboard medical treatment and two florida doctors issued a study of ship physicians the study found that half of doctors surveyed werent certified in trauma life support and that ships lacked crucial equipment such as x ray machines and external pacemakers machines that help restore the hearts natural rhythm cruise companies say they have improved the quality of care since then cruise companies say it would be unfair to hold them responsible for treatment provided by the medical professionals because they dont oversee a doctor or nurses medical training and certification some of the companies say they include a warning clause to that effect on passengers tickets earlier this month the u s supreme court bolstered that position further declining to hear an appeal in a medical injury lawsuit that had been winding through florida and federal courts for nearly a decade in that case a then year old girls abdominal pains were misdiagnosed as the flu during a trip on carnival corp s carnival cruise lines ecstasy in doctors at an emergency room later found that elizabeth carlisles appendix ruptured the injury rendered her sterile in a lawsuit the carlisle family argued that the physician was part of the ships staff making the cruise line responsible in court carnival said the physician wasnt an employee and it bore no responsibility the italian doctor was initially named as a defendant but later dropped because attorneys said they couldnt locate him he also couldnt be reached for comment by the journal or a private investigator hired by the family carnival declined to comment in a florida court of appeals sided with the family saying carnival owed passengers "reasonable care " in february the florida supreme court reversed that ruling affirming that doctors are independent contractors and that cruise lines are not "vicariously liable for the negligence of the shipboard physician " the u s supreme courts refusal to hear an appeal upheld the ruling in favor of carnival the carlisles say they intend to continue pursuing other aspects of the case yesterday lawyers for mrs sullivan said they were dropping the physician from her case based on the u s supreme court results in the carlisle case the case against royal caribbean is still pending locating ship physicians in the aftermath of an incident is a common problem for passengers who believe theyve been injured onboard foreign doctors often return to their home countries and malpractice cases involving treatment outside the boundaries of the u s generally must be filed in the courts of the physicians country of origin which is complex and expensive "it leaves the passenger who goes on a cruise and gets bad medical care with virtually no remedy " says jason r margulies one of the carlisles lawyers he says his firm has dropped the doctors in more than a dozen malpractice cases when they couldnt locate them cruise industry officials say concerns about onboard health care are overblown and that doctors provide excellent care to hundreds of thousands of passengers each season instances in which patients are unhappy are extremely rare the companies say "all royal caribbean cruises physicians and nurses are committed to providing exceptional diagnostic and urgent medical care to guests and crew on its vessels " says raul duany a spokesman for the company a carnival cruise lines spokeswoman said that among million passengers on its ships over the past years "the incidences of medical malpractice have been so limited as to be statistically insignificant " international regulations dont spell out specific guidelines on ship medical care according to the international maritime organization clia says about of cruise companies including all of the major u s based lines have adopted tougher voluntary guidelines endorsed by the industry those recommendations say doctors should be u s board certified or have at least three years of experience most are trained in emergency medicine according to the companies most ships have at least one doctor and one nurse aboard vessels with more than passengers usually have more clia says upgraded telecommunications also now make it easy for onboard doctors to reach specialists on land in an emergency the queen mary part of carnivals cunard line has hospital beds four of which have cardiac monitoring abilities and a large laboratory for blood work royal caribbean has ships with helicopter landing pads for emergency evacuations still pay for ship doctors is low &# a month compared with nearly &# annually for a starting u s based internist according to
