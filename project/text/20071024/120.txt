the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources iraq meager sacrifices undercut war on terror u s voters have exacerbated the difficulties in the war on terror by refusing to make the sacrifices that citizens shouldered in previous conflicts says alasdair roberts a professor of public affairs in foreign policy while the overreaching by the bush administration most often gets blamed for problems in iraq and afghanistan the decisions made over the past eight years have been equally influenced by a political consensus that has endured since the reagan era a suspicion of government programs and large budget deficits coupled with light regulation of the private sector and the promotion of free trade the problem with these popular principles says prof roberts a professor of public administration at syracuse university is that they impose overly strict limits on what tactics can be pursued against terrorists while mr bush has said that "a time of war is a time of sacrifice " he hasnt asked for much from the electorate especially compared with other wars he has reduced the tax burden to the historical average leaving some important national security programs underfunded meanwhile the publics preference for lax regulation means that efforts to protect crucial infrastructure are carried out with little accountability by the corporate sector one of the few demands mr bush made of citizens after sept that they spend to keep the economy humming led to a marked rise in maritime imports just as policy makers were worrying that port security wasnt tight enough similarly the promoters of the invasion of iraq emphasized how easy they presumed victory would be prof roberts says this proved incorrect but the u s remains unwilling to commit sufficient resources to the struggle even after januarys surge of troops to iraq the u s has fewer troops there than it did in japan years after world war ii these are politically driven decisions prof roberts says "the desires and preferences of the american people have shaped the war on terror just as profoundly as any neoconservative doctrine " foreign policy november december environment vegetarian diet can help planet but rich soil is key vegetarians who tout their diets benefits to the environment might want to brag only if the foods they eat meet certain conditions says brendan i koerner environmental columnist for slate avoiding foods derived from animals will result in lower greenhouse gas emissions than "the standard meat rich american diet " mr koerner says the savings come mostly from the extra energy required to feed animals compared with growing plants a university of chicago study found that a vegetarian diet that includes milk and eggs produces about fewer metric tons of carbon dioxide per person a year roughly the same impact as switching from a chevrolet suburban to a toyota camry if milk and eggs are removed the savings are greater however in situations where land is scarce or soil quality is poor eating meat or dairy products might be the wiser environmental choice chicken farms make better use of land with poor soil than crop farms do also animals eat low quality grain that might otherwise go to waste effectively converting it into nutrient rich dairy products cattle that graze on land deemed unsuitable for crops reduces the need to use fuel to import plant based food from elsewhere a recent cornell university study found that eating two ounces of cooked meat and eggs a day might be better for the environment than forgoing it entirely mr koerner says before carnivores get too excited though mr koerner notes that the two ounces of meat and eggs cited in the cornell study is the optimal maximum and ounces fewer than the average u s consumption the study also assumed that the meat and eggs were grown locally and not frozen and trucked cross country slate oct culture noted female chefs say bias smolders inside the
