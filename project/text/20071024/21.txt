can a world series save a rocky relationship for baseball fans and sportswriters in denver calling for colorado rockies owners dick and charlie monfort to sell the team to someone with deeper pockets has become as much a part of spring as rhapsodizing about the smell of fresh cut grass and the sound of bat meeting ball on may one day after the rockies lost at home to the san francisco giants dropping their record to the web site monfortsmustsell com made its debut "if dick and charlie truly want to see a world series in this state as much as the rest of us real baseball lovers do " denver post columnist mark kiszla wrote eight days later after a rockies loss in arizona "the hapless franchise owners must hang a for sale sign on the rockies " but with those same rockies in the world series that starts tonight in boston thanks to an unheard of string of wins in games by a lineup filled with inexpensive homegrown players the mile high city isnt quite sure what to make of the monforts anymore "this has been the most remarkable entertaining uplifting run of any sports team in denver during my quarter century working in the community " mr kiszla says "but winning of games does not change ownerships record over the last years " the monfort brothers who declined to be interviewed for this article may not qualify as household names nationally but inside colorado their family has reached a level of aristocracy just this side of the coors beer clan their grandfather and father ran an eponymous meatpacking plant out of the plains town of greeley the family sold the company to conagra foods inc in though both brothers remained high level executives in the parent company into the s after the sale with dick serving as president and chief operating officer from to denver mayor john hickenlooper calls their late father ken who was also a powerful state legislator a "legend" in the state generally liked even by detractors the brothers donated over &# million to charity last year through their family foundation charlie monfort the teams chairman and chief executive and dick monfort its vice chairman have preferred to focus more on baseball in recent years they have consolidated power since charlie helped to found the franchise in and dick joined four years later they agreed to buy out lead partner jerry mcmorris in friends point to their differences charlie the bon vivant dick the more serious businessman who used to work to hours a week coloradans used to love the rockies unconditionally from the teams first home game at the now gone mile high stadium where fans cheered them on they helped the young team become the fastest to draw million fans in major league baseball history mr mcmorris recalls chartered flights of fans arriving from as far as salt lake city every weekend but after a single playoff appearance in the team slowly sunk under the weight of massive contracts to free agents like pitchers mike hampton and denny neagle the team sharply cut its payroll the rockies havent signed a top rated free agent since in the meantime they traded name players like outfielder larry walker for minor leaguers and shopped their lone veteran star todd helton as the losses accumulated before this season the rockies finished in no higher than fourth place in their five team division for nine straight seasons so did the criticisms of the monforts "they were dabblers they didnt know what they were doing they should stay in the cattle business thats putting it nicely " is how the attitude is described by don hinchey vice president of communications at bonham group a denver based sports marketing firm more than fans signed an online petition at monfortsmustsell com and some are still adding their names even after the teams miracle finish the monforts havent always helped their own cause with their comments in the media fans became outraged when charlie monfort told the denver post of his teams fiscal policies "if people want to say that we are a minor league team for the yankees and somebody is going to pick matt holliday off for million dollars a year as a free agent so be it " dan lucero a depauw university college student who helps run one of the biggest rockies fan blogs up in the rockies says such statements from the monforts are why they "should probably stop talking to the media every time they do an interview or say something they say something that makes them look bad " denver is again enraptured these days with fans hoarse with whats being called "rockies voice " after announcing it would sell world series tickets only online the teams ticket site crashed monday and it was running slowly yesterday giving fans something other than baseball to complain about on internet message boards the monforts are now receiving credit for keeping general manager dan odowd and manager clint hurdle amid much of the losing an unusual approach in the hair trigger sports world and for investing in a strong minor league system the brothers vowed to raise the teams payroll for at &# million it is less than half that of their world series opponents the red sox but even this euphoric run hasnt prevented some fans from cringing at a colorado business magazine article where dick monfort said the team would "probably" limit itself to offering players contracts no longer than four years in an era when the best players can get seven year deals jason gilligan a denver computer network engineer who runs monfortsmustsell com says of the teams policy on long term deals "why is anybody going to come here if at most youre going to get four years thats bad business practice not that they go after anyone anyway " mr holliday who is the rockies best player is due to be a free agent in and if the outfielder keeps putting up all star numbers he will almost certainly command a longer deal and so even at the highest point in mile high baseball history no one quite knows what will happen once this magical year ends "it gives you chills to hear a capacity crowd to cheer mvp in unison every time matt holliday comes to the plate in the playoffs " mr kiszla the columnist says "what will those same fans be shouting if in the next year or two rockies ownership allows matt holliday to walk away because of finances " corrections &amp amplifications the magazine coloradobiz was incorrectly identified as colorado business its former name in an oct marketplace article about the colorado rockies baseball team wsj nov
