me &amp my car columnist jonathan welsh answers readers questions about automobiles q i own a golf tdi diesel and love it why did vw discontinue their lineup of diesel cars and will a diesel version of the rabbit appear any time soon paul hardwig rochester minn a volkswagen stopped selling cars powered by the previous generation of its diesel engines while preparing to roll out a new diesel that will meet stricter federal pollution standards the bad news concerning the new diesel for the foreseeable future it will be available only in jetta sedans and station wagons not in the rabbit and passat the good news the four cylinder engine will generate horsepower more than before and be available in all states several states including california and massachusetts banned earlier diesels because they didnt burn cleanly enough q most manuals indicate that tires should be inflated to manufacturer specifications for optimal performance why is it that a sealed tire loses pressure at all what would be considered a normal loss in tire pressure versus something that would warrant inspection or service steve wastek phoenix a compressed air oozes or slowly "migrates" through tire rubber resulting in the loss of about one or two pounds of pressure per month more rapid air loss often is indicative of a puncture to slow this seepage some service stations and parts outlets offer to fill tires with nitrogen the nitrogen molecules are larger than oxygen molecules and migrate more slowly staying in the tire longer but since compressed air is about nitrogen anyway the advantage of using a purer form of nitrogen is questionable q i would like your advice on choosing an audi a or a bmw series i would be getting a lightly used model with the more powerful engine option bob gall boulder colo a both cars are attractive luxurious and pleasant to drive as long as you like a firm ride but each car has a distinct personality the audi i think is among the best finished cars available with exterior paint interior decor and hardware such as switches knobs and door handles that few rivals can touch so if beauty matters a lot the audi may outshine the bmw when it comes to driving though the bmw moves ahead i have driven both cars and consistently find the bmw to be more fun to drive part of the reason is that the series is available with a manual transmission that helps involve the driver more in the act of moving between points a and b i also think the bmws steering and overall handling are sharper
