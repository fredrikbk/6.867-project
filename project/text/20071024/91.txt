ode to the red sox online edition special to the wall street journal online the daily fix asked readers who are fans of the rockies and red sox to write an ode to their clubs explaining why they root for them and what characteristics their teams seem to have year in and year out even as the cast of characters changes heres mike bonafide on the boston red sox as near as i can tell ive always been a red sox fan there are ticket stubs in the "baby book" my parents kept and of course my inability to remember a time when i wasnt when my friends and i were growing up in new hampshire every time we picked up a bat or a glove we were dewey evans wade boggs or roger clemens the only real threat to my sox loyalties was an insidious one my parents grew up in new york my father was an old brooklyn dodgers fan and his cousin did some work for the mets i still have a ball he gave me signed by the mets team in my childhood bedroom try reconciling that when youre eight but fortunately good sense prevailed my parents became huge sox fans and despite what may have been the mets best efforts i have never strayed too far i cheered for guys from oil can boyd to mike greenwell to john valentin to rod beck to jason varitek i checked carlton fisks bags at the manchester airport when i was a skycap one summer and it was amazing in late i briefly toyed with the idea of changing my name to dave roberts im sure i wasnt alone the defining characteristic of the sox has always been the fans its more than remarkable that boston turned into a big market franchise even as fans shouldered years of often brutal heartache frankly after the way ended its amazing we even turned the tv back on in but thats the way we operated like trying to leave an abusive relationship wed return even though we knew the outcome would likely be the same except it wasnt our tormentors reformed in and flourished where once they might have stumbled now here we are in and though the same urgency for the ring may not be there the longing sure is before there was "red sox nation " there was what i would call red sox new england and the only dues you had to pay were to live in the area get fox and channel and nesn if you were lucky and root for the sox jerry remy might have been president of that group too but who would have bothered to moderate the debate no matter the players involved the sox have always represented the fans belief in hard work and overcoming challenges thats why as players come and go we come to the park and cheer in winning in and throwing aside the collective emotional wreckage of the greater new england area the sox exemplified the spirit of the fans as they came back from three games down in a best of seven series it is a beautiful burden for a sports team to so fully embody the collective philosophy and aspirations of its fans no wonder red sox nation the real one not the one you pay to join is now truly nationwide the sox certainly give us our ups and downs but we believe that is why we won in why we are here in and why they are our team we dont root for the sox because theyre the sox rather theyre the sox because were the fans so now here we are after an unpredictable year and an amazing series looking back on this year and our team for me the theme is consistent surprise players surprised me from josh beckett stepping up as a clear ace to tim wakefield pitching so well in the early season and dustin pedroia and jacoby ellsbury be serious winning kept surprising me with curt schilling manny ramirez and david ortiz all dealing with injuries and a patched together rotation gamely fighting out the back half of the regular season in game against the indians j d drew surprised us all when he put aside a season largely defined by frustration to get the big hit and become the spark the back half of the lineup needed the team surprised me by not rolling over when the yankees got close in the end and most significantly by overcoming a tremendously talented young indians team sitting on a three games to one lead it wasnt the prettiest season but it got us here of all the sox teams that have looked capable of getting this far this one honestly surprised me but over the course of the year theyve completed their transformation into a team a brawny hairy red machine and thats what now makes me so excited for the world series the rockies are rolling right now and momentum can be a tough th man to face even in game the momentum seemed to swing back and forth all night until pedroia struck it firmly in the direction of lansdowne street once and for all from david and goliath to cinderella all of the cliches have been written about the rockies and theyll be ready to play but sox fans should take heart and sox doubters should take note i dont think the sox are done surprising us quite yet mike bonafide is a lawyer in washington d c he grew up in central new hampshire with his brother and a couple of other characters playing pickle at the beach and long toss in the backyard to offset the negative karma from the mets ball mikes parents took him to pawtucket one summer where he got a sam horn autographed ball the two now defiantly share the same shelf write to him here
