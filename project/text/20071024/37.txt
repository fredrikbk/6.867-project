credit crunch mixed feelings from on high worlds top banker talks about u s rescue plan washington the worlds top banking overseer has reservations about the &# billion rescue package planned by u s banks he also believes the banks could be temporarily at a competitive disadvantage to their foreign rivals because of the slowed implementation of new capital requirements nout wellink the chairman of the basel committee on banking supervision as well as president of the dutch central bank and a member of the european central banks governing council discussed the recent credit market turmoil wall street journal what are your thoughts about this new superconduit that has been proposed mr wellink for the time being i have mixed feelings what is exactly the idea behind it is it a way of escaping your fate because if there is no market at a certain price then youre confronted with losses take these losses as long as its meant to create an orderly process ok but if these artificial elements are involved then immediately the supervisor and the central banker uses the phrase "moral hazard " european banks are not the least interested to participate in this project this is an american initiative and its the banks who created themselves these mortgage problems so the european banks they look from a certain distance wsj european banks are scheduled to implement the new basel ii international capital standards on jan a year before u s banks could this give them a competitive advantage over u s banks who wont implement the standards until mr wellink you might have competitive advantages under turbulent circumstances my smiling japanese colleagues tell me that by introducing basel ii the japanese banking system is suffering less at this very moment japanese regulators implemented basel ii in march well before european and u s regulators wsj what since the credit market turmoil began on aug have we learned about the adequacy of the basel ii requirements mr wellink a number of issues weve been confronted with recently are issues that are solved to a large extent by the basel ii regulations this holds for the conduits for example this holds for credit lines basel ii is an important step in the right direction its not perfect its not the ultimate wisdom we will on the basis of present recent experiences reflect on whether its in all respects the right answer and there will be refinements to my mind theres no doubt about that and in the meantime to use a simple example if all banks would have taken into account in their risk management the existence of conduits it would have been different already this was not the case in all parts of the world but i know from our experience that these banks had no problems whatsoever wsj there are those in the central banking community who feel that the ecbs own actions since aug have been providing a certain kind of encouragement to moral hazard an ex post insurance mr wellink yes i know one of the colleagues has said that a colleague from the u k and then a real moral hazard situation emerged in the u k itself i dont think that what we as central bankers are doing is a moral hazard in that we are not rescuing specific institutions and therefore not giving stimuli to other institutions to "misbehave" in the future were just contributing to the smooth functioning of the financial markets and we withdraw immediately our support and actions the moment markets are going to function again
