worse than you think proponents of educational choice tend to focus on the underprivileged which is understandable given that low income kids are overrepresented in failing inner city public schools but an emphasis on the plight of the poor can leave the impression that middle class public school students are doing fine and that would be a false impression according to a new book length study by the pacific research institute "not as good as you think why the middle class needs school choice " conventional wisdom holds that upscale communities tend to have "good" schools and parents often buy homes in expensive neighborhoods so their kids have a shot at a decent public education but the pri study which focused on california found that in nearly schools in middle class and affluent neighborhoods "less than half of the students in at least one grade level performed at proficiency in state math and english tests " many of these schools were located in the golden states toniest zip codes places like orange county silicon valley and the beach communities of los angeles in areas such as newport beach capistrano and huntington beach where million dollar houses are commonplace researchers found more than a dozen schools where to of students werent proficient in math at their grade level in one silicon valley community where the median home goes for &# million less than half of th and th graders scored at or above proficiency on the state english exam schools serving middle income kids are also doing a poor job of preparing them for higher education some of freshmen in the california state university system need remedial courses and its not because they grew up in watts at dos pueblos high school in ritzy santa barbara only of high school juniors tested college ready for english in slightly better than the of students who did so at san marin high school in marin county where the median home price recently hit &# million "many middle class parents dont think they have a stake in the school choice debate " says lance izumi the lead author of the study in an interview "they assume their schools are doing better than they are " in reality these families would benefit from vouchers tuition tax credits charter schools and other educational options as surely as the inner city single mom and the competitive pressure would help make the surrounding public schools better "when you show people in these communities how their schools arent doing so well how theyre not getting the bang for their buck " says mr izumi "they can begin to see how the debate over school choice affects them too " see related letters "letters to the editor if schools are worse than we think lets get busy on repairs" wsj oct
