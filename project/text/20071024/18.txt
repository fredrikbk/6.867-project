california fires fuel squabbles about readiness as property damage mounted from wind fueled southern california wildfires that have destroyed more than homes in recent days squabbles broke out among government officials over their preparedness and access to firefighting resources the patchwork of at least fires began in coastal malibu sunday morning but aided by some of the driest conditions on record the blazes have quickly spread across more than acres of brush covered hillside in seven counties hundreds of thousands of people have been evacuated many of them in the san diego area where some of the hardest to contain fires are still spreading tens of thousands of local residents sought refuge at locations such as san diegos qualcomm stadium and the historic del mar fairgrounds racetrack just north of the city president bush declared a federal emergency in the seven counties a move that is expected to speed relief efforts with the bush administration determined to apply lessons learned from its missteps in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in the federal emergency management agency on monday set up an office in pasadena calif to coordinate federal state and local aid to the region yesterday fema administrator david paulison and his boss homeland security secretary michael chertoff traveled to california to consider what more can be done president bush is expected to visit too probably tomorrow a firm estimate of property damage is impossible while the fires continue to burn but the insurance information network of california a trade group said insurance claims are likely to reach at least &# million that would still be far below the &# billion in claims paid after a fire in the hills of oakland calif which destroyed homes and remains the most destructive brushfire in california history but with many of the fires showing little sign of being brought under control as of yesterday afternoon state and local officials raised doubts on several fronts about the areas readiness for the blazes that frequently accompany fall in southern california four years after some of the states worst fires ever tore through san diego county and city local government officials have taken limited steps to improve preparedness and still havent adequately staffed or funded fire departments these critics say the city of san diego has been mired in a financial crisis stemming from a pension fund deficit in recent years voters twice rejected proposals to increase hotel taxes as a way to boost funding for local fire and police departments in part because of public concerns about how the city council would manage the extra funds in the citys fire chief jeff bowman resigned in frustration over the citys inability to fund &# million in new fire stations and equipment maurice luque a spokesman for the san diego fire rescue department said the city which covers more than square miles needs to add fire stations to the current and more firefighters in order to meet its goal of responding to incidents within five minutes the city now has fewer than firefighters about the same number as five years ago and they havent received pay raises in three years "san diegos financial challenges affect all departments including the fire department " mr luque said still mr luque pointed to improvements that have helped save lives if not buildings during the current fires since the last big fires the city and county have implemented reverse an automated communication system that has been used in recent days to contact about households and urge them to evacuate reverse is a unit of plantcml a closely held temecula calif company the san diego fires caused one death compared with at least in the areas fires there were reports of four additional deaths in the region according to a san diego county spokeswoman a total of about residents have been ordered to evacuate and have been advised to do so rick sanborn chief executive officer at a bank in a san diego suburb packed up his family around noon on monday hours before mandatory evacuations went into effect in his carmel valley neighborhood "it took about four hours to go through the whole house and then i videotaped everything that was left " said the year old mr sanborn after that he his wife and their two children drove to the coastal community of la jolla where they are staying at his father in laws country club though the evacuation order for his gated community of homes remains in effect a neighbor returned there yesterday afternoon and called him to report that all was well steve erie a political science professor at the university of california in san diego and author of a forthcoming book on the citys political and fiscal turmoil said he believes that as far as the fires are concerned "the only lessons applied were those that dont cost any money in terms of new fire prevention or fighting capabilities we have barely made any progress " mr erie noted that unlike los angeles county san diego doesnt have a countywide fire department he said the county outside san diegos city limits is a "hodgepodge" of operations that range from relatively well funded to what he calls "bake sale funded departments " meanwhile marshalling existing resources has proved complicated with the arrival of six c military aerial tankers state officials said at least tankers and helicopters were deployed around the seven county region to dump fire retardant chemicals some two dozen more aircraft were preparing for action or were already on the way but with state county and local agencies overwhelmed by the sheer number of fires and flames in some areas fanned by winds approaching miles per hour there were escalating concerns about the availability and effectiveness of airborne tankers "weve had some difficulty getting air assets " said chip prather the fire chief of orange county which is located south of los angeles early yesterday his department fought a square mile blaze using firefighters and fire engines "with more air resources we would have been able to control this fire " he said mr prather said it wasnt until the fire had consumed more than acres that the first aircraft arrived to aid ground crews "there are not enough resources to go around either air or ground resources " he told reporters state assemblyman todd spitzer who represents parts of orange county complained during a news conference about the way firefighting aircraft were distributed "i do believe we have been penalized" by failing to get aerial tankers earlier he said alleging that the previous success of fire crews in keeping a lid on the main orange county blaze prompted state officials to send those tankers elsewhere mr spitzer also criticized state coordinating officials for a lack of planning that prevented local fire commanders in other jurisdictions from tapping the help that was available on monday he said "san diego was eligible for air support and local officials didnt even know it " a spokesman for the governors office said aircraft are being dispatched "as quickly as possible " and "there is no holding back on our end " peter sanders and john r emshwiller contributed to this article
