the religious left and living wage a matter of faith not politics in response to the oct editorial page commentary "the rise of the religious left" by steven malanga mr malangas analysis of the religious left is particularly one sided while i have always considered myself a conservative person and a republican i must say that the appeal of the religious left is much more consistent with the traditional judeo christian views upon which i was raised in order to offer a more balanced view on the religious left vs the religious right lets look at the historical track record of these two groups the religious left is consistently anti war which appears to have appalled mr malanga the religious right seeks to justify war on terms which would advance their beliefs i e the crusades the religious left actively fought to end segregation and slavery while these practices lasted for centuries in the backyard of the religious right the religious left seeks tolerance and forgiveness the religious right seems to seek to damn those opposed to its views while it is true as mr malanga pointed out that the economic views of the religious left dont make very much sense from a rational policy perspective i am not aware of any stellar economic policies being advocated by the religious right lets remember that the religious right doesnt oppose communism solely on economic grounds but because communism is atheistic at the end of the day the right to vote is my own and not that of the religious left or right while i will enter the voting booth with all my rational knowledge of the secular and the sacred in my head it is the message of the religious left that i carry in my heart tom hart charlotte n c mr malangas commentary brought to light a concern that must be addressed over questionable alliances between the clergy and the unions the clergy certainly does remain quiet over another far more virulent cause of poverty the growing numbers of girls having babies before they are able to even provide for themselves my one challenge to mr malanga is to note that while he was no doubt trying to be politically correct in lumping rabbis with the rest of the clergy and synagogues with the churches that invite union leaders to speak from their altars this is hard to believe union leaders would not have a welcoming audience in most synagogues no jewish organization is involved with interfaith worker justice if he can name any specifically then i will stand corrected marilyn bricklin lebovitz yardley pa as a bona fide long time member of the religious left i couldnt resist reading mr malangas commentary the first thing i learned growing up as a follower of jesus was to love my fellow man how many times has scripture shown jesus reaching out for those in need action not words is needed eric piper corona del mar calif mr malanga ignores the depth of religious concern for and teaching about hunger and poverty ending poverty is a faith question witness the thousands of congregations that provide food and shelter for poor people the new emergence of a faith led effort around raising wages benefits and working conditions reflects the maturity and sophistication of the religious communitys fight against poverty this is not a left wing matter this is a matter of faith the religious leaders i know do not "blindly refuse to acknowledge" academic research on rising wages but rather understand that those who oppose raising wages and benefits for low wage workers have historically trotted out studies to "prove" that keeping the minimum wage at a certain level is necessary for a healthy economy more than of the american public including most people of faith supported raising the minimum wage kim bobo executive director interfaith worker justice chicago mr malangas excellent essay points out how members of the religious left are resistant to the findings of economic science e g as regards wage policy notoriously the religious right is strongly resistant to the findings of natural science e g evolutionary theory cosmology etc this suggests that the opposition to grounded and established scientific theories and facts is not due to political orientation stephen r gould merrick n y mr malanga may indeed rightly argue that living wage laws result in the loss of low wage jobs this does not diminish the fact that the church has a role in establishing a just society mr malanga points out that much of the economic plight of the poor is the result of the irresponsible "sinful" choice to have children out of wedlock and personal responsibility is indeed crucial for the pursuit of a productive and moral life however one cannot ignore the systematic forces in our culture and economy that perpetuate climates that foster the types of choices that mr malanga lambasts indeed these are also "sinful" forces at work mr malanga may disagree with the particular policies like living wage laws that churches are advocating for but the spirit of their work is just and right it is the role of the church to stand up for those whom the system does not favor dave kwok director of operations the river church community san jose calif mr malangas essay reminded me of my discussions over the years with a number of ministers including my father who was a protestant minister on issues of the minimum wage living wage unions income redistribution and inequality all the ministers i have known have been very liberal however they have never been exposed to free market economic arguments or to any opposing moral arguments theyve not considered for example that their preferred governmental solutions require the use of force ive never "converted" a minister to free market capitalism not even my father but i have persuaded some that religious people can hold such views in good faith my advice to entrepreneurs and anyone who favors individual liberty and free markets when your minister condemns your views or livelihood as greedy exploitative or unjust speak up but be gentle they know not what they do michael b hays leawood kan
