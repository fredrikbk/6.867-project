worlds central bankers struggle with good times for developing nations flood of foreign money spurs inflation threat like many central bankers in the developing world russias konstantin korishchenko is struggling to cope with a dramatic reversal of fortune in august of he remembers trying in vain to stave off a massive government default as foreign investors deserted the country and the ruble collapsed now he faces the opposite problem wealth pouring into russia is pushing the ruble higher and swelling the governments coffers harming exports overexpanding foreign reserves and making it hard to stem inflation "in russia we have a saying " says mr korishchenko now the russian central banks deputy chairman "having things too good is also not so good " a similar turnaround is playing out from thailand to india to brazil and beyond a decade after some of these countries battled currency crises theyre struggling with currencies strengthening too fast one big factor is the shrinking dollar once central bankers in many of these places stood helplessly as u s officials trotted the globe offering advice on how to navigate financial upheaval alongside a rising u s currency now the fallout of the dollars long slide includes the difficulties of overheated investment and mountains of reserves the investment wave into emerging markets has been building since now its a tsunami financial flows into these countries in the first half of this year have already exceeded the total for all of the international monetary fund says "it is a new world " says jim oneill head of global economic research at goldman sachs "when was the last time such a broad group of developing countries faced upward pressure on their currencies i dont think in the history of floating exchange rates " the investment influx is a better problem to have than the crises of old say central bankers but it presents its own complex challenges many central bankers having lived through the crises of the s in the formative parts of their careers are wary of what they call short term "hot money" pouring into their economies lest it rush out again meanwhile as their countries currencies strengthen their exports become more expensive abroad a serious problem in economies geared toward trade the typical response by central bankers has been to try to prevent their currencies from strengthening too quickly to do that they buy dollars thats a prime reason why emerging markets have more than doubled their reserves since to a forecast &# trillion this year according to the imf that accumulation causes problems countries are sitting on massive u s dollar assets that they may not need those holdings including u s treasury bonds are losing value thanks to the greenbacks swoon at the same time to decrease inflation pressure some developing countries are issuing local bonds to take money out of circulation and paying higher interest rates on those debts "it certainly looks like theyre wasting a lot of money " says kenneth rogoff an economics professor at harvard university especially in poor countries in need of infrastructure slowing the appreciation of a currency also hampers a countrys ability to fight inflation partly because prices of imported goods dont fall as much as they could thats important because inflation is perking up in a range of developing countries in russia for instance price increases could top in breaking an eight year trend of declining annual inflation rates "there are no easy solutions " says raghuram rajan a finance professor at the university of chicago and a former imf official "in general people are worried about losing their competitive edge especially if demand from the u s slows down and youre fighting one another for the crumbs " the situation is complicated by china keeping a tight rein on its yuan through restrictions on capital flows and massive government buying of dollars countries that compete with china for exports are reluctant to let their currencies strengthen rapidly in a bid to reduce the heat some countries including thailand and colombia have slapped restrictions on foreign investment most others are trying to manage the pressure on their currencies by soaking up dollars and parking them away in their vaults even as the dollars fall in value some like india and korea are trying to get money flowing in the opposite direction encouraging local investors to buy overseas theyre also rethinking how they manage reserves next year for instance russia will take a small portion of its reserves and seek to invest it more aggressively going beyond bonds issued by governments and into global stocks china has already made a similar move earlier this month brazil said it was looking at setting up a new fund to invest some of its &# billion of reserves differently too at the start of one brazilian real bought about cents while now it fetches roughly cents an increase of more than in the same period the south korean won has risen against the dolllar the thai baht the russian ruble and the indian rupee those figures would likely be higher if those governments didnt intervene in the currency markets to slow the increase the chinese yuan has appreciated against the dollar in the same period the rising currencies also bring benefits to these countries they make it easier for governments and companies to borrow in their own money instead of in dollars they also make imports less expensive a boon for economies that are looking to modernize in brazil a more robust real has opened the window for manufacturers and others to invest in new machinery and equipment from abroad hospitals have gone on a buying spree pent up demand has driven up imports of cat scanners and other hospital equipment by about a year still such beefed up buying power isnt enough to ease the larger worries about massive inflows and strengthening currencies some countries are beginning to react more assertively to try to manage the problem in india the rupees rise has cut into the profit margins of the countrys vaunted software exporters leading some tech executives to complain the currency change is happening too fast "it is the suddenness at which the exchange rate changed that is the worry " said s ramadorai chief executive officer of tata consultancy services indias largest software company in a july interview mr ramadorai said the company was questioning whether it should do such a large proportion of its work in india as a result the indian government introduced tax breaks in july aimed at helping local manufacturers hurt by the stronger currency brazil and thailand announced similar measures this summer in early september y v reddy indias central bank governor warned an audience in stockholm of a "dilemma" for emerging economies in "grappling with inherently volatile increasing capital flows " later that month the central bank tried a different tack it removed some of the barriers to investing overseas in a bid to get more money flowing out rather than in to ease the upward pressure on the rupee it didnt work the money pouring into india kept increasing swamping any movements in the opposite direction in just two weeks at the end of september indias foreign exchange reserves increased by &# billion or nearly half the rise for all of last year on october indian officials went a step further the stock market regulator announced a proposal to restrict a popular method used by foreigners to invest in the countrys stock market p chidambaram indias finance minister told an investment conference in new york on october that the measures to damp investment would be needed "until we gain mastery of the situation " he added "liquidity from developed economies is spilling over into india " its a marked change from when indian policy makers spent several harrowing months making sure the asian financial crisis didnt spread to their country then the rupee fell more than against the dollar in six months and the bank spent as much as &# billion a month in scarce reserves to defend the currency recalls bimal jalan the central bank governor at the time thailand the epicenter of the asian financial crisis has had one of the most dramatic reversals back then tarisa watanagase supervised the countrys deeply troubled banks last year she was placed in charge of the bank of thailand by a new government controlled by the countrys armed forces on a monday afternoon last december the central bank announced an effective tax discouraging foreign investment it required investors to deposit a portion of the money they brought into the country in interest free accounts with the central bank for at least a year the move was a bid to stem the rise of the baht by reducing demand for it exporters complained the rising currency was killing their competitiveness the last time an asian country had instituted similar controls was in malaysia back in only then the goal was to keep foreigners from yanking money out thailand wanted to hinder them from bringing so much in the controls crushed the stock market temporarily and the government quickly lifted the provision that applied to shares once the rules were modified sentiment toward thai stocks recovered and the market is now higher than the day the controls were instituted but despite the efforts the bahts appreciation continues it has strengthened against the dollar since then ms tarisa has said she worries the dollar has further to fall and many of her problems havent gone away in july a large struggling thai garment factory shut its doors blaming pressure from the rising baht workers protested by blockading a road "there are strong and vocal constituencies that are averse to currency appreciation " ms tarisa who holds a doctorate from washington university in st louis said in a speech in september that means a "deft balancing act" for central bankers she said "one fine day we can see hot money flowing into the country not long after we can easily witness a reversal of such flows " the risks and volatility she added "are of unprecedented scale " her feelings are echoed by russias mr korishchenko a genial bespectacled year old sitting in his spacious central moscow office where the walls are studded with mounted sets of commemorative coins and banknotes he describes his main challenges guarding against sudden swings in the value of a strengthening ruble and keeping a lid on inflation mr korishchenko helps oversee the banks interventions in the currency markets which lately involve mostly buying foreign currencies and salting them away in the banks reserves russia manages the ruble against the dollar and the euro closely his goal he says is to prevent extreme moves in either direction a large inflow of money into a country "is an equally bad thing as a huge outflow " mr korishchenko says russias foreign exchange reserves have swelled from &# billion in august to more than &# billion holding down the rubles rise runs up against another policy priority fighting inflation prices for staples like milk and flour are soaring if the ruble were allowed to strengthen more rapidly it would make it even cheaper to buy imports bringing down the prices of many products and increasing competition in the domestic economy currency intervention works against that central bank intervention in currency markets fuels inflation in another way central bank purchases of dollars in exchange for rubles in theory increases the supply of rubles in russias financial system further stimulating the economy central bankers try to minimize this impact in a technical process known as sterilization but its an imperfect and often costly solution "its a dilemma " mr korishchenko says "in principle the appreciation of the ruble by several percentage points would be a very effective measure in fighting inflation but from a political and social point of view it is impossible to implement " largely due to opposition from local manufacturers the rubles upward trend is already affecting trade making it more attractive to import goods and more challenging for exporters mr korishchenko says the oil exporting giant may soon run a trade deficit its surplus shrank by between january and august of this year to &# billion despite all of the oil it sells overseas imports outstripped exports last year the president of the russian union of industrialists complained to president vladimir putin about the rubles appreciation at a kremlin meeting "the national currency is gaining muscle so fast that a good deal of industry cannot adapt " he said at a conference later this month the imf which was at the center of russias bailout urged the government to let the ruble rise further to combat inflation mr korishchenko praises the "dialogue" with the imf but he says russia sets its own agenda james hookway in bangkok and antonio regalado in
