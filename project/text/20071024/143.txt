market leading position to u k jeweler signet group plc the operator of kay jewelers in the u s the company also has several store brands zales gordons zales outlet peoples jewellers and mappins jewellers which makes it difficult to plot a broad cohesive strategy history also isnt on zales side some investors felt burned by a directionless strategy of years past from to chief executive mary forte tried to introduce silver and gold high fashion jewelry to compete with the likes of tiffany consumers werent having it holiday sales suffered and ms forte among others was forced to quit given this a coherent workable strategy could be key to the stock price and to keeping those hedge funds happy asset sales might also be key given the number of brands zales vice president and treasurer david sternblitz says the company is aiming to keep only brands that meet or exceed corporate average returns he declined to discuss any potential asset sales but with high end business bailey banks

drive the top line " zales mr sternblitz said the companys tactic however appeared more as way to ease pressure on its troubled reputation and rally the confidence of shareholders two other factors may prop up the stock for a while yet the whiff of a deal signet group pushed for talks with zale in the spring of and the presence of those three hedge funds it isnt clear exactly what the hedge fund

didnt return calls seeking comment mr sternblitz says in several conversations zales management has had with the hedge fund mangers theyve said they think the company is undervalued with "significant cash flow potential " "a number of things that management is doing is in line with what some of their recommendations would be " he said while ms burton acknowledges consumers are curbing spending right now because of gas prices and the housing crisis she sees some things zale can do zale executives said an unspecified new product line will be launched in time for the holidays the company is reissuing the popular "journey" diamond pendant which rival de beers sells versions of at higher prices zale said it will promote the holiday line with last years commercials featuring vanessa carltons hit "a thousand miles " using the same ads keeps spending flat but critics wonder if consumers might want something more fresh management also wants to whittle down its &# million inventory part of which is discounted jewelry by offering more discounts in stores and online during the holiday season this inventory has grown almost every quarter as its high priced products have failed to attract customers j p morgan analyst brian tunick blamed company mismanagement for zales inventory problems "the message is not very clear from the leadership of zale down to the stores employees and store managers " he said this lack of communication has hurt morale
