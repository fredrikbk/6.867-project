the surveillance law that matters i have never met judge michael mukasey and i have no strong feelings on who should be our next attorney general but after four decades studying and writing about national security aspects of our constitution i believe congress and the american people must understand that some of the issues raised in mr mukaseys confirmation hearings are far more complex than they may initially appear take for example sen pat leahys question to mr mukasey about whether the president has the power to violate the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa i know that statute well having worked in the senate when it was enacted in and later serving as the senior white house lawyer under president reagan charged with overseeing the implementation of fisa and other intelligence laws the real issue here is not whether the president is "above the law " but rather which "law" he must see "faithfully executed" when there is a conflict between the constitution and an inconsistent statute his highest duty i submit is to the constitution itself in chief justice john marshall declared in marbury v madison "an act of the legislature repugnant to the constitution is void " from the earliest days of our history until fisa was enacted it was understood by all three branches that the constitution had left the president to quote "federalist " "able to manage the business of intelligence as prudence might suggest " when congress passed the first wiretap statute in it expressly declared that nothing in it would limit "the constitutional power of the president" to collect foreign intelligence information every administration from fdr to and including jimmy carter engaged in warrantless foreign intelligence wiretapping in the belief that this was one of the "exceptions" to the fourth amendments warrant requirement others include border searches and searches of commercial airline passengers and their luggage not to mention the requirement imposed by congress that citizens entering a congressional office building to exercise their constitutional right to petition their government for redress of grievances must submit to a warrantless search absent the slightest probable cause in carter administration attorney general griffin bell told the senate that fisa "does not take away the power of the president under the constitution" but he explained that the statute could nevertheless work because president carter was "agreeing to follow the statutory procedure " that was mr carters prerogative as it is president bushs but neither they nor congress may take away the constitutional power of future presidents the foreign intelligence surveillance court of review composed of federal appeals court judges noted in a unanimous opinion that every federal court to decide the issue held the president has constitutional power to authorize warrantless foreign intelligence electronic surveillance the opinion added "fisa could not encroach on the presidents constitutional power " the supreme court has had at least six opportunities to limit presidential power in this area in the katz case that first required a warrant for wiretaps the court expressly exempted "national security" wiretaps from its holding when it required a warrant for national security wiretaps of purely domestic targets in it exempted electronic surveillance of the "activities of foreign powers and their agents" in this country on four other occasions it declined to hear cases on appeal where it had the opportunity to impose a warrant requirement on foreign intelligence electronic surveillance much contemporary debate over presidential claims of power to ignore "laws" fails to appreciate the modern congressional practice of enacting flagrantly unconstitutional statutes this helps explain the increased use of presidential "signing statements" in recent decades on june sen robert p griffin r mich inserted a lengthy statement id drafted into the congressional record explaining why "legislative vetoes" of executive agency actions were unconstitutional seven years later the supreme court echoed those arguments in reaching the same conclusion in the chadha case the congressional response it has since enacted more than new unconstitutional legislative vetoes mr mukasey rightly promised to resign rather than violate his oath of office if the "president proposed to undertake a course of conduct that was in violation of the constitution" and could not be dissuaded for precisely the same reason he was also right to refuse to be bound by unconstitutional acts of congress like fisa that usurp presidential power any senator who elects to vote against him because of this issue has a duty to explain to the american people by what theory an unconstitutional statute has suddenly taken on a superior position to the constitution itself mr turner holds both professional and academic doctorates from the university of virginia school of law where he cofounded the center for national security law in he is a former three term chairman of the american bar associations standing committee on law and national security see related
