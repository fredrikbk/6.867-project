taking it verizon estimates david barden an analyst with banc of america predicts that verizon will have two million fios tv customers by the end of ranking it as the ninth biggest provider of television service in the country after the top six cable operators and the two main satellite tv firms cable industry executives who two years ago scoffed at verizons plans have changed their tune "verizon is real " steve burke comcast corps chief operating officer said last month at an investor conference "verizon is taking video customers from us " verizons growing market clout is a complicating factor in todays vote by shareholders in cablevision systems corp on whether to accept the dolan familys &# billion offer to take the company private while some prominent institutional shareholders have warned they may vote against the deal believing the price isnt high enough others are worried by the long term impact of tougher competition proponents of the offer note that cablevision has far more exposure than any other cable operator to verizons fios network the outcome of the vote appears to be too close to call cablevision declined to comment fios uses fiber optics to deliver television faster internet services and phone like similar cable packages it typically costs a little under &# a month for all three services cable systems use fiber optics in their networks as well but depend on coaxial cables to get the service into homes the fios network has far more capacity for high definition tv channels online games and downloading and uploading files it also offers a few premium features that cable companies dont offer like digital video recorders that can pipe recordings to different tvs in the house on a national level fios promises to change the balance of power among cable telephone and satellite tv companies over which one can offer consumers the most attractive combinations of the latest tv phone and high speed internet services until recently cable companies were winning they have about a share of the high speed internet market and were much faster in breaking into phone service than phone companies were in offering tv about million of the roughly million households that can get phone service from their cable operators subscribe to that service phone company at&amp t inc has launched tv service and has been upgrading its high speed internet network but at&amp t has been hoping to get by with a less expensive internet technology that service known as u verse has been plagued with delays and software problems although

and new features as verizon for example cablelabs the industrys research and development arm is developing a next generation of broadband technology that backers say can deliver faster broadband speeds than verizon is offering to be sure the damage fios does to cables business could be limited verizon at this point plans to offer the service to nearly three quarters of the households in its

investors who are opposed to the dolans plan say they arent too concerned about fios they predict that the company will more than make up for the loss of tv subscribers by taking telephone business away from verizon also cable companies in the past have successfully battled back against so called overbuilders companies that have built competing wired tv systems "fios is just another overbuilder and cable has trashed them " says mario gabelli whose gamco investors inc owns an stake in cablevision and who is planning to vote "no" today to taking the company private but a recent analysis by jason bazinet analyst with citi investment research found that cable customers are signing up for fios tv at four times the rate that cable customers are signing up for cable phone mr bazinets advice for cablevision investors "take the money and run "
