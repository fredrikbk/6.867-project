in the fray a stinging rebuke but consider the source blender magazine which treats men like boys women like chattel and rock music like a soundtrack for cretins recently published its list of "the worst songs ever " in its current issue it follows with "the worst lyricists ever " surely the culture is better off for its musical anthropology blender may be beyond caricature but it isnt much worse than most rock magazines aimed at young men or magazines for young men that occasionally feature rock music its not paste the best among american music titles but no magazine i know of has anyone assigned to rock who writes as well in his field as alex ross writes on classical music in the new yorker thumbing through the "laddies " as the brits call magazines such as maxim and blender readers suffer a dozen writers who can tell you which rock star is dating which model and how much bling bling the latest rapper wears but its hard to find more than a handful of magazine journalists who know music and understand how rock continues to develop as a genre and who can write well which brings us back to blender it bills itself as "your music buddy" and "the ultimate guide to music and more " but music isnt its thing it covers and exploits the marginally talented currently popular and easily ridiculed people who do something involving music the magazine claims a circulation of which is rather impressive but to paraphrase something miles davis once told me in another context "somebody must like it but i dont " as someone who grew up on ben fong torres and cameron crowe who is now a notable hollywood writer and director in rolling stone and graduated to whitney balliett in the new yorker as well as leonard feather and our own nat hentoff wherever they chose to write i expect more for example "the worse lyricists ever " is actually more modest in scope than its hysterical headline would suggest its about one or two bad verses by some rather talented songwriters including paul mccartney bernie taupin alanis morissette smashing pumpkinss billy corgan and death cab for cuties ben gibbard this last is accused of being "the type whos sensitive wears glasses likes long conversations " so much for finely honed music criticism at the top of blenders list is sting while he can be skin crawlingly pretentious in his writing hes also crafted some gorgeous lyrics a book out this week "lyrics by sting " features his words to some songs and demonstrates the highs and lows of his writing but if blender is right and rocks worst lyricist is the man who wrote such moving songs as "fragile" and "they dance alone " and whose words for "message in a bottle" and "driven to tears" are a perfect match for the music we must be surrounded by lyrical geniuses either too obscure or too hip for the likes of you and me "the worst songs ever " feature indicts "the sounds of silence" by simon &amp garfunkel and "ob la di ob la da" by the beatles some achingly sincere tunes like five for fightings "superman" which helped soothe first responders after the attacks bette midlers version of "from a distance " it also includes a bunch of harmless party songs like "everybody have fun tonight" by wang chung and billy ray cyruss "achy breaky heart " which was once sung to me by a cab driver in budapest as a demonstration of his mastery of english their all time worst song is starships "we built this city " ok they may have a point there id argue that the songs and lyrics on the list are not appreciably worse that the best work of the cavalcade of the artistically challenged blender celebrates in its current issue pete doherty of babyshambles who is shown feeding crack to a cat former pussycat dolls nicole scherzinger who augments her musical skills by posing topless here and hip hops baby who tells us he did three years in jail on a gun rap and lets his kids play with one dollar bills the promising singer songwriter johnathan rice is dubbed "jenny lewiss talented arm candy " referencing the leader of the popular indie band rilo kiley mr rice describes her as "the best songwriter ive ever met " as evidence blender cites this ms kiley lyric "an investment banker started something so i broke his neck " what the people who appear on the "worse" lists have in common is they arent particularly popular with blenders focus demographic which is affluent males under which is fine many of them were one hit wonders or did their best work decades ago its always a good time to welcome creative new music and musicians and i could fill a blender sized magazine with features on wonderful new artists whod rather not promote their work by celebrating their drug use toting criminal background playing model or being identified by who theyre dating the problem is and i cant tell you how badly i hope im wrong here some readers may think blender is a music magazine and that what they do is actual music criticism that putting down year old pop tunes and selectively panning gifted songwriters is a merely a dumbed down form of qualitative analysis its not even blenders cd reviews some written by critics who know better take a flip tone that suggests the subject is disposable and thoroughly banal blender and its peers wait for others the recording industry tv and hollywood the police blotter to declare whats hip in its current issue it places "dont stop believin" by journey among "the greatest songs ever " why in part because of its association with the finale of "the sopranos " maybe its me but i dont find "dont stop believin " a candy coated piece of springsteen lite any less calculating than "we build this city " the lyrics work for the song but would you say they are considerably better than stings worst they must be tony soprano thinks so mr fusilli is the journals rock and pop music critic
