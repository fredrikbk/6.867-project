running underground to sharpen nikes edge ceo taps influencers house built by athletes hires a tattoo artist mr parker and the twins beaverton ore nikes iconic co founder philip h knight built the company by sealing endorsement deals with sports heroes such as michael jordan and tiger woods but under current chief executive mark parker nike is also depending on lesser known figures like a los angeles tattoo artist known as mister cartoon though far from mainstream mr cartoon rivals nikes high profile jocks for influence among a certain crowd that is young latino and hip hop his ink on flesh flourishes are popular with rappers like eminem and cent born mark machado mr cartoon has also written comic book style graphic novels and created a brand called joker to sell t shirts and baseball caps with his designs nikes mr parker who met mr cartoon several years ago calls him an "aesthetic influence and a friend " so far the artist has designed six lines of limited edition shoes for nike ranging in price from &# to &# they include a version of the companys classic air force basketball shoe that nods to what mr cartoon calls the "old icons of the gangsters" skulls and roses dark tenements and "sexy female clowns " the heel of one model is adorned with the initials "l a " rendered in gothic letters athletes still rule at nike but the game is changing nikes traditional endorsement strategy has taken a few hits recently it dumped nfl star michael vick from its lineup in the wake of his august guilty plea in a criminal dog fighting case more recently one of its most prominent former pitchwomen track star marion jones admitted to using performance enhancing steroids after years of staunch denials meanwhile delivering the sales growth mr parker has promised wall street a increase in revenue to &# billion by means expanding nikes hold on fickle style conscious consumers the company hasnt lost its traditional focus on pure sports utilitarian design and performance just yesterday nike penned a &# million deal to acquire umbro plc the british soccer brand but now nikes vast expansion has created pressure to broaden and deepen its appeal even among non athletic types mr knight recently told mr parker "your job is way more difficult than my job was " mr parker sees the challenge thusly "the question is how do you not let your size become a disadvantage how do you keep an edge a crispness a relevance " one answer for many marketers over the years has been to divine the future to find the most cutting edge trend sniffing individuals and set them loose to formulate new ideas new products such "coolhunters " as some types are known scour the globes streets stores clubs and hidden haunts picking up clues as to whats hot whats next they then interpret their findings to help companies better resonate with their core audience at nike the drive to recruit under the radar influencers like mr cartoon is on the rise and a key part of the companys strategy while other sneaker makers have also called on cultural soothsayers to shape their aesthetic agenda mr parker has taken the practice all the way to the executive suite acting as the companys ambassador of cool "i have a personal interest in popular culture and the influence of culture on the consumer landscape " says mr parker rattling off the words he turns to for inspiration interior design cuisine art and music among them following his own instincts mr parker has moved to aggressively link nike with those who can help maintain the companys standing among what he calls the "influencers of influencers " the year old mr parker plumbs a global network of friends including artists djs designers and other early adopters for tips on who might be able to confer credibility on the company the result mr parker says is a bit like social networking on the internet its about "looking peripherally not just straight ahead " in addition to mr cartoon mr parker has fostered nike collaborations with a new york graffiti artist named lenny futura the industrial designer marc newson and a pair of twin brazilian muralists known as os gemeos the idea of such projects is to create an insiders buzz that widens out as it is discovered by consumers closer to the mainstream its a way of combating the stale homogeneity of big budget tv marketing campaigns which can seem monolithic its difficult to value the impact of such novel moves however especially compared with the ease of cataloging how many jordan brand shoes and shirts the company sells each year with support from major marketing campaigns unlike ads that plaster the sides of buildings with the towering image of superstars like lebron james one of nikes top basketball endorsers these projects seek to get under the consumers skin in far less obvious ways that means rationing quantities of unusual nike goods to be sold not just in sneaker shops but also in upscale venues like colette the paris fashion boutique and moss the new york city design store earlier this year in an episode of the hbo series "entourage " about a hollywood star and his posse a character named turtle hotly pursued a pair of customized limited edition nike air force sneakers supposedly designed by a japanese artist the gold and black shoes covered in graffiti like laser etchings were actually the creation of mark smith one of nikes top shoe designers they caused a frenzy among the fashion crowd nike has cultivated a pair fetched more than &# on ebay shortly after the episode aired mr parkers broad interests have been key to developing this newer side of nikes consumer proposition the more style conscious world of so called sneakerhead culture that revels in cool design and keeps the brand relevant for young consumers world wide who arent sports junkies mr futura the brooklyn based graffiti artist found himself on the road in tokyo with mr parker after the executive approached the artist in his studio and soon after invited him for a tour of japan "he was getting into a lot of these japanese artists " recalls mr futura their hyper realistic styles particularly fascinated him on the surface mr parker seems deeply wedded to nikes sports rich past hes a nike lifer having started at the company in its earliest days he worked not only with mr knight but also the late bill bowerman the oregon track coach who is nikes co founder and spiritual mascot mr parkers conversations are liberally peppered with nike maxims that convey his status as a true believer in the power of the swoosh but the ceo is drawn as naturally to art and culture as he is to sport his beaverton office is a menagerie of oddball toys he has obsessively collected for years a huge caricature painting of keith richards by the german artist sebastian kruger looms behind his desk leaning in a corner matter of factly is a beat up stratocaster guitar once owned by jimi hendrix looking to unwind after a summer board meeting mr parker flew to see a surf themed exhibition at californias laguna art museum arriving at nike in he started out as a manager in the companys advanced product design labs where he eventually began designing shoes even back then mr parker was tuning his ear to offbeat creative sources outside the company he once paid a call to the novelist ken kesey who was a star wrestler in college to get "some ideas" on wrestling shoes mr parker later worked on signature brands such as the air pegasus running shoe his breakthrough came in with the invention of the "visible air " which showed off the hidden cushioning system of nikes successful air max line the new idea came after fellow designer tinker hatfield visited the centre pompidou the controversial parisian art museum where gas and electric lines are exposed on the exterior the two decided to cut away at the shoes sole revealing its innards in a new futuristic way in the s mr parker headed up footwear research and design later continuing on to executive positions in product marketing and in the global footwear division his ascent to the top job began in when mr knight tapped him and nike sales guru charlie denson to serve as co presidents of the nike brand but when mr knight left the ceopost in he announced a surprise successor an outsider named william perez the former chief executive of s c johnson &amp son mr perez had cut his teeth on mundane consumer products like windex and drano and nikes tight internal culture rejected him in mr knight pulled the plug and mr perez was ousted mr parker then stepped in as ceo he brought to the role something different than his predecessors a vast creative network years in the making much of the groundwork had been laid well in advance the previous year he had teamed up with artist mr cartoon for a shoe launch in venice calif that among other things involved directing a crane to lift a two ton low rider ice cream truck into a nike rented house "they had to knock off the front wall " recalls mr cartoon in a later event mr cartoon helped nike set up a boxing ring in los angeles union station to fete his new air force "cinco de mayo mexico" limited edition shoe traveling by corporate jet mr parker frequents other cities where new influencers might be found new york london paris tokyo a "friend from milan whos quite well connected in the art world" first pointed him to os gemeos a brazilian duo their street murals featuring lanky yellow skinned caricatures attracted the executive with their "primitive" elements that were "folksy with a pop twist " so last year mr parker drafted the twins for nikes world cup campaign commissioning os gemeos to paint houses in europe asia and the u s that were inspired by brazilian shanty towns privately mr parker introduced them to friends at new yorks jeffrey deitch gallery the art house that now represents the twins he had other plans for them since the early s the company has labored to gain footing in the hard to crack skate market in os gemeos art he saw an "overlap" between "the skate culture and the art culture " and so as nike promoted the twins abroad os gemeos provided designs for limited runs of collectible shoes to be sold only at hip independent retailers "skateboarding is not corporate and most skaters and true skate shops are anti establishment " says james jebbia founder of supreme the storied new york skate retailer who adds that nike nevertheless has managed to "adjust to the way we do business " specifically they kept the skate shoes out of mall type chains like foot locker which carry many other nike shoes not everyone is so anxious to see nike roll into new turf recently designer steve "birdo" guisinger owner of a small but influential santa cruz calif retailer called consolidated skateboards painted three wheel less skateboard "decks" with images that lampooned nikes attempts to craft a more street smart image the board depicting mr parker shows him in a t shirt with flame tattoos running up one arm and a chauffeured white limousine waiting behind him mr guisinger says the parody was meant to "raise awareness " about the "behind the scenes jockeying that was going on with nikes attempt to enter the skateboard industry " nikes response was characteristically in your face global design head sandy bodecker shown on one of the boards with a sales projection chart and a brown nose purchased them on ebay and recently displayed them proudly in a prototype for a nike retail concept store "i personally was very pleased to be in such august company" he says some of nikes coolest collaborations seem to defy marketability marc newson an australian industrial designer befriended mr parker around and soon offered up "an interesting idea" for "the guys in space" collapsible footwear featuring a sock like inner shoe a detachable rubber sole and a perforated outer shoe which looks a bit like swiss cheese messrs parker and newson named the shoe "zvezdochka " after the fifth soviet dog to be sent into space the resulting "modular" shoe had all the hallmarks of a vanity project the limited edition sneakers appeared in and sold for &# in new yorks moss they were an instant if brief hit "this is a cult item in the art world " says mr parker when mr parker walked into the laguna art show the psychedelic painter robert williams approached him to proudly show off his zvezdochkas mr parker thinks the sneaker concept still being adapted for a broader market will eventually have commercial wings "theres no question" that it will reach the mainstream he says
