business day sign up for the e mail here the numbers cannot describe the suffering caused by the wildfires that have chased more than half a million people away from their homes in southern california but they can testify to the scale of the disaster as of last night more than half a dozen fires spreading from north of los angeles down to the mexican border below san diego had burned acres destroyed homes and forced the evacuation of some people according to the los angeles timess tally gov arnold schwarzenegger said the fires which are mostly uncontained still threaten more homes and until the santa ana winds subside there isnt much overtaxed fire crews are able to do other than tamp out spot fires and chase "ribbons of airborne embers to keep new fires from flaring " as the associated press puts it "if its this big and blowing with as much wind as its got itll go all the way to the ocean before it stops " san diego fire capt kirk humphries said "we can save some stuff but we cant stop it " around san diego while thousands of people began returning to their homes in some coastal areas the "monster" witch creek fire already acres big last night was expected to join with the recently started acre poomacha fire the san diego union tribune reports like the fires in malibu and santa clarita north of l a the flames there have been stoked by the high desert santa anas and summer like heat complicated by the droughts that have been plaguing the region mr schwarzenegger described that as "the perfect storm for a fire " but while he said he was "happy" with the number of firefighters the state was able to deploy other officials said that "they were stretched thin and that a lack of resources was as much a burden as the temperatures and winds " the new york times reports "if we had more air resources we would have been able to control this fire " orange county fire authority chief chip prather tells the l a times about the blaze near the residential enclave of modjeska canyon as he was speaking "the canyon was erupting in an inferno that forced firefighters to retreat and destroyed an undetermined number of homes " the paper says president bush yesterday mobilized federal emergency assistance to help and today he plans to visit the region and meet with gov schwarzenegger in order "to witness firsthand what the people there are going through " press secretary dana perino said that marked a reversal from hours earlier when ms perino said "the last thing california needs right now is a trip from the president to take away assets " "with the bush administration determined to apply lessons learned from its missteps in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in the federal emergency management agency on monday set up an office in pasadena " to coordinate federal and local efforts as the wall street journal reports but the journal reports that "squabbles broke out among government officials over their preparedness and access to firefighting resources " like the fire chiefs on the front lines state and local officials were raising doubts about government readiness for the periodic burst of wildfires in southern california san diego in particular has been mired in a financial crisis that might have stopped it from improving preparedness since the last wave of fires there four years ago twice in recent years voters rejected proposals to boost funding for local fire and police departments by raising hotel taxes the journal notes and last year the citys fire chief resigned in frustration it was too early to estimate the scale of property damage though a trade group the insurance information network of california said claims are likely to reach at least &# million like hurricanes and other natural disasters large scale fires reverberate financially beyond the cost of actual physical damage and southern californians are likely to find higher rates and possibly dropped policies once the claims are submitted l a times consumer columnist david lazarus writes "what they and you may not know is that virtually all such claims also will end up in vast privately run databases that are routinely accessed by the insurance industry to determine what rates theyll charge or if theyll cover you at all " he says "in other words a claim filed with one insurer can be used by another insurer to jack up premiums even though your record with that other insurer may be spotless " amid housings financial mess it is ironic that such a tragic and graphic destruction of peoples homes is taking place when the loss of home values

lynch which earlier this month announced an expected quarterly write down of &# billion mainly due to over exposure to risky mortgage related securities is "expected to announce its third quarter losses are more than &# billion more than first projected ratcheting up the pressure on chief executive stan oneal to demonstrate he has a grip on the firms risk level " the journal also reports and as citigroup bank of america and j p morgan chase try to finalize a rescue plan for some investment funds whose shakiness is linked to the mortgage mess they are facing new problems the journal says while the outlines of a new superfund are still being negotiated "the funds at the heart of the situation known as structured investment vehicles or sivs need to find investors for &# billion in debt coming due in the next six to nine months even as ratings firms continue to come out with reports that lower the ratings of securities in moves that could further depress the value of siv holdings "

the new york times reports that warning in mr bushs first standalone speech on cuba in four years seems the latest in his second term rhetorical push for democracy around the world and one timed to coincide with the poor health of fidel castro and possible succession by his brother raul but its unclear how much weight such a speech will carry in cuba and elsewhere around the world considering
