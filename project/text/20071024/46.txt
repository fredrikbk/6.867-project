economist rethinks age gauge how old are you it is the first question many of us learn to answer when we are or years old and one we try to avoid as time goes by but stanford university economist john shoven thinks it is the wrong way to look at age with life expectancies increasing and the retirement age staying more or less the same mr shoven says the best way to look at age isnt the number of years people have been alive but how many they have probably got left "it is time to consider a new way to measure age " mr shoven wrote in a paper released last week by the national bureau of economic research one of his alternative approaches "would be to measure age from the other end of life at least in expected terms " remaining life expectancy or rle "would be the measure of age and those with a short rle would be considered elderly and those with a long rle would be considered young " mr shoven wrote the result "the aging of the society is a lot less dramatic with the alternative mortality based age measures " mr shoven wrote the distinction between counting forward and backward is more than just academic especially with tens of millions of baby boomers eligible for retirement in the next years the oldest boomers can start collecting benefits as soon as next year and last week the first baby boomer applied for them amid much media hoopla if unchecked spending on social security medicare and medicaid will cripple government finances in recent months federal reserve officials also have observed that the aging of the population may have a damping effect on economic activity and living standards through slower growth in the labor force mr shoven estimates that if retirement is based on remaining life expectancy instead of beginning at a fixed age then the labor force could be higher by which would help finance entitlement programs gross domestic product meanwhile "would be between and higher by if retirement lengths stabilize " mr shoven wrote basing entitlement benefits on remaining life expectancy instead of a set eligibility age is just another way of saying people have to work longer that along with benefit reductions and higher taxes has been long considered by experts to be among the only ways to balance social security and medicare over the next generations but telling people they have to work longer isnt popular which is one of the reasons social security is called the "third rail" of politics mr shoven has some ideas on how to encourage longer working lives one change he said would be to increase the number of working years used to calculate social security benefits to from "and then index the number of years for improvements in life expectancy " another would be to exempt workers from paying payroll taxes once they have reached that year working threshold "today most of these workers face a pure tax with no increase in benefits to offset the additional payroll taxes that they face for working " mr shoven wrote "under this reform they would neither pay taxes nor improve their benefits from further work " a third change would be to change rules that appear to favor short careers over longer ones he said "given the improvements in life expectancy these changes in incentives seem appropriate " mr shoven wrote
