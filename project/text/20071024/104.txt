purists protest oil in chocolate have no fear trick or treaters this halloweens chocolate will be just as sweet and melt just as delightfully as always but the staple of so many candy bars and other confections might be about to take on a spooky transformation federal regulators are considering a proposal from several food industry groups that would allow the substitution of vegetable oil for cocoa butter in products that could still be called chocolate current food and drug administration guidelines only permit cocoa butter in products labeled chocolate no other vegetable fat is allowed "i am vehemently opposed to allowing a vegetable oil product to be called chocolate the organic and natural food industry is growing at a year because americans want better ingredients for themselves and their family not cheaper substitutes like vegetable oil for cocoa butter " karen hochman editorial director of food magazine the nibble told the food and drug administration earlier this year "no one would willingly eat or give their families vegetable oil chocolate who could have authentic cocoa butter chocolate " she said cocoa butter has a unique property that chocolate lovers adore its melting point is just below human body temperature that temperature quality allows the luxurious feel of chocolate on the tongue as it melts yet alternative oils have potential some could cost less ending up in savings for companies and consumers and some could even be healthier industry representatives say alternative oils can also offer different textures and heating properties desirable qualities for cooking and baking consumers of some pastries vitamin supplements and other items that dont require pure chocolate may have already eaten a product made with vegetable oil "usually when its used in conjunction with a pastry or candy its hard for people to tell because theyre not focused " said gary guittard president of guittard chocolate co a california based chocolate maker founded in "but if they were to taste it side by side with real chocolate theyd notice a difference " the guittard company has been making a white chocolate baking product using vegetable oil and cocoa butter for about years said mr guittard great grandson of the founder "it was to have something that didnt need to be tempered this product would always look nice if someone is doing home candy making it would be easy for them to work with " he said some companies such as mars inc maker of snickers and other candy bars have taken a firm stance against altering recipes smaller producers and retailers have also shown reluctance "its about the mouth feel " said robert kingsbury owner of an alexandria va chocolatier "if you have chocolate with a lot of cocoa butter it will melt smoother than products with less cocoa butter just dissipates with the chocolate as you swallow " mr kingsbury said using vegetable oil in chocolate would produce a whole different feeling "its going to coat your mouth it doesnt give you that feeling that it melts smoothly " he said mr kingsburys business uses chocolate produced from cacao originating in venezuela ecuador and the dominican republic the most expensive ingredients in chocolate come from the cacao bean chocolate liquor cocoa and cocoa butter other ingredients sugar milk and vanilla are more accessible chocolate made with a fat other than cocoa butter could be less expensive and could in turn drive down the price of cacao as demand falls however mr kingsbury doesnt see his suppliers making a switch even if new rules affecting chocolate are passed "the chocolate would be less expensive but youll also be getting a piece of product that tastes less expensive " he said "im happy with the product right now theres so much variety already to choose from " any change could be a ways off altering a government food standard that regulates approved ingredients can take years approving a standard of identity for white chocolate took about a decade the fda doesnt appear to be in a hurry to act on the request in a private meeting in august the fda told chocolate industry representatives that they should come up with modernization ideas that consumers and companies can swallow that meeting followed a public outcry to a petition from the grocery manufacturers association chocolate manufacturers association and other groups that asked the fda to consider a broad review of food standards including the vegetable oil in chocolate idea for now the petition is not a high priority for federal regulators who are looking for new recommendations from the chocolate industry according to a spokeswoman with the national confectioners association the fda may also be focused more on food safety now rather than on modernization in terms of health an alternative oil could be an improvement cocoa butter is a saturated fat though it may have a more neutral impact on bad cholesterol than other saturated fats said katherine tallmadge a nutritional expert and spokeswoman for the american dietetic association "it depends on the type of oil thats substituted " she said "it may or may not be a healthy product " most vegetable oils are going to be healthy but if they are treated to make them hard at room temperature that process creates undesirable trans fats ms tallmadge said consumers would still be able to find chocolate with flavanols which are found in cocoa and help maintain a healthy vascular system reduce blood clotting and increase blood flow to the brain "now if youre eating chocolate for health benefits youll need to be very discriminating in your selection " ms tallmadge said "youll get more flavanol and more health benefits with less processing " ms tallmadge said the first chocolate choice for a healthy diet is cocoa and then chocolate with a high percentage of cocoa milk chocolate which has added sugar and milk isnt as healthy although mr guittard sees some room for vegetable oil products in the chocolate industry he is wary of companies that would use a "raunchy" oil that wouldnt allow chocolate to melt in the mouth "youd get better and worse ones " he said "in the industry you need a discipline of ingredients to have good products "
