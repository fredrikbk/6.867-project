fiscally fit debt vs the dream car terris husband gerry gives their son a lesson in setting financial priorities online edition my husband gerry recently got an offer i was convinced he couldnt refuse a like new chevy corvette the car of his dreams for the bargain price of &# his friend daves dad died recently and the car was part of the estate sale dave knew gerry had always wanted a corvette so he offered my husband first crack at the car when gerry came home from a test drive he was over the moon "its mint " he raved running down the list of extras that came with the car a convertible with a v liter engine premium sound leather seats and rims oh the rims why do guys get so worked up over tire rims the car was a model but it was rarely driven and garage kept gerry said our year old son gerald whod gone with his father on the test drive was just as excited "its a real race car mom " he said "are we going to buy it " good question gerry and i never make big purchases unless we both agree but this time i felt the decision to buy the car should be gerrys alone this is a car hes talked about for as long as ive known him for years ive watched him gaze longingly at other corvettes on the road the cars price tag had always stopped us from buying one late model corvettes in good condition cost in the low &# s "too expensive for a car " gerry would say mostly to convince himself and now he had the opportunity to buy one practically new at half the price how badly did gerry want the corvette he said if we decided to buy it hed sell his cherished ford mustang a souped up death trap that ive been trying to get him to sell since gerald was born when gerry said he was ready to part with the mustang i thought the decision to buy the corvette had already been made still i didnt want gerald whod been listening to our conversation to think that any time mommy and daddy see something expensive they want they just run out and buy it "lets check the value online to make sure that its a good price for the car " i suggested with gerald watching i did a quick check of the cars private party sale value on kelley blue books web site and found comparable cars were valued at about &# remember its a model "so its a good deal " gerry said i suggested we offer &# and tell dave we were saving him the hassle of having to list the car for sale and sell it i also checked the mustangs blue book value &# still wed seen that model mustang more than once at antique car shows and in worse condition gerry thought we might get more for it from an enthusiast "well sell the mustang take &# from our savings account and borrow the rest " gerry said i told gerry if thats what he wanted to do then wed do it what i didnt say is "great more debt " this year weve borrowed about &# from our home equity line of credit for our backyard remodeling project since wed already borrowed about &# last year for smaller home renovation projects another &# for the car would raise our current debt to nearly &# ive been making a little more money lately and funneling the extra cash to pay down some of the previous debts typically our year end bonuses cover most borrowing made against our home equity line so ive never fretted too much about it but were not done with home maintenance projects this year our furnace and our central air unit will both have to be replaced i didnt like the idea of borrowing more for the repairs on top of the cost of the car well pay for the furnace and central air out of savings rather than take on more debt right now and focus on saving more i thought to myself so gerry gets his dream car and we tighten our belts for a while until the debt is paid and our savings are replenished right not so fast after the glow of the test drive faded gerry began to think about our debt too the next day after our son finished his homework gerald asked his dad whether we were going to buy the car today but gerry was having serious second thoughts which he shared with our son he told gerald that wed just received the &# bill for the furnace and that there will be more costs once he begins to install it and the central air upgrade will be even more expensive gerry said because some of the ductwork will need to be replaced too then he mentioned the big project the bathroom tiles are literally falling off the wall in some places due to water damage and were going to have to address the problem soon which will probably cost another &# gerry told gerald how important it is to take care of the house and that doing that costs a lot of money he also said the race car was a luxury that wed have to borrow money to pay for and that its never a good idea to borrow too much money gerry said well get a race car when weve saved enough to pay for it just as gerald has to save to buy the expensive video games he wants i know gerry told gerald all this because i barely had my jacket off arriving home from work when gerald repeated the entire conversation to me "we cant afford that race car right now mom " my son finished soberly i was surprised and a bit relieved but i was also impressed because gerry had talked through his thought process gerald had learned a valuable lesson in setting financial priorities the race car is a luxury the house repairs are a necessity the house comes first wed have to borrow money to buy the race car and borrowing a lot of money is bad so mom and dad have to save for the race car just like i have to save for videos i think were doing the right thing by not buying the corvette but i was feeling guilty and asked gerry again whether he was sure about the car gerry reassured me he doesnt need another expensive toy right now which made me feel a little better but he added "the mustangs staying in the garage "
