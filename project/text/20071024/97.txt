politics &amp economics kurdish crisis drives a wedge northern iraqis failure to curb pkk puts stress on u s relationship the crisis in northern iraq is driving a wedge between the u s and the iraqi kurds further destabilizing iraqs unsettled political landscape senior u s officials said they are increasingly disappointed that the kurds who govern northern iraq have failed to take concrete measures to root out the kurdish guerrillas whose attacks into turkey have sparked fears of a turkish invasion ambassador david satterfield the top state department official on iraq yesterday said washington wants kurdish leaders to take immediate measures to prevent militants from the kurdistan workers party known as the pkk from crossing into turkey it also wants the iraqi kurds to cut off the groups access to weapons explosives and other supplies he said "responsibility for dealing with this group lies with the kurdish regional government " mr satterfield told reporters in washington "we are not pleased with the lack of action undertaken against the pkk " mr satterfields comments come at a time of deepening tensions between the bush administration and the kurdish leadership of northern iraq long the most reliable american allies in iraq the iraqi kurds have alarmed the u s by bypassing baghdad and striking their own oil and trade deals with foreign companies the bush administration faces the challenge of figuring out how to pressure the iraqi kurds into taking action against the pkk without alienating them and prompting them to use their political clout to further destabilize iraqs government it is a delicate balancing act and u s officials acknowledge they have so far been unable to persuade the kurds to crack down on the pkk the kurdish regional government is "turning a blind eye to it " said a u s military adviser in iraq iraqi kurdish officials reject the criticism they say they lack the firepower to defeat a guerrilla group skilled and tenacious enough to have survived a decades long war with turkey which has one of the most modern and powerful militaries in the middle east many turkish officials meanwhile blame the u s for failing to mount any concerted push to dislodge the pkk in northern iraq on its own or with turkish forces the tension is complicating u s and iraqi efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the current standoff with turkey president bush and senior administration officials have contacted turkish leaders to urge restraint but turkey has continued to mass troops and military equipment along the iraqi border in preparation for a possible strike in baghdad iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki yesterday ordered the immediate closure of all pkk offices in iraq and said his government wouldnt allow the armed group to "work on iraqi territory " iraqi officials said they would also seek to curb the pkks financing such steps are unlikely to defuse the crisis iraqs central government has little sway over the kurdish ministate in northern iraq iraqi officials acknowledged that the future of the pkk would be determined by whether iraqi kurdish leaders decide to seriously confront the guerrilla group not by edicts from baghdad there are several kurds in the highest echelons of the iraqi government which serves to insulate the kurds from coming under excessive pressure from mr maliki or his aides president jalal talabani is kurdish as is foreign minister hoshyar zebari mr talabani a former guerrilla leader has condemned the pkk attacks and expressed sympathy toward turkey but he has also argued strongly against a turkish incursion and said the kurds would never turn wanted pkk militants over to turkey the iraqi kurds "have to do something to ease the situation not just say they arent supporting the pkk " said sami al askari an adviser to mr maliki mr maliki has spoken on the phone with kurdish regional president massoud barzani to convey a similar message mr askari said mr maliki and other arab iraqi leaders have expressed sympathy for turkey and criticized the pkk as terrorists part of a broad push to lower tensions with turkey an important neighbor and trading partner in contrast iraqi kurdish leaders besides saying they have no control over pkk rebels have evoked pan kurdish solidarity and warned that other iraqi kurds might join the fight against turkey if it attacks pkk hideouts in northern iraq for many u s and iraqi officials the pkk crisis is stoking broader concerns about iraqi sovereignty the iraqi kurdish leaders have called for direct talks with turkey effectively proposing to bypass baghdad altogether turkey rejected the idea but the proposal highlighted the iraqi kurdish push for more powers of statehood the u s generally supports iraqi kurdish autonomy but u s officials worry that more independence for the iraqi kurds could undercut the already shaky central government in baghdad last month the iraqi kurds signed an exploration contract with hunt oil an american firm without waiting for passage of a national oil law a u s embassy official in baghdad said such deals risked undermining iraqi unity the kurds have signed exploration deals valued at a total of &# million with oil companies from france norway turkey and canada "these contracts significantly elevated tensions between the kurdish regional government and baghdad " the embassy official said the kurds say they cant wait for the central government to agree on a much delayed national oil law and that they want to proceed with economic development in their enclave
