taking a flier on bedroom suites first airline to fly the a is devoting half its vast space to just first and business class passengers sitting in a pumpkin colored leather bedroom suite on board singapore airlines first airbus a christina zeller runs her finger around the edge of a dinner plate decorated with a raised pattern resembling caviar she recounts how hard it was to get that pattern just right "it was either too grainy or not grainy enough or not the right color or it wouldnt stand up to washings " says ms zeller who leads the accessories unit at french fashion house givenchy hired by the airline to create the look and feel of the planes interior singapore airlines is raising the bar in the global race to pamper premium passengers with the first commercial flight of the a planned for tomorrow from singapore to sydney the first class passengers will nestle in fully enclosed cabins reminiscent of luxury yachts each suite boasts a private coat closet a inch video screen and ergonomically designed reclining seats in addition to a built in bed expandable to a double size for traveling couples who want to nap the seats in business class are inches wide nearly twice as wide as typical inch economy seat altogether almost half the cabin space is reserved for the premium passengers but a key question for the industry is whether allotting so much space to a carriers best customers is the wisest use of this planes voluminous real estate the a is the biggest passenger jetliner ever built the combined floor space of its two decks could contain nearly nine squash courts and each is longer than the distance the wright brothers covered in their first motorized flight airports have had to widen runways and install special jetways just to handle the plane yet singapore airlines is providing just seats on the aircraft which has more floor space than the previous record holder boeing co s that jumbo jet seats about passengers in a typical three cabin layout so the legroom on the a is lavish indeed even the economy class passengers on singapore airlines a will have their own usb computer ports with full miniature keyboards and seats that recline degrees when the airline and givenchy talked to passengers they discovered an important distinction business class passengers are often flying on their companies money and so they want to take full advantage of all the goodies on board including a choice of more than movies tv shows and music compact discs and videogames first class passengers in contrast are accustomed to high end living and mostly just want to sleep their blase attitude prompted the givenchy designers to ensure there was "nothing showy and nothing too obvious " ms zeller says instead everything down to the fine cotton bed sheets with carefully finished stitching had to feel luxurious "an expensive idea realized in a cheap way is awful " she adds for givenchy sia was a dream client ms zeller says when middle managers balked at the cost of more adventurous proposals sia chief executive chew choon seng frequently overrode them she recalls though some of givenchys ideas such as double faced cashmere blankets were too much even for him the compromise wool blankets with cashmere trim sia is charging a premium for all this luxury first class fares on the a between singapore and sydney are higher than for the same route on the airlines s bringing the one way fare to around &# excluding taxes and extra charges business class passengers pay a premium about &# one way excluding taxes and charges mr chew says sia which is among the worlds most profitable airlines is able to charge above market rates for its products because "if you want to live in trump tower youve got to expect to pay a bit more " there will be no premium on economy class seats where at least eight different fare levels apply and can vary from month to month all told the airline has of the superjumbo jets on order and plans to deploy them on high demand routes where it can boost capacity without having to increase the number of flights to busy airports that may not have room for more planes early next year it expects to start daily a service between singapore and londons heathrow airport followed by flights to tokyo hong kong and san francisco ticket sales began last month and demand has been "exceedingly positive " says sia spokesman stephen forshaw though he declined to give specifics "there is clearly a place in the market for superior products like those we have unveiled on the a " it isnt just sia that is going the cushy route with the a seven of the carriers that plan to fly the jet emirates airline qantas airways ltd deutsche lufthansa ag air france klm sa korean air kingfisher airlines ltd and sia have configured their planes with an average of seats according to the centre for asia pacific aviation a sydney based consultancy that is nowhere near as many as the passengers the aircraft is certified to carry demand for first class service probably is "recession proof " says shukor yusof of standard &amp poors asia equity research in singapore but he notes that corporate demand for business class seats on the a could dry up in a severe economic downturn and that an external event such as the terror attacks of september or the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome could pinch profits some carriers that have ordered the superjumbo are hedging their bets and tailoring some of their a models to the needs of specific regional markets emirates for example is exploring a seat jet the densest configuration of any a customer so far that would fly from mumbai or new delhi to dubai ferrying the tens of thousands of "guest workers" who shuttle between home and the hotels and construction sites of fast growing luxury and business destinations in the gulf states future versions of the a might embrace a more mass market model "there are other airlines low cost carriers for example that might want an a one day and might want to make it all economy " says john borghetti executive general manager of qantas the only other carrier so far to reveal details of the interior it plans for the a among other things it plans to take advantage of the planes roomy upper deck to install business class seats three rows abreast in a configuration when airbus introduced the a it triggered lots of buzz about the possible extras it could accommodate from showers and gyms to casinos and bowling alleys such fanciful talk died down as carriers focused on the planes economics "the manufacturer provides floor space its up to the airline to maximize revenue and profit from that floor space " says chris tarry an aviation consultant based in tunbridge wells england an onboard gym he says might be "good from a marketeers point of view but how are you going to make money from it " airbus a unit of european aeronautic defence &amp space co delayed delivery of the a for almost two years due to production problems that angered customers and spawned turmoil among the companys senior management it justifies its &# billion investment in the a with predictions of strong demand for flights to hub airports traffic that airbus says the superjumbo is ideally designed to serve to date it has received firm orders for as from different customers it needs to sell about of the aircraft to reach the break even point
