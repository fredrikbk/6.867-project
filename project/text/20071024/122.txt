the mossberg solution from the pc to the tv device captures certain video files to view on the tube with video content making up a huge chunk of the online world nowadays wouldnt it make sense to have a one step way to transfer videos from a pc to a tv just as easily as moving files from one computer to another imagine a special device that not only plugged into your pc so you could drag and drop video files onto it but also then hooked up to your tv to play back those videos rather than watching tv shows or movies on your laptop youd be doing so while comfortably relaxing on the couch no high tech networking required sandisk corp s sansa taketv www take tv attempts to do just that but is more complicated than it should be this device essentially a inch usb thumb drive with attachable accessories costs &# or &# for four or eight gigabytes respectively by itself it moves videos from a mac or windows pc to a tv but only certain types of files are transferable since taketv wont work with videos downloaded from other online services such as apple inc s itunes store sandisk created its own service called fanfare www fanfare com to work with taketv users plug taketv into a pc download a movie or tv episode from fanfare unplug the device and attach it to a tv to watch the videos fanfare is still in its beta or testing stage and doesnt currently offer much content its big name networks include showtime and cbs but only certain episodes of some shows like "dexter " "survivor" and "csi miami " are available sandisks taketv and fanfare are just getting started and because of that have plenty of restrictions on the upside fanfare is a visually attractive program a real change for a company best known for selling flash storage and the quality of the video playback was impressive but for now this device and service combination is frustratingly green fanfare works only on windows right now and downloaded videos cant be played back on the pc because of its current beta status fees for movies and episodes of tv shows are being waived for a limited time content providers will eventually charge &# per episode or nothing if they choose to use an ad supported model sandisk plans to keep improving fanfares content now limited to a total of episodes from shows on six networks but playing videos on a tv can be frustrating lacking simple features like a visible progress bar when youre rewinding or fast forwarding and if you need to stop a video halfway through watching it and happen to power off the taketv your place is lost taketv gets points for its clever design its usb part tucks into a sleek holder that disguises the whole thing as a slender rectangle for porting around on its own the holder operates as a remote for controlling taketv when its connected to your tv a separate television connector plugs into the tv using red yellow and white composite cables or just an s video cable this tv connector must also plug into a power outlet not everyone will like the way taketv looks hooked up to a television as its connector uses long unsightly composite cables i started off slow first just dragging and dropping video files from my computer into taketv at first i accidentally moved mp files which arent compatible with taketv some types of video files that would transfer divx xvid and mpeg avi mpg and mpeg files fall under this last category heres the problem most people dont know what format their videos are in so finding the correct formats could be a real hassle one file i transferred was a short video of a trip to california its footage looked startlingly crisp and clear when played back on a standard definition television sandisk says videos will play in dvd quality and i thought this was an accurate assessment using the fanfare service was rather straightforward upon plugging your taketv in for the first time youll be prompted to download the fanfare client and to use the client youll need to register creating a user name and password the fanfare program is colorful and animated it shows the available networks cbs showtime smithsonian the weather channel jaman and tv guide in a vertical list network names and titles of show episodes glow as you move your mouse over them still shots from each movie or show illustrate just what youll be getting including previews of certain videos with my taketv plugged into a pc at work i selected a plus icon to download the pilot episode of showtimes twisted series "dexter " this minute episode took minutes to download i downloaded a minute film called "countdown " which took just short of minutes to download but i couldnt watch these videos until i was in front of my tv at home due to fanfares no pc playback policy once taketv was plugged into my tv i chose videos from a list a pre created folder called "fanfare downloads" automatically holds everything you download from the service i was using the &# four gigabyte taketv which sandisk estimates will hold about five hours of video the &# eight gigabyte should hold up to hours a useful illustration of my devices capacity showed in fanfare to indicate how much space was taken mine was full when i wrote this sandisk knows it has a lot of improving to do especially if it wants to challenge successful services like apples itunes as is taketv has the right idea but forces users to jump through too many hoops it plans to make fanfare usable on macs sometime in the future and hopes to enable video playback on pcs before the end of the year for now its best to hold off on getting excited about this device or its service edited by walter s mossberg email mossbergsolution wsj com
