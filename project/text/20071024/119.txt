taxable payouts on many funds are set to surge many mutual funds are estimating that theyll make big taxable distributions to shareholders this year and that means investors planning to buy or sell fund shares in the weeks ahead should tread carefully each year mutual funds generally distribute to shareholders their income and net capital gains or profits on the sale of their holdings investors who hold funds in taxable accounts must pay taxes on these distributions even if they reinvest them in the same fund if they buy into a fund just before a distribution they could end up paying taxes on gains they didnt actually receive some fund experts predict this years total mutual fund distributions will be the highest ever despite the summer market turmoil stocks have moved substantially higher this year creating sizable gains in many funds a number of funds have also exhausted their supply of losses booked during the last bear market which theyve used to offset gains in recent years american funds new economy for example recently burned through the last of those stored up losses and will likely make a capital gains distribution this year for the first time since last year mutual funds paid out &# billion in capital gains distributions the highest level since according to the investment company institute the fund industry trade group thanks largely to strong stock market returns major fund companies like janus capital group inc and capital research &amp management co s american funds say their funds are likely to make even larger year end distributions this year than they did in t rowe price group inc and oppenheimerfunds are also expecting to make higher payouts in their retail stock funds funds expected to make hefty payouts this year include foreign stock funds and funds focused on small company and "value" stocks or those that look cheap relative to their earnings or assets though fund payouts generally arent made until november or december some financial planners are already bracing for them and making plans to minimize the tax consequences for clients wealth management firm regentatlantic capital in chatham n j has already compiled a list of exchange traded funds which unlike many conventional funds have a unique tax efficient structure and rarely make capital gains distributions for clients investing new money during november and december "i expect bigger distributions coming out of funds this year " says christopher cordaro chief investment officer at regentatlantic "the longer you get into a bull market the harder it is for funds to manage tax efficiently " taxes can have a big impact on investors returns over the past years the average stock fund has surrendered an annual percentage points of returns to taxes according to fund researcher lipper inc but experts also caution that investors should keep the fund tax burden in perspective and avoid making hasty trades based solely on tax considerations though fund investors tax bills may be higher than last year they will still be substantially lower than they were at the start of the decade because tax rates have declined significantly tax experts say advisers also caution that investors shouldnt necessarily dump a fund just because its expected to make a large distribution since selling the fund could trigger an even bigger tax hit the top federal tax rate on long term capital gains and qualifying dividends is the top federal rate on short term gains and interest income is some highly regarded funds are making capital gains distributions for the first time in years even as their performance falters legg mason value trust known for beating the standard &amp poors stock index for straight years is distributing capital gains this year for the first time since the fund fell behind the s&amp p last year and is up about this year through monday lagging behind the index by about six percentage points the muhlenkamp fund which has beaten more than of its rivals over the past years according to morningstar said in a recent letter to shareholders that it would make a capital gains distribution for the first time since the distribution will likely amount to at least of fund assets the fund said the funds performance falls near the bottom of its category so far this year analysts say that some of the largest distributions are likely to come from small cap and value funds since these funds have been on a tear in recent years and now are widely expected to fall behind funds focused on larger faster growing companies investors are pulling money out of the category investors yanked &# billion out of small cap value funds this year through august according to financial research corp when investors exit a fund managers are often forced to sell holdings booking gains that can be distributed to shareholders thats what happened recently to the evergreen small cap value fund a big investor pulled money from the fund forcing it to sell some holdings as a result the fund made a capital gains distribution amounting to of its net asset value in late june due to the continued strong performance of overseas markets many international funds are "tax time bombs " says morningstar analyst christopher davis in some cases foreign stocks are rising so quickly that managers are taking gains just a few months after buying the shares generating an even bigger tax hit for shareholders as of sept for example the masters select international fund had realized gains amounting to roughly of nav and more than of those gains were short term "when managers bought these companies they werent expecting the price to reflect the long term value so quickly " says jeremy degroot chief investment officer of litman gregory fund advisors which runs the masters select funds "this year is just highly unusual when you look at the performance of some emerging markets theyve almost gone vertical " small cap value funds expected to make sizable year end distributions include pioneer small cap value and t rowe price small cap value investors can get a sense of their potential mutual fund tax hit by looking for year end distribution estimates often posted on fund companies web sites in october or november not all fund companies offer such estimates however and fund firms often stress that any estimates are subject to change another option look up the fund on morningstar com and find its "potential capital gains exposure" under the "tax analysis" tab this figure is an estimate of the percentage of a funds assets that represent gains while this is just a starting point in assessing a funds tax consequences generally funds that have higher potential capital gains exposure and higher turnover meaning they trade holdings more often are more likely to make taxable distributions says bill rocco a morningstar analyst investors who hold a fund expected to make a big distribution should generally avoid sinking much more money into the fund just before a distribution is paid because theyll simply get part of their investment back in the form of a taxable distribution investors might consider taking the distribution and reinvesting it in a more tax efficient fund says joel dickson a tax specialist at vanguard group "dont just blindly reinvest distributions " he says investors can also consider selling other portfolio holdings at a loss to offset the taxable gain while it may not make sense to sell a fund just to avoid a distribution investors who are considering selling the fund anyway might want to do so before the distribution advisers say investors might also want to consider so called tax managed funds which aim to minimize taxable distributions this years sharp market swings have created ample opportunities for managers focused on tax efficiency to harvest losses that can offset gains says david yeske a financial planner in san francisco t rowe price for example estimates that its tax efficient balanced tax efficient growth and tax efficient multi cap growth funds will pay no capital gains distributions this year tom herman is on vacation email taxreport wsj com
