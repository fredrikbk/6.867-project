fda spending options abound if you are among the one in five americans working for a large employer who has socked away dollars in a health care flexible spending account now could be the time to go out and splurge flexible spending accounts enable workers to pay for medical expenses that are not covered by health insurance with pretax dollars the caveat what you dont use during the year you lose money in fsas cant be rolled over or refunded "people often put away money and then forget about it " says tracey baker vice president of cjm wealth advisers ltd a financial planning firm in fairfax va and with employers generally imposing few restrictions on how much money employees can put into an fsa and workers increasing their annual contributions by around a year over the past three years according to data from health insurer aetna inc balances can run into thousands of dollars dont despair if you find your fsa full of dollars for one thing it means you are probably healthier than you thought you would be because you and your family did not need to use as many medical services as you predicted over the year also your pocketbook doesnt have to suffer there is a wide range of medical services health care products and treatments you can spend your money on before your deadline without falling foul of the internal revenue service contrary to what is commonly thought a doctors note or prescription is often not needed to go on a health care shopping spree dental checkups and orthodontics hearing and eye exams contact lenses over the counter drugs exotic vaccinations even surgery can be on the list experts say but some careful planning is needed to get the best value for your money and your health for instance fsas can pay for corrective eye surgery but that is not a procedure that should be rushed into without researching providers "find out what your employers deadline is for spending money in fsas " advises ms baker who is the co author of "navigating your health benefits for dummies " a consumer guide sponsored by aetna and the financial planning association a trade group representing financial planners and stock brokers traditionally employees had until dec to make their medical purchases under a rule passed by the irs in may employers can provide a two and a half month grace period until march to use these untaxed funds check the summary of your plans

anemia when taken for general good health even when recommended by a health care professional dietary supplements dont qualify as medical expenses and therefore arent reimbursable however those looking to quit smoking can order supplies of nicotine patches and gum or enroll in a smoking cessation program you can check with your human resources office for details or ask your primary care physician for recommendations the same goes for weight loss programs and if you take prescription drugs and receive them through the mail dont forget to order your next three month supply "the co pays and co insurance can be paid from your fsa " says tom billet a senior consultant with watson wyatt worldwide a visit to the dentist can be a wise investment especially as the number of employees without dental coverage grows according to mr billet x rays fillings extractions dentures caps crowns fluoride treatments implants and orthodontia including braces for your kids are among the eligible medical expenses however teeth whitening and veneers are out of pocket expenses the same goes for botox injections "anything cosmetic is a no no " says mr billet however eye exams and some eyeglasses
