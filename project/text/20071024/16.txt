business world cheap shot at toyota never underestimate the value of hypocrisy which makes the world go around and the lives of social animals livable but theres hypocrisy and hypocrisy herewith a defense of toyota and a slam of the ethanol lobby toyota suddenly finds itself in a position as whipping boy for environmental groups its usual allies only because it makes the prius sold as a "green" car never mind that it burns gasoline like any other car brand imagery is hostage giving and the natural resources defense council and fellow rabblers now find it convenient to promote the storyline "toyota hypocrite" because the company recently signed up with gm ford and chrysler to oppose a senate bill mandating higher fuel mileage targets in favor of a house bill with somewhat less demanding targets you can find evidence of the green campaign at truthabouttoyota com or by thumbing through the collected works of tom friedman angry prius owners even staged a rally two weekends ago in portland ore toyota is a hypocrite all right for supporting any mileage standard at all as car companies do it sold prius customers a car that met their needs and or flattered their vanity for other customers whose hot buttons lie elsewhere toyota has the tundra its giant fuel consuming pickup auto companies only achieve efficient scale by appealing to different consumer appetites the profitless prius wouldnt exist if not for the non hybrids that keep toyota in business indeed toyota supports the house bill over the senate bill only because it would let auto makers continue to make big vehicles that happen to be the ones americans with their dollars show they actually want but the year old cafe rules have become a fetish of environmental groups a talisman of their clout a ticket to a seat at a table in washington the policy itself has no value it doesnt reduce oil imports it doesnt meaningfully curb fossil fuel use in the nature of things auto buyers amortize their forced investment in fuel economy by driving more miles burning more gas the impressive reliability gains of the auto makers over the past years are in part a reflection of this consumer demand for more miles ditto the conspicuous increase in vehicle size and comfort partly a function of the increased time motorists spend in their cars for an example of truly pernicious hypocrisy forget toyota and consider the ethanol lobby it endlessly invokes global warming and energy security for a program that positively obstructs both while enriching an industry that wouldnt exist except by government handouts two years ago congress was debating a new law forcing motorists to buy more ethanol lobbying for the change was venture capitalist vinod khosla who told legislators he had received confidential warnings from oil executives that "big oil" would drive down prices to put ethanol out of business ergo the industry needed congresss help two years later oil has hit a near record high of &# but ethanol still cant stand on its own feet far from it the industry is plagued by a glut and falling prices while costs have gone through the roof because of the surging price of corn dozens of new bio refineries built amid signs of congressional and white house favor now are losing money the solution up has geared a new campaign for a larger mandate to soak up the excess supply created by the last mandate a recently passed senate bill would require motorists to buy billion gallons a year by up from billion gallons under current law at least this would benefit the atmosphere right think again a research team featuring paul crutzen who won a nobel prize for his work on ozone depletion recently showed that the intensive cultivation of biofuels in the u s and europe produces up to more greenhouse effect than the fossil fuels they displace nitrous oxide a byproduct of the fertilizers used has nearly times the heat trapping properties of carbon dioxide passenger cars can burn fuel consisting of ethanol if our goal were really to displace conventional gasoline wed open our coastal markets to sugar cane ethanol from brazil and other southern hemisphere countries produced by less intensive methods that result irony alert in a genuine reduction in greenhouse emissions but washington blocks imported ethanol with a cents a gallon tariff to protect domestic ethanol profits so lets sum up the ways youre paying to prop up an industry thats bad for energy security and bad for climate worries higher taxes higher gas prices and higher food prices did we mention the mileage penalty that comes from burning gasoline with a ethanol content thanks to ethanols inferior btu value compared to gasoline ethanol lobbyists like to pretend theyre the front line against opec and middle eastern terrorists their real goal is to create a high cost outpost of opec in the midwest call it "cornistan" dependent on high oil prices and an endless conveyor of subsidies and protectionism delivered via the clout of rural interests in the u s senate energy "independence" is a mischievous pipedream energy security is not americas real interests would be served by free trade in biofuels but instead weve ended up with an uneconomic domestic ethanol industry that will forever have its hand out no matter how high oil prices go mr jenkins edits "political diary " the
