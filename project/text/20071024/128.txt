the hybrid vs all electric debate leading car makers take sides on issue at tokyo gathering big auto makers revving up efforts to electrify automobiles are taking shots at each others strategies in a style more familiar to silicon valley entrepreneurs than the auto industrys usually circumspect leaders the argument surfacing among auto industry leaders gathering for the tokyo motor show this week is over whether it is time to skip past partial electrification of cars represented by gasoline electric hybrids such as the toyota prius and push instead to revive the idea of an all electric car on one side are toyota motor corp and general motors corp both have played down all electric cars in favor of developing gasoline electric hybrids though they disagree on the best technology and how quickly it can be implemented on the other side are two allied car makers frances renault sa and japans nissan motor co as well as honda motor co the three have expressed skepticism about the economic wisdom of hybrids and are talking up all electric cars renault nissan chief executive officer carlos ghosn and honda president and ceo takeo fukui in separate interviews yesterday argued that all electric vehicles make more sense environmentally politically and economically than do hybrids provided there are advances in lithium ion battery technology none of the major auto makers are proposing to abandon internal combustion engines anytime soon but industry leaders are worried regulators in the u s and europe under pressure to respond to climate change and address climbing oil prices will force car makers to dramatically decrease petroleum use in new vehicles in an interview in tokyo mr ghosn said the allied french and japanese companies he leads are working to field significant numbers of all electric vehicles as early as in the belief that gasoline electric hybrids wont satisfy regulators in key markets "we think in cities paris and london we think cars will be forbidden unless they are zero emission" vehicles mr ghosn said he said renault nissans plans reflect a judgment that lithium ion battery technology will soon be mature enough to power purpose built electric cars in cities he stressed that renault and nissan dont plan to convert their entire fleets to all electric power hondas mr fukui expressed skepticism about what are known as plug in hybrid gasoline electric vehicles saying they offer too few environmental benefits such vehicles like gms proposed chevrolet volt are recharged through an electrical outlet yet are still partially powered by gasoline "my feeling is that the kind of plug in hybrid currently proposed by different auto makers can be best described as a battery electric vehicle equipped with an unnecessary fuel engine and fuel tank " mr fukui said at the companys research and development center he said he was referring to plug in hybrids such as the chevy volt gm toyota and other auto makers largely scrapped efforts to commercialize all electric cars some years ago after california delayed a mandate that car makers offer zero emission vehicles a renaissance of consumer all electric vehicles could depend in large part on whether auto makers and battery makers can solve safety and cost problems with lithium ion batteries such batteries commonly power laptop computers and consumer appliances but auto industry executives have expressed concern about the batteries tendency to overheat gm has heavily promoted the idea that its chevrolet volt concept could use lithium ion batteries to operate for as far as about miles on electricity alone but it qualified its claims by saying actual production of the volt depends on advances in the safety reliability and cost of lithium ion battery technology separately mr ghosn told a tokyo conference yesterday that he remains open to the idea of adding a north american partner to the renault nissan alliance but he said any such move would have to be by "mutual consent "
