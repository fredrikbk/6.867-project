the dish on at&amp ts satellite plans at&amp t inc has been circling the satellite television sector for several years contemplating a bid for one of the two major players now with consolidation in the telephone industry mostly done at&amp t appears to be getting ready to swoop in investors should be wary at&amp t has been consulting lawyers in washington about how long it would take to get government approval to purchase either echostar communications corp or directv group inc people familiar with the matter said if it does make a bid for one of the satellite providers at&amp t could unveil the offer before years end in hopes of getting federal antitrust officials to approve the combination before a new administration takes over these people say a final decision on a bid hasnt been made at&amp t hasnt even decided which satellite tv firm to go after although a purchase of echostar of englewood colo could be easier to undertake because it has a less complicated ownership situation there also isnt any guarantee that either company would be available but what at&amp t shareholders and other investors are likely to focus on is the potential cost of a deal between &# billion and &# billion depending on the target and the san antonio telecommunications giants ability to absorb another acquisition after last years purchase of bellsouth corp "it would create uncertainty " said john krause a stock research analyst at thrivent investment management of minneapolis which owns million at&amp t shares he doesnt rate at&amp t that could be bad news for at&amp t stock which is trading near a week intraday high of &# in p m new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday at&amp t rose cents or to &# giving the firm a market value of &# billion the shares are trading at about times per share earnings for the past months the stocks rise came after at&amp t reported strong third quarter earnings yesterday with net income rising last years figures dont include results from bellsouth and its stake in cingular wireless which at&amp t took full control of with its acquisition of bellsouth late last year at&amp t added two million new wireless customers in the quarter bringing its total to million it said it sold million apple inc iphones since the launch of the device in late june at&amp t chief financial officer rick lindner declined to comment about potential acquisitions echostar and directv also declined to comment talk about at&amp ts interest in a satellite tv firm has swirled for several years as the company like rival verizon communications inc has made a push into offering television service to counter cable tv firms push into phone service at&amp t announced that through the third quarter it had signed up subscribers for its "u verse" tv service the company says it will offer u verse to million homes by the end of next year a project estimated to cost &# billion a satellite deal would give at&amp t a way of fending off rival cable operators luring customers with low priced bundles of phone tv and high speed internet a purchase also would allow at&amp t to negotiate less expensive content deals for its tv service and it would save at&amp t the cost of rolling out u verse in certain parts of the companys expansive territory where laying the fiber optics is expensive still the premium at&amp t would have to pay to land a satellite concern may offset those cost savings of the two satellite firms directv which has million customers in the u s versus echostars million would be cheapest as measured by a multiple of its earnings directv of el segundo calif has a market value of about &# billion roughly times earnings for the past months but directv would be a complicated acquisition john malones liberty media corp late last year agreed to buy news corp s stake in directv although the deal has yet to be approved by regulators news corp has agreed to acquire dow jones &amp co the publisher of the wall street journal acquiring all of directv would likely require spending as much as &# billion analysts speculate the equivalent of more than times earnings liberty would also have to hold on to about of the company for several years for tax reasons a liberty representative declined to comment echostar would require at&amp t to negotiate with the satellite companys chief executive and controlling shareholder charlie ergen some analysts and industry officials are skeptical that mr ergen renowned as a maverick and often stubborn manager would sell the company he founded to get his agreement may require at&amp t to offer a big price perhaps as much as &# billion analysts estimate about times its earnings over the past months according to capital iq still echostar makes sense in a number of ways at&amp t has an investment in echostar it put &# million into the satellite firm in the two are partners in offering "homezone " a service using a television set top box that blends satellite tv with on demand movies and other services off the internet a deal also would be simplified if echostar goes ahead with its plan to separate its satellite television business known as dish network from
