editing on big films is now being done on small computers like any modern professional naomi geraghty took her laptop with her when she went on a business trip in january the machine got a lot of use but not just for email ms geraghty is a film editor and was spending days at the irish coastal home of terry george director of "reservation road " starring joaquin phoenix which opened across the u s last week mr george couldnt travel for the editing so ms geraghty loaded a copy of avid editing software on her apple powerbook and went to him most people have a mental image of film editors hunched in the dark over editing consoles with lengths of film pinned to the wall behind them these days they sit at computers moving scenes around as easily as paragraphs in a word processor video files are so demanding editing computers used to cost tens of thousands even hundreds of thousands of dollars but as ms geraghtys tale suggests even relatively low end personal computers laptops included are now so powerful that hollywood pros have joined student filmmakers and indies in taking advantage of them its one more example along with music recording and graphic design of the way cheap computers are blurring the distinction between professional and amateur tools not that just having software makes you good at something as a quick trip around the web makes clear ms geraghty says that while she enjoys the comfort of her regular editing studio a notebook is not without its charms "i could look out over a fishing harbor " she says "it was the best view ive ever had from a cutting room " like "reservation road " the typical hollywood feature film these days is an analog digital hybrid reels of film might be developed at a lab such as technicolor but then &# million scanners digitize them and put them on a &# generic usb hard drive from there its on to the editors editing on computers is so much easier than editing physical film that its how nearly all movies are now cut uscs film school once had editing consoles now it has only two indeed editing may have become too easy "you can easily recut your movie times a day " says matt furie who teaches editing at usc "some students go off the deep end and cut cut cut we tell them they need to discipline themselves to push away from the desk drop the mouse and just think " like others mr furie suggests that one of the reasons there are so many rapid fire cuts in todays movies is that editing software has made them so simple to do editors are lucky in that theirs is one of the few industries with intense software competition anyone paying attention to computers the past years will understand its dynamics avid of tewksbury mass is the long established leader your average academy award winner typically is cut on an avid the company was one of the first in the field and designed its software to work the way editors were used to working for example avids programs like most software use folders but theyre called "bins " after the canvas bags into which editors used to toss small lengths of film avid software does just about anything you could ask for a price the companys flagship media creator package runs &# philip hodgetts who follows the industry for creative planet says avid has an epic fight on its hands from newer lower cost alternatives apple sells final cut studio for &# while adobes premiere pro is just &# while film still is central in big hollywood features its unclear how long it will be before even the biggest feature movies go all digital the buzz in technical movie making circles these days involves the two month old ultra high resolution digital red camera boosters say it looks nearly as good as mm film and costs around &# or about the same as renting a mm camera for days thanks to cheap computers a similar sort of creative destruction is happening everywhere in the industry color adjustment used to require expensive oscilloscope like monitors it first moved to specialized and expensive software but lately its done with relatively low cost say &# "plug ins" by companies like red giant software angus wall editor of "zodiac " a film released earlier this year says the real impact of all of this digitization is to bring simplicity and artistic control back to the process he says postproduction work on the typical hollywood movie is a vast assembly line of runners technicians assistants and others with murphys law in force at every step it isnt always easy for filmmakers to get the results they want the "zodiac" crew by contrast sought to rethink and streamline the process right on the set the digitized film went into a computer after that just a handful of people were involved while the skills were different coordinating the work of these editors and others wasnt much more difficult than what happens in an average office with a typical powerpoint presentation "its revolutionary and empowering because you dont have to worry anymore about some nameless person somewhere not doing their job right " mr wall says "you start to see the joy come back into the movie making process " email me at lee gomes wsj com corrections &amp amplifications avid
