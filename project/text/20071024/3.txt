alltel faces financing challenge alltel corp is trying to become the first major wireless carrier to undergo a leveraged buyout before it can get there however it will need to finance that buyout in credit markets that have become inhospitable and expensive for deal sponsors since the transaction was announced five months ago if the buyout goes as planned alltel will need to prove it can remain competitive in a mature industry while generating enough cash flow to pay down debt in may alltel agreed to a buyout by private equity firm tpg and gs capital partners an arm of goldman sachs group inc the deal is valued at &# billion or &# a share plus the assumption of &# billion in debt the company said it expects to close the transaction which is awaiting approval by the federal communications commission by the end of the year a challenge for alltel is to boost profit margins and retain customers at a time when the u s wireless market is becoming saturated with penetration rates above "youre looking at a very mature industry " said dave novosel a telecommunications cable and media analyst at credit research firm gimmecredit "and at a company that has performed well but now finds itself well behind the major three competitors in terms of subscribers " to complicate matters alltel picked a bad time to navigate credit markets to drum up financing for a buyout in a report this month moodys investors service said that while media and telecom companies are well positioned to weather the credit crunch alltels debt may put it at risk moodys said the sector is less economically sensitive than others adding that telecom revenue is fairly steady and less vulnerable to economic cycles making companies less likely to seek covenant relief in tight markets alltels leveraged buyout however puts it under pressure according to moodys which said liquidity concerns loom over a handful of leveraged buyouts including clear channel communications inc and cablevision systems corp "the critical period is ahead " mr novosel said "in terms of completing the transaction seeing how the sale of the debt goes after the close and determining alltels near term cash flow prospects " a spokesman for alltel declined to comment beyond statements contained in fridays earnings release representatives for tpg and gs capital partners didnt return calls seeking comment alltel said its third quarter earnings rose while net subscriber additions doubled to its total customer base is million about a fifth of the size of industry leaders at&amp t inc and verizon communications inc the little rock ark company which has a strong niche for wireless coverage in suburban and rural areas posted a third quarter churn rate or percentage of subscribers who leave of up from in the second quarter that rate lags behind some of its competitors verizon posted a churn rate in the second quarter at&amp t had a second quarter churn rate while t mobile usa inc the wireless unit of deutsche telekom ag had a second quarter churn sprint nextel corp posted a second quarter churn rate since the issuance of junk bonds and leveraged loans the primary financing vehicles for lbos bottlenecked in june market participants have kept a nervous eye on a roughly &# billion overhang of pending bond and loan issuance much of it to finance leveraged buyouts only in recent weeks have underwriters been able to entice investors to buy large blocks of new debt but it has come at a cost as banks have been forced to offer higher yields and often to sell the debt at a discount last week first data corp sold the first &# billion in bonds to finance its &# billion leveraged buyout at a discounted price of cents on the dollar in september underwriters sold &# billion of first data leveraged loans at discounted prices of cents and cents on the dollar meanwhile energy future holdings formerly known as txu corp came to market last week with a &# billion junk bond deal along with &# billion in loans to fund its leveraged buyout which was completed this month after first data and energy future holdings alltel is the next major buyout in line to tap credit markets for financing "the fact that first data got done bodes well for the alltel deal as well " said gimmecredits mr novosel who said both companies have performed well in recent years with good margins revenue and free cash flow in may following the announcement both standard &amp poors and fitch ratings cut their ratings on alltel into speculative grade or junk territory s&amp p downgraded alltel five notches to bb from a minus while fitch slashed its rating seven notches to bb minus from a both agencies kept the company on review for a possible further downgrade if the buyout is funded completely with debt alltels debt burden would increase tenfold to &# billion according to s&amp p and its leverage would climb to nearly times earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or ebitda which s&amp p said would merit a further ratings cut until full details on the financing emerge s&amp p said its bb rating is based on an assumption the sponsors will contribute enough equity to bring leverage below seven times ebitda "we do not envision any financing plan that would be more conservative " s&amp p said moodys hasnt taken any ratings action against alltel but said the company faces a multinotch downgrade once the buyout is complete as the only one of its peers to be taken private alltel will likely see an immediate crimp on capital investment "the massive amount of lbo debt will restrict investment going forward " said mr novosel who estimated alltels postbuyout debt leverage to be slightly below eight times ebitda "sponsors typically look to conserve cash not spend it and to use cash to start paying down debt "
