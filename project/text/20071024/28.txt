carrying a torch for china helps a lot in this event foreigners are competing for slots in olympic relay by bowing and scraping ten months before the games begin in beijing a new and grueling olympic sport is in full swing among foreign nationals living in china advanced kowtowing foreign residents are vying for eight slots to carry the olympic torch on chinese soil in the traditional relay prior to the games exactly people will be picked to run inside china most will be chinese eight at least will be foreigners but the foreigners have to clear some extra hurdles in an online contest organized by chinese computer maker lenovo group ltd and the government owned english language newspaper china daily the criteria aspiring torchbearers should "love chinese culture and history" and "be devoted to communicate information of a real china to their native countries " each of them also needs to write a word english essay titled "china and i " which should "cover a true touching part of my story in china " according to the application instructions foreigners have risen to the occasion engaging in a furious competition to outdo one another in praise of the middle kingdom one contestant prithviraj puttaraju a year old executive from bangalore india said "i had continuously heard that china had a lot to offer in terms of deep culture extreme beauty and growth " he added that at the u s tech company he works for he is known as "china man " benjamin travis wood an american architect in shanghai plays up modesty a virtue that chinese for some reason think americans lack "i dont deserve to carry the olympic torch for china " he wrote in a classic chinese self deprecating way of asking for something "china has changed my life china has given to me more than i have given to china " he wrote philippe le gall the seychelles ambassador in beijing offered that he was born on the eighth hour of the eighth day of the eighth month "eight eight eight is a lucky number in china and i feel the need to do something exceptional around aug " he wrote in an essay on one level this is a garden variety pr campaign by lenovo which is very active in using the olympics to market itself around the globe but in china such patriotic verbiage is also a reminder of times not entirely departed when little other public speech was permitted "theyre the words the government wants to hear " ian ross a scotsman living in china since said in a phone interview "thats the way the culture is here people want to hear that kind of rhetoric every foreigner every chinese knows that " he adds "but you dont have to say what they want you to say " still mr ross didnt push the envelope in his application "becoming an olympic torchbearer in china is a wonderful opportunity for my country scotland and also a chance for me to say thank you to the people of china for making my stay here such a wonderful and life changing experience " the online voting ended on oct and the eight winners will be chosen by a committee of lenovo and china daily executives and journalists by the end of the month entries have been received from people representing countries or nationalities lenovo spokespeople say the winners wont be chosen for slavish adoration but the essays are a way to evaluate a contestants ability to "communicate the attributes of the chinese culture to their home country " the organizers havent decided how much the essay will weigh versus popular votes and personal background about two dozen groups have been set up on facebook the social networking site to solicit votes "shameless pandering for votes continues " wrote dan brody an employee of an american internet company to his facebook group "it all started as just a lark then became kind of serious moved into extreme kitsch and ridiculousness " now he says "who cares its all for fun and olympic games anyways " but some contestants figured that the richest pool of votes would come from the million internet users in china mr brody submitted the required english essay but he also posted one in chinese on the countrys popular online forum tianya "the end of the world" he was flooded with responses some were impressed with his fluent chinese "just voted for you old foreign brother " wrote one forum member "your chinese is superb " others were flattered by his passion for china "some foreigners love china more than some chinese do " commented another others however think that even eight torch carrying foreigners are too many "i believe the whole thing of foreign torchbearers is just for show there are more than one billion chinese and many of our own outstanding people dont have the opportunity why should we give it to foreigners " one called those who voted for mr brady "blind worshipers of everything foreign " a trait that would have constituted a crime during chairman maos cultural revolution and still isnt considered virtuous some contestants and their friends have even found problems with the voting system which has allowed people to vote as many times as they want even though the rules stipulate that there shall be no more than one vote per computer a few tech savvy expatriates allegedly used computer programs that could vote thousands of times for themselves on the official contest web site people call one of the top vote getters a "cheater " "what a dishonor for the olympics " says one commentator "in the old time they cut the head off " a lenovo spokeswoman says that officials are aware of irregularities and thats one reason that the selection will not be based entirely on voting results corrections &amp amplifications a contest organized by lenovo group ltd and the china daily newspaper to select eight foreigners to carry the olympic torch in china is one of many opportunities for foreigners to be selected a page one article wednesday about the contest didnt make clear that it wasnt the sole method of selection for foreigners wsj oct
