barbie strikes pose in argentina buenos aires the famous dolls profile is everywhere stamped on clerks t shirts and on the pottery of the teahouse that serves pink iced desserts the fragrance of strawberry bubble gum fills the air and everything for sale from clothes to gadgets to decor comes in any color you want as long as those colors are pink and white welcome to the worlds first barbie store the store the brainchild of an argentine businessman tito loizeau opened its doors in buenos aires last month offering everything a young girl could want for the complete barbie experience everything except a guaranteed supply of the doll that has entertained three generations of girls as barbies maker mattel inc is struggling with recalls following the discovery of toxic materials in some of its chinese made products including barbie items "but soon we are getting a big barbies delivery " mr loizeau said barbie corner shops already exist in big toy retailers like fao schwarz in new york and the brand has stores under similar licensing arrangements as mr loizeaus but this is the first where girls fantasies take shape in the form of a hair salon a tearoom and a square foot barbie house set up in the square foot store richard dickson mattels head of world wide consumer products said the toy maker sees the argentine venture as an avenue into the south american market the store mr dickson said aims to create a "halo experience for the entire brand " "while we have a product in different categories theres not a single place where you can get it all " he said comparing the experience to that of a walt disney store or a branded theme park mr dickson said the argentine outlet will allow girls to have "a magical experience that is the barbie brand " the adventure started three years ago when mattel hired promo red mr loizeaus promotion company to run a one week barbie event in a buenos aires shopping center mr loizeau created the barbie house where mothers left their children to play while they went shopping what caught his attention was that both mothers and daughters wanted barbie outfits "they were common pink clothes but everybody wanted them just because they were in barbies wardrobe " said mr loizeau after that success the businessman made the pitch to mattel to open a barbie store along the lines of the disney store at first mattel rejected the idea on the grounds it didnt sell clothes but left the possibility open a year later the el segundo calif company asked him to put together a business plan as part of the agreement reached earlier this year mr loizeau who spent &# to open the store in palermo one of buenos airess wealthiest neighborhoods won exclusivity to expand the concept in argentina uruguay and paraguay he also has a first rights option to expand in latin america mattel gets a percentage of the stores sales and is entitled to develop the concept everywhere else in the world free of royalties to mr loizeaus new company license stores "basically mattel takes no risk if the pilot test in buenos aires fails the brand will remain undamaged because argentina is far enough from the states " mattels home market mr loizeau said mr loizeau rules out failure in the first month in business he said the barbie store already is above its annual sales target of between &# million and &# million independent economists say the countrys annual inflation rate is between and the official government figure is but shopping center sales keep on posting double digit percentage gains as the government keeps interest rates low creating an incentive to shop now rather than save for later mattel shares mr loizeaus optimism the company believes the argentine capital will provide a distinctive portal into the latin american market where countries such as brazil and mexico dominate sales of barbie dolls in the region while buenos aires is one of latin americas principal capital cities its residents have strong ties abroad finding "influence from europe and from america in style cultural trends and celebrity icons " said mattels mr dickson the company characterizes it as a "hybrid city" and "a great incubation place for us to learn and test" new ventures with the brand he said the original proposal included only barbie clothes and accessories the entertainment element came to mr loizeau later "the barbie store thus became a fashiontainment concept " he said "i wanted the store to be a sensorial experience where girls can feel as the real protagonists even though their mothers make the shopping decisions " mr loizeau said license stores spent a lot of money and time in market research focus groups showed for instance that mothers found the bubble gum smell too sweet but girls loved it they also showed that mothers were happy their daughters played with barbie as they did years earlier but didnt want their year olds to look like barbie in real life so license stores came up with the idea of selling non barbie themed baby clothes as well this in turn prompted a new "barbie and me" line of clothes for the doll which match those sold for the kids "instead of having girls dressed like barbie we dress barbie like real girls " mr loizeau said showing a pair of white and pink baby trousers that can be matched with a similar pair for barbie one big hit is the stores line of barbie makeup as for the charge that the store excludes boys mr loizeau said that in business he learned to stay focused still he tries to accommodate all needs "this is a store for girls but boys are welcome " he said pointing to a hot wheels space set up for toy cars nor is the stores sales potential limited to its target age of to years old "a year old woman has booked the tearoom to celebrate her birthday with girlfriends in two weeks time " mr loizeau said
