business bookshelf pitchman in the corner office the education of an accidental ceo by david novak with john boswell crown business pages &# yum brands inc chairman and chief executive david novak isnt your typical corporate chieftain any doubts about that should have vanished when in celebrating the companys initial public offering years ago this month he wore a yellow foam cheese head on the floor of the new york stock exchange these days in his occasionally goofy but effective efforts to motivate subordinates mr novak may opt for rubber chicken feet an executive who views himself more as coach and cheerleader than as the boss mr novak oversees one of the worlds biggest restaurant companies with some outlets in countries and nearly a million employees its fast food brands include kfc hence those chicken feet pizza hut taco bell long john silvers and a&amp w how yum brands got to be so big and successful its stock has quintupled since going public is laid out in "the education of an accidental ceo " the book guides readers along mr novaks remarkably steep and smooth career path focusing on the proper way to treat people and the rewards that can come for doing so intelligently and if possible with a smile mr novak with co author john boswell makes clear that to a large degree yum brands is a company to emulate the books subtitle "lessons learned from the trailer park to the corner office " is somewhat misleading it suggests that mr novak grew up poor and even perhaps in dissolute circumstances he did spend much of his youth bouncing around the u s in a trailer but the reason was that his father an employee of the u s coast and geodetic survey was frequently reassigned to different parts of the country to gather data for maps an entire government crew would move together "it was like a circus caravan without the elephants " mr novak recalls in any case mr novak looks back on his peripatetic upbringing as a major plus in his career development as a youth he quickly learned how to adapt to new situations and interact with strangers and while he calls himself an accidental ceo the reader will conclude that his ascent was no fluke throughout his advancement from advertising agency to pepsico inc division president to head of a corporation with &# billion in annual revenue his supervisors saw in him effusive enthusiasm and an obvious talent to lead mr novak came up through the marketing side of business and "the education of an accidental ceo" at times has a pitchmans tenor written in the first person it is chock full of insights axioms and a few bromides "fear is a fact of life " "stereotypes are poison " "enthusiasm is contagious" and "keep a lid on your ego " mr novak occasionally forgets that last piece of advice "i knew how to get through to people " he writes at one point "how to set a vision for a company and rally the troops around it " but in fact he did much of mr novaks worth as a ceo he notes is doing "whatever it takes to get people fired up " one way is to motivate with praise "you can never underestimate the power of telling someone hes doing a good job " he asserts "the higher up the ladder you are the more important it is to give credit rather than receive it always be on the lookout for reasons to celebrate the achievements of others " mr novak often sends congratulatory handwritten notes to subordinates signing them with a smiley face predictably yum is a company awash in employee awards engraved silver pizza pans rubber chickens &# bills "thank you" is "probably the most important thing a leader can say " mr novak writes at the same time he sets the bar high if you want to get noticed and promoted he says it isnt enough to do just what is required you must do more as for where you do it that shouldnt be important "if you are happy with and challenged by your work " mr novak writes "you will be happy doing it on the moon " yum by the way is headquartered in louisville ky while having self confidence is commendable listening is a vital check on it in mr novaks opinion he frequently reminds himself that despite his "infectious enthusiasm " he needs be "ever vigilant to remain open to other peoples points of view " otherwise he says "i could enthusiastically lead everyone right over the cliff " at times he has nearly done that while in pepsicos beverage operations in the early s mr novak zealously pushed the idea of a clear soda it was called crystal pepsi that turned out to be what time magazine called one of the worst product ideas of the th century mr novak now blames himself for not paying attention to in house skeptics as a marketing executive at pizza hut when it was part of pepsico in the late s he was certain that a sunglasses promotion tie in with a "back to the future" film sequel would be a "slam dunk " he should have checked first with his young daughter who pronounced the glasses "dorky " it took months mr novak now sheepishly recalls to unload nine million pairs of shades among his victories was transforming diet mountain dew from a shunned stepchild soda into a winning brand extension later he presided over a turnaround at kentucky fried chicken an accomplishment he says that "pretty much made my career " the kfc success positioned mr novak as the logical person to lead the restaurant group that pepsi wanted to spin off one reason for kfcs turnaround at least to judge by "the education of an accidental ceo" was mr novaks willingness to cooperate with franchisees many of whom had their nest eggs on the line "they think like entrepreneurs " mr novak writes "because thats what they are and wed have to be crazy not to listen to them " their advice was to concentrate on product quality new menu items and better personnel training working together company and franchisees developed an action plan one result was crispy chicken strips a franchisees creation that mr novak says became the most successful new product "since the colonels original recipe " obviously mr novaks pitchman fervor and people skills are joined to a traditionally shrewd sense of how to make a profit still he seems to relish being the hyperkinetic iconoclast he describes himself as "the one among the brooks brothers power suits with his shirttail sticking out " the ceo says that he avoids working weekends if he can help it so as to focus on family and relaxation and it may be good for yum that he does "sometimes " he confesses "the worst thing that can happen to our company is me getting a free day in the office im a creative guy and i can start dreaming up stuff to do when we havent finished what we started " mr gibson is a special writer covering the restaurant industry for dow jones newswires
