youve played the videogame now buy the car tokyo when nissan motor co decided four years ago to launch a new version of its gt r sports coupe in the u s chief executive carlos ghosn wanted to make sure the car never before sold in the u s seemed cutting edge to americans his idea was to break tradition which meant avoiding the ordinary route of big television ads and billboards "if we advertise we fail " he told his marketing team instead nissan developed a massive "viral" campaign aimed at building buzz by spreading the word through a wide range of product placement arrangements in videogames unlike with other models it didnt reveal details to anyone outside the company and posted sneak previews of the car masked in a black rubber cover on blogs and youtube in japan it worked with a publisher to create a comic book series in which the hero takes a job at nissan just to catch a glimpse of the new gt r and it struck a deal with sony corp s videogames unit sony computer entertainment inc and electronics arts inc to unveil the new version of the gt r in downloadable games at exactly the same time that mr ghosn was scheduled to introduce the car at the tokyo motor show today "weve tried to really dramatize the moment " says yoshimitsu kaji the nissan director overseeing the gt r marketing blitz nissan says it chose to use videogames because they tend to attract an impassioned group of young car enthusiasts who already know the history of the gt r and think of it as the corvette of japan launched in in japan the first version of the muscle car called the skyline gt r became legendary among car buffs world wide for its extra powerful engine before being discontinued in last year after it appeared in the racing movie "fast and the furious tokyo drift " american drivers bought gt r regalia on ebay and glued it to their dodge neons and honda civics the new gt r will go on sale in japan in december where it will be priced at &# and world wide next year the u s price has yet to be determined nissans tactics signal a shift in how the auto industry is spending its massive advertising budget while this type of stealth marketing is on the rise in all industries car makers with their edgy television commercials and glossy magazine ads have tended to stick to more traditional media but thats changing advertising spending by auto makers on tv radio and print campaigns globally fell to &# billion last year according to nielsen co meanwhile auto industry spending on internet ads and other web based means grew by more than to over &# million according to tracking firm tns media intelligence videogame manufacturers have long had agreements with companies to prominently feature their products in its need for speed racing game ea has licensing deals with over auto makers and over auto parts suppliers the older models of the gt r have long appeared in various videogames along with an array of high speed sports cars but this time nissan took the collaborations a step further the car maker worked with sony and ea to coordinate the release of new videogame downloads to coincide with the unveiling of the actual new model nissan leaked details about the car and offered test drives to delegates at sony and ea and swore anyone who worked on the project to total secrecy starting this past monday fans could download a free new version of sonys gran turismo and drive a masked version of the new gt r that is covered in a sleek black sheet eas need for speed gives users a chance to drive a prototype version of the car at the same time as the cars unveiling at the motor show players can download a version of both games that shows what the car looks like next month ea is expected to roll out its need for speed pro streets game in which the gt r is designated as its "hero" car every year ea picks one "hero" car that players compete to get the "hero" car is also featured on all packaging and in pro streets print and television ads nissan even commissioned polyphony digital inc the sony subsidiary that makes gran turismo to create the monitor inside the new gt r used for navigation and other high tech extras like monitoring engine functions the onboard computer system inside the gt r has the same futuristic aesthetic as the videogame nissan says its ad budget is confidential but adds that the gt r campaign is costing about half as much as a launch using mass market advertising videogames can provide marketers with a cheaper and more advanced form of product placement since they can digitally create images and instantly transform products says kazunori yamauchi president of polyphony digital and a senior vice president at sony "were entering an era when gaming can be the main dish in an auto makers marketing campaign " he says there are risks to using a nontraditional strategy warns dentsu inc japans top advertising agency by revenue and particularly risky is using bloggers as part of a campaign because they can turn negative "once its out there its out of your control " says dentsu senior manager norio kobayashi nevertheless nissans mr kaji says he is confident that given the strength of the gt r brand the message wont turn negative the campaign comes at a critical time for nissan which is owned by renault sa of france earlier this year nissan posted its first drop in net profit in seven years amid slowing sales in the key u s market where fuel conscious consumers are shunning its big suvs and trucks the gt r is no surefire winner it is likely to face competition from other japanese auto makers that are showcasing expensive high performance sports cars in tokyo this week toyota motor corp is showing off its new lexus is f sports sedan and mitsubishi motors corp has a redesigned lancer evolution x nissans mr ghosn acknowledges that fielding a nearly horsepower supercar like the gt r might seem strange at a time when consumers and regulators around the world are worried about climate change and rising oil prices but he says nissan has to appeal to all kinds of car buyers "there is a market for this " he said in an interview in tokyo "people love it " nissan forecasts sales of gt rs per month in japan the company hasnt said how many it expects to sell in the u s or whether the cars price will approximate the &# sticker in japan ea says that among the million annual players of the need for speed game the vast majority are to year old men not the best demographic for a high five figure car paul sakalas years old first learned about the skyline gt r when he was playing gran turismo on his playstation mr sakalas a radio producer in virginia beach va says he was exuberant when he heard a new version of the car would finally be sold in the u s "but when i heard how much it cost my dreams were crushed on the rocks of reality " says mr sakalas he now drives a nissan sentra sedan joseph b white contributed to this article
