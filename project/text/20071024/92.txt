"sometimes thats hard to do if hiding behind a mask " but for employees like ryan lynch who works at young &amp rubicam an advertising agency in new york a costume can be "the ultimate conversation starter " last year when he dressed up at work as a skier from the s complete with an era appropriate mustache he found it became an easy way to start a chat with someone he might otherwise just pass by in the hallway to dress or not to dress its a point worth considering as halloween office events including costume contests creep up on the office break calendar while some people cant resist the prospect of wearing a costume while performing daily work tasks others would rather dress for business as usual and even though the young at heart employee might see it as the perfect time to express

five times more than the variety made for children he added one subset of adult costumes that has grown greatly in popularity is the provocative variety that allows adults to have fun with "sexy doctor" or "sexy nurse" costumes for example mr kirchner said it should be obvious but maybe its worth saying anyway while those costumes may be fun for a night out dont take them to the office in fact employers will probably want to lay down the ground rules beforehand when it comes to costumes said michael karpeles head of the labor and employment group at goldberg kohn a chicago based law firm "its ok to allow people to dress up but i think that companies should let their employees know that certain types of costumes are not appropriate if theyre especially revealing for example " he said also shy away from disturbing horror costumes or ones with religious themes that might rub co workers the wrong way and remember office policies such as those regarding sexual harassment dont take a holiday at work events "if someone has a costume a he man costume or superman costume and wants to demonstrate his super powers for certain women it doesnt take much imagination to see where things could lead " mr karpeles said the encouragement of halloween costumes in the office fits into an overall trend of companies wanting their workplaces to feel fun and comfortable said john

suggest that youre not a team player also getting more than one co worker to go in on a group costume can get a lot of laughs and knowing that you wont be the only one in costume can help in the confidence department said mr lynch the young &amp rubicam employee "there is strength in numbers " he added other tips for celebrating halloween in the office follow your companys policy on whether
