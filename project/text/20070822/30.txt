chinas market vital but tricky baird capital partners got a lesson in chinas cutthroat business culture a couple of years ago when a plastic molding company it owned tried to set up a joint venture there while reading the fine print of an agreement between xaloy inc and a local manufacturer baird capital came across a passage indicating that the chinese entity planned to set up a sister company with access to xaloys proprietary technology baird a unit of robert w baird &amp co realized the joint venture was a ruse when it slipped a noncompetition clause into the agreement and the other party pulled out of the deal according to baird the local company essentially wanted to crib xaloys intellectual property and set up its own operation baird says it might not have picked up on the ploy if it hadnt had a team of investment professionals embedded in the country "you cant manage asia from afar the laws are evolving the culture is evolving " said andrew brickman a partner with the milwaukee firm "the most viciously competitive market in the world is asia " it is also one of the most complicated markets but asia is increasingly an essential ingredient of doing business for many midmarket companies that combination is prompting more u s midmarket buyout firms to open offices in china to help shepherd their portfolio companies through the tricky process of sourcing goods and establishing manufacturing sites in the region while megafund managers like carlyle group and blackstone group lp have had a presence in china for years only recently have their midmarket colleagues followed suit at least four have opened offices in china in the past year or so american securities capital partners llc sun capital partners inc anderson group and hammond kennedy whitney &amp co they join a small number of midmarket firms that have been there for longer including baird and blue point capital there is no blueprint for setting up shop with the new entrants varying in how they pay for their new branches and how many people they commit to the effort some firms like anderson group charge their portfolio companies fees to support the new offices others like american securities rely on the general partners to absorb the costs these firms say that expanding overseas is no easy task as reliable talent is hard to find and office space in cities like hong kong and shanghai is expensive becoming global also puts stress on a firms culture as lengthy overseas flights and a m conference calls become a day to day reality "its a lot of money and its even more time and effort " said michael g fisch president of american securities capital but they add that midmarket investors have no choice but to pay attention to china as u s manufacturing shifts overseas for instance blue point portfolio company engineered material solutions inc which makes metal strips for the automotive and telecommunications industries recently opened a production facility in eastern china under pressure from customers automobile brake and component maker qualitor inc in which baird has a stake had to open a site in china or else lose a contract with a top customer that recently moved production to the region "the middle markets customer base is heading to asia " mr brickman said "asia is not going anywhere you have to deal with the global economy because ignoring it will only threaten what youre trying to do " a presence in asia can also give a firm a competitive edge in making deals blue point structured its bid for dri eaz products inc last year by taking into account cost savings the dehumidifier maker could generate by sourcing parts in china "we bid more sharply than we would have otherwise " said blue point managing partner chip chaikin "it allowed us to be a little more aggressive " his firm also makes it a point to sell its capabilities in asia to u s investment banks and took a handful of them on a weeklong tour of the country about a year and a half ago the visit impressed lincoln international which now keeps blue point in mind when it is advising a business that has facilities in china or is looking to source products in the region having an office in china "gives them a competitive advantage in actually winning deals in the u s " said jim lawson managing director and co chairman of the chicago bank "private equity firms are trying to distinguish themselves in some way this asian play is a way to distinguish yourself " just how firms go about that varies for instance hammond kennedy has just one director on the ground in shanghai a chinese native who had worked for the firm in the u s since and relocated last year baird capital in contrast has a person team spread across offices in hong kong shanghai and beijing anderson group which buys u s based manufacturers valued at less than &# million has staffed its shanghai office with a partner a chief financial officer and two sourcing specialists with connections in the plastics and metals industries the team essentially acts as a chaperone for anderson group portfolio companies looking to source goods in the region it handles everything from making travel arrangements for visiting business executives to helping navigate the complex legal wrangling it takes to establish a manufacturing plant for anderson group its china office represents a major change in strategy for most of its years in business the firm took pains to avoid investing in companies vulnerable to competition from china considering the region a threat that changed in when it made a play for texstyle llc a u s based bedding and curtain maker with facilities in shanghai the investment opened the firms eyes to the advantages of sourcing goods in the region prompting it to establish the office "we shouldnt be looking at china as a strategic threat " said corey gaffney a partner with the firm "it really should be an opportunity "
