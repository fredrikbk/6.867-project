sprint nextel bets on wimax sprint nextel corp wants its wimax network to serve more than just cellphones and laptops a move that would change the business model of its wireless operations besides selling wireless service to subscribers the wireless carrier is seeking to embed access to the network in more novel products such as digital cameras and even billboards sprint thinks that move along with other advertising opportunities will diversify its wireless business away from its traditional subscription model "im absolutely convinced this model will work " chief technology officer barry west said at sprints technology summit last week "it is a completely new game changing model " the early wimax revenue generated by sprint will likely come from the subscription model longer term though the company hopes to make money from advertising for example it has a deal with google inc in which more than half of the mobile advertising revenue from the wimax network goes to sprint it expects to post revenue of &# billion to &# billion from the network in as a sign of the plans significance to sprint the company has unveiled a new brand xohm for the business however the companys history in building new brands is mixed "sprint is a powerful telecom brand " mr west said "we want to create an internet brand " wimax is a wider ranging form of internet access similar to its cousin wi fi but it uses licensed spectrum and is considered more dependable sprint chief executive gary forsee said demand for wimax services wont grow without a large number of products that use the network as a result the company has teamed with intel corp motorola inc samsung electronics co and nokia corp to release million wimax products over the next three years mr west said sprint was in discussions with other makers of consumer electronic products one example presented was with a digital camera sprint could sell service either as a one time fee or regular subscription that would allow consumers to send photos to their home computer from the camera through the wimax connection down the line billboards with wimax chips in them could link up with an individuals wimax enabled cellphone and present the bystander with a personalized advertisement cars traveling down the highway will be able to pick up and play video stored in computers at home the "embedded model" gives sprint a chance to expand beyond selling just cellphones it also gets the company away from using subsidies to push its service the million devices expected over the next three years still pales in comparison to wi fi enabled devices roughly million consumer electronic devices are expected to carry wi fi chips by according to abi research sprint is making a costly bet &# billion through that its wimax network which it dubs g technology will pay off by winning new customers the company needs the help the wireless carrier has been steadily losing customers over the past several quarters and only in the recent quarter did it turn itself around management has warned that things could get worse in the third quarter "we believe the success of sprints g strategy is critical to its ability to arrest the companys current market share decline in the u s post paid market " ubs analyst john hodulik said in a note the network wont just benefit sprint fred wright who heads up cellular network products and wimax for motorola said he sees revenue opportunity in providing consumer devices modems and networking equipment to support wimax in the to time frame the market will be worth "billions of billions of dollars " he said "as g tapers off broadband wireless will take off " mr wright said "it represents a good replacement technology " the low key debut of xohm pronounced "zome" was meant to replicate the quiet groundswell of support that google or facebook enjoyed in their early days it is unclear however whether the xohm name will garner the same following as its more famous web predecessors mr west said it was necessary to create a separate brand so sprint and xohm products can be sold at the same locations but at different price points laptops and other electronic devices will boast xohm stickers similar to intels centrino stickers "thats a great long term goal " said david placek chief executive of brand consulting firm lexicon branding inc "but i think those things are difficult to pull off " sprint has had varied success with its brands the company initially caused confusion by attempting to tie the sprint and nextel brands following those companies merger which partly resulted in the defection of nextel customers its pivot brand which is a wireless joint venture between sprint and four cable companies took more than a year to get off the ground and hasnt made much of a dent sprint however has done well in positioning boost mobile as a youth oriented brand and is seeing sporadic success in going after leap wireless international inc and metropcs communications inc with its expanded boost unlimited service
