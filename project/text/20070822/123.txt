td ameritrade in merger talks with e trade the online brokerage industry which underwent a wave of consolidation after the bursting of the dot com bubble may be headed for another shakeout with giants td ameritrade holding corp and e trade financial corp holding merger discussions a merger of the two online brokers would create a dominant player in what has been a highly fragmented industry with dozens of smaller companies battling for market share as a result it could reduce some of the fierce competition that has benefited consumers by driving down the cost of online trading but has squeezed the industry by chipping away at its profit margins as of the end of june e trade had million brokerage and banking accounts td ameritrade had million such accounts and charles schwab corp now the largest online broker had about million merrill lynch &amp co in contrast has more than million customer accounts a spokeswoman for e trade said the firms management team has consistently stated it believes there is "tremendous value in consolidation that aligns business strategy and operational synergies and will do what is in the best interest of its customers " a td ameritrade spokeswoman said "we have talked and continue to talk to peers in the industry " e trade and td ameritrade have been in serious discussions for weeks but arent yet close to a deal according to people familiar with the matter they have discussed an alliance several times in previous years but have never managed to make it to the altar this time however they may feel more pressure to reach a deal two hedge funds with big stakes in td ameritrade have publicly urged the two companies to talk the two funds jana partners llc and s a c capital have argued that toronto dominion bank which owns of td ameritrade opposes a merger of the company because its interests arent fully aligned with other shareholders the funds which own a combined of td ameritrade contend that the canadian bank wants to use the online broker which is based in omaha neb to grow in the u s and isnt necessarily focused solely on maximizing shareholder value td bank has publicly disagreed with that characterization of its position even so jana and s a c successfully pressured td ameritrade to remove td banks chief executive from the online brokers mergers and acquisitions committee in early july it isnt clear what a merger deal between e trade and td ameritrade would be worth or how it might be structured one person familiar with the talks estimated a deal could create a company valued at as much as &# billion given the cost saving that could result from uniting both companys accounts on a single computer system the consolidation would make the cost of adding new clients minimal yesterday e trade shares rose cents to close at &# in p m composite trading on the nasdaq stock market td ameritrade which also trades on nasdaq closed at &# up cents td ameritrade currently carries a market capitalization of &# billion while e trades stock value is &# billion a person familiar with the merger talks said the discussions currently are focused on making sure both online brokers agree on strategy ameritrade historically has been known as king of the low cost trade while e trade has pursued a more diversified strategy and even owns a bank in recent years though both firms have become more focused on offering customers an array of products "both companies are looking to add client assets and diversify their operations away from trading commissions so on many levels a merger makes sense " says rich repetto an analyst at boutique brokerage firm sandler oneill + partners lp since the internet bubble burst the sector has been beset by falling commissions new york based e trade for instance now charges between &# and &# a trade in by contrast schwab corp made headlines by offering the then bargain price of &# for online trades of up to shares at the time schwab insiders worried that such a price cut trades had cost roughly three times that amount before would eat up profits today the competition for low cost trades is even fiercer some banks including bank of america corp now offer free

acquisition scene amid the current credit crunch traditional mergers among industry rivals like td ameritrade and e trade may be the surest path for such companies to reach a deal such a deal might also be subjected to less antitrust scrutiny now under the business friendly bush administration than if it came up for review under president bushs eventual successor in recent years a number of deals between major competitors have passed antitrust muster including appliance maker whirlpool corp s acquisition of maytag corp and the merger of the nations largest and second largest hog producers smithfield foods inc and premium standard farms inc the credit crunch however has added a new wrinkle to the td ameritrade e trade talks last week e trade was hit with rumors that the quality of its mortgage portfolio a growth engine for the company in recent years was weak the companys stocks dropped last thursday before rebounding the same day after e trade assured the market that despite some volatility "the financial health of the company is sound " still sources close to the negotiations say the quality of e trades mortgage portfolio is an issue td ameritrade is watching closely eventually those involved in the talks say they expect the sticking points to be familiar ones the two sides will need to agree on a management team to run the combined company and on a related note what degree of control ameritrade shareholder td bank would have once the two brokerage firms were combined picking a management team wont be easy both companies are run by forceful chief executives mitch caplan at e trade and joe moglia at td ameritrade control was a point of contention during ameritrades talks with td bank eventually mr moglia got the ceo post and td bank acquired five of the companys board seats a person familiar with the matter said the two companies were talking before hedge funds jana and s a c went public with their call for talks between the pair this person said the move actually slowed down negotiations because td ameritrade has been working to address some of the concerns raised by the funds such as removing the td bank ceo from its merger and acquisition committee a deal between e trade and td bank would put added competitive pressure on schwab during a conference call with analysts in july schwab chief executive charles schwab threw cold water on speculation his firm might merge suggesting that its internal growth opportunities were superior to acquisition related ones yesterday a schwab spokeswoman declined to comment schwab long criticized by analysts for its high expenses has sought in recent years to cut costs it also recently named walt bettinger as president and chief operating officer to help assuage some concerns that had been brewing on wall street about the depth of schwabs management bench in another move aimed at getting its house in order schwab last year sold u s trust to bank of america schwab initially bought u s trust in hopes of retaining more wealthy clients but the marriage never worked in part because of culture clashes between the two companies
