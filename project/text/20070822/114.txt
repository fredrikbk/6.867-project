shoe merger seeks big footprint it is time for the casual shoe industry to grow up and matt rubel is prodding it on its way as president and chief executive of collective brands inc a footwear company formed last week with payless shoesource inc s &# million acquisition of stride rite corp mr rubel will head a firm that some said points to the future of how casual shoes will be distributed world wide big sophisticated companies such as nike inc already have consolidated the athletic sneaker business but the other side of footwear is still dominated by smallish manufacturers that serve thousands of mom and pop chains the merged company aims to become a brand building powerhouse injecting a heavy dose of marketing savvy into a stubbornly fragmented and sleepy industry the result according to proponents of the deal will be a higher profile at department stores sporting goods outlets and other major chains for a fast rising stable of brands that includes stride rite keds sperry top sider and saucony "i personally believe the footprint of collective brands will be significantly larger at some later date " said gilbert harrison chairman of financo inc a new york investment bank that advised payless on the deal "matt rubels vision is to democratize fashion and design in footwear and accessories to the world " after spearheading a multiyear turnaround of nikes cole haan brand mr rubel took the helm two years ago of what had long been a no frills discounter since then designers hired from shops such as kenneth cole and michael kors have been filling paylesss chain of shoe outlets with stylish branded and exclusive lines such as airwalk american eagle champion and dexter which now account for about of sales and eventually could double that in its purchase of stride rite which operates more than stores of its own some have fretted over the price which was high by some measures especially after the stock markets recent selloff still many agree it will pay off in the long term a key advantage of the deal mr harrison said is that increasing cash flow from the payless chain can fund long term brand development and further acquisitions at stride rites higher margin wholesale business indeed those funds recently have been lacking at stride rite mr rubel said for example that the sperry top sider brand doesnt have a designer for its womens line noting that women account for of all shoe buying but only of sperrys business that will soon change he said sperry will spend the next few months crafting plans for its untapped pool of female shoppers over the next two to three years there also is big potential to take the sperry brand slightly more upmarket and extend it into clothing and accessories mr rubel said the same goes for stride rites saucony brand which has begun a search for a new ad agency the keds line having swung wildly in recent years between targeting customers from ages to will aim its shoes at year olds an age to which both the teenage and the middle age alike can aspire he said "its not just about chasing fashion its about creating brand platforms" that can spur demand for an image or lifestyle mr rubel said that bold vision which resembles the higher margin businesses of sneaker giants such as nike could help collective brands gain back some of the profits that casual shoemakers have lost over the years to big discounters and middle market department stores the latter have gained leverage in recent years by tracking fashion trends themselves and establishing their own relationships with overseas manufacturers to make private label shoes said john shanley an analyst at susquehanna financial group "this is going back to the way the shoe industry used to be run years ago powerful brands that control their own distribution " mr shanley said collective brands will rely on payless to fuel the effort and the chains ability to generate cash has room to grow said jeff stein an analyst at keybanc capital markets payless on average charges less than &# for a pair of shoes but the average at department stores and rival specialty stores such as shoe carnival inc and brown shoe co s famous footwear chain is more than &# a pair mr stein estimates every time a pair of shoes at payless goes up a dollar on average as the company adds more high quality and fashionable footwear mr stein estimated it will add &# million in sales and cents a share in yearly earnings last year the payless chain nearly doubled its earnings to &# million or &# a share on revenue of &# billion analysts also have admired paylesss prowess in cutting profitable deals with overseas manufacturers and in distributing shoes to retail outlets quickly and precisely having opened a new distribution warehouse in redlands calif this summer collective brands will open another in ohio next year in addition to stocking payless stores the new facilities could help the company deliver quick changing styles and keep sizes in stock for its wholesale customers that is a task whose complexity has led the more upscale department stores and family footwear chains to shy away from making and distributing their own shoes collective brands aims to become a model of "precision retailing " said mr rubel he takes inspiration from vf corp which makes lee and wrangler jeans vans skater shoes and the north face skiwear among other lines a smaller but fast growing and highly profitable pillar of the new companys business will be in licensing with which the company aims to stoke growth for its brands world wide "it took vf a decade to get where they are today " mr rubel said "if we can do it in five years it will be pretty amazing "
