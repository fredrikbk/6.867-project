muscle cars on parade royal oak mich former texas oilman george w bush is talking about making fuel out of switchgrass a major oil and gas company is trying to convince consumers that its initials stand for "beyond petroleum " even arnold schwarzenegger has sworn off his hummers whats an old muscle car guy to do many come to this leafy suburb outside detroit every august for the woodward dream cruise its one of the last places on earth where low fuel economy high octane and raw horsepower are still celebrated with a rare combination of exuberance and reverence best described as the worlds largest rolling muscle car show the dream cruise has been held on the third saturday of august for decades but locals know that it really begins as soon as the snow melts thats when unabashed muscle car enthusiasts open up the heated garage and take the tarp off of their horsepower steel chariots these cars are labors of love for many they scour ebay and small town auctions to find them viewed more broadly the cars with names like chevelle mustang and hemi cuda are reminders of the days when detroit actually made cars with some sense of styling and git up and go under the hood woodward avenue is the grand boulevard that runs the length of detroit from the bombed out shell of the inner city to suburban pontiac and beyond but during the third week in august the stretch from about eight mile road northward becomes a scene straight out of "american graffiti " george lucass homage to californias car culture and the muscle cars that defined it there are other classic car shows but this is the one where car owners come to cruise and be cruised like kirk featherston of oxford mich who was here in his orange and black mint condition ford torino the car has a cubic inch cobra jet engine that puts out horsepower fuel mileage "no clue " said mr featherston "all i know is i need a wallet full of money for the weekend " same for dave grizzel of grand rapids mich he was here with his chevrolet chevelle ss and oldsmobile both of which are insured for "somewhere between &# and &# " he said the chevelle is especially nice because it has all original parts and a special rally green paint job that was an option that year the mileage is "terrible" on both mr grizzel admitted but he still spends the extra money for &# a gallon octane fuel that is sold at some of the gas stations along woodward just for dream cruisers while that may sound like a lot the price of fuel is the last concern here thats because a lot of these cars have sentimental value for the owners like tom daults cadillac el dorado convertible "i had a car just like this once and promised myself that id own one again " said mr dault of chelsea mich his caddy is white with red leather interior he has adorned it with a set of texas longhorns as a hood ornament a musical horn and a front license plate that reads "boss hog " it took him a year to find the car on ebay where he paid &# for it and had it shipped to michigan from san diego eunice allen of novi mich bought her black ford thunderbird hardtop in from a classic car dealer named "t bird ted " the car had no particular sentimental value to her she simply fell in love with it "it was perfect " she said "i couldnt pass it up " shes only the cars second owner the t bird which features a cubic inch engine and red leather interior has less than original miles on it mrs allen had the car for sale here for &# thats not unusual many of the cars here have "for sale" signs on them because the owners know that this is the place to get top dollar for them many advertise that theyre "all original " like a ford mustang gt that had just miles on it and according to the original bill of sale was built in nearby dearborn on april and sold to joseph errante who still owns it on may a few of the cars here hadnt yet been restored like the meteor montcalm s two door convertible that adrian clements had on display according to mr clements a member of the ford galaxie club of america it was just one of four cars built with that trim level and options at fords oakville ontario plant that year it features a cubic inch marauder v engine and four speed manual transmission the car is rusted out and badly in need of repair but it still drew a crowd and so it went i walked about eight miles here but could have gotten all the material i needed for this story in about a block and a half it is by far the best collection of working classic cars ive ever seen the auto makers mistakenly try to have a presence here seeing these great cars next to the ovoid schlockmobiles of today only reminds you just how far the industry has fallen there are a few exceptions the corvette is still the best car you can buy for &# and dodges new challenger is a nod to the companys solid muscle car past but the new model pales in comparison to the historic ones on display here indeed what you have to keep reminding yourself as you walk along woodward avenue is that these werent specialty vehicles that detroit made for car shows and drag racers these were the cars that detroit once mass produced our dads drove them to work and our moms took them to the grocery store unfortunately an afternoon at the dream cruise makes it clear that those days are long gone mr yost was the detroit bureau chief for the dow jones newswires he is the author of "the mph billboard the inside story of how big money changed nascar" motorbooks see related letter "letters to the editor burning up the road detroit still has muscle" wsj sep
