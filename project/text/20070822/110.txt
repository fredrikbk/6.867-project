opportunities for investors willing to overlook some dings and scratches in companies that should generate healthy profits over the long term among the stocks trading at attractive prices are genworth financial inc allstate corp hartford financial services group inc chubb corp and ace ltd true some of these stocks could be hurt one way or another by subprime mortgages gone bad but any losses could be minor compared with their overall profits genworth which was spun out of general electric co in sells mortgage insurance which puts the company on the hook to make good on home loans if borrowers default genworth and the other insurers hold mortgage securities in their investment portfolios and some include subprime loans "its got the mortgage word in it and thats a bad word these days " says

investors nervous is genworths u s mortgage insurance business which generates of the companys revenue officials have tried to reassure investors about the risks in that portfolio in discussing second quarter results on a conference call chief executive michael fraizer said subprime loans made up of the u s mortgage insurance portfolio and called that exposure "limited " genworth also sells life

thats the issue " mr kamath said pointing to the state of the broader mortgage market "it is a cyclical market and we just happen to be in the negative part of it right now " for many other insurers the sin of holding mortgage securities as part of their overall investment portfolio has made investors dump their shares shares of hartford and chubb are trading at about times book value while ace shares are trading at about times all below their historical ranges it is true insurers typically will have to mark their subprime bonds to market each quarter meaning they could take hits to their shareholders equity but what looks like short term pain could turn into longer term gain if they hold these bonds to maturity and there are no significant defaults that undermine them because then they would eventually realize the gains they originally anticipated a number of large insurers have noted that most of their bonds are in the highest rated categories aaa and aa "the p&amp c insurer
