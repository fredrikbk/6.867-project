valassis deal weighs it down valassis communications inc sells coupons but it may be valassiss shares taking a big discount if it doesnt show payoffs from a recent acquisition buying direct marketer advo inc a lengthy contentious purchase that closed in march was supposed to broaden valassiss coupon business as a price war with competitors and shrinking newspaper sales eroded profits but advos business turned out to be weaker than expected and the early disappointing results coupled with the deals hefty price tag have weighed on valassiss shares the companys market capitalization has been sliced in half over the past year to less than &# million valassis says the deal will pay off over time as it integrates the two companies sales forces and sells advertisers on the benefits of being able to market in several formats others are less optimistic believing this was an expensive acquisition and that the two companies are not a good fit skeptical investors will be expecting valassis to make good on promised benefits from the deal by next year valassiss share price doesnt suggest much optimism about the advo purchase earlier this month the stock withered to its lowest point in more than a decade and its shares trade at a much lower multiple than peers valassis chief executive alan schultz says the stocks decline is "irrational " and he and other company officials have been picking up shares as a sign of confidence "we dont have a crisis in our business " mr schultz said "we just have a stock thats real low that doesnt reflect whats going on in our business " when it announced last summer that it would buy advo valassis which completed the acquisition at a price of approximately &# billion saw the deal as a way to offer advertisers new ways to reach consumers like valassis advo puts together marketing promotions from multiple advertisers valassis delivers its bundles of coupons as "free standing inserts " or fsis the familiar pages of coupons stuffed into sunday newspapers advo delivers similar marketing promotions through the mail valassis saw an opportunity for cross selling to each companys traditional clients it is too early to draw conclusions but in the second quarter the first reporting period as a combined company valassis missed earnings expectations and ratcheted down guidance for the year blaming in large measure lower revenue than expected and the unpredictability of advos business bears believe the hiccups show the advo deal was misguided from the start but valassis says the rationale of the deal remains sound "customer bases around valassis and advo are very complementary " said suzie brown head of sales development at valassis "i think we have a very strong value proposition to customers that no competitor can match " valassis says it needs six months or more to integrate the two companies sales staffs and effectively sell products from valassis and the former advo business company officials have been on an eight city road show to meet with sales associates to bolster support for new business plans valassis also hopes to attract more local businesses to support its existing retailers and other national advertisers the addition of advo may be a help in that effort as its direct mail products allow it to send location specific coupons and promotions to respective neighborhoods meantime valassis has made inroads cutting costs and otherwise steadying advo which had been experiencing financial problems before the merger advos gross margins ticked up more than a percentage point in the second quarter to compared to a year earlier at the same time valassis is working to integrate advo the company continues to struggle with problems in its core inserts business where troubles are likely to get worse valassiss profits have been dented for several years as rival news america marketing slashed its prices forcing valassis to do the same news america is owned by news corp which is buying dow jones &amp co publisher of this newspaper valassis has other advertising products but the fsi business has been roughly half the companys revenue and profitable for the company which is based in livonia mich the pricing pressures have eroded margins at its fsi business from the range of several years ago to just more than in the first half of this year valassiss fsi prices are already down this year and the company recently said it expects prices to decline in by low to mid single digit percentages from this year it doesnt help that the newspapers that include valassiss inserts are printing fewer copies thanks to greater use of the internet and higher materials costs fewer copies of newspapers means less revenue for valassis makers of supermarket products also are directing less effort toward blanketing shoppers with coupons the vast majority of which go unused advo itself was concerned about continuing weakness in valassiss core coupon business the two companies initially talked about a stock merger according to court filings but advo was worried about exposing its shareholders to a faltering company some say the rationale for the advo deal looks better as valassiss inserts business wanes "i think the deal makes more sense to me now than when they announced it " said troy mastin an analyst at william blair &amp co who rates valassis at "market perform " "their dependence on and exposure to the newspaper industry is maybe a bigger liability than we thought a year ago " he says financially valassis needs the advo deal to pay off buying advo was a big bite and pushed the companys leverage to about times expected earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization this year or ebitda after adjusting for a full year of the advo transaction there were rumors valassiss dwindling earnings would trip up debt covenants but fitch ratings analyst mike simonton says the company has plenty of wiggle room to meet requirements set by lenders wall street
