the afternoon report history lessons online edition with a crucial report on iraq nearing president bush today compared the u s military engagement there to the vietnam war arguing that the consequences of withdrawal from that earlier conflict serve as a justification for the u s to persist in iraq speaking to the convention of veterans of foreign wars the president said "one unmistakable legacy of vietnam is that the price of americas withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like boat people re education camps and killing fields " moreover he said the pullout showed al qaeda terrorists that americans couldnt stand to fight long wars "will todays generation of americans resist the deceptive allure of retreat and do in the middle east what veterans in this room did in asia " mr bush asked the gathering in kansas city mo todays speech also drew heavily on the examples of the pacific war against imperial japan and the korean war saying their more successful outcomes held lessons for u s involvement in iraq that said mr bush last november paid a visit to vietnam which is now more politically and economically stable on that trip he also made comparisons between the two unpopular wars saying that vietnam today served to remind that progress takes time mr bushs rhetorical sally today comes ahead of a much anticipated report to congress about progress in iraq from gen david petraeus and ambassador ryan crocker expected in mid september it also comes as relations between washington and iraqi prime minister nouri al malikis government may be fraying although he was more supportive today in his speech mr bush yesterday cited his "frustration" with the iraqi governments lack of advancement in uniting the countrys rival factions mr crocker said that u s support in iraq wasnt a "blank check" and depended on iraqi progress more stridently sen carl levin d mich on monday said mr maliki should be removed and someone less sectarian installed today at the end of a three day visit to syria mr maliki said no one had the right to set timetables for his government and that criticism only reflected discomfort with his syrian visit "we will pay no attention " he said "we can find friends elsewhere " mr maliki also blamed the flurry of criticism on the u s presidential election campaign which brought presidential hopefuls to kansas city this week illinois sen barack obama told the vfw yesterday that there is no military solution to iraqs political problems even if the recent troop increase had helped to diminish violence and that iraqi leaders were not achieving political benchmarks and on monday sen hillary clinton his main rival for the democratic nod also noted that the troop surge had helped to quell violence but that political progress in iraq remained elusive sen john mccain a republican contender and longtime supporter of the war told the vfw monday that withdrawal from iraq would be a grave mistake although americans are understandably "sick and tired" of the war itself meanwhile in iraq a black hawk helicopter went down today killing all u s
