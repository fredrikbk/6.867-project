found in the weeds bug scientist touts cure for levee leaks engineers ponder benefits of fast growing vetiver foe of termites hangovers new orleans louisiana state university professor gregg henderson is a bug scientist but lately hes been obsessed with grass in a city searching for ways to combat two great plagues termites and flooding dr henderson believes an unremarkable looking tall grass could be a new weapon to fight both vetiver grasss densely clumped stems quickly shoot up to feet tall it puts down a massive root system that has been touted for diverse uses ranging from erosion protection for the hurricane prone gulf coast to a treatment for baldness dr henderson an entomologist at lsus agcenter is interested in vetivers ability to repel subterranean termites including the rapacious formosan species that is devouring much of new orleans his studies have convinced him vetiver would be ideal for reinforcing the citys protective floodwall system fighting erosion and discouraging termite infestations that he believes have weakened the levees but the bug professors vetiver crusade has hit a wall the u s army corps of engineers the corps charged with fortifying the citys levees is skeptical that the grass can really do all its advocates claim and the corps frets that vetiver isnt a native plant which could be a problem if the plant proves to be invasive government officials are still wincing from the consequences of importing virulent kudzu known as "the vine that ate the south" to control erosion in the s "were obviously concerned and proceeding with caution when it comes to vetiver " says col murray starkel in charge of operations at the corps new orleans district office its not the first time vetiver has run into skeptics a global organization known as the vetiver network has been preaching the virtues of the grass for three decades it has succeeded in getting vetiver widely adopted in countries around the world but in the u s "we have had no luck getting anyones attention " says william journey a biologist and expert in rural water supply who became a vetiver believer through his work for unicef and the world bank in south asia vetiver is native to india its fibrous aromatic roots have been harvested for centuries and turned into perfumes insect repelling textiles closet sachets and even food flavorings the "vetiver grass system" caught on among foreign aid workers in the s and s who taught villagers and farmers how to use it for controlling erosion and water runoff vetiver could grow in sand or clay in the desert or submerged in water the more people planted it the more uses they found for it in guatemala a villager confided to u s aid worker jim smyle that his wife brewed the roots in a tea to soothe her hormone rattled nerves others believed it was good for treating diabetes and high blood pressure as for mr smyle who grows the grass around his home outside san antonio texas "i can personally attest to its worth as a hangover cure " he says but the army corps of engineers has so far shunned the grass for what many believe to be its greatest use erosion control while vetiver cant survive in colder northern climates devotees argue the grass is ideally suited to help protect hurricane prone coastal areas in the south in a breakthrough vetiver recently made a short list of plants the army corps was considering for plantings along the new orleans levees "it has some characteristics worth exploring " concedes col starkel but corps planners are concerned about vetivers tendency to develop roots at its leaf joints if pieces broke off and washed away during a flood they could root elsewhere and spread the plant to places its not wanted vetiver advocates point to hundreds of years of cultivation abroad as well as in the u s to prove that the grass is well behaved the grass has been a part of the new orleans landscape for two centuries without becoming invasive say local residents "i grew up knowing about vetiver " says jean fahr president of the civic gardening group parkway partners "my grandmother hung it in her closet to repel moths " new orleans nurseryman don heumann first learned about vetiver years ago while exploring plants for coastal restoration projects as mr heumann learned more about the grass he became enthralled and then frustrated "you just cant get anyone to believe all the things this plant does " he says hurricane katrina destroyed mr heumanns greenhouses south of the city and flooded his land with saltwater for days he says his vetiver grass was the only plant to survive intrigued by its insect repelling reputation about years ago mr heumann tried dropping some chopped up roots on a swarm of termites the next day the termites were gone he says except for several dead ones thats when he took the plants to dr henderson a leading expert on formosan termites at lsus agcenter over the years dr henderson and other scientists pinpointed a chemical in vetiver roots called nootkatone thats toxic to many insects including termites several patents later dr henderson is conducting more experiments to prove his theory that vetiver grass can form an effective barrier to subterranean termites and that it can thrive in a salty gulf coast environment years before katrina dr henderson warned that formosan termites were invading trees growing along the levees and even eating the sugar cane based seam filling material in the concrete dike walls which he believed weakened the protective system vetiver he says could not only provide erosion control and a breakwater barrier but it could help ward off future termite infestations the corps regards termites as only "a minor contributing factor" to levee failures and officials remain wary that vetiver could prove to have downsides that outweigh it benefits despite the government doubts private landowners have begun to embrace vetiver grass doug terreson an oil industry analyst for morgan stanley in houston installed thousands of the plants along the shorefront of his property on mobile bay ala after losing several feet to erosion from hurricane katrina the grass was by far the cheapest solution he found to his erosion problem costing &# to &# a plant depending on the size "they call it the soil nail " he said "and thats what it is " two months after planting the grass "i couldnt pull it from the ground " earlier this month dr henderson and mr heumann were invited to talk about vetiver grass to members of the parkway partners civic group at a plant sale before their presentation new orleans homeowners snapped up pallets of the grass to plant around their houses "ive been a victim of termites twice " said mary lou main years old "i dont know if vetiver will stop them but i do hope it will retard their progress "
