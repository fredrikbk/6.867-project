me &amp my car columnist jonathan welsh answers readers questions about automobiles q shortly after purchasing my e amg mercedes i inflicted a slight curb scrape on the right front wheel while backing into a parking place there was no visible abrasion to the tire itself three thousand miles later i noticed a quarter sized tread separation bubble two or three inches from the scrape the dealer said this was a delayed reaction to the curb scrape and isnt covered under the tire warranty and cost &# to replace im wondering if other drivers have problems with these "delicate" wheels and tires on cars designed for high performance driving bob hurt washington a if striking the curb left no abrasion on the tire and even if it did i wouldnt expect the tires layers to begin separating as a result we often take tires for granted but they are generally tougher than they were years ago and should withstand a gentle bump against a curb your story brings up the main reason i dislike the combination of pricey alloy wheels and low profile tires for everyday street use it leaves both the tire and wheel vulnerable to damage when i was learning to parallel park years ago tires had higher sidewalls and nudging the curb rarely carried any consequence beyond embarrassment the tires always met the curb long before the metal rims came close hitting even a garden variety pothole at speed in a sports car with low profile tires and lightweight wheels can easily result in a bill of &# or more to replace the wheel and tire q we are looking at cars to replace a ford explorer coming off lease were checking out an acura suv gmc acadia ford explorer and toyota highlander gas mileage is a key decision factor one salesman told us an all wheel drive gets better gas mileage than a four wheel drive car which operates with only two wheels powered unless conditions warrant having all four wheels powered is this correct is sounds counterintuitive stanton t healy marlborough mass a while the efficiency of all wheel drive systems has increased over the years driving four wheels still consumes more energy than driving two modern all wheel drive systems are more sophisticated and generally more efficient than older part time systems that required the driver to shift manually into four wheel drive vehicles with part time four wheel drive but where the four wheel drive is often engaged may be less economical overall than similar all wheel drive vehicles but if the part time system is in two wheel drive most of the time it will use less fuel questions can be e mailed to mecar wsj com
