the daily fix anderson erases frustrating season with a monster of an august game online edition memo to the new york yankees seattle mariners and the rest of the american league dont count garret anderson out the anaheim angels outfielder struck two doubles and two home runs good for rbi as the angels pasted the yankees last night those rbi are an angel club record one short of the al mark set by the yanks tony lazzeri in and two shy of the major league mark shared by jim bottomley and mark whiten in the press enterprise matt hurst sums up how a frustrating year yielded a marvelous night "anderson entered the game with one home run in august and just four other extra base hits in each of his first two at bats he doubled giving him as many doubles as he had in his previous nine games when he connected for a three run third inning home run it was his first homer in at bats andersons rbi total tuesday matched his entire april output and was double what he compiled in an injury riddled june entering the game he had rbi in august games " in a sign of how sabermetrics are creeping further into baseball thinking many columnists and announcers have scratched their heads over the odd rise of the arizona diamondbacks carl addressed this in a numbers guy blog post the d backs have been outscored by their opponents which normally saddles you with a losing record yet arizona sits in first place atop the national league west and has shown no signs of regressing to the mean as normally happens with statistical anomalies on monday chris jaffe of the hardball times dug into the diamondbacks season looking for how theyve stood "sabermetic orthodoxy" on its head and he thinks he found the secret the fix doesnt want to give it away but heres a hint as of monday the d backs were in blowouts but in all other games "ok now thats not supposed to happen " mr jaffe writes "when you play like a win team in close games youre not supposed to morph into a loss team in the laughers better teams are supposed to be the most likely to blow others out and the hardest to get blown out and it defies logic to say a team thats won nearly two thirds of its close games arent that good lets think this through " another hint the secrets in the bullpen but not in the way you might think and for those whose eyes glaze over at all those numbers or who are grumbling about stats geeks dont miss this from mr jaffe "speaking as a sample size of one this is why i love this game just when you think you can figure it out with numbers the ball starts to bounce the other way right when you are so sure in yourself and your conclusions john mabry starts outperforming jeremy giambi " last week an suv collided with a freight train in suburban houston the drivers body was horribly burned and no identification was found forcing police to turn to dental records those records revealed the driver was eddie griffin the no pick in the nba draft mr griffin began his career with the houston rockets and battled alcohol problems throughout his short tumultuous career he was waived by the minnesota timberwolves in march on espn com j a adande struggles to draw lessons from mr griffins too short life was he an example of why going to the nba early can be a terrible idea or an example of how sports teams will overlook almost anything as long as an athlete has talent or both "the stream of incidents arrests and unsuccessful stints in rehabilitation centers allows us to list him as exhibit a in the argument that just because you can enter the nba that doesnt mean you should " mr adande writes adding that "its clear griffin never learned to be responsible or accountable during his one year at seton hall or the six seasons he spent in the nba maybe his problems were too serious for anyone in the league to deal with even if teams top priorities hadnt been making money and winning games regardless it was the wrong environment for someone so unstable youth and money and loads of unsupervised time were a toxic combination for him " on the other hand there were warning signs before mr griffin ever put on an nba uniform he had to complete high school from home after a fight with a teammate and then punched out a seton hall teammate in the locker room the rockets drafted him anyway as a rocket he pleaded guilty in an assault case but the new jersey nets and the t wolves gave him contracts anyway he was jailed for violating probation but the t wolves resigned him anyway "before his self destructive tendencies turned deadly they were expensive " mr adande writes "before he cost those who loved him the chance to see him again he cost teams money players and time but whos to blame for that theres a blinding arrogance teams get when they covet talent they think they can make it work for them when all the evidence suggests otherwise " columnists continue to struggle with the case of michael vick in the chicago tribune rick morrissey begins by telling us about his beloved old basset hound but then writes that "the convulsive reaction to the vick case has made it obvious weve lost our sense of proportion dogs are defenseless and we humans are quick to protect the defenseless it is one of our better qualities but a woman in the hands of a pound elite athlete is more or less defenseless too and i cant remember any case of domestic abuse sexual assault or murder involving an nfl player that sparked this kind of public outrage abuse your dog and people howl smack around your girlfriend or face charges of sexually assaulting a woman and people shake their heads and roll their eyes and theyll eventually cheer you again if you dont believe that pay attention the next time kobe bryant rolls through town " mr morrisseys point isnt that were making too much of the charges against mr vick rather its that we make too little of the charges against athletes who assault women in the washington post sally jenkins argues that both are points on the same spectrum of inhumanity "there is an unnerving ruthlessness to the bloodsport of dogfighting and to killing something because it isnt good enough " she writes adding "the truth is that athletic prowess can breed a kind of coldness we hold star athletes to be more valuable than other people and we literally pay them as if they are worth more than others if an animal didnt perform well enough if it wasnt champion enough if it was in vicks judgment flawed he strangled it drowned it electrocuted it or beat it to death on the ground vick and his pals deliberately enslaved and tormented weaker creatures and killed those they considered inferior the dogs had faces and voices that would have eloquently expressed their agony and vick hurt them anyway repeatedly the crimes may have been committed against canines but at issue is basic humanity " oh and ms jenkins opening nails mr vick thoroughly and efficiently "michael vick and his alter ego ron mexico those suave fakers are going away it looks like vick will do at least to months in a federal penitentiary for his crimes after which the admittedly faint hope is that he might emerge a more whole and gentle person as opposed to a dog slayer and liar " tip of the fix cap to reader john falck and to the journals bryan gruley found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at
