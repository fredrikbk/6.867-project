business world payback bailout has been a busy word in the last two weeks but lending so solvent institutions wont go under for lack of short term liquidity is very different than bailing out insolvent institutions from their bad decisions in any case weve made peace with a financial system that lives a little closer to the edge on liquidity than it would if there werent a federal reserve whether the alternative would be a more stable world with as much growth is uncertain but theres no doubt that the system has been conditioned to expect a general subsidy to risktaking by way of the feds willingness to provide cheap money in an emergency everybody talks about moral hazard a wisp of memory came to mind last week then fannie mae chief franklin raines visited the journal years ago and entertained himself by mocking editorial writers who assume that establishing that a policy is economically inefficient is enough to establish that its unwise he yukked it up quite a bit in fact noting that voters are perfectly entitled to assert values other than those of the market namely that homeownership is a social blessing and should be encouraged with subsidies and so weve done with tax subsidies lending subsidies and a concerted set of policies by bill clintons hud to move low income people out of rental units and into homes they own his goal which was achieved was to lift the homeownership rate from to of households but a home financed by a mortgage is not just an asset its also a liability we owe thanks to carolina katz reid then a graduate student at university of washington for a study of what she dubbed the "low income homeownership boom " she considered a simple question "whether or not low income households benefit from owning a home " her discoveries are bracing of low income households from a nationally representative sample who became homeowners between and fully returned to renting in two years and in five years suggesting their sojourn among the homeowning was not a happy one few returned to homeownership in later years even among those who held on to their homes for years the average price appreciation gain was less than if their money had been invested in treasury bills this meager capital gain was about half that enjoyed by middle income homeowners a typical low income household might spend half the family income on mortgage costs leaving less money for a rainy day or investing in education their less marketable homes apparently also tended to tie them down making them less likely to relocate for a job ms reids counterintuitive discovery was that higher income households were "twice as likely to move long distance if theyre unemployed " almost needless to add the great squarer of circles for middle income homeowners the mortgage interest deduction wont turn a house into a paying proposition for those with little income to shelter bottom line homeownership likely has had an exceedingly poor payoff for millions of low income purchasers perhaps even blighting the prospects of what might otherwise be upwardly mobile families and yet subprime lending wouldnt be a business without a flow of customers and politicians and a vast array of interest groups flog the notion that owning a home is the american dream for anyone who can squeeze sideways through the door now this curse is being repaid with interest and by an inherently unpredictable route dont buy any "news analysis" that says that because subprime lenders were known to be making risky or fraudulent loans last weeks credit meltdown in unrelated markets from here to tokyo should have been foreseen yes you can find a hedge fund manager somewhere who bet on a credit crunch just as you can find some who did the opposite for every buyer theres a seller and selective evidence always supports the hindsight fallacy thats more comfortable than acknowledging that big unpredictable effects sometimes result from small causes the irony is were the owners of the subprime paper inclined to make themselves known and realize their losses the majority of these loans would likely end up paying off buyers of the severely discounted paper would make a killing and the markets dispersed decision making which recently became its weakness would return to its normal role as a strength in any case subprime lending accounts only for about of outstanding mortgages with an uncataclysmic &# billion worth facing foreclosure fluctuations in the s&amp p wipe out as much wealth every ho hum day without drying up credit globally but todays caginess problem is partly a regulatory and legal problem because something is clearly stopping holders of temporarily unmarketable mortgage paper from sidling up to their bankers and asking forbearance on the loans financing these positions the feds announcement of an accommodating discount window last friday was an invitation to banks to help their clients dig out of these problems but the fed cant make them do so if prosecutors and class action lawyers now decide to launch an undiscriminating war on the mortgage finance industry look out below for the sake of people trying to climb into the middle class lets hope that one lesson will be a rethinking of policies designed to saddle them with money pits the democratic presidential contenders are currently outbidding each other in ways to help "homeowners" a dubious term in the present instance avoid foreclosure what might really benefit these citizens is being freed to return to renting where some real bargains will likely be had in the months and years
