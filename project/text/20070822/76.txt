idle time to the casual observer the just concluded north american leaders summit in quebec focused mostly on u s immigration problems canadas claims to arctic waters and the early departure of mexicos president to deal with a rampaging hurricane dean these are headline worthy topics but not quite the heart of the discussions that should dominate a meeting of the leaders of the security and prosperity partnership of north america u s president george w bush canadian prime minister stephen harper and mexican president felipe calderon speaking for u s and canadian manufacturers we ask our leaders to remember the issue that must remain central to our relations how borders serve not just national security but also prosperity through wealth creating trade and commerce north americas manufacturers lead the world in technology innovation and productivity unfortunately we are seeing these competitive advantages being lost due to ever increasing regulations and inefficient border processing requirements efficient borders are especially important given the highly integrated north american industrial base particularly between canada and the united states on an average day more than commercial trucks enter the united states from canada back to back these trucks would stretch from detroit to chicago these trucks bring consumer products and manufactured goods parts for u s auto plants agricultural products for food processors and newsprint for newspapers like this one manufacturers have developed highly integrated production systems across the border contributing to the million dollars of business our countries do every minute of every day that trade is getting bogged down with the additional security measures implemented since the terrorist attacks vehicle processing times have doubled at the border resulting in an additional &# billion in costs to business regulations adopted for various reasonable purposes add further burdens these non production costs not only come from trucks idling at the border but also from more time processing paperwork and entering data a lack of consistent standards at different border crossings and increased border inspections manufacturers whose profits depend on just in time production find it increasingly difficult to manage these delays and remain globally competitive all three north american countries have acknowledged the problems in the united states canada and mexico created the security and prosperity partnership of north america to improve efficiency at the borders and boost our economies governments promised to undertake initiatives including creation of the north american competitiveness council in february the council identified practical actions to be taken as soon as this year building on this weeks summit now is the time to turn these recommendations into reality putting these actions into effect and showing that the spp is about concrete results and not just rhetoric one area where political will could make a significant difference is on pre clearance before goods reach the border moving customs farther inland from the actual border crossings could considerably reduce border congestion especially since many of our key border crossings are over water and have limited space for added infrastructure yet earlier this year negotiations between the u s and canada over pre clearance broke down another area of mutual interest is load limits for trucks states provinces and in some cases counties set their own standards for regulating the weights and dimensions of heavy trucks cargo crossing different jurisdictions travels with slower trucks and lighter loads leading to more border congestion increased road traffic and air pollution as our manufacturers work more closely together and cross border trucking increases the costs associated with different vehicle sizes and weight regulations are becoming more significant addressing these problems need not come at the expense of security we believe that greater cooperation among the three governments can produce solutions that both increase security and efficiency but this will only happen if our government officials take an integrated approach to the border and recognize the vital role that north american commerce plays in keeping our three economies strong and globally competitive we firmly support the goals of the security and prosperity partnership initiative and want to see it succeed for north americas manufacturers and the millions of people we employ however success means progress not only on security concerns but also on improving efficiency at our borders and reducing the regulatory burdens that hamper our ability to remain the worlds most productive and innovative industrial region mr engler is a director of dow jones which publishes this newspaper and is president and ceo of the national association of manufacturers mr myers is president of canadian manufacturers &amp exporters
