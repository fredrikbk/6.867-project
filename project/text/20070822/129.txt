the market whisperer in peter fisher served as the federal reserve bank of new yorks point man in organizing the private sector rescue of long term capital management enlisting the big wall street firms in "joining hands under the feds protective banner" to help unwind the hedge funds positions mr fishers role in calming markets was the highlight of his years at the new york fed where he rose to the top post on the desk that deals with the markets that tenure was followed by a stint as undersecretary of the u s treasury for domestic finance in the early years of the bush administration despite his democratic leanings he is now a managing director at blackrock inc the global investment management and advisory firm with &# trillion in assets under management and owned by merrill lynch &amp co in an interview monday with the wall street journal mr fisher gave his interpretation of the current credit market shakeout and what he expects the fed to do next wsj what do you think explains the timing of this seizing up in the credit market mr fisher in june the markets finally woke up to the idea that the fed wouldnt be easing any time soon which is what chairman ben bernanke had been saying for some time back in january the expected path of monetary policy was thought to be extremely benign market participants were convinced that a fed easing was right around the corner by the time we got to june background monetary conditions in europe were much firmer and at the same time the market finally had to confront the fact that bernanke meant what he said this started the process wsj and because there was so much easy money there was so much borrowing in retrospect were interest rates too low for too long mr fisher it is hard to escape that conclusion did we create too much leverage was our credit capacity based on false assumptions about how low monetary conditions could be i think so we have the benefit of hindsight now but rates were too low for too long and now we are going to squeeze out the excessive levels of leverage that built up wsj for so long we have been hearing that the banks dont matter much and the capital markets are all that matters yet suddenly we are discovering how much the banks do matter mr fisher a great deal of activity has shifted to the capital markets but banks still matter banks both commercial and investment banks play a pivotal role as asset originators for the capital markets underwriting both consumer and business credit before it gets distributed to investors in the capital markets with the rapid changes in prices and rise in volatility the capital markets are less willing to buy these assets and they are piling up on the banks balance sheets to restart the process we need the banks to provide the grease the fed move friday was to signal that it is still about the banks and their willingness to finance wsj will the fed take further action mr fisher i think they would rather not but im in the minority market participants are pricing in the virtual certainty of multiple fed eases over the rest of the year and some even think the fed could cut the fed funds rate before their next regularly scheduled meeting on sept i thought of their action on the discount rate last friday as a bridge to sept and i think the likelihood that the fed eases further is more like a chance not the probability being priced in for the fed to ease further the open market committee will have to reach one or both of two conclusions first they would need to believe that credit conditions have tightened sufficiently for all households and businesses so that the economy is receiving tighter overall financial conditions than they intend and that this will persist for some time second they would need to see a convincing internal fed forecast of an unemployment rate backing up toward in the next few quarters wsj what similarities or differences do you see to previous market crises mr fisher big market events that pose systemic risks tend to reflect collective mistakes in which most market participants are offside in the same direction in the summer of there was a collective misunderstanding about credit risk everyone underestimated sovereign risk and lived in the fantasyland were sovereigns did not default remember "russia wont default they have missiles " it turned out not be about missiles but about cash flows it turned out that credit mattered and then we had to revalue a lot of sovereign paper that was being used as collateral wsj so in there were problems with collateral and this time there are even more problems with collateral right mr fisher yes indeed until the week before last nobody seemed to be focused on the uncertainty surrounding the value of mortgage related and structured finance paper and then suddenly everyone did the late mit professor rudi dornbusch sagely observed that in financial markets things always take longer to happen than you expect but once they happen events unfold much more quickly than you expect and this perfectly describes the events of mid august wsj the conventional wisdom was that globalization would lead to a dispersion of risk and yet the market seems so spooked with announcements of problems from australia to germany as well as in the u s how do you see the costs and benefits of globalization in the financial markets mr fisher the benefit of course is risk diversification and dispersion but this comes with an offsetting cost this is the cost of proxy or imperfect hedging where market participants sell what they can rather than what they wish which leads to higher linkages and less benefit of dispersion in after russias default there was selling pressure in mexican bonds not because the market thought a mexican default was likely but because the mexican bonds were liquid wsj what else feels different this time mr fisher in september of there were a lot fewer people who thought they saw a buying opportunity famously in the case of ltcm only warren buffett and hank greenberg it took until october and november of that year for more people to see a buying opportunity and for the markets to find a bottom
