credit crunch moves beyond mortgages individuals see higher rates harsher terms on credit cards and other consumer loans its not just mortgages as it gets tougher to land a home loan some people are also finding it harder and more expensive to get other types of consumer credit some lenders such as usaa are nudging up credit score requirements across their auto loans credit cards and personal loans bank of america corp and capital one financial corp recently raised fees and interest rates for some of their credit card customers and this month citigroup inc s citifinancial auto started charging higher auto loan rates for borrowers with less than perfect credit all this comes as lenders continue to tighten guidelines on mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit as investors back away from subprime loans and other perceived credit risks for the most part lenders say the changes arent directly tied to the mortgage mess but reflect concerns about an economic slowdown and uncertainty about interest rates still some lenders are becoming more cautious about extending credit in weaker housing markets and to people who may have exposure to certain riskier mortgages "in the past few months weve been tightening up our credit underwriting standards and raising our score cutoffs slightly " says barbara johnson vice president of usaa federal savings bank referring to the banks credit cards auto loans and personal loans the bank has also scaled back credit line increases in its credit card business "we used to offer frequent automated line increases and now weve pulled back on that a little bit " she says a spokesman for j p morgan chase &amp co s chase says the company has been tightening up credit guidelines across some consumer products such as home equity and auto loans mainly among customers with weak credit who live in markets that have been hurt by a decline in home prices lenders arent tightening credit standards nationwide thats why the average interest rates on many types of consumer loans havent changed much since the beginning of the year rates on variable rate credit cards five year new car loans and personal loans are averaging and respectively roughly the same as they were in january according to bankrate com card issuers can afford to be more selective about whom they extend credit to and by how much because more consumers increasingly locked out of home equity loans and lines of credit are using their credit cards more this month for example the federal reserve said consumer credit rose at an annual rate of in june to a record &# trillion the second straight sizable gain the increase was led by an rate of increase for revolving credit the category that includes credit card debt doug eddings a year old small business owner in portland ore says three of his credit card issuers all took steps in recent weeks to tighten his credit either by raising his interest rate halving his available credit or freezing his accounts first he received a notice from chase in june notifying him that it was going to raise the interest rate on his chase amazon card to from soon after another lender hsbc holdings plcs hsbc north america dropped his &# credit line on his best buy store card to &# just &# above his current balance "when i called them up they didnt have an answer for me but said it was something in my credit file " says mr eddings who had recently used the card to buy a refrigerator for his new home he also got hit with a "financial review" this month from american express co which froze his accounts until he could send in additional tax forms from the irs for them to look at although mr eddings who has a high credit score says he hasnt been late on any payments he recently requested a credit line increase on his delta skymiles card which american express raised to &# from &# in addition he took out an interest only mortgage this past spring through a local broker to buy a new home his mortgage was originally offered through american home mortgage investment corp which filed for bankruptcy court protection earlier this month and was then sold to countrywide financial corp "i dont know if it has anything to do with the mortgage industry but it does seem coincidental " mr eddings says economists are increasingly worried that the credit crunch in the mortgage market could spread further into other types of consumer loans the federal reserves quarterly survey of senior loan officers released last week showed a small increase in the number of banks that have tightened credit standards for consumer loans excluding credit cards over the past three months this weeks drop in short term treasury bill yields is yet another symptom of the turmoil thats roiling the credit markets since it signals that investors are fleeing to the safest assets available "if this turns out to be a blip on the radar one to two weeks even a month then it will probably only have a modest impact" on lenders credit standards says stephen stanley chief economist at rbs greenwich capital in greenwich conn "but if we see these sorts of conditions continue for months and months then it probably will start to have an impact on the way that lenders see risk in the consumer credit arena " industry consultants say there are signs that card issuers are already becoming more cautious average credit card approval rates across the industry have dropped by five percentage points to over the past year while credit lines for subprime borrowers have fallen to an average of &# from &# a year ago according to robert hammer chief executive of r k hammer a bank card advisory firm issuers have also cut back on direct mail offers to new customers in the second quarter such offers were down from the first quarter continuing a decline that began at the end of last year according to mintel international group ltd s mintel comperemedia unit a direct mail market research firm meanwhile credit card and consumer news web sites such as cardratings com credit com and consumeraffairs com say they are getting more complaints from consumers who have seen their credit lines fall or interest rates jump nationally credit card delinquencies are relatively low at and havent risen significantly in the past three years however in certain markets especially those that have been hit hard by a decline in home values delinquencies have spiked higher in fort myers fla port st lucie fla and stockton calif for example delinquencies have jumped about two percentage points in the past year to as high as according to an analysis by equifax inc and moodys economy com "if lenders see a household start to go late on payments theyre going to be much quicker to respond " says mark zandi chief economist at economy com "they may reduce the size of the credit line or may raise the interest rate theyre responding much more quickly to any signs of stress " patti powell a year old child care provider got a notice from barclays plcs juniper bank last month telling her that her account which she had for several years was being closed the lovington n m resident says she wasnt late on any payments and mailed in more than the minimum payments each month but in recent months she started to use the card more and her total balance had climbed to about of her available &# credit line from about previously in a separate move last year american express dropped the credit lines on two of her cards she adds for their part lenders say they are monitoring the credit environment carefully a citigroup spokesman says the bank is "constantly adjusting our underwriting standards to best reflect market conditions updates to our risk models and a variety of other factors " while a bank of america spokeswoman says it hasnt seen "significant issues or had to significantly change our underwriting standards" in the current environment chase meanwhile is "thinking hard about the loan qualifications for people " says spokesman tom kelly who adds that "most consumers can still get credit at a fair rate " for consumers its a good idea to look out for any change in terms and conditions from the issuers although issuers can change rates and fees at any time many will allow customers to opt out of those changes and pay off any balances under existing terms although they will typically have to close their accounts in recent months capital one for example changed many of its fixed interest rates to higher variable rates while bank of america implemented a new monthly minimum finance charge of &# on former mbna credit card customers this past spring to bring charges in line with its existing customers fees meanwhile discover financial services recently raised the higher end of its interest rate range to from and began charging higher minimum payments for certain customers who used over of the available credit on balance transfer offers another victim of the trend toward tightening credit once generous introductory credit card offers "weve seen the length of the introductory periods diminish on certain offers and more lenders offering introductory rates ranging from and instead of financing offers " says curtis arnold founder of cardratings com tighter credit some lenders are raising fees and tightening credit on credit cards and auto loans lenders are likely to make it harder for borrowers with weaker credit in markets hit by a housing downturn watch your credit card mailings for any changes in terms and conditions you may be able to opt out of
