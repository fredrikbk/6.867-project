the tax man takes enough of our money no need to exaggerate in regard to todd j zywickis recent op ed "the two income tax trap " aug mr zywickis hypothetical s family should sharpen their pencil or get some help preparing their tax return on &# of income hes got them paying a whopping &# of income tax and hillary isnt even president yet assuming they take the standard deduction and do not qualify for a credit for dependent care or the child tax credit their federal income tax would be &# count social security tax &# as an income tax and add an estimated &# of state income taxes you get &# as "income" taxes thats about a lot of money but a smaller percentage than mr zywicki calculates his s family would pay john s paroske c p a denver colo mr zywicki says the authors of the book "the two income trap" should have identified the principal culprit as "the dramatically higher tax burden caused by the progressive nature of the american tax system " while it is true that taxes have risen as a share of the average households income the culprits are dramatically higher social security and medicare taxes plus dramatically higher state and local taxes which collectively are not progressive the only significant progressive tax has been and remains the federal income tax which according to the congressional budget office claimed half as much of the median familys income in than it did in the mid s over and claimed a tiny in to be accurate mr zywicki should have said that if the average household with children really wants a tax break it should insist that all taxes be progressive john o fox visiting associate professor mount holyoke college amherst mass mr zywickis analysis of relative tax burdens makes a leaping conclusion that his numbers do not support during the year period that he considers the federal income tax burden on the middle income families that he examines has actually decreased total taxes have gone up to be sure but that increase is due almost entirely to major increases in state and local income taxes property taxes sales taxes social securitys payroll tax and excise taxes on gasoline and telephone service these levies are already the type of "flat" taxes that mr zywicki seems to favor thus the results he cites unfairly lays the blame for the rising tax burden of two income families on the progressive income tax richard kaplan professor of law university of illinois champaign ill for a married couple filing jointly to have the government take " of the familys money " as mr zywicki states would under current tax law require them to have a taxable income of something in excess of &# million a year even to have a marginal tax rate of would require a total taxable family income in excess of &# these numbers are wildly different from those shown in the authors column ralph bristol gilmanton iron works n h politicians have an insatiable appetite for spending and the only way to fund their addiction is by raising our taxes this movement to raise taxes occurs at the federal the state and the local level to justify raising taxes politicians have put forward the canard that americans dont pay their "fair share" of taxes shame on us for letting them malign us double shame for letting them tax us so heavily the problem isnt low taxes it is excessive spending steve fleischer monument colo i have trouble believing what mr zywicki is saying that the average american family pays of its income in taxes a more believable figure would be perhaps less my godson supports his wife and four children on an income above the figure cited in the article and after deductions for mortgage interest taxes and the like as well as the child tax credit pays no federal income tax he does however pay of the premium for his familys health insurance at a total cost in excess of &# annually i dont think taxes are what hes most worried about mary t slayter west dennis mass mr zywickis op ed resounded with me personally and professionally twenty five years ago just after publication of a comprehensive study of income tax reform that id written for the congressional budget office i took what i thought would be a brief hiatus from policy analysis to care for our first child because i had spent so much time thinking about the incentives and unintended consequences of income tax provisions and had even co authored a paper on the marriage tax penalty i was well aware that if i continued working my first dollar of pay would be taxed at the marginal tax rate of my husbands last dollar of pay since then i have devoted myself to raising a family and working as a community volunteer but i have continued to follow the tax debate sadly the issues that i wrote about so long ago reforming the income tax to make it simpler fairer and more efficient are the same ones on the table today but in the past years the tax code has become far more complex as congress has continued to add tax credits to encourage various activities and target tax relief and instead of curbing preferential deductions like that for mortgage interest congress has vastly expanded the subsidy for homeownership by exempting from tax most of the gains on home sales if congress decides to try to narrow the budget deficit by raising marginal tax rates that would magnify the distortions of all tax deductions and worsen the marriage tax penalty even as much attention has been focused on reining in earmarks on the spending side it may be time to take yet another look at revamping the income tax cynthia francis gensheimer mission hills kan im surprised mr zywicki did not mention the simple solution to the "two income tax trap " which many couples both young and old have discovered dont get married donald j libert lancaster
