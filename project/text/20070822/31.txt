common sense stocks swings create opportunity to stock up smartmoney last wednesday when the nasdaq closed at just eight points above my buying target of i got out my shopping list there was plenty on it since its been quite some time since i had a buy signal and went shopping a year ago in june to be exact in putting together my shopping list i followed advice ive given before which is to choose a mix of stocks from companies ive always wanted to own but seemed too expensive as well as those that have recently faced panic selling this time i focused on energy and materials cyclicals and diversified financials while i didnt know how the federal reserve would react to the latest turmoil the odds seemed to be tilting towards a rate cut that makes it even more important to have inflation hedges in your portfolio since inflation remains a worrisome possibility raw materials fit the bill especially since stocks of the big producers got slammed last week on recession fears but global demand is still strong and the supply finite much the same rationale applies to energy stocks cyclicals like deere and caterpillar the subjects of my column on march got punished in the selloff presumably on recession fears deere which falls into the category of stocks that once seemed expensive reported fantastic earnings last week to no avail deere is benefiting from both the global construction boom and the ethanol driven agricultural renaissance what could be better nor could i ignore the widespread panic in the financial sector already making up the worst performing sector this year financials were being dumped across the board even the most diversified best capitalized companies many of them showed up on my screen for low price to growth ratios these werent the only candidates i examined ive wanted to own some of the exchanges especially the newly merged chicago mercantile exchange but at &# last week it hadnt sold off much and still looked expensive to me i also looked at some emerging market mutual funds and etfs but decided to wait early thursday i heard on the radio that foreign markets were selling off by the time i got to the office trading had begun in new york and the nasdaq was down well below my buying target of i suppose there are circumstances in which id ignore my own system but im hard pressed to imagine such a scenario a major goal of my system is to take emotion out of the decision to buy and sell fear of the unknown is an emotion not a reason to stop investing and so i launched my buying campaign i bought commodity producers companhia vale do rio doce and rio tinto both of which had the added advantage of being foreign boosting my allocation toward non u s assets in energy i added to my position in valero among cyclicals i bought deere caterpillar and cummins in the financial sector i was tempted by goldman sachs and morgan stanley but settled for more diversified main line banks wells fargo and bank of america later at lunch i noticed stocks had fallen further if only id waited there were even more bargains to be had but then i got a grip reminding myself that no one has perfect timing the important thing is that i was able to buy at a big discount to where the market was just days ago when the market averages again hit new highs which they will someday my gains will be all the more impressive james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
