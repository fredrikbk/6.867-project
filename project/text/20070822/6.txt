architects and designers build a shantytown on fifth avenue design for the other cooper hewitt national design museum through sept new york the current cooper hewitt exhibition "design for the other " curated by cynthia e smith is a challenge to the idea that designers and architects are necessarily relegated to the sidelines when it comes to big issues facing the world the show suggests that while it may be very nice to build huge office and residential towers in new york with photovoltaic panels or waterless urinals there are more dire issues that the professional expertise of architects and designers might be employed to address incongruously installed though in the museums manicured garden facing fifth avenue and the bucolic fantasy of central park are design solutions "for more than five billion people across the globe" that is to say refugees the homeless the poor all of whom are struggling with basic survival so as small children play on the grass and adults sip wine and coffee while seated on pretty garden furniture visitors move among the displays at the gardens western edge "slow drip" irrigation runs across a small patch of earth through thin green plastic tubing a variation on a more expensive method this drip system uses less pressure through thinner pipes and is moveable a bicycle leaning against a fence has been redesigned to carry a heavier load more effectively a ceramic water filter draws upon the inherent filtration potential of ceramics combined with an antibacterial agent cooking is made possible by solar energy a bamboo treadle pump operated by motion provides access to ground water these useful objects and mechanisms do tap the expertise of designers but they lack the marriage of ingenuity to aesthetic principles that the cooper hewitt typically would be advocating for a museum devoted to design "useful" is only halfway there more dispiriting are the architectural contributions in the garden here instead of structures that do not merely keep out the rain but incorporate the inherent human need for aesthetics and for dignity one finds a shantytown of temporary structures the plywood on cinderblocks "mad housers hut " feet high feet wide and feet deep with an improbably shallow "loft" for sleeping and the potential for one window of plastic or screen not included was created by architecture students at georgia tech for the homeless in the prosperous american city of atlanta it looks like something you wouldnt want your dog to live in and has no facilities except for a steel drum stove that seems unsafe asked what the homeless people given these rudimentary huts in atlanta would be doing about sanitary facilities one of the sponsors replied "whatever they were doing before " nearby you have to duck your head to get into "the global village shelter " which is made of biodegradable triple wall laminated corrugated cardboard that is shipped flat and "requires no tools to assemble " created by ferrara design along with architecture for humanity the shelter was uncomfortably warm inside even on a cool spring day and is seen in triplicate in the garden for unknown reasons compared to this a device that won an award in the museums design triennial chuck hobermans rapidly deployable square foot tent that can be set up by four people in three minutes and is seen in a continuously running video inside the museum seems preferable in that it is quick effective and doesnt pretend to be anything other than temporary even better is an exuberant intervention that also is not installed in the garden but is included in the page exhibition catalog with a foreword by barbara bloemink it is the "inclusive edge canopy" created by the london architectural association in cooperation with the universidad federal de recife made of lycra and spandex in what looks like a luscious shade of yellow it is punctuated with brass eyelets and steel cables so that it can be stretched across a road and anchored in trees or roofs or poles or existing shop fronts to create a large area of shade and mark a gathering place by its festive and welcoming presence it thereby meets for residents of a brazil favela or a squatter settlement the same need for aesthetics as everyone everywhere else it is consistent with the cooper hewitts mission and in fact the museum has been ahead of the curve in a small elegant work of architecture sat alone at that same western edge of the museums summer garden it seemed apt for the setting and for the museum long and slender in beautiful colors it was raised off the ground had a ramp that dropped down for entry and an adjustable parasol roof that created an indoor outdoor effect and spread shade along its edges this temporary shelter for refugees and victims of natural disasters was carefully considered and developed by an architect doing what architects do best it was named "future shack " and it was unmistakably a residence conceived by australian sean godsell it was made from a discarded stackable portable shipping container measuring eight feet high eight feet wide and feet long and used solar energy had adjustable built in furniture and even provided sanitary facilities created from leftover plumbing parts it also would have arrived packed with all of the necessities and even food and blankets and would have been put in place in hours more good news although it cost more than the examples that are now displayed in the garden it was significantly reusable after the worst was over months years later future shack could be dismantled packed flat again and moved on to the next disaster mr godsell said about this work "the need to house others gives architecture the opportunity to provide shelter for other human beings " a tonic declaration for a profession in search of a mission an emphasis on architecture seems likely to continue at the cooper hewitt too as of this summer cara mccarty will be curatorial director and matilda mcquaid will be deputy curatorial director both are veterans of the department of architecture and design at the museum of modern art the architect richard gluckman has been selected to renovate the turn of the last century building including the creation of contemporary exhibition space consistent with the museums design vision which is not parochial last year for example the jurors for the museums national design awards gave a special award to the conceptual designer syd mead who with douglas trumbull created the imagined st century urban landscape of ridley scotts movie "blade runner " mr mead described his strategy as "making a frontal assault on every sensibility that architects are trained to respect" and using "squashed italian lotus columns" and elements he called "crypto egypto " "retro deco" and "el segundo run amok" while positioning "a billion fiber optic lights across a map of los angeles " this approach helped to push the movies title into the english language as a way of describing a fundamental urban condition hinted at yet to come and since the urban condition of the future is still a subject of vigorous debate it is reassuring to know that some of these discussions will continue to take place at an institution at once substantial and adventurous ms posner an essayist and critic in new york is a former architecture critic for the journal
