finding the right remedy for our congested skies what is taking place in the crowded airspace over new york "small jets more trips worsen airport delays " aug is just a precursor of things to come in many other parts of the u s and abroad what we face is a condition that in the long run benefits neither the producer nor consumer until we put in place an incentive based solution for airlines to fly larger aircraft we will have our "crowding in" problem throughout our air transportation system much like overfishing crowding in occurs when there is no direct owner of a given resource the air transportation infrastructure in this case it is one of the ugly anomalies of a free market system airlines will continue to add flights that run counter to the benefit of society and lead to aviation gridlock frank ketcham pilot northwest airlines sausalito calif an auction based market in landing take off slots would resolve the congestion problem without the need for more regulation as the price went up commercial airlines would fly optimally sized planes and users of executive aircraft would find cheaper alternatives airport landing fees would be set based on their economic value rather than historical cost increasing landing slot value would fund airport expansion daniel g sadler mercer island wash has anybody thought to implement in the airways and airport the equivalent of high occupancy vehicle lanes on highways in metropolitan areas aircraft the size of s and larger would be assigned hov flight lanes while the small jets would be assigned to the slow lanes after waiting longer both in the air and on tarmacs passengers who now want more flights with smaller aircraft would likely change their preferences paul r hartmann phoenixville pa your article missed one solution to the problem efficient high speed rail service one spends hours traveling to an airport arriving well before flight time dealing with check in and security lines etc for a minute flight between say pittsburgh and new york city or between portland and seattle one could get there in less total time and far greater comfort by train unfortunately we have focused solely on air for long distance travel in this country whereas other countries wisely use high speed rail as an efficient and effective method of moving people relatively short distances mark e marchetti ashland ore
