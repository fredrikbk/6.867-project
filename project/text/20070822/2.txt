a new dell dude looks to rebuild an ailing brand questions for mark jarvis company dell inc title chief marketing officer mark jarvis is refereeing one of the biggest grudge matches to hit madison avenue this year as the first ever chief marketing officer for personal computer giant dell inc mr jarvis is seeking to consolidate the companys massive advertising account which is now spread across hundreds of ad agencies the prize is a particularly lucrative one dell spent &# million on u s ad time and space in according to tns media intelligence the former marketing chief for oracle corp who has a penchant for wearing black mr jarvis has been given the task of rebranding a company that a few years ago was the global leader in pcs but which has watched as its direct selling business model is ailing consumers increasingly want to buy their computers in retail stores rather than via the internet or telephone the shift has helped to lower dells sales and profits and in part led to the recent resignation of its chief executive now the round rock texas company back under the leadership of founder michael dell is looking to reboot mr jarvis talks below about how he proposes to put the dell brand back on top and what he is looking for in his search for an ad agency the wall street journal are you holding meetings with advertising holding companies why mr jarvis yes we are probably the only fortune company with a contractual relationship with just about every agency in the world we work with agencies today around the world our goal is to end up with a smaller number of agencies capable of running the dell business we will finish the process by november and be up and running by february to do that we may split creative and execution wsj dell currently is using mother an independent ad shop in new york why would a big brand like dell hire a small agency like mother to do its ads mr jarvis we work with mother because mother is incredibly creative we like the people there and think they were a great cultural fit with dell wsj does size matter when working with an agency mr jarvis size doesnt matter but global execution does we need a global execution capability size is not nearly as important as creative skill but there needs to be some global capacity that is why we may split up creative and execution wsj being the company thats most known for being direct do you plan to spend the majority of your ad dollars online mr jarvis youd be surprised how little we spend online our marketing budget is huge but it goes mostly to catalogs and direct mail which is not scalable we print and send about million catalogs a month that is not an efficient and scalable way to advertise you are going to see us invest more in brand advertising you are going to see us invest more in online and specifically more in dell com dell com needs to become more of a community for users we will build out dell com and create a different feel to the online experience we will also have a dell conference wsj are you considering any nontraditional forms of advertising mr jarvis i am big into the whole viral thing you are going to see us do a lot of viral activities and spray it on the wall and see what sticks dell customers are vehemently loyal there is a "dell for life" concept so we are going to build a loyalty program there will be viral aspects to that loyalty program wsj prior to your arrival at dell dell didnt have a top marketing officer what changes do you think need to happen to create a marketing culture mr jarvis the big challenge was that there actually was no culture or discipline of marketing at dell at all marketing at dell until i walked in was a consequence of the sales process quite honestly the entire marketing function was focused on closing the transaction they know how to get people to go to a web site and how to get people to call up dell and get people to buy however what is lacking at dell is there is no air cover over the top that actually explains what dell does and creates an emotional link between dell and the customer wsj is that in round rock mr jarvis its global obviously there are a lot of people in round rock but what we have done is we have taken people around the world and they are part of the global team but yes from the context of the guy who runs european marketing now reports to me the guy who runs asia pacific marketing reports to me conversely underneath that the guy who runs french marketing reports to the head of european marketing that was a totally alien concept to dell every country had its own finance hr and marketing sales and they basically built a mini dell within every country and there was no coordination between countries so you would get situations where the dell logo in one country is different than the dell logo in another the tag lines were different in every country the advertising was different for the same product and another fascinating thing was even the messages for what the product does were different in each country simply because there was no global oversight and there was no process to make sure we were consistent that is my job wsj what do you see as the biggest challenges facing dell right now mr jarvis quite honestly the biggest challenge facing dell is changing the culture of the company its a cultural challenge that is going from being a &# billion disorganized structure to having very clear roles and responsibilities and organizational excellence spending on the right things not spending on the right things and focusing on the customer experience marketing things should be done by marketing sales things should be done by sales product things should be made by the product division and really clarify who does what because quite honestly its sort of organized chaos right now wsj what about hewlett packard mr jarvis yes and no in that what chief executive mark hurd has basically done is what he did at ncr so he has basically reproduced a template so far and kudos to the guy he has done a good job of getting them to that point however i think h p has no shortage of problems and challenges going forwards and i would certainly not think of them as being high and dry we are certainly going to challenge them and there are things where we have let h p get a run on us which we need to tow back in i think that ultimately h p is trying to go through a massive transition themselves into services and software and its going to be an interesting challenge wsj branding experts have said that selling direct basically defined the dell brand and now that you are selling in retail the dell brand needs to come up with a new message how would you respond to that mr jarvis the answer is yes i would agree but there are several things we need to go and do some people have questioned whether the direct model has a great future and actually i think it has an incredible future for a very simple reason so far the direct model has allowed us to customize very effectively inside the box you can choose which processor you want how much memory you want how much disk you want and so on we are going to apply the direct model to customizing whats outside the box so you are going to be able to pick the design of the outside of your system which h p cant do ironically even apple apple has moved away from that there used to be a time when you could get six different colors of apples we can use our direct model and our manufacturing on demand in order to give the people a unique and individual computer and we can do that in retail as much as we can do that directly now on to the brand question we are going to go through a brand revolution quite honestly i think if you ask people what the dell brand stands for today you would get different answers so we need to explain what dell does from the enterprise to the ceo and the chief information officer right down to the consumer and we are going to do it through building specific brands for particular areas of our business and linking them all to the master dell brand so there will be a flavor of dell in retail there will be a flavor of dell consumers there will be a flavor of dell for small and medium businesses all will link to the dell master brand its not rocket science funnily enough we are all over the map the reason why people dont understand who dell is is because on any given day we produce five or six different pieces of marketing material all of which look entirely different you wouldnt think it came from the same company
