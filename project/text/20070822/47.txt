cutting edge to heal diabetes doctors doctors who have turned surgery into a popular treatment for obesity are setting their sights on a burgeoning new market diabetes patients a growing amount of research suggests that bariatric surgery which shrinks the stomach and sometimes reroutes the intestines has a lasting effect on the most common form of diabetes and not just because patients lose weight studies have found that more than of patients with this type of diabetes who undergo the surgery see their disease disappear they can go on to live diabetes free without insulin or other medicines even advocates of bariatric surgery say its too early to recommend it for the broad mass of diabetics bariatric surgery can lead to serious complications such as nutritional deficiency the death rate from the procedure is estimated to be between one in and one in an array of medicines plus better diet and exercise can treat diabetes effectively without invasive procedures still some doctors behind the research believe surgery could be a new weapon against a disease that affects some million americans and million people world wide "the idea that you could induce long term remission in diabetic patients without medication is unprecedented " says francesco rubino a surgeon at catholic university in rome who is one of the leaders in the field "clearly theres something big going on here that cant be ignored " studies into bariatric surgerys impact on diabetes are shedding light on little understood hormones that reside in the small intestine and help keep the bodys sugar levels in balance researchers theorize that in diabetic patients food causes these hormones to go awry but when surgery alters the intestinal tract and diverts food away from them the disease can quickly recede understanding how this happens could lead to new medicines and nonsurgical strategies to fight diabetes bariatric surgery usually costs about &# and is a big profit center for some hospitals if even a small percentage of diabetics chose to undergo surgery it would bring a gusher of new business for the profession over the short term at least the cost of surgery exceeds the estimated &# a year needed for conventional care of diabetics "as a primary treatment for diabetes it simply doesnt measure up very well " says richard hellman president of the american association of clinical endocrinologists specialists who treat diabetes bariatric surgery is currently recommended only for patients considered "morbidly obese" those who are at least pounds overweight or about pounds overweight and also have diabetes or other related conditions in medical parlance this corresponds to a body mass index or bmi of and respectively according to a calculation based on height and weight obesity is defined as a bmi of or higher a foot inch person who weighs pounds has a bmi of health insurers generally cover bariatric surgery for the severely obese though sometimes reluctantly it is unlikely that less obese patients would receive broad coverage without a significant body of research proving the surgerys benefits in such cases death rates from bariatric surgery have fallen in recent years partly reflecting new minimally invasive techniques and efforts to improve quality but a few patients still die on the operating table or shortly afterward others suffer ill effects later such as vitamin deficiency also the surgery isnt foolproof as a weight loss strategy some patients gain lost weight back daniel b jones director of bariatric surgery at beth israel deaconess hospital in boston is among doctors who think diabetics with moderate obesity may benefit from surgery "if you have type diabetes and your bmi is we absolutely intervene " says dr jones referring to the more common type of diabetes that typically strikes adults "maybe we should be looking at bmis of maybe were not being aggressive enough with the amount of health impact we can have " barbara brennan who has diabetes was more than pounds overweight when dr jones operated on her july within a couple of weeks she became light headed and had other signs of low blood sugar that is the reverse of the usual problem with diabetics who experience high blood sugar because their bodies arent producing enough insulin or arent properly using the insulin that gets made ms brennan expects that she will soon be able to drop her diabetes medicine she has lost pounds since the procedure "i can see the medical benefit already and its not even two months " says the year old who retired as a property manager at bostons logan airport "taking less medication plus having my sugar levels being more stable has really made me feel a lot better " however she says "i dont know if id ever recommend someone have the surgery just for diabetes " last year patients underwent bariatric surgery according to the american society of bariatric surgery nearly four times the figure five years earlier reflecting the potential for growth from expanding the business to diabetes patients the society plans to announce today a name change to the american society of metabolic and bariatric surgery following a meeting in rome earlier this year the society is part of an effort to publish a consensus paper on when the surgery is appropriate in diabetes patients and what further research needs to be done the prevalence of diabetes is growing at a year according to data from the u s centers for disease control and prevention diabetics are at especially high risk for heart attacks as well as such ailments as stroke kidney disease blindness infertility and a clogging of blood vessels in the legs and feet that can lead to amputations studies indicate that just to of diabetics are able to keep their blood sugar under control a treatment that could reduce this toll would be a major advance and an economic boon to the health care system aggressive marketing and a gold rush atmosphere sparked a surge in bariatric surgery for the severely obese early in this decade resulting in variable results for patients and a tarnished reputation for the procedure "we dont want to make the same mistake twice " says dr rubino who will move from rome in october to head a new program for diabetes surgery research at new york presbyterian hospitals weill cornell medical center in manhattan he says it could be a "disaster" if thousands of patients were urged to get the procedure before further studies show who is likely to get the most benefit from it evidence of bariatric surgerys impact on diabetes has been building for two decades in walter pories a surgeon at east carolina university greenville n c and colleagues published a paper in the annals of surgery titled "who would have thought it " the report based on patients who had undergone the procedure over a year period found not only weight loss but also long term blood sugar control in of the patients who had diabetes and of patients with a prediabetic condition called glucose impairment "no other therapy has produced such durable and complete control of diabetes " the researchers reported few diabetes specialists noticed the article in the surgical journal "it was such a radical departure from how diabetes is treated it didnt get much recognition by thought leaders in the diabetes world " says philip r schauer head of bariatric surgery at the cleveland clinic in dr schauer then at the university of pittsburgh and colleagues reported in annals of surgery on a five year study of diabetics who had the surgery their finding was nearly identical in of the patients blood sugar returned to normal and it was markedly improved in the others results from both papers suggested patients with milder forms of diabetes and those who lost the most weight after surgery were most likely to experience remission of the disease recent papers point to another phenomenon among several variations of bariatric surgery there are two principal strategies one of the strategies marketed by allergan inc and known as the lap band procedure involves an adjustable band that is cinched around the stomach to reduce its size it is reversible and doesnt involve any rearrangement of the intestines the other strategy both shrinks the stomach and reroutes the passage of food to avoid upper portions of the small intestine known as the duodenum and some of the jejunum one specific example of this strategy is a procedure known as roux en y gastric bypass some doctors in the field say that although both forms of the surgery lead to weight loss patients who get the intestinal rerouting see faster improvement in their diabetes that suggests weight loss alone isnt a full explanation for how surgery might help diabetics while training as a surgeon at mount sinai hospital in new york in the late s dr rubino became curious about whether surgery could address diabetes without shrinking the stomach he came up with a procedure that would bypass the duodenum and the upper portion of the jejunum but leave the stomach intact in contrast to the roux en y procedure then he tested it on a strain of laboratory rats that had type diabetes but werent obese they were able to eat normally the procedure resulted in a dramatic reduction of diabetes a report on the experiment was published in the annals of surgery in "that was the first evidence that the surgery could have a direct effect on diabetes that wasnt related to losing weight " dr rubino says doctors are beginning to test the idea of intestines only surgery in humans dr rubino says about patients all of them outside the u s have been treated with that approach with encouraging early results fabrizio michelassi surgeon in chief at weill cornell says such surgery could be a valuable innovation the standard forms of bariatric surgery typically leave patients with stomachs the size of an egg "they are condemned to meals that are little purees for the rest of their lives " says dr michelassi it may be he says that with dr rubinos procedure "you can still eat your steak and potatoes and your diabetes gets controlled " other doctors say the stomach reduction part of the traditional surgery plays an important role in the antidiabetes effect it may help by curtailing how quickly food flows into the intestine they say "it looks as if there are rogue cells in the intestine that are causing diabetes " says dr pories the surgeon from east carolina university "the surgery either reduces the amount of food that comes down to these cells or detours the food around them " small studies of moderately obese diabetics in brazil india and mexico show promise for surgery but the numbers are too small and the length of the studies too short to reach solid conclusions dr schauer at the cleveland clinic has started a five year study of diabetics with bmis ranging from to two groups of patients in the study will receive forms of bariatric surgery a third group will get only drugs and other noninvasive therapies dr schauer wants to discover which group sees the greatest effect on diabetes "when you get a gastric bypass things are dramatically changed in your favor " says dr jones in boston "we dont know what it is we know its real and its reproducible if we can tease it out it will be a huge advance "
