is the final frontier just one ride away on a space elevator tie a rock to the end of a piece of ribbon then spin it over your head it will be pulled taut as the rock circles about now imagine a ribbon miles long anchored near the equator with a weight on the other end the centrifugal force of the earths rotation will make it behave the same way youll end up with not only the worlds biggest nunchuck but also a kind of elevator to outer space a space elevator is one of those ideas from s style futurism that are so wacky they might just work a thriving community of elevator buffs certainly thinks so they meet online at sites like spaceelevator com nasa is sufficiently intrigued that it has kicked in millions of dollars for a space elevator design competition the third annual running of the contest takes place in october outside of salt lake city teams mostly from universities have signed up to compete to the extent that a space elevator is feasible at all is due to advances in the science of nanotechnology especially carbon nanotubes these are atomic scale threads with a tensile strength greater than steel but with vastly less weight when bound together they become unimaginably strong the long spine of the proposed elevator would be inches wide but only as thick as a sheet of paper wade adams a nanotech researcher at rice university said nano engineers have created threads as strong as those needed for an elevator and continue to make steady progress existing nanotube threads are already triple the strength of the kevlar strands used in bulletproof vests the main theorist of the space elevator is brad edwards a former los alamos national lab physicist who spent three years under a nasa contract figuring out if a working elevator could be built yes he concluded and heres how a rocket would take two spools each the size of a living room with miles of ribbon wrapped around it to an orbit of miles both would be unrolled one being allowed to waft back to earth the other pulled up and away from earth by a spacecraft and then anchored with a weight at the end then theyd be joined in the middle the bottom portion would be secured onto an oil rig like platform located along the equator miles west of mexico a location chosen for its uneventful weather the ribbon would weigh tons or about pounds a mile were it to break the top segment would float away into space while the bottom would fall to earth nothing youd want to be on hand to see of course "but nothing that would threaten the planet " says dr edwards the actual cab of the elevator the "climber" would attach to the ribbon via rollers it would zip up at miles an hour requiring a week to reach the very top while theres nothing but deadly space radiation to keep people from making the trip the elevator is mostly conceived as an all cargo affair especially for satellites remarkably it could also be used for trips to the moon mars or beyond recall says dr edwards that the earth rotates once every hours meaning that something tethered to it miles up travels at more than miles an hour if youre at the top of the elevator and time it right when you let go you can be whipped to just about anywhere you want to go with a nudge or two from booster rockets the teams at the october event will be entering a miniature version of a climber that will need to go up and down a foot tether to win the &# million prize a climber has to make the trip within a specified time last year a team from the university of saskatchewan this year five of the entries are from canada came within second of winning climbers in general get their power from the ground last year the saskatchewan team members aimed powerful light beams at their climber which then used solar panels to convert the light into electricity this year says captain clayton ruszkowski theyre switching from light beams to lasers that are a million times as strong as the one in your dvd drive back east in cambridge mass the mit team is working on a climber that will work on beamed up microwave energy dr edwards estimates a real elevator would cost &# billion and could pay for its operations by capturing of the commercial satellite launching as for nasa says dr edwards its committed to the contest not necessarily because its sold on the idea but because its interested in the sort of spinoff technologies that elevator research might make possible such as for advanced composite materials that might be used in other spacecraft another use of the space elevator contest is to get schoolchildren interested in something besides their ipods diana jennings associate director of the institute for advanced concepts a nasa funded outfit sponsoring the contest says young eyes light up when she talks about the elevator not even the space shuttle elicits that reaction "everything else is just tv for them now " she says email me at lee gomes wsj com
