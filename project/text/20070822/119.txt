staying balanced in a wild market youve been through this before and you know what to do the subprime mortgage mess and the accompanying stock and bond market turmoil may have been a surprise yet the pattern is all too familiar risky investments got hammered safe securities made money and most ordinary investors freeze unsure what to do next but if youre a veteran mutual fund investor there is no dithering rather this is a time for action positioning your portfolio for profits in the years ahead taking aim it all starts with those target percentages you settled on a few years ago back then you opted for a mix of say large company shares small stocks real estate investment trusts gold shares developed foreign stock markets emerging market shares high quality short term bonds inflation indexed treasury bonds and high yield junk bonds now when you do your regular portfolio review you find some holdings have drifted far from their targets for instance many gold and reit funds have been hit hard this year so you are likely underweighted in both categories indeed reits are shaping up as this years biggest losers after seven consecutive years of market beating gains reits finally got their comeuppance with the dow jones equity all reit index losing so far this year nobody of course knows how the sector will perform in the months and years ahead still if you own a well diversified collection of these stocks through a real estate fund you can be pretty sure you will make decent money over the long run armed with that confidence you "rebalance" by stashing more money in your real estate fund with the goal of getting back to your target what if reits keep sinking you keep buying knowing you should eventually get your reward thats what happened with inflation indexed bond funds in and these funds performed poorly which meant a lot of buying to maintain your target but this year the funds rank as morningstars top performing bond category and today you might want to do a little selling so you have money to buy reits arguing strategy to be sure fund aficionados quibble endlessly over how to execute this whole rebalancing strategy some favor index funds because they offer a surefire way of capturing the underlying markets performance others prefer actively managed funds hoping to beat the market similarly some investors stick with broad based funds such as total stock market index funds and total bond market index funds others slice and dice the financial markets buying specialized funds focused on say small company value shares and emerging market debt the more specialized your funds the more turmoil you will endure but the more chances you will get to rebalance your portfolio and realize profits theres also debate over how often to tweak a portfolio some investors rebalance every year or every three months others are more opportunistic rebalancing when there is a market shakeout like were seeing now to avoid onerous tax bills and tax hassles try to confine any selling to your retirement accounts if you need to rebalance in a taxable account you might choose to direct fresh savings and any mutual fund distributions to those funds that have become underweight dont however let all these details deter you at its heart the strategy is really delightfully simple after all you dont need to figure out which way stocks and bonds are headed or which securities look cheap instead you just calculate how your funds compare with your targets and then do a little trading to get back on track thus ensuring you arent overloaded on any one sector this keeps your portfolios risk level in check maybe more important it also keeps your worst instincts in check when markets turn wild folks are often tempted to flee hard hit sectors but rebalancing forces you to grit your teeth and invest more in funds that are suffering while easing up on those that have lately fared well result you buy low and sell high turning the markets mayhem into a money making opportunity
