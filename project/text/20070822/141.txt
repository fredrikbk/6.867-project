volatile markets spook money centers landlords for the past two years financial institutions fueled the robust office markets of new york and london rental rates soared to record highs as hedge funds and a few other financial institutions elbowed each other out of the way for offices with amenities that reflected their presumed power grand views of parks or waterways easy commuting access and world class restaurants nearby for entertaining clients the vacancy rate for top quality space plunged below in both lower manhattan and the city of london the british capitals financial district but now the two cities heavy dependence on financial sector jobs has real estate brokers and analysts debating whether the gusher will shut off caveats abound with experts saying the answer depends on how long the turmoil continues how much bad debt financial firms end up swallowing and how many hedge funds go under one thing market experts agree on though most finance firms will take a timeout on real estate decisions until they see how everything shakes out "our view at the moment is there is going to be an awful lot of sitting on the fence over the course of the next three months on the part of the major banks " says joe valente london based head of research for dtz a global real estate adviser if so those landlords who bought buildings based on very aggressive assumptions of future rent growth hoping to duplicate last years in new york or in london may start to sweat no office markets in the world are as dependent on financial institutions banks hedge funds and private equity firms as new york and london though cities such as hong kong and tokyo are home to major banks the office tenant base is more diverse the numbers are striking financial firms hold nearly one third of all office space in manhattan and london the breakdown is even more pronounced for submarkets in the city of london business district finance firms have a virtual stranglehold at compared with only for the west end district according to cb richard ellis a los angeles based real estate services firm in lower manhattan where wall street is located the financial sector holds of all space according to colliers abr inc a real estate brokerage those tallies dont include law and accounting firms that often support the financial sector if the problems in the credit markets turn out to be no more than a summer cold and the financial system recovers quickly the office markets in the worlds financial centers may see little change but there is some fear that the sniffles could become a lingering malaise and banks will start to cut back ubs ag analysts last week downgraded to "hold" from "buy" sl green realty corp and boston properties two office real estate investment trusts with heavy exposure to new york saying that earnings should remain strong but that the possibility of layoffs at banks and implosions at hedge funds could weigh on the stocks "dislocation in the credit markets in recent weeks appears to have begun a ripple effect through the employment levels at wall street firms " writes analyst james feldman mr feldman writes that one wall street firm has canceled contracts with some newly hired analysts several hedge funds have closed their doors and merger activity has clearly slowed sl green chief executive marc holliday declined to comment on the downgrade but said people may fear the financial sector tenants would put space back on the market as subleases however he said "the market is so tight right now that we are not seeing any drop off in demand as evidenced by the leases we are signing and the rates we are still getting right up to today " boston properties didnt return calls seeking comment nobody is predicting catastrophe for these markets rents arent expected to drop anytime soon its just that the growth rate might slow after all space is very tight and tenants are having trouble finding any big blocks of space "the good news is that this credit market volatility is occurring during the best office fundamentals new york city has ever seen " says sonny kalsi managing director and global co head of real estate investing for morgan stanley a more likely consequence is that the leases taken by hedge funds at the rates of nearly &# per square foot in midtown manhattan and &# per square foot in londons west end are a thing of the past says mr valente those leases made for sensational headlines but tended to be small spaces of under square feet if most financial firms are lying low on decisions people close to the situation say merrill lynch &amp co continues to negotiate a lease for its new york headquarters merrills lease in the world financial center in lower manhattan runs out in and it must make a decision soon if it wants to construct a new tower the company is in talks with its current landlord brookfield properties corp but is also talking with developer larry silverstein about one of three towers he is building at the world trade center site as well as vornado realty trust about a possible new skyscraper near pennsylvania station in midtown a little relief in rent growth could be good news for those tenants wincing at current rates now averaging above &# per square foot for top quality "class a" space in midtown manhattan and &# for the city of london "there might be some tenants dancing in the street hoping the rates are going to come down " says james kuhn president of newmark knight frank a real estate brokerage with headquarters in new york the party may be premature the credit crunch will actually benefit some landlords because developers will be less willing to start new buildings as people find it difficult to borrow money says stephen hester chief executive of british land co plc one of the united kingdoms largest real estate investment trusts several towers are under way in london including three being constructed by british land but most new space wont be completed until even if the london and new york markets remain robust overall a few landlords could find themselves in a bind if leasing slows over the past year sales prices for buildings soared just last month investors smashed the office sales record in new york for a building at park ave paying nearly &# per square foot in london prices for prime office towers also remain strong yet rent assumptions for some commercial mortgages were aggressive some loan underwriters calculated office towers cash flow based on prevailing market rates rather than what tenants are actually paying assuming for example that a tenant who is locked into a long term contract at &# a foot is actually paying &# a foot says erin stafford senior vice president for the credit rating firm dbrs exacerbating their plight landlords may not have the option of refinancing to avoid ballooning mortgage payments or selling the building at a higher price during this credit crunch says jim costello senior economist for the real estate research firm torto wheaton research "depending on when loans get due some folks may get left holding the bag " michael hudson contributed to this article
