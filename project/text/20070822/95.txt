over the wall beijings communist party isnt keen on giving up power over its citizens so mondays announcement that chinese investors can now buy foreign stocks is a big vote of confidence in individual freedom if senators chuck schumer and lindsey graham and other china bashers really care about creating a stable healthy global economy and a freer china they will cheer this move like many other reforms in china this one looks small at first glance in a short statement on the state authority of foreign exchanges web site monday regulators announced a pilot capital control liberalization project in the northern coastal city of tianjin there investors can put as much money as they like in the local bank of china branch buy foreign currency and invest it initially in stocks listed in hong kong investors in other parts of china may open accounts in tianjin too the hong kong stock exchange rose almost on monday and stayed in positive territory yesterday on the news perhaps these investors know that chinas biggest economic reforms often start as "pilot projects " and then are slowly expanded this reform has been a long time coming while beijing has liberalized its trade account it has never done much on the capital front at home that has led to credit misallocations as chinese savers scramble to find places to put their money because bank savings yield in the low single digits most investors have turned to property and stocks little wonder that the shanghai market is up over this year far outpacing global bourses beijings capital controls have also given washington an excuse to carp about chinas exchange rate blaming the value of the renminbi for the countrys booming export led growth the real problem is different because they were not allowed to find decent returns on their hard earned income most chinese figure it is better to save their money for retirement their childrens schooling and other necessities so local consumption has remained stagnant aggravating the trade imbalance between the u s and china contrary to the anti china hype beijing has long signaled its openness to market based solutions to these problems in the spring of policy makers unveiled the qualified institutional investor program which let chinese savers put their money into mostly foreign fixed income products such as international bond funds that never attracted huge amounts of capital however because china wasnt offering investors attractive investments why put money in bonds if youre tripling your cash on the local stock market so the party tiptoed toward more liberalization in may regulators allowed banks and insurers to sell foreign stock products in june they laid out rules for fund managers and brokerages to join in last month they increased the percentage of their portfolios that insurance companies could invest in foreign stocks in the short run mondays announcement wont send floods of money into hong kong most big time chinese investors who want to put their money abroad already have done so either by skirting regulations or through illegal transfers yet if beijing extends the tianjin experiment to other cities and eventually allows other banks to participate a vast pool of new chinese investors may well be emboldened to diversify their risks and put some cash abroad in the long run this could help impose more market discipline on chinas domestic stock markets bring more investors into chinas formal financial sector and ease appreciation pressure on the renminbi it eventually could also make that all important chinese consumer feel more confident in his savings and start to spend in the u s stocks and mutual funds have let middle america share in national prosperity europe caught on a bit later china isnt anywhere near that level of financial market sophistication but it is moving in the right direction bottom line the more chinas investors feel they have a stake in the global economy the harder it will be for beijing to roll back its free market reforms and thats good for everyone
