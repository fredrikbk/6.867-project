tax report sole proprietors face tax scrutiny gao says majority underreport income enforcing the rules a new government report shows large amounts of tax noncompliance including both cheating and honest mistakes among "sole proprietors " or people who own unincorporated businesses by themselves these people represent a "significant portion" of the nations annual tax gap or money that taxpayers owe but dont pay says a u s government accountability office report based on internal revenue service data irs officials have estimated the overall tax gap at about &# billion for the tax year congress is focusing especially intently these days on narrowing the tax gap through improved tax law enforcement because of what are known as pay as you go rules these generally require lawmakers to offset tax cuts with revenue raising measures legislative measures that are projected to raise revenue through improved enforcement measures such as giving the irs new powers are an alternative to raising tax rates or eliminating deductions or credits the gao report is "very significant in these times when tax reductions have to be paid for by tax increases " says donald alexander a washington lawyer at akin gump and a former irs commissioner "why not turn first to those who dont report their incomes and dont pay their taxes " the report released last week provides more details than have been released publicly on sole proprietors and their tax payments according to the report "at least " of u s sole proprietors underreported their net business income for the tax year irs data also indicate that sole proprietors misreported around of their business income for that year several examples of the problem can be found in the gao report which doesnt name names because of taxpayer privacy laws for example the report cites a sole proprietor who reported about &# in gross receipts on schedule c the business was "largely done with cash transactions " the gao said an irs examiner found the proprietor should have reported an additional &# in net income on schedule c that contributed to a total proposed additional tax assessment of about &# in another case the sole proprietor owned a construction business and reported losses of more than &# the examiner found the proprietor had "poor business skills and shoddy records " the gao report said the result the irs found more than &# of net taxable income or gross income minus expenses and other items sole proprietors include a wide range of businesses mostly small ranging from plumbers and grocers to electricians and free lance writers the gao report says about two thirds had gross receipts of less than &# for sole proprietors are distinct from corporations and partnerships the gao report says the report says more than million sole proprietors filed tax returns for they represented about of all businesses in the u s but less than of all business receipts the gao report is "pretty interesting " says a former irs official with extensive background in law enforcement "but you are immediately confronted" with the tricky issue of how to reduce tax evasion among sole proprietors "without imposing large third party reporting costs or dramatically increasing enforcement " he says irs and treasury officials have long been aware of compliance problems among sole proprietors and made references to the subject in a recent report on how to reduce the tax gap irs research shows income reporting compliance is strongest when taxpayers are subject to tax withholding and "information reporting" such as an employer reporting an employees salary to the irs for example only about of wages and salaries are misreported by contrast amounts that arent subject to withholding or third party information reporting are most likely to be misreported the irs says such transactions are less "visible" to the irs the bush administration has made proposals to narrow the overall tax gap among other things the administration wants congress to approve a record irs budget of &# billion up nearly from the budget enacted for fiscal president bush also has made other legislative proposals for example he wants congress to authorize the irs to require organizations that process card payments for merchants who accept payment cards to report to the irs each year the gross payments made to the merchants the policy options suggested in the gao report include improving irs instructions and expanding taxpayer assistance programs another idea would require businesses that process credit and debit card payments to report to the irs on the amount of payments made to sole proprietors because of the problem caused by sole proprietors failing to report income other taxpayers "have to pay on average hundreds of dollars in additional taxes" apiece says james r white director of tax issues at the gao it isnt known how much of the misreporting by this group is intentional and how much is caused by factors such as tax law complexity honest errors poor recordkeeping or other issues the gao report says small business groups say the problem is due in large measure to increasingly complicated tax laws that make it hard even for experts to know what to do bill rys of the national federation of independent business says the irs should consider "more outreach and education of small business owners and first time filers " but the gao report points out most of the misreporting was underreporting of income "its not fair to honest owners of small businesses for some to pay less than they legally owe and so these problems should be addressed " says senate finance committee chairman max baucus d mont "theres also a lot the irs could do to make the rules clearer and compliance easier and in particular there should be assistance to help small businesses learn the ropes of the system right at first " phone customers still have time to file for a one time excise tax refund the irs said this week about million taxpayers or nearly of all individual tax return filers already have requested telephone tax refunds this year most phone customers including most cellphone users are eligible for the refund if youve already filed your return for and didnt include this item file an amended return using form x briefs edward d kleinbard a year old partner at cleary gottlieb steen &amp
