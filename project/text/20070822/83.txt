the years since rising an average of to annually according to the law firm group of citi private bank a unit of citigroup inc but for some time the highest billing partners at top big city firms have hovered in the mid to high &# range hesitant to cross the four figure threshold "we have viewed &# an hour as a possible vomit point for clients " says a partner at a new york firm "frankly its a little hard to think about anyone who doesnt save lives being worth this much money " says david boies one of the nations best known trial lawyers at the armonk n y office of boies schiller &amp flexner llp a select group of attorneys began billing at that rate before this year such as stephen susman a founding partner of a houston firm who has tried big ticket cases around the country and

almost &# an hour as a critical mass develops around fees of &# an hour in new york though more firms may feel comfortable going to that level and beyond "one thousand dollars per hour has symbolic

says he recently balked when a new york lawyer cited &# as his hourly rate instead mr sager says he agreed to pay the attorney a flat monthly fee "one thousand dollars may be someones choke point but mine is actually a lot lower " he says still some lawyers are confident theyre worth &# per hour and that nows the time to break the barrier "i havent personally experienced resistance to my billing rates " mr ostrager says "the legal marketplace is very sophisticated " law firms say the boosts arent just about lining partners pockets theyre partly a response to booming costs which in recent
