missouri case could ring up cellphone taxes in recent years state and local governments have been looking to monthly cellphone bills as a new source of tax revenue to make up for the growing number of consumers giving up their traditional telephones for wireless services now a legal battle in missouri could accelerate that trend emboldening some state and local governments to increase cellphone taxes and cellphone bills even more after a six year legal struggle a state court in st louis county this week may finally rule on whether a group of municipal telephone license taxes worth an estimated &# million statewide apply to services offered by wireless carriers the missouri case is among the most important attempts by the states to tax cellphone bills it involves a large amount of money and some major companies including at&amp t inc sprint nextel corp and verizon wireless a joint venture of verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc the case could result in a big financial hit to the carriers which until recently have resisted collecting the tax from their customers that means they now could face having to pay the bill plus interest and penalties at issue is whether cellphones can be taxed the same as regular phone lines which pay special utility taxes in many states cellphones services are also assessed sales and excise taxes fees to guarantee universal coverage and to fund emergency lines and other surcharges the costs are typically passed on to customers "our customers are tired of having state and local governments treating them like atm machines so we are fighting on their behalf " said john taylor a sprint spokesman who says the average sprint customer pays of their bill in taxes the taxes vary by state currently states or their municipalities impose on cellphone services taxes and fees traditionally applied to utilities according to scott mackey of the montpelier vt consulting firm of kimbell sherman ellis llp which is representing the wireless industry the combined tax bill for an average cellphone user ranges from a high of in nebraska to in idaho missouri is no with users paying the missouri municipalities say that landline calls and cellphone calls are essentially the same and must therefore pay the same business license taxes "you dial a number and get to speak to someone at some distance i think its pretty obvious that its telephone service " said howard paperner an attorney representing two cities "why should one provider of telephone services have to pay a tax of to of their revenues while another has to pay nothing " cellphone companies say the business license taxes missouri wants to collect represent an unfair extension of laws written when telephone calls moved along copper wires and a sole provider agreed to the tax in exchange for right of way to set up telephone polls and lay cable the companies argue such laws shouldnt apply to wireless services which use mobile radio signals to send email take photographs surf the internet download and listen to music and watch movies in addition to making phone calls they also point to a missouri law requiring a popular vote to approve new taxes the missouri municipalities the largest of which are st louis and kansas city have seen their tax bases eroding as customers gradually give up their landlines for cellphones for example university city a suburb of st louis and the first to file suit against the carriers in this dispute has seen its telecom tax revenue decline to &# last year from &# in business license tax rates in missouri run as high as of gross sales in the largest cities and cellphone carriers do more than &# billion in business in the state each year if the lawsuit is successful more than municipalities could collect back taxes for five years before the suits were filed in plus interest and penalties the tax at issue was historically applied to public utilities but missouri municipalities sought to change that in after a state appeals court ruled in a separate case that wireless companies were telephone companies for the purposes of local taxation university city and other cities filed suit against the seven largest wireless carriers in december on behalf of all municipalities after the major carriers ignored repeated requests to voluntarily pay the tax said john f mulligan jr the lead attorney the wireless industry has fought the case in all levels of state court in federal court and sought relief through legislation that would have capped the tax rate in exchange for dropping the lawsuits that legislation was passed in but overturned last year by the missouri supreme court after that court decision at&amp t sprint and verizon wireless paid taxes to some municipalities under protest into special escrow funds in this weeks case at&amp t is requesting a refund of &# million it paid into escrow to cities the missouri municipal league which is coordinating legislative efforts for the municipalities in the dispute estimates that the cellphone companies owe &# million in taxes mr mulligan estimates that interest and penalties could add hundreds of millions of dollars to the bill "six years ago they could have paid under protest into a fund and let the courts decide whether the tax was applicable to wireless telephone service " mr mulligan said "they decided to gamble by not collecting from their customers and so far it hasnt paid off " the growing number of states that impose or let localities impose cellphone taxes has prompted sen john mccain r ariz and rep mary bono r calif to sponsor legislation proposing a three year moratorium on new state cellphone taxes tomorrow st louis county circuit court judge bernhardt drumm jr will hear a motion for summary judgment in the at&amp t lawsuit deciding if he can rule on the case based on the evidence submitted so far or must hold a full trial if he does rule his decision could be appealed on sept judge drumm is set to determine if the university city case deserves class action status if it does it would automatically include more than other municipalities the impending court hearings are accelerating negotiations to resolve dozens of lawsuits in the dispute settlement talks are focusing on limiting the back taxes that are due and an agreement to pay going forward "paying something thats fair would be fine for us " said cheryl bini armbrecht a spokeswoman for verizon wireless "its something that we want to put behind us its something that we want to resolve for our customers "
