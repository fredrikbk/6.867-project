politics &amp economics sea treaty unites unlikely allies environmentalists oil interests and military urge senate to back pact washington what do the nature conservancy exxon mobil corp offshore oil drillers the fishing shipping and diamond industries president bush and the u s navy have in common answer they all support a little known but highly contentious international treaty set to come before the u s senate next month for ratification that governs nearly every aspect of ocean law from underwater mineral rights to access to shipping lanes the page law of the sea convention debated since the s and sealed in has stirred passions for decades in washington critics in the senate have repeatedly blocked its ratification saying the pact would undercut u s sovereignty supporters tout the treaty as a pillar of international law and key to long term u s security the u s is now one of fewer than countries and the only significant power not to have joined that is now almost certain to change for three reasons scarce energy sources the thawing arctic ice cap and the u s navys desire for unfettered access to the worlds seaways these motivations have helped galvanize an odd coalition of environmentalists oil interests and military brass to persuade enough senators to back the treaty the renewed interest has grown more intense amid a scramble to claim undersea territories in the resource rich arctic looking to buttress its legal case for ownership of a massive undersea ridge russia planted its flag earlier this month on a seabed more than feet below the north pole canada asserting its disputed rights plans a new fleet of ice breaking ships and a deepwater arctic port yesterday canadian prime minister stephen harper asserted his countrys claim to the so called northwest passage along its northern coast during a meeting with mr bush in quebec and denmark is sending a research team to push its own claim to undersea holdings that extend far from greenland all this has put the u s in a jam the law of the sea treaty allows countries even nonsignatories exclusive rights to the seabed extending nautical miles from their shores countries can then present evidence to claim rights to any of their continental shelf beyond that claims and disputes fall to one of several arbitration bodies established by the treaty without being a party to the treaty the u s has no clear way short of threatening force to assert its claims u s officials said the stakes are literally vast in the arctic alone the u s could lay claim to more than square miles of additional undersea territories the u s coast guard cutter healy is in the region to continue mapping the ocean floor to help strengthen the u s case by some estimates the countrys total additional undersea holdings including extensions off the east coast and the gulf of mexico could exceed square miles or roughly twice the size of california recent estimates have found the arctic could contain the equivalent of more than billion barrels of oil and gas and massive amounts of another potential energy source crystallized methane the u s geological survey has estimated the amount of carbon found in hydrate form world wide is "conservatively" twice the amount found in all the worlds fossil fuels increased thawing of the arctic ice cap is also beginning to open up seaways such as the long heralded northwest passage that is expected to revolutionize shipping still blocked by ice much of the year the polar pathway linking china to northern europe and the northwest u s is about miles shorter than routes through the suez or panama canals canada for years has asserted its sovereignty over the passage a claim the u s and other countries dispute environmentalists back the law of the sea treaty because of its provisions for controlling pollution from ships and underwater exploration policy makers in washington have generally been slow to champion the treaty president reagan opposed the original pacts undersea mining rules as biased against u s interests a position that still carries much weight with many conservatives president clinton signed the treaty after those rules were amended but the republican controlled senate refused to go along in the measure withered again on capitol hill under pressure from oil groups and diplomats in his administration mr bush in may endorsed the pacts ratification for the first time the heads of the army navy air force and marines followed suit with an unusual joint letter urging senate passage the pact still has some vocal critics in washington former reagan adviser frank gaffney calls it "a socialist manifesto for the redistribution of wealth " now the head of the center for security policy a conservative think tank in washington mr gaffney says "no senator who has actually read this treaty would vote for it " republican sen james inhofe of oklahoma one of at least a dozen conservatives who oppose the treaty calls it "a disaster" and vows to work to block it from a full senate vote other critics say the treaty will weaken u s efforts to interdict illicit shipments of nuclear materials and entangle the armed forces in a web of international regulations as for the arctics resource potential they say the u s could work out an accommodation with the half dozen other nations with a stake there the navy the pacts most ardent supporter dismisses such claims "this for us is global mobility thats what its all about " says rear adm bruce macdonald the navys judge advocate general the treaty is now the worlds primary legal blueprint for what constitutes international waters and airspace it grants all navies the right to "innocent passage" through the worlds seaways yet dozens of countries from ecuador and somalia to china south korea and vietnam continue to try to limit the rights of warships to pass through their waters joining the pact adm macdonald said would give the u s a forum to contest such claims "we need this treaty to lock in the rights we already have " administration officials also argue that washingtons failure to sign on to the treaty has in fact undercut the proliferation security initiative a u s effort to enlist international help to cut off shipments of nuclear and missile technology to countries such as iran or north korea two countries that have declined to join psi malaysia and indonesia recently cited washingtons spurning of the law of the sea treaty as their main reason others argue that the u s is already losing out in what promises to be a multibillion dollar opportunity the undersea mining of copper zinc cobalt and even diamonds john norton moore a top legal expert on the law of the sea at the university of virginia said russian and chinese firms have already laid claim to some of the biggest undersea mines in the world without joining the treaty the u s has no forum in which to stake a claim "our sitting on the sidelines all these years has already cost us " he said corrections &amp amplifications the northwest passage links china to northern europe and the northeastern u s an article aug on the law of the sea treaty incorrectly said the northwest passage links china to northern europe and the northwestern u s wsj sep
