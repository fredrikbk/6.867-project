zipcar goes to college for generations carless college students have had to rely on their own feet or bikes buses and friends clunkers to get around but now a new wave of car sharing companies is giving kids easier access to wheels companies such as zipcar inc and revolution llcs flexcar which allow customers to rent cars for hours or days see a lucrative new market in students a population that has been largely ignored by traditional rental car companies such as hertz corp and avis budget group inc indeed many rental car companies prohibit those under from renting at most locations the car sharing companies however are now cutting partnerships with schools nationwide flexcar is set to announce deals with arizona state university and the university of wisconsin milwaukee and this month it added ohio state university the nations largest school by enrollment last year zipcar the worlds largest car sharing company says it is launching at between and new schools this fall including yale university and carnegie mellon university bringing its total to more than both companies are also lowering their age requirement at many universities to just making cars available to most of the student body "its underserved " says mark norman chief executive of flexcar the companies also hope to cement students loyalty while they are in college and then keep them as customers after graduation universities are adding the programs in the hopes they will help reduce the number of privately owned cars and ease the resulting parking crunch on campus schools are also using the programs to allow them to reduce their own fleets of cars some also tout their possible environmental impact since the car sharing companies offer hybrids and could theoretically reduce emissions by taking some cars off the road for mike karp a senior at columbia university zipcar has been ideal for his big grocery store runs he prefers buying in bulk at costco and for collecting relatives at the airport he left his five year old mazda protege back home in palo alto calif "it just seemed like a great idea in new york because theres no chance im going to have a car there ever " he says "ten bucks an hour is not exactly cheap but its certainly cheaper than having a car in new york " the cost to the customer includes an hourly usage rate which is typically around &# to &# and an annual membership fee which usually ranges from &# to &# gas insurance and an allotment of free miles per day at zipcar at flexcar plus with each additional paid hour are included cars belonging to the programs are typically situated in university provided parking spaces on campus just like car sharers elsewhere students reserve a particular car for a particular time either online or by phone then enter the car by holding their membership card over the cars card reader the keys are inside the car as is a gas card traditional rental car companies largely avoid the student market because of concerns about liability according to the insurance institute for highway safety the crash rate per mile driven for year olds is four times that of drivers and older companies seek to mitigate risk through surcharges and higher minimum age requirements hertzs minimum age is in all states except michigan and new york where its hertz renters under the age of are also subject to an age differential charge avis budget has a minimum age of in most locations and has a &# per day surcharge in new york state for renters to the car sharing companies by contrast are aiming to manage their risk by requiring that to year old applicants have two years driving experience and a clean record and that they be a student at a participating school there are no additional fees or deposits although flexcar also requires parental consent and a copy of the students current auto insurance policy showing the policys limits flexcar requires that year olds have &# of additional liability coverage but otherwise insurance works the same way for year old car sharers as it does for older ones in an accident the car sharing companys insurance covers the cost except for a &# deductible which applies if the member is at fault the car sharing companies believe they can tap into the younger market safely because of their business model which allows them to screen customers by their driving record and because of the clientele "the reason we see a difference is because were a membership driven system " says scott griffith president and chief executive of zipcar mr norman of flexcar says that actuarial studies show a correlation between higher education and better behavior among younger drivers so after successfully running an and up pilot program at six schools last year flexcar is expanding its plus program to all of its schools except the university of washington where insurance requirements prevent it from doing so "what they have to concern themselves with is six kids getting in a honda civic with six packs in the trunk and driving to the lake " says neil abrams president of abrams consulting group a car rental consulting firm "thats the risk as long as they mitigate that risk i think it could be great " there can be some downsides to renting a car whose prior occupants could have been using it as a mobile fraternity party because the cars arent returned to a maintenance location after every use as airport rentals are students sometimes find upon pickup that the cars arent perfectly clean or fully fueled grace tomlin of cambridge mass who has used zipcar while at the massachusetts institute of technology says that one previous user left behind a baking dish which ms tomlin kept "i was like i scored " she says still the companies say that upkeep generally isnt a problem even with college kids because shared usage encourages self policing since members may find themselves reusing the same car penalties also exist for offenses like smoking which flexcar says carries a &# charge zipcar says maintenance of its college cars is handled by the participating schools fleet department which examines the cars once a week at zipcars expense the deals between the companies and the schools work this way the companies provide the cars the insurance and the membership program administration the schools provide marketing parking and some financial guarantees not all of the kinks have been worked out yet though michigan which is entering its second year with zipcar guaranteed the company in year one that if it didnt make &# in membership and rental fees the university would make up the difference the program brought in about &# according to the university leaving michigan owing &# the university wants to lower its financial guarantee in year two says david miller executive director of parking and transportation services at u m but mr miller is optimistic about the program he says it didnt grow as fast as hoped because michigan had only six cars for its entire campus the fewer the cars the farther customers have to travel to get them which car sharers dislike and because the schools departments havent embraced it for business use sticking with the universitys car fleet instead better marketing will help he says last year the program started in late october well after the school year had begun and the program will have a wider audience as the age limitation is dropping to from mr miller is expecting particular interest from younger students since the school doesnt sell campus parking permits to freshmen or sophomores carnegie mellon which has very limited parking on its urban campus in pittsburgh says it hopes its faculty and staff will use its zipcar program and leave their personal cars at home the university already provides them free use of pittsburgh public transportation but they often bring their cars to work anyway to run personal errands "some people love their car theyre going to take their car no matter what " says tim michael the schools assistant vice president for campus services "but if we can provide options like car sharing it would give them a new opportunity to do the right thing being sensitive to the environment using more of a shared resource " carnegie mellon is starting out this fall with two cars a mazda sedan and a toyota prius hybrid for now traditional rental car companies arent jumping in to compete with the car sharing companies on campus "i wouldnt say were ceding it to them but its a market that hertz has yet to tap into " says a hertz spokeswoman enterprise rent a car co says it has accounts with numerous universities which can be tailored to offer hourly and under age renting but the company doesnt promote them
