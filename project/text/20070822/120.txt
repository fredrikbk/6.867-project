storms good for some stocks during a five week stretch two years ago that produced hurricanes katrina and rita energy equities were among the biggest winners in a flattish market otherwise spooked with concern about the effects of higher energy prices while virtually all boats in the ocean of petroleum stocks rose amid s unprecedented battering to gulf coast petroleum infrastructure there were some standouts within the vast network of companies that explore for oil service wells and refine and distribute petroleum products while oil giants including exxon mobil corp and chevron corp would ultimately post annual profit records in in part because of the storms their valuation gains of and over this five week stretch were overshadowed by a range of smaller companies that posted double digit gains the patterns are worth keeping in mind as the spotlight returns to the gulf coast amid gloomy predictions of another turbulent hurricane season over the next two months or so after a slow start the hurricane season kicked into gear earlier this month with the sudden intensification of tropical storm erin near the texas coast and hurricane dean erin never reached hurricane force but did dump seven inches of rain in some parts of texas after making landfall hurricane dean pounded jamaicas southern coast on sunday but slowed to a category hurricane from category while passing over mexicos yucatan peninsula and was expected to roll into the oil rich campeche sound late yesterday in the biggest stock movers over a five week stretch encompassing katrina and rita included companies that perform offshore repairs such as oceaneering international inc which rose more than and global industries ltd which jumped many companies from this subsector continue to earn fresh revenue from storm related work that dates back to the storms and to s hurricane ivan also recording outsized gains during the september storm stretch were onshore natural gas producers chesapeake energy corp which rose and eog resources inc jumping these companies which arent heavily leveraged to the gulf of mexico garnered all of the benefits but virtually none of the pain from higher commodity prices due to offshore production outages many offshore producers including apache corp also gained during this stretch but not as much the other notable winners in were independent refiners which benefited from a severe gasoline supply crunch wrought from huge impairments to the domestic refining industry as consumers balked at high gasoline prices after katrina and rita struck leading refiners gained billions of dollars in market value for example valero energy corp which sustained storm damage at plants in louisiana and texas gained energy experts point to some caveats when it comes to trying to orient an energy portfolio around hurricane season the biggest is that while energy markets are primed for a busy season after the and seasons most hurricane seasons do not produce lengthy outages or significant physical damage to assets that means that even if equities surge on initial storm headlines the gains will vanish once the market realizes the storm is a nonevent another wild card is how energy equities will be affected by the recent uncertainty in the broader market most experts see the buying trends as a reliable barometer for at least as far as momentum buying "i would tend to expect the same thing at least on a short range basis " said james halloran an energy investor with national city private client group in ohio "if you get a really bad storm the perception is you will want to be in the stocks that repair things" and then those that are leveraged directly to the commodities such as producers and refiners "its essentially symmetrical " art smith chief executive of energy consultant john s herold inc said of the risk reward effects from hurricanes on petroleum subsectors in other words while integrated giants like chevron and exxon mobil garnered only modest valuation gains in their declines were tempered when the season produced no major storms helping to push energy commodity prices and most energy equities lower one critical difference this year compared with is the brittle state of natural gas markets natural gas storage levels currently sit above the five year average an overhang that has some market watchers fretting that producers and many oil services equities could plummet if the hurricane season is uneventful "meaningful shut ins " or production outages will be needed to address the glut in the current gas market said david pursell a principal at tudor pickering &amp co securities inc otherwise "gas is going lower " mr pursell said if major storms do hit this year oil field contractors that repair infrastructure will likely have to rejigger their operations to meet new demands oceaneering which inspects offshore pipelines and supplies remotely operated vehicles among other services is still removing debris and plugging well sites abandoned after the and seasons said jack jurkoshek director of investor relations "for sure were at capacity " mr jurkoshek said "we are still involved in cleanup related to ivan even now " but mr jurkoshek said some of this work would be deferred for more pressing operations from a fresh storm such as restoring production another bout of storms would instantly set new priorities in the gulf probably resulting in even higher rates for many of oceaneerings products and services he added mr jurkoshek notes that oceaneering is also a leader in some other leading oil field sectors not leveraged to hurricanes including the hot subsea business which allows production of smaller offshore fields
