warning to pakistan on monday vice president dick cheney met with pakistan president pervez musharraf on what was billed as an "unannounced" visit to islamabad yesterday during what was also supposed to be a secret trip to afghanistan a suicide bomber killed himself and up to others outside of bagram air base where mr cheney was staying at the time theres no need to accuse pakistani intelligence of tipping off the taliban about mr cheneys whereabouts to see a connection between decisions in islamabad and terrorism in bagram mr cheney reportedly delivered a stiff message to mr musharraf about the need for pakistan to deny the taliban sanctuary along its frontier with afghanistan thats a message islamabad needs to hear even if an islamabad spokeswoman did insist after mr cheneys visit that "pakistan does not accept dictation " this is not to say the musharraf government has done nothing in the fight against terror hundreds of pakistani soldiers have died fighting taliban elements and pakistani cooperation was essential in the killing or capture of such al qaeda ringleaders as khalid sheikh mohammed general musharraf has twice been the target of islamist assassination attempts but his government has been suspected of cutting deals of convenience with islamist political groups and it has formed alliances with pro taliban forces in pakistans parliament in a common front against secular democrats who might come to power if the general allowed a truly free election still worse from the u s perspective was the agreement islamabad signed in september with the taliban tribal elders and "local mujahadeen" from north waziristan that agreement allowed the taliban to operate unfettered in the province in exchange for a promise not to launch raids into afghanistan the number of raids has since more than doubled say afghan and u s military sources one immediate result is that congressional democrats including house foreign affairs chairman tom lantos are floating measures to curb u s arms sales to pakistan an echo of the pressler amendment that took effect when the first bush administration de certified pakistan as a non nuclear state nobody should want to reprise that chapter of u s pakistan relations which did nothing to stop pakistans nuclear ambitions or later its support for the taliban while denying the u s the diplomatic leverage it previously had with pakistan governments but sanctions will only become more likely if the american public sees pakistan as an enabler of the taliban in its campaign to destabilize the karzai government in kabul and kill americans including the vice president policing its long and mountainous border with afghanistan has exacted a high price in pakistani lives and treasure failing to police it may exact a higher one see related letter "letters to the editor theres no alliance with taliban forces" wsj march
