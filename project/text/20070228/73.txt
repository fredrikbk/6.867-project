cultures and their lives in the wake of a crisis or is it always one or the other in asia sentinel a hong kong based online journal of politics and society antonio graceffo describes how the lives of thailands nomadic moken people were upended by the tsunami in late and the influx of aid that followed while the embrace from the developed world brought stability and much needed services such as health care to the moken it also is threatening to squeeze out traditions that defined their unique culture for hundreds of years thailands moken have lived off the andaman sea diving for sea cucumbers oysters and pearls and foraging in the jungle for potatoes in the rainy season their hand to mouth existence attracted international attention when nearly all of the moken on the western coast survived the tsunami having fled to higher ground when their familiarity with the sea helped them detect the oncoming waves the tsunami destroyed many of the mokens coastal settlements and houseboats aid groups responded delivering relief supplies and eventually a government funded school visiting doctors and a reservation in surin island near phuket where moken families now live while some of the assistance was welcomed the rapid changes have hampered the mokens ability to sustain their language animistic religion and sea based economy the moken never ate rice a thai staple before the tsunami but it became a part of their diet when introduced in relief rations that has prompted the once largely self sufficient culture to seek ways to generate cash such as selling handicrafts to tourists to pay for rice supplies as a sign of halting adaptation parents now send their children to the new school which also has become an invaluable source of health advice but moken children are taught to read and write in thai instead of in the unwritten moken language "the tsunami didnt kill them but it remains to be seen how much longer they can survive as a people " mr graceffo says asia
