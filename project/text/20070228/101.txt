real estate professionals say irs snares them by mistake some real estate professionals say they are being mistaken for part time investors by the internal revenue service and that could prohibit them from taking advantage of certain tax and economic benefits consider the case of david friedman a real estate broker and property owner in los angeles like many professionals in the business he not only sells homes to consumers he also buys and sells undeveloped land and owns single family homes that he rents out he says he works every day and has amassed holdings in southern california and oklahoma that are valued at &# million yet after years in the business mr friedman finds himself in a battle with the irs which is auditing his past tax returns over whether he is really a full time real estate professional or one of the many part time real estate investors who have sprung up across the country in the past decade "real estate is all that i do im not a contractor or a doctor who does real estate on the side " mr friedman says "i just think that the irs has some issues believing that someone truly does this full time " the distinction is important because full time real estate professionals defined as someone who spends more than half of his working hours in real estate and more than hours a year tending to real estate activities can fully deduct losses including depreciation interest expense on loans and property taxes but those who dont fit into that category are typically considered to be "passive" real estate investors with a limited ability to deduct their losses says alan weiner a cpa and tax partner at the firm of holtz rubenstein reminick llp in melville n y robert marvin a spokesman for the irs said that the tax agency cant comment on individual taxpayer cases however he indicated that the agency is paying more attention to real estate activity because it is one of the areas where research shows there is a large tax gap meaning the irs isnt receiving as much income as anticipated the tax gap in income from rents and royalties is about &# billion and &# billion for capital gains income from real estate activity is included in but not exclusive to both categories mr marvin said that several thousand returns of real estate professionals have been audited since last year and approximately are under audit now but some tax attorneys say these professionals are being unfairly scrutinized "unfortunately real estate professionals are being caught in a broad net that is intended to catch investors " says philip panitz a federal tax litigator in westlake village calif who represents mr friedman "my clients are real estate professionals although the irs disagrees and theyre saying prove it " of the eleven cases mr panitz has pending in the united states tax court five involve people who say they are full time real estate professionals whom the irs is trying to reclassify as part time investors two years ago none of his cases involved this issue "whenever i see this kind of trend going on i know some sort of sweep is happening " mr panitz says the "passive loss" rule goes back to when congress added the measure to stop real estate investors who were receiving paper loss deductions such as depreciation and using these paper losses to shelter real income from other jobs mr panitz says real estate professionals were excluded from this act because real estate was their job "if that person had a deduction related to the buying and selling of property those deductions directly correlated to what they did for a living " mr panitz adds since he has been audited for mr friedman is now struggling to prove that real estate is his profession he says he has provided the irs auditor with every receipt and canceled check related to his business but they always ask for more proof he adds including detailed logs of how he spends his time a listing of all projects in which he is involved and all the people he talks to on any given day "it takes hundreds and hundreds of hours out of my time to provide all these details " he sighs "i just feel like im being harassed " it has been financially draining as well mr friedman says that in the past few years he has spent about &# in fees to his accountant and tax attorney who are helping him prove his professional status because his case is ongoing those costs could reach &# if the irs does conclude that mr friedman isnt a real estate professional his tax returns for the years in question would have to be adjusted and if one factors in penalties interest and tax liabilities he could end up owning the government hundreds of thousands of dollars real estate professional or passive investor the irs advises its auditors to do the following when trying to discern whether a taxpayer is actually a real estate professional determine whether the taxpayer materially participates in one or more of such real estate trades or businesses as rental construction or leasing determine who is the real estate professional husband or wife request and closely examine the taxpayers documentation regarding time scrutinize other activities the taxpayer is engaged in to determine whether claimed time makes sense source irss passive activity loss audit technique guide
