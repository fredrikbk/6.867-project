a photographer comes into sharper focus henri cartier bressons scrapbook international center of photography through april new york henri cartier bresson was a catch and release photographer the art as he saw it was to capture however briefly and in a black and white rectangle the dynamic elements of a glimpsed reality before it vanished forever "the world is being created every minute " he once said "the world is falling to pieces every minute " it was enough for him to see on a contact sheet that here and there he had caught life on the fly he kept score of his successes with red grease pencil and didnt need so much to have the image blown up and mounted on a wall the trophy was knowing that once in a while he had outwitted the fugitive world as you visit "henri cartier bressons scrapbook photographs " the superb show that runs through april at the international center of photography here it helps to keep in mind how much he valued process over product otherwise you may be disappointed that almost all of the nearly prints on the walls and in the vitrines are small most no more than inches by inches and of less than sterling quality cartier bresson himself denigrated his early prints of these negatives and favored later versions with more contrast the dazzlement of the scrapbook comes from the historic stature of the images not their tonal quality the examples that he pasted into an album in an item he treasured until his death in constitute one of the supreme achievements in th century photography martine franck the photographers widow and agnes sie director of the fondation cartier bresson which originated this show in paris are to be commended for bringing this material into sharper focus scholars will feast on the new information in the catalog essays for this show about the uncommonly fertile period when the young artist equipped with a sleek mm leica and under the influence of surrealism went hunting for signs of the uncanny on trips throughout europe and north america during this time in his life before he chose to earn a living from assigned stories as a member of magnum photos the independent agency he helped to found in he was pursuing no particular editorial directives his camera was simply a tool with which he uncovered a myriad of enigmatic clues to a harsh reality he circulated among the destitute sleeping in the streets and parks of paris and marseille with a trio of sexually ambiguous spaniards as one of them had a haircut in mexican brothels and within the empty staircases and squares of italian towns he was as at ease with children as with adults many of these famous pictures from the early s combine an awareness of the world wide depression with an undertone of comedy or dread that has little to do with politics the pack of boys playing in the rubble of a seville street has often been interpreted as a war image especially as one of the boys is on crutches but the date of the picture precedes the spanish civil war by three years it is perhaps more accurate to read it as being about quotidian destruction and the childish pleasures of acting out for an attentive stranger efforts to turn cartier bresson into a mere historian or reporter are doomed to fail one of the delights of the show is the group of pictures he made in london in he was asked by a magazine to photograph george vis coronation typically he came back without a single image of the king instead he focused on the crowds straining to see anything of the event and sitting around after the parade had gone by how uninhibited in their desires people look when looking is a pervasive theme in cartier bressons oeuvre he had an indulgent affection for the english and a loathing for germans portraying the throngs here as besotted but harmless in their surrender to pomp and ceremony the scrapbook was the quarry from which two celebrated exhibitions at the museum of modern art were carved the first in established cartier bresson as a guiding spirit of street photography about a dozen of the original enlargements from that show which consisted of photographs have been rounded up by icp in the odd style of the time they were mounted on wood the moma show had originated as a posthumous homage as the museums photography curator beaumont newhall and his wife nancy believed that cartier bresson had been killed in in fact from to he was a prisoner of war in occupied france until escaping on his third attempt and hiding out with forged papers on a farm in the loire valley the family that sheltered him was not so fortunate an informer betrayed them to the gestapo and all but the farmers wife perished at buchenwald the vitrines at icp feature correspondence with the newhalls a article from the new york post welcoming the photographer to new york a laudatory essay on his work by lincoln kirstein as well as his membership card in the free french an unusual series of pictures on the last wall shows the interrogation in august of the actor sacha guitry suspected later cleared of being a german collaborator many of the scrapbook images also appeared in another landmark moma show organized in by peter galassi that studied the exceptional period of cartier bressons career when he was first realizing the potential of small camera photography and his own eye "in a white streak of invention he proved that a photographer can handle the world as freely as a sculptor handles clay " mr galassi has written his indifference to the craft of printing has made cartier bresson an artist best appreciated in books his prints were never highly prized by the art market in his lifetime prices for his work did not crack the &# barrier until a large late print of "on the banks of the marne" sold for &# at christies in scores of lesser photographers have attracted far greater sums from collectors more proof if any was needed that auctions are poor indexes of artistic worth what cartier bresson seldom lacked was acclaim or self confidence icp reminds us of this with an amusing slide show of images with his recorded commentary from always prone to fiats and aphorisms he grew more incendiary late in life often dismissing photography as inferior to drawing and playing down his own gifts no doubt this was a healthy reaction to seeing himself called a genius too many times in print "its a question of alertness " he says on the tape "it doesnt take any brains it takes sensitivity a finger and two legs " we need only turn to the scrapbook and a marvelous photograph to contradict him shot from the hip it shows his pants leg and bare foot stretched along a wall near sienna only an artist educated in the distorted views of de chirico and dali would have seen a picture in this scene and he didnt even need two legs mr woodward is an arts critic in new york
