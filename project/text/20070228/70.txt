is a candid camera the key to safer teenage drivers there is a curve in the road near alexander mougins house near oxford iowa the high school senior used to like to take it hard and sharp but that was before his car was fitted with a camera capable of recording his driving habits mr mougin years old has been participating in a university of iowa study to see whether the device and the data it provides can help improve teen driving the camera attached to the rear view mirror has one lens facing the road and another aimed at the driver it runs constantly and slips into recording mode if for example the car accelerates rapidly or brakes suddenly it then preserves about seconds before and after the event that triggered it "you dont want to set it off " mr mougin says after months of taking part in the study he says "i know im a safer driver " starting tomorrow american family mutual insurance co the nations th largest car insurer will offer some of its customers the same system known as drivecam in an effort to improve driving behavior among teens a population that is particularly at risk on the roads more teenagers die in car crashes than from any other single cause customers with teenage children in indiana minnesota and wisconsin will be able to request that the system be installed in their cars free of charge parents will receive regular reports on incidents that trigger a recording which they can then review with their kids the system made by drivecam inc a privately held firm in san diego is the latest in a line of tools that can help parents track their teenagers behavior for example global positioning equipment can alert parents if a car leaves a certain area other devices can reveal driver behavior in general black boxes now standard in many new vehicles can capture data such as how fast a car is moving until now drivecams system has been used in commercial fleets the move to make these kinds of devices more available to consumers could meet resistance from those concerned about an intrusion into a once private realm american family will get aggregated data from drivecam but wont have access to information about individuals the company says it doesnt intend to watch the videos though they could be subpoenaed in a legal proceeding american family also says it will not use the data to set rates and doesnt have enough information to do so now but it doesnt rule out that possibility in the future "its going to make the kids safer drivers " says jack salzwedel the president of american family which is based in madison wis the question he says is whether families will want to have it installed "we need to see if this is something that parents can get engaged in " he says it also could be a marketing tool since parents typically buy the auto insurance and drivecam is not offered directly to individuals american family which operates in the midwest and west is the largest car insurer in wisconsin the second largest in minnesota and the fifth largest in indiana according to a m best co inc mr salzwedel sees the drivecam program as a way for the company to differentiate itself from competitors if the program reduces the number of crashes that could contribute to lower insurance payouts in the last year for which data are available nearly to year olds died on the roads according to the national highway traffic safety administration about of all crash deaths another suffered incapacitating injuries mr mougin drives about minutes each direction to and from his school near iowa city he says he used to trip the device about once a week when a light went on indicating the camera had started recording that happens rarely now he says his mother brenda confirms that at one point she saw a video of a car pulling around a farm vehicle on a gravel road and into her sons oncoming lane he braked sharply and avoided a collision "he kept calm " ms mougin says "that gives you a lot more confidence " the iowa study includes teenagers who have driven total miles in months the researchers first let the teens drive with the device but hid the light that lets a driver know the recording has been triggered after several weeks they uncovered the light and began sending results to parents those most prone to trigger a recording during the preliminary period saw a drop in safety related events after using drivecam for the next two months says daniel mcgehee director of the human factors &amp vehicle safety research division of the universitys public policy center american family hasnt committed to expanding the program to the other states where it operates the company a mutual insurer owned by policyholders has conducted or supported three studies in which teenagers who used the system curtailed driving behavior seen as risky including the iowa study its not clear whether a change in teen driving behavior from systems such as drivecam would lead to fewer crashes experts believe teens are at greatest risk during their first year of driving by themselves anne mccartt senior vice president for research at the insurance institute for highway safety says these kinds of systems "do have some potential " a video recording also could protect a teenager from blame in a crash and help establish who is liable for damages says joan claybrook president of public citizen a nonprofit group in washington d c that advocates for among other things safer roads she says it is important the device be installed on a voluntary basis to limit privacy concerns bruce moeller the chief executive of drivecam calls the system a "proactive behavior modification tool " drivecam compiles reports that analyze the video clips and compare a drivers record of triggering the camera with groups of other drivers parents in the american family program will be able to access their teens clips and reports on the internet through a password protected site steve lagman a physician in fitchburg wis says he used similar reports to talk to his son patrick who is participating in a pilot program at his school "it seems a little in the big brother realm " says mr lagman but he adds that safety considerations trumped that concern he says that since his son began using a drivecam in october he has exhibited "fewer risk taking behaviors " patrick lagman for his part says "i feel like im a better driver " and adds "im pretty close to not needing it anymore "
