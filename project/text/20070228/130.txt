two bolshoi newcomers already shine as stars washington stars may be born as much as made but a little word of mouth can help the whole process one classic case of the grapevine aiding a russian ballet star came years ago when clive barnes then dance critic of the new york times filed a diary from the u s s r about a remarkably prodigious year old named mikhail baryshnikov who had just joined leningrads hallowed kirov ballet mr barnes saw the soon to be internationally acclaimed mr baryshnikov in a leningrad ballet class and met the legendary galina ulanova in moscow a few days later the retired russian speaking soviet ballerina mentioned the "little boy" from leningrad to the english speaking mr barnes no translators were needed as the ballet critic reported it both he and ulanova just smiled some audience members at the two kennedy center matinee performances of moscows bolshoi ballet this past weekend probably came fortified with eager expectations about the star qualities of year old natalia osipova and year old ivan vasiliev the young dancers taking on the central dancing roles in "don quixote " a three act plus prologue production with roots in the glories of late th century russian ballet in a interview with time out new york alexei ratmansky the troupes artistic director had already singled out ms osipova as a talented newcomer at that time in a role sometimes called "flower girl" in act three of "don quixote " she danced unforgettably to be sure only one semiprominent solo distinguished by the challenge of successive bounding jumps anyone paying attention to news from the sometimes crass ballet competition circuit might have had an eye on mr vasiliev whos been winning at least one prize a year since he began his training at age in ukraine and studied further in belarus before coming to moscow at other ballet watchers could have heard as i did of the mark mr vasiliev was already making at the bolshoi initially as the elegantly rustic hero of frederick ashtons "la fille mal gardee" and then as basil the scampish protagonist of alexei fadeyechevs version of "don quixote " which honors the turn of the th century traditions of the work established by both st petersburgs marius petipa and moscows alexander gorsky from their initial separate entrances riding the crests of ludwig minkuss colorfully buoyant score in act one both ms osipova and mr vasiliev announced their stellar arrival with highflying spirits and higher flying steps one could readily sense the smiles of amazement flashing in the dark all through the packed audience as kitri the strong willed and carefree daughter of the opportunistic innkeeper in the cervantes inspired tale and as the impecunious but dashing barcelona barber the two winning performers now classed as soloists fourth rank from the troupes top level showed unbridled confidence and unmistakable artistry by their second entrance as a duo the standards each set individually rose twice as high and then some witnessing their artistically acrobatic duets complete with deft overhead lifts by the boyish mr vasiliev one sensed that the smiles that earlier rippled through the audience were growing broader and broader at the further embarrassment of riches on display happily these two performers arent merely young strong athletes they are lovingly schooled classical dancers and beguilingly vivid actors ms osipova has an almost doll like face complete with shining dark eyes and blue black hair with her carefully spiraled spit curls and red cupids bow mouth she suggested the wit of betty boop calmed by the luster of clara bow she may be small of stature but ms osipova dances with unbounded and almost unheard of scale "don quixote"s kitri has been played by a formidable roster of world famous ballerinas for whom jumps were a breeze at gale force velocity ms osipova all but blows away the kitris of the past the still younger mr vasiliev is another kind of charmer and a perfect foil for his ballerinas wit and physical prowess he has darting eyes as well as an expressive mouth whose overbite suggests difficulty in suppressing a smile and whose pouting lower lip speaks volumes without words unlike mr baryshnikov to whom he has been compared mr vasiliev is not ideally proportioned he has somewhat small feet and slightly stocky legs likewise the precision of his positions and the control of his dancing arent as remarkably clear and clean as mr baryshnikovs were at his outset of his career but both of these bolshoi newcomers need not invoke the names of famous predecessors to make their gifts and charisma count ms osipova the more seasoned performer here was equally compelling and enchanting in both of the performances she gave in washington mr vasiliev looked slightly nervous in his first appearance but that all but disappeared by the second it seemed as if his shot from a gun ability to bound and spin through his choreography gained hair trigger timing overnight when the soft spoken mr ratmansky was pressed in to talk about individual dancers ms osipova was the one budding ballerina he singled out even though he was then able to show her off only as "don quixote"s flower girl in washington as kitri she became both this ballets bride and a ballet world queen bee by putting mr vasiliev opposite her for two back to back matinees mr ratmansky told more than he might in words about the stars of his company the news is out and the palpable reactions all over kennedy center proved that a historic classical ballet partnership has been launched mr greskovic writes about dance for the journal
