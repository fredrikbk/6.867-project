eu delays unification of securities settlements a wall street journal news roundup brussels european union finance ministers have persuaded the european central bank to delay its plan to unify europes securities settlement system a decision had been expected in march but ecb board member gertrude tumpel gugerell said the final decision wouldnt happen then after all the "target " securities project would unite the fragmented and costly system of cross border euro zone securities trades across all countries using the common currency currently each country in europe has its own clearing and settlement house each with separate operating systems almost all finance officials and experts in the euro zone agree on the goal of a common system but finance ministers from belgium the united kingdom the netherlands and most eastern european baltic and scandinavian countries fear that target would put too much power in the ecbs hands according to a finance official who helped draft the finance ministers response to the plan national finance ministers yesterday outlined a series of concerns warning of "potential conflicts of interest" and the "legal implications of reconciling a new system with existing national jurisdictions " the main worry of critics is that the project oversteps the ecbs mandate instead of just focusing on managing the euro currency the bank would be giving itself powers over a crucial area of securities regulation another objection is that the plan could fracture the market as it would leave individual domestic settlements houses to operate such functions as custody corporate actions and asset servicing the ministers cautioned the ecb yesterday to make target voluntary for domestic settlement houses
