ahead of the tape not so fast gdp to show slower growth adding insult to yesterdays injury today investors will likely find out the economy last quarter wasnt as rosy as it appeared to be at first blush last month the commerce department reported fourth quarter gross domestic product rose at a annual clip a bevy of reports since then have shown many of the commerce departments assumptions were overly optimistic the revised gdp figure today should show the economy expanded at a rate according to economists surveyed by dow jones newswires exports consumer spending business spending and construction all look to have come in below what the commerce department originally estimated the bulk of the revision should come from slower inventory growth more of what companies sold in the period was stuff they already had lying around that meant they produced less hence lower gdp such inventory corrections as they are called can set the stage for faster growth because companies with their cupboards bare have to increase production to meet sales but such a rebound may not be in the offing this time a lot of the inventory companies worked off looks like it came from abroad says ubs economist james osullivan that means that when it comes time restock companies will be largely ramping up imports rather than domestic production without an inventory rebuilding boost and with the housing market continuing to weigh on the economy gdp growth is probably off to a slow start this year mr osullivan says a recession doesnt look likely but if economic growth doesnt pick up corporate profit growth may suffer leading some companies to shed workers for investors licking their wounds that isnt a welcome prospect are loans a safe bet amid credit turmoil although credit markets melted down yesterday one increasingly important slice of the lending business could prove resilient at least in the short term the loan market for companies with low quality ratings in a worst case scenario and suddenly the markets are focused on the worst case if a company cant pay its debts lenders rank higher than bondholders and are first in line for repayment when things go wrong that makes loans a good resting place for investors fleeing riskier assets such as equities and noninvestment grade bonds "loans have become the repository for scared money " says howard gellis head of debt capital markets at the blackstone group the loan market has provided the bulk of the financing for the huge buyouts of recent months and "the stampede of elephantine deals is expected to continue " wrote standard &amp poors leveraged commentary &amp data arm in a report yesterday noting that &# billion plus loans for harrahs and clear channel are expected to come to fruition soon still for investors a resting place isnt exactly the same as a safe haven if yesterdays selloff was the first sign of a larger shift in sentiment in the junk bond market at some point the loan market also would be affected private equity firms might not stop buying companies but many are already hedging their bets by starting funds focused on companies in distress in case there are no safe havens for private equity firms either henny sender send comments to justin lahart wsj com or henny sender wsj com
