politics &amp economics labor rides political wind shift previously thwarted causes advance somewhat in congress organized labor aims to use the houses expected passage tomorrow of a pro union bill to further the rest of its legislative agenda even though the bill under heated industry opposition faces likely defeat in the senate the employee free choice act would make it easier to organize workers by giving them the right to unionize as soon as a majority signs cards in favor of a union a process known as "card check" that can take a few weeks the typical secret ballot election can drag on for months and is often slowed further by charges of labor law violations union officials see the bill as a key to stemming a decline in membership and correcting a perceived weakening of workers rights under the bush administration today unions represent of the nations private sector work force down from in the s although passage is expected in the house where it has co sponsors the bill is expected to face a filibuster in the senate in large part because of intensifying objections from employer and industry groups in the past two days the national association of manufacturers sent two letters to members of congress saying that the association would use tomorrows vote in determining its future support for lawmakers the association argues the bill "further erodes the competitive capabilities of american manufacturers " a coalition representing more than state and local employer groups also is lobbying against the bill and the u s chamber of commerce said it has sent more than emails to members of congress to oppose it the last minute flurry of opposition also is an attempt to discourage a potential compromise that could involve dropping the card check provision while keeping provisions that make arbitration mandatory if a first contract isnt reached between a union and an employer and assess stiffer penalties to employers who violate labor law during organizing drives "theres always the danger that someone in the senate will see themselves as a deal maker and do something like that " said randel johnson vice president for labor policy at the u s chamber of commerce the chamber and other business groups would fight the binding arbitration portion of the bill just as hard as the card check rule he said beyond the pending vote the increasing resistance from business groups also indicates their concern about labors closer ties to lawmakers since the fall election democratic lawmakers are planning to propose efforts in coming months to expand sick leave coverage introduce bills on workplace safety on retirement security and a bill that would effectively reverse a national labor relations board decision last year on the supervisory status of workers these measures have been on labors legislative agenda and opposed by business groups "its going to be a long two years " said mr johnson organized labor isnt expected to give up on the employee free choice act and the fact the measure is up for a vote at all and likely to receive approval from a full house is a victory for organized labor a year ago a house vote on the measure was unthinkable to many union officials now the campaign represents one of labors biggest pushes in decades many union leaders are looking ahead to the presidential race and saying that in they will only back candidates who supported the bill at the same time labor wants to move quickly on other measures while it has the limelight and momentum from an expected house victory anna burger secretary treasurer of the service employees international union said it is crucial to get congress to act on issues such as health care and immigration reform now "i think theres a move both in the house and the senate to get something done on immigration reform by june " she said "i think that this is the moment " next week leaders of the afl cios affiliate unions plan to announce details on a bankruptcy overhaul bill which would make it harder for companies to walk away from wage and benefit obligations when filing for bankruptcy court protection as well as a strategy to deny renewal of the presidents fast track authority on trade agreements when they meet at their winter conference in las vegas meanwhile many individual unions are seeking more specialized legislation the international brotherhood of teamsters for example is seeking a legislative fix to stop a pilot program started last week that gives mexican trucks greater freedom to travel throughout the u s the union is demanding hearings on the program "were going to do everything we can to get this ridiculous pilot program stopped " said leigh strope a teamsters spokeswoman there also will be a renewed push by labor to get the stalled minimum wage increase signed into law labor leaders have tried to position the employee free choice act as helping to bridge the widening income gap which they said is connected to the steep decline in union membership "the single best opportunity for working women and men to get ahead economically is to come together with their co workers to form a union " said john sweeney president of the afl cio yet business groups have called the bill undemocratic because it gives workers the option of skipping a secret ballot election and could lead to unfair pressure by unions they have also attacked the unions for having a double standard noting that unions want to keep a secret ballot process when it comes to the process of decertifying a union some labor experts have said the employer argument is misleading because it doesnt take into account the context in which many union elections are held as workers may be pressured by employers "cuba has secret ballot elections if you think those are democratic then you might think these union elections are democratic " said harley shaiken a labor expert at the university of california at berkeley who testified in favor of the bill in recent congressional hearings despite the battle over this legislation there may be areas including health care and immigration reform where business and labor may be willing to compromise on legislation a bill on immigration is expected to reach the senate in march while a number of business and union leaders have joined together to work to reduce the number of uninsured americans there is little consensus at the federal level on what approach to take
