investors seek safety of treasurys china triggered selloff damages junk bonds as dow drops investor fear that pressured stocks also spilled into bond markets breaking months of calm as investors sold down a spectrum of corporate emerging market and other debt and flocked instead to the safety of treasury bonds that drove up treasurys prices pushing down the yield on the benchmark year treasury note by percentage point to a level last seen in mid december meanwhile in the stock market the dow jones industrial average finished points or lower as part of a global selloff that began with a pullback in chinas red hot stock market as treasurys rose junk bond prices tumbled sending their yields higher the gap between average yields on junk bonds and treasury bonds increased by percentage point to around percentage points as buyers demanded higher returns to take on the risk of holding these assets prices on investment grade bonds also dropped sending their yields higher and the cost of insuring all sorts of corporate debt rose in the credit default swap market among the bonds that were hardest hit were those issued by general motors corp and ford motor co which would be especially vulnerable to an economic slowdown or an increased unwillingness of creditors to lend prices on some bonds issued by wall street investment banks like merrill lynch &amp co and bear stearns cos also took hits they could suffer if the markets keep sinking prices on some bonds issued by countrywide financial and residential capital mortgage lenders also tumbled taken together the sharp moves in credit markets were a potentially important signal that investors are starting to reassess their appetite for risky assets like junk bonds which are issued by the least credit worthy companies or emerging market debt which has traditionally been volatile bond markets have experienced hiccups in the past including a swoon last spring only to bounce back but some analysts had been arguing recently that the appetite for junk bonds below investment grade loans and other risky forms of debt had become overdone in recent months over the course of the past six months interest rates on corporate bonds had fallen to just a hair above treasury bonds suggesting that investors think corporate bonds are only slightly riskier than treasurys the difference between corporate junk bond yields and treasurys the so called spread moved to its narrowest point in a decade and helped fuel a record buyout boom since financing had become so cheap and because of easier fund raising by companies themselves yesterdays move wiped out about a months worth of that move "were seeing a wave of risk aversion hitting the markets in a very broad way " said laura ostrander a bond fund manager at columbia management in boston a confluence of events appeared to trigger the move including a plunge in stock prices in shanghai which set off fears of turmoil in emerging markets mounting problems in the u s subprime mortgage industry were another factor subprime mortgages are offered to the least credit worthy homeowners an index called the abx which is derived from bonds backed by these mortgages has tumbled more than in the past few weeks suggesting subprime mortgage bonds could drop in value in the coming months because of rising defaults in the pools of loans backing them until yesterday credit market turmoil was largely confined to the subprime market but that might also be changing remarks from former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan earlier in the week about investors apparent disregard for risk had already jolted the market mr greenspan who spoke to a business conference in hong kong via a satellite link monday said that risk premiums on financial assets were "extraordinarily low" and that this could pose problems in the future risk premiums on corporate and emerging bonds are typically measured by the difference between their spreads over treasurys mr greenspan said he found the appetite for financial risk "disturbing " underlying the buoyant conditions in credit markets that preceded yesterdays selloff was an ocean of cash that had been finding its way into risky assets in the past few years large gobs of it from hedge funds institutional investors and foreign investors looking for high returns on their money "it feels like theres a pullback in the abundant liquidity in credit and is a reminder of how weve been in a very blissful period for riskier assets " said paul scanlon a junk bond manager at putnam investments in boston "if this changes a bit it will have wide ramifications " until yesterday there had been little evidence that the wave of money or the appetite for risk was ebbing some recent events could change that as mortgage lenders run into trouble with their subprime loans many are tightening lending standards for weaker borrowers that may curtail the spending of some consumers and affect the economy in the longer run and if stock markets locally and overseas continue to fall investors may stop pouring money into riskier assets or demand significantly higher returns for them a counter to the risk aversion on the other hand could come from central banks if market turmoil continues the federal reserve and other central banks could be expected to come to the rescue by pushing short term interest rates lower the fed fund futures market signaled just that pricing in a high likelihood that u s central bankers would slash the overnight funds rate to this year down from its current level in recent weeks the market had been predicting the federal reserve would cut its fund rate by a quarter point in late or early now the futures investors are pricing in a roughly chance of a quarter point cut in june and another quarter point cut in october "we havent seen the market rethink its outlook for fed policy this dramatically since hurricane katrina in september of " said jim bianco of bianco
