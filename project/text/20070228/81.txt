monitoring your heart via the internet fda to review one of the first in a wave of new implants that track vitals wirelessly is american medicine ready for a device thats surgically implanted costs thousands of dollars but delivers absolutely no therapy that question will be on the table tomorrow when a food and drug administration advisory panel considers whether the fda should approve one of the first of a coming wave of implantable sensors now being developed specifically the agency is set to review a diagnostic only device called the chronicle from medtronic inc that would be used by very sick patients with heart failure in hopes of keeping them out of the emergency room the device known as a "hemodynamic monitor " is designed to measure pressure inside the heart along with body temperature and heart rate the information is transmitted wirelessly via the internet to a doctors office there medical personnel can tell for example if the patient is quickly building up fluids that could pool in the lungs a potentially life threatening situation depending on the patients condition and how hectic the doctors office is the device could be set to send reports weekly or even once or twice daily the device doesnt send alerts in an emergency so the doctor must check the data on a regular basis a number of companies are developing implantable sensors that could have far flung applications st jude medical inc in st paul minn cardiomems inc in atlanta and israel based remon medical technologies inc are all developing or testing such devices for a number of conditions for patients with aneurysms sensors could be implanted to see if pressure is building up in these ballooned arteries such pressure if uncorrected can cause the artery to burst causing death or disability sensors are also being developed for use in patients with hypertension or high blood pressure a cardiomems filing with the securities and exchange commission says the company is applying its endosure wireless sensing technology which is used during aneurysm repair procedures for longer term monitoring of patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure and medtronic already is selling an implanted device called the reveal that measures heart rhythms in an effort to explain mysterious episodes of fainting the company says sales have been modest "this is a new era in device therapy " says leslie a saxon chief of cardiovascular medicine at the university of southern california and one of the researchers in the medtronic study "this heralds an era of body computing in which we can tailor medical therapy" based on continuous measurements from within patients megan moynahan chief of the pacing defibrillators and leads branch in the fdas device center says the agency is seeing a "growing interest in implantable diagnostics in general " but reviewing devices that are diagnostic only and deliver no direct treatment requires "a different way of thinking " she says evaluating devices such as pacemakers which provide direct and obviously needed therapy is more straightforward the fda will generally want to see evidence that the diagnostic devices through their effect on physician and patient actions actually improve medical outcomes ms moynahan says in the case of the chronicle the fda will consider whether medtronic has proven that the information the device amasses will actually help patients enough to warrant approval there are five million people in the u s and more than million world wide with congestive heart failure a condition in which the heart has lost significant pumping power blood and other fluids build up first in the arteries later pooling elsewhere in the body patients are treated with drugs including diuretics ace inhibitors and beta blockers even a meal like pizza chinese food or anything with lots of salt can cause a massive fluid buildup with the chronicle implant in theory doctors could see this happening early and could call the patient and change drug dosage or diet to avert a dire episode implantation of the matchbox sized device would carry the same infection and bleeding risk as installing a pacemaker but its fairly simple surgery the device is placed under the skin in the upper chest with a wire leading to the heart in medtronics patient study of the chronicle there was a reduction in combined heart failure related "endpoints" hospitalizations and emergency and urgent care visits but the reduction wasnt considered statistically significant meaning it could have been due to chance such a statistical shortfall can be fatal to a products chances for approval other trends in the study were positive however among the patients with moderately advanced heart failure who were not the most severely ill in the study there was a reduction in hospitalizations and other events james b young chairman of the division of medicine at the cleveland clinic and an investigator in the medtronic study says "in specific and select patients it can be very useful this is not a device that should be put willy nilly into any patient with heart failure " chronicle is merited for a relatively small group of heart failure patients says dr young those who have a serious form of "brittle" heart failure with fluctuations of symptoms and a tendency to retain fluids the device also could raise novel questions about how heart doctors would get compensated for monitoring chronicles data would medicare for instance pay for long distance advice traditionally the program hasnt paid for tele medicine because of concerns that such intangible care could be financially abused
