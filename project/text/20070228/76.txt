manufacturers face consumer confusion over tv technology anyone who thinks consumers understand high definition television should consider a recent survey by leichtman research group it concluded that close to one half of the million households with hdtvs dont actually watch high definition programs because they havent obtained the necessary hardware from their cable phone or satellite operators and about one half of those viewers about six million dont even realize theyre not watching hdtv bruce leichtman the market research firms president figures the confusion is partly because the consumers spend so much money on the set they cant believe theyre not getting what they paid for "this is cognitive dissonance " he says the forward march of consumer electronics of course is replete with examples of technology outpacing the ability of average users to understand it look no further than the success of the "for dummies" series of how to technology books most consumers surveys show use only a small fraction of the features on their various devices but the history of digital tv has been particularly tortured in addition to the usual false starts and over promising the technology has been hampered by political quagmires battles at all levels of the tv industry misleading ads and far too little consumer education the problem is bound to get worse as we near the february digital transition deadline when all broadcasters must transmit entirely in digital rather than analog signals in the meantime sales are rising as the price of flat panel hdtv sets fall below &# there were million hdtvs sold last year according to the consumer electronics association the failure of so many hdtv owners to figure out what theyve actually bought is bad for everyone after years of dragging their feet tv networks finally are investing heavily to produce shows in high definition but these investments arent going to pay off anytime soon if of the hdtv owners arent set up for hd viewing retailers and manufacturers complain of unacceptably high rate of returns though they wont disclose specific figures consumers get discouraged when the picture that transfixed them at the store isnt the same at home "its getting a porsche and driving it at down a straight highway " says blaine altaffer a senior buyer for circuit city "you want speed and a crooked highway " consumer ignorance is understandable it used to be buyers needed only to bring a new set home plug it into a cable or satellite hookup and flop back on the couch now they first must choose either an hdtv set or a standard definition digital set that has a lower price tag and inferior picture quality all hdtv sets are digital but not vice versa then they must make sure theyre getting high definition service from their cable or satellite operator which typically costs more after that they have to lease a high definition set top box and make sure its set up right after all that preparation viewers still can make the mistake of watching the wrong channel cable and satellite systems now carry both hdtv channels and regular channels for the same networks such as espn and cbs some consumers get confused when they see the "broadcast in high definition" bug written across the regular channel they think theyre watching hdtv adding to the complexity device makers have been fighting over whats better plasma or liquid crystal display screens even worse if consumers want a high definition dvd player they must choose between blu ray and hd dvd formats naturally discs for one dont play on the other in the heat of battle information is often the first casualty take the current tv commercials with the "back to the future" theme being broadcast by directv it boasts that the satellite operator has a "future" of channels and soon will have three times more high definition capacity than cable it neglects to say that in many smaller markets directv subscribers still wont be able to get hd signals from local abc cbs nbc and fox affiliates unless they set up an over the air antenna but there are signs of hope a major consumer education effort on the digital transition is set to be announced today by the largest industry trade groups representing broadcasters cable operators device manufacturers networks and retailers there will be the obligatory new web site then extensive research and focus groups organized to figure out consumers needs some manufacturers are ahead of the game panasonic last year launched a customer service line dubbed the "plasma concierge program" for flat screen buyers at the same time best buy began giving customers discounts of up to &# to get the right hardware and setup to watch hdtv that reduced returns by several percentage points says michael vitelli a best buy senior vice president "employees have been telling us that customers come in and do not understand this technology " he says "were trying to make sure that the customer does the right thing " send email to peter grant wsj com
