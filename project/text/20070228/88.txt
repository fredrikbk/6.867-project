to move its stock listing to archrival nasdaq stock market inc "youve got to justify this " mr thain told e trade president jarrett lilien according to a person familiar with the meeting mr lilien did the nyse had balked at pushing its listed companies to use e trade to manage their employee stock option plans a big opportunity for the brokerage firm by contrast nasdaq had agreed to market the product to its listed companies after e trade jumped ship mr thain fired the brokerage firm as the administrator for the exchanges employee stock plan the kerfuffle provides a glimpse into the battle between the nyse and nasdaq for listings which has intensified since both exchanges went public in recent years "theyre at war " says andrew fishman president of brokerage firm schonfeld group the stakes are high listings bring about &# million in annual revenue to the big two u s stock exchanges from fees paid by listed companies each year based largely on the size of the company and shares outstanding they dont require much cost public companies need to list somewhere and for big firms these two exchanges are pretty much the only game in town but with the dearth of big u s initial public stock offerings listings are increasingly hard to find as a result the two exchanges have tried hard to differentiate their sales pitches to attract listings the technology friendly nasdaq offers lower listings fees and services like distributing news releases and setting up investor conference calls the nyse leans on its history and prestige along with an international presence that would expand with the pending deal to acquire european exchange operator euronext nv it has even waived the fee of up to &# that companies transferring in are usually required to pay nasdaq also scrapped its fee for transfers last year companies switched market allegiances four bolting from the nyse and leaving the nasdaq thats up from nine switches in with four leaving the nyse and five departing the nasdaq the activity has picked up in recent years the first time an nyse listed company decided to leave for the nasdaq was in ten more left between to including e trade and liberty media corp the nyse says the numbers are misleading it argues that some smaller companies left because they had fallen below nyse listings standards which are more stringent than the nasdaqs and the big board is still the dominant venue snagging more than nasdaq companies since in recent months it has lured several nasdaq listed companies including insurer safeco corp and retailer american eagle outfitters inc scheduled to transfer march today oil and gas producer petrohawk energy corp is expected to announce it is moving its shares from nasdaq too to land a software company it viewed as a potential listing switch red hat inc the big board spent eight months lobbying its top management it had ramped up its internal spending on red hat products and nyse president catherine kinney flew out to the companys raleigh n c headquarters to tout the benefits of a listing the firm pressed the big board to waive its six figure initial listing fee "we were part of the reason that happened " says charlie peters red hats chief financial officer further intensifying the scramble for each others listings is a coming regulatory change for years the two exchanges have been governed by different trading rules as a result switching has often caused headaches for investors but next month regulatory rules will begin applying the same basic trading principles to the way orders are prioritized on both nasdaq and nyse listed stocks still some on wall street are critical of the nasdaqs move to push products such as the e trade employee stock plan program of its listed firms "its potentially problematic " says jamie selway an executive at brokerage firm white cap trading in new york "the risk is that they elevate the interest of one customer over another " nasdaq officials say the e trade arrangement isnt exclusive and that it will help direct new public companies to a potentially useful service "were trying to provide everything you need to be a public company " says bruce aust nasdaqs head of listings the big board for its part has no plans to follow suit "we have a different philosophy " says noreen culhane the big boards executive vice president in charge of listings the nyse offers some services to companies but believes the companies want to pick other vendors without the exchanges interference the nyse also says its "specialists" the trading firms matching buy and sell orders on the big board floor help lower price volatility in nyse stocks while keeping listed company executives informed about how their stock trades nasdaq says the nyses model has become less effective because the specialist firms have lost market share in the trading of nyse listed stocks as electronic platforms have gained favor stock swaps with big money and prestige at stake the
