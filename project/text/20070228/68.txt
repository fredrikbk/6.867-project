in east java a scientist tackles deadly mud flow engineers drop the ball and hope it helps stanch volcanos stubborn leak sidoarjo indonesia since may geophysicist satria bijaksana and fellow researchers have been wrestling with a big engineering problem trying to slow the flow of boiling mud from a volcano that suddenly appeared in rice paddies near this town in east java using a pulley system erected over the mouth of the crater which is yards across they have begun dropping big concrete balls tied together with chain link into the ooze the balls weighing pounds per set go in four at a time when the project is finished in about eight weeks they will have dumped in more than balls this is just the latest in a series of attempts to stanch the flow which began may and has been spewing as much as million cubic feet of mud a day the mud has covered an area of square miles destroying four villages and factories it has caused people to leave their homes and has submerged the areas main toll road a gas pipeline exploded under the weight of the mud in november killing people now the mud threatens to cut off a railroad line that runs to surabaya indonesias second largest city after jakarta the mud volcano nicknamed "lusi" by local residents also has thwarted nearly all efforts to contain it lusi is the contraction of the indonesian word for mud and the town of sidoarjo last year one of a number of levees built by the indonesian government since the eruption was breached pumping the mud into a river that runs to the sea hasnt kept up with the flow relief wells dug to absorb it collapsed mr bijaksana hopes the concrete balls will cause enough interference the chain links are designed to add friction that the mud will coagulate rather than run mr bijaksana spent last week directing workers as they hung a steel cable across the crater the balls are hoisted across the cable to the middle of the crater where they are cast as much as feet into the abyss "i believe this is the most important moment of my life " says the year old mr bijaksana who has spent weeks working in the tropical heat "we would like to contribute to solving the problem " heading off volcanic eruptions is usually the stuff of hollywood movies see the film "volcano " in which tommy lee jones saves los angeles by diverting a lava flow into the pacific ocean here much damage has already been done mr bijaksana who has a ph d degree in rock magnetism from canadas memorial university of newfoundland and two colleagues started looking at the problem out of curiosity last year then persuaded their employer the bandung institute of technology to grant them time off from teaching duties to analyze it one member of the team has worked with foreign oil companies mapping underground rock layers the third is a german trained expert in the properties of rocks for mr bijaksana the project is part of a lifelong passion for volcanoes which run the length of indonesia growing up in the hill town of bandung which is ringed by volcanoes he was attracted at an early age to a career as a geophysicist "volcanoes became normal for me " mr bijaksana says working from a laboratory at their institute the scientists created a mock up of the crater using plastic sheeting and a hose pipe in august mr bijaksana hit on the plan to use balls inches in diameter which they hope will curtail the flow but also allow some water to get through so as to avoid a massive pressure buildup the team traveled to the site of the disaster in december to make a presentation to the government initially the head of the emergency team trying to deal with the mud was skeptical mr bijaksana recalls officials feared that meddling with the vent the mud flows from could prompt an eruption elsewhere threatening thousands of people who still live near the site to allay that concern mr bijaksana and his colleagues made two small holes in a fruit juice carton then filled it with water blocking one hole they showed how the flow rate from the second hole was unaffected even though the amount of water coming out had decreased the point of this demonstration if one vent in the volcano is blocked the pressure on other vents wont increase and the overall amount of mud will decrease the government hired them for an eight week project budgeted at &# "we dont know if this will work " says rudy novrianto a spokesman for the governments team "but in the laboratory they could do it " some elements of the original plan such as dropping the balls from a helicopter were turned down as too dangerous but there are risks galore last weekend the pulley cables broke in the heat and had to be repaired yesterday operations were again postponed because of heavy monsoon rains displaced villagers demanding government compensation have recently blockaded roads near the site skeptics say the scientists cant possibly know enough about what is happening under the mud to succeed nobody knows exactly where the main vent is located at the bottom of the large mud filled crater for instance and the fear persists that if the main vent is blocked another could open richard davies an expert in mud volcanoes at durham university in england visited the site last month he says the juice box experiment is a bad analogy he prefers comparing the plan to blocking a hose pipe at its end ultimately the water will burst through another part of the pipe "if the pressure builds up it will take the next easiest route out " he says no one knows for certain what caused the mud volcano to erupt last may one local mining company pt lapindo brantas was exploring for gas in the area of the disaster indonesias president susilo bambang yudhoyono has ordered the company to pay &# million in compensation to villagers who have lost their homes and to help the government pay for its emergency operations a team of british scientists led by mr davies recently concluded that drilling without a protective steel casing caused rocks to fracture allowing mud and water to work their way to the surface but lapindo part of the business empire of a wealthy cabinet minister aburizal bakrie denies any wrongdoing the mud flow it contends was the result of a major earthquake centered several hundred miles west of here two days earlier that created fissures in the earth mr bijaksana acknowledges that "were facing something we know very little about" but says he is more focused on stopping the flow than in determining the cause "few people are interested in solving this problem " he says "most people are trying to find whos to blame "
