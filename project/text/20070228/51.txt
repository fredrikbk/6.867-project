fiscally fit a hectic childhood terris family ponders whether her son has too many activities or not enough online edition many parents these days wonder if theyre overscheduling their kids activities so many play dates to plan sports teams to join violin lessons to take for a long time my husband gerry and i didnt worry about this our seven year old son gerald is one of the least scheduled kids we know he meets with a school tutor twice a week and plays baseball and soccer twice a week when those sports are in season on weekends he spends much of his time riding his bike and playing with friends in the neighborhood many of geralds friends are much busier some stay at home moms like my friend diane schedule regular play dates during the week and a few of my friends have their kids participating in a number of extracurricular activities both because the kids seem to enjoy them and because they hope it will give the kids a leg up come college admission time for instance my friend lisas daughter is on her high schools track team and is her schools student treasurer gerry and i work full time and geralds homework takes up an increasingly large portion of our evenings so we werent eager to add another scheduled activity to our routine nor were we excited about another scheduled expense depending on which activity we choose we could be adding another &# to &# to our weekly budget our parents have been on our side gerrys dad and my mom are constantly urging us to let gerald play on his own "let my grandson be a kid a while longer " my mom often says she also worries about gerry and me adding yet another responsibility to our already overcrowded daily to do lists my father in law emigrated from ireland and thinks americans spend too much time and money getting their kids involved in activities "why do you feel the need to keep the child constantly entertained " he asks "let him be " and hes outraged by what sports cost last season gerry made the mistake of griping to his dad that geralds baseball team registration cost &# and at least one parent was required to support the league by helping out as an assistant coach or working the concession stand his father told us we were crazy despite all this gerry and i decided that another activity for gerald is a good idea on days when his friends arent home he too often plays video games to pass the day and were thinking about the future noting that the level of a students involvement in extracurricular activities is weighed as heavily as test scores by college admissions officials this journal article details which activities colleges find most desirable having come around to the idea gerry and i talked for months about signing gerald up for an activity but we couldnt agree on which one gerry thought studying martial arts would help gerald improve his discipline which might help him concentrate on his schoolwork and that in turn might eliminate the need for tutoring martial arts also offered some practical advantages the studio is less than five minutes from our home and the cost was fairly low &# for a first month of lessons then &# for two lessons a week i wanted gerald to learn a musical instrument our sons always been a very musical child which is no surprise as a young man his grandfather sang and played tin whistle and irish flute in a band i thought learning a celtic instrument such as the irish flute or bodhran might tie gerald more tightly to his irish heritage and forge a deeper bond with his grandfather my father in law was all for it but didnt think he had the patience to teach gerald an instrument finding traditional irish music instructors in our area wasnt easy a google search turned up one irish music and dance school about miles from our home with classes only on thursday evenings the cost &# a week after a &# registration fee not to mention the added stress of getting to and from class then squeezing in time for homework dinner and geralds bedtime routine and then theres the dreaded practicing we finally decided to let gerald choose and when asked he didnt hesitate "piano i really want to learn how to play the piano " one of his christmas presents was an electronic keyboard that can be rolled up and carried anywhere wed heard him pounding away on it in the family room now and then but honestly didnt think he was that into it turns out hed been trying to teach himself how to play using the instruction booklet he liked the sound of the instrument and wanted someone to help him learn on a real piano we explained that besides taking lessons hed have to practice every day and he agreed and his decision made us both happy i was pleased hed chosen music and gerry was impressed by his determination there were a number of studios listed in the phone book under "music instruction " and i found teachers who are members of the music teachers national association here but i wanted to cut down on the amount of time i spent searching for a good teacher so i called a local music store manager and asked for his recommendations i also contacted geralds school for their advice one teacher was recommended by both sources so i gave her a call ive never had piano lessons so i relied on this interview checklist to help me make sure i was choosing the right teacher after checking her references i made an appointment for a trial lesson at her studio her fee felt a bit steep &# a lesson but i felt her teaching experience was worth it well also have additional costs for sheet music lesson books and a metronome maybe this will be a waste of money we havent started lessons yet so who knows if gerald will enjoy piano enough to stick with it but we feel like were giving him an opportunity to discover a talent that may give him lifelong joy and anythings better than videogames are kids today overscheduled with too many extracurricular activities how do you find the best balance between extracurriculars and down time write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com and then come join me in a discussion or join me and your fellow readers in a continuing discussion on last weeks column about the lack of customer service in health care some readers said they had good experiences with health care providers but many more shared stories of shoddy treatment read on for some of their thoughts as always letters have been edited health care in this country has become more like a public utility than a essential part of life there is little or no incentive for health care providers to be nice to people let alone reduce costs why should a doctor take time to explain a medical procedure or test results when they know there is little chance of you changing doctors or finding another provider wholl provide the same services at a lower cost its difficult to change doctors due to the network system that most employer provided health care plans use if you actually find a health care provider you like and the health care plan changes and is suddenly no longer in the network youre in an even worse position as long as medicare as we know it continues and the insurance companies go along with the medicare reimbursement guidelines we will be stuck in this doom loop of higher costs and lower service levels bob gitzen two patients limp into two different medical clinics with the same complaint both have trouble walking and both appear to have torn a ligament in the knee the first patient is examined within the hour x rayed the same day and has a time booked for surgery the following week the second sees his family doctor after waiting a week for an appointment then waits eight weeks to see a specialist then gets an x ray which isnt reviewed for another week and finally has his surgery scheduled for six weeks later why the different treatment for the two patients the first patient is a labrador retriever the second is a senior citizen insured by an hmo i can vouch for the labradors care i paid &# and he got first class care my wife had a broken elbow and our out of pockets costs were close to that amount but her care is best described as competent but perfunctory by the way the vets were much more sympathetic and informative with the dog then the doctors were with my wife and shes just as cute as our lab steve fleischer my primary care physician who is in a large practice has never kept me waiting more than minutes every time i see her i comment on how efficiently her practice is run that said i have a medical plan that requires me to pay the bills upfront and im reimbursed later without my plan she couldnt be my doctor because she no longer accepts most insurance plans that says to me that the kind of care im getting is quickly becoming a luxury that most people couldnt afford we recently went through a bout of family illnesses one of which involved two surgeries i cant imagine how we would have gotten through such a hideous experience without all the help and empathy the hospitals staff offered us they thought of everything from laying out snacks for folks undergoing chemotherapy to keep nausea at bay to keeping the waiting families posted on the progress of surgery perhaps part of what makes an institution work so well is the same thing that makes any other business function building a culture in which the people you serve whether you call them patients or clients are genuinely the most important concern mary mattimore my family and i are blessed with good health so we dont have to endure the experiences you describe very often but when we do i feel just as dissatisfied with the experience i find myself putting off blood tests and other health care services because i dread the waiting and poor quality of the whole experience most irritating is the rudeness of the clerical staff it seems to me that hmo plans have become the dominant means by which health care is funded and as a result patients are no longer treated like customers im not optimistic about the future but i think medical insurance needs to be redesigned to cover only major unanticipated costs such as catastrophic illnesses or injuries all other routine medical care should be paid out of pocket by the patient then wed see doctors offices cater to their customers rude and rushed doctors visits wouldnt be tolerated because patients would vote with their dollars jeff longenecker i own a pharmacy and have seen my share of scary stories the reason most health care practitioners and facilities have such bad customer service is that they have bad customers when you or your son has a procedure you are the consumer but the insurance company pays the bills health care providers dont view you as a customer therefore youre not worthy of customer service and insurance companies are a sorry lot most any provider will give you one horror story after another on how an insurance company wont pay this bill or requires this extra form to be filled out therefore since the customer insurance company is bad the customer service is as well i would love to join your crusade for better customer service in health care i feel it wont get better until everyone realizes that each person is responsible for his own care john holland i was a physician for years and can easily explain the deterioration in health care it was major reason i left the full time practice of medicine you cant minimize the constant fear of litigation involved in every aspect of medical care any bad outcome regardless of fault is a cause for investigation and potential strife with this thought always in the background patients and their families become potential adversaries rather than objects of care ive seen this factor ignored in all the proposals for how to fix health care but it is the elephant in the room this country wont have reasonably priced and quality health care with good customer service unless the threat of litigation is reduced significantly
