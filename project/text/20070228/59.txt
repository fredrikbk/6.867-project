global positioning russian deals in middle east snarl u s strategy on iran moscow sees market for arms and energy harming isolation plan as the u s struggles to contain iran and its nuclear program it is bumping into a new impediment an assertive russia bent on regaining leverage and markets in the middle east while the u s and russia tussled last autumn over a united nations resolution to rein in irans nuclear program moscow quietly moved ahead on another front it delivered more than &# million worth of air defense systems to help protect irans nuclear enrichment and research sites from attack russian officials confirmed in december the russian military then started training iranian officers to use the new systems "we dont think iran should feel itself encircled by enemies " president vladimir putin told al jazeera television earlier this month after tehran successfully tested the weaponry "the iranian people and the iranian leadership should feel that they have friends in the world " pumped up by surging oil revenues and a rebounding economy the kremlin now is keen to reclaim a prominent global role and help offset the perceived might of the u s especially in the middle east under broad pressure to engage tehran and other adversaries diplomatically the u s yesterday agreed to join in with both iran and syria in regionwide talks about iraq though washington said the scope of the talks would stay narrow in its campaign to recapture its sway in the region moscow has forgiven billions of dollars in soviet era debts and lined up lucrative energy and arms deals causing heightened concern for washington u s and israeli officials say there also are signs that russian antitank missiles are finding their way back into the hands of lebanons hezbollah militia via syria even after the kremlin promised to cut off any flow after the war last summer between israel and hezbollah russia also has broken with the u s by nurturing contacts with the palestinian militant group hamas which the u s regards as a terrorist group but the starkest example of russias new assertiveness is toward iran for months the bush administration had tried to get moscow to stop the arms sale russias biggest to iran in years for the white house and much of the arab world last summers war in lebanon served as a wake up call on irans growing role in supporting radical groups such as hezbollah the u s since then has bulked up its forces in the persian gulf and declined to rule out an attack on iran it has led a financial crackdown against irans banks and other financial entities along with the u n effort to curb irans nuclear program russia has taken a far different tack for four months last autumn moscow used its u n veto power to fight successfully against u s and european efforts to impose tough sanctions on irans nuclear program russia finally agreed in december to a much more narrowly tailored resolution that targeted only parts of irans nuclear and ballistic missile programs in january while the u s and europe were working to isolate iran and u s forces were detaining iranian officials in iraq mr putin reacted warmly to an iranian proposal for russia and iran two countries with the worlds largest reserves of natural gas to form an opec style alliance the idea drew a swift negative response from washington and europe earlier this month in a speech in germany that raised fears in the west of a new cold war mr putin said american military aggressiveness was the reason countries like iran are seeking nuclear weapons "russia is a huge problem on the iran front " says john bolton who frequently wrestled with moscow as president bushs ambassador to the u n until december "when it comes to russia and iran it is hard to say who is whose client state " current administration officials who work closely with russia arent quite so harsh but concerns over moscows intentions in the middle east as well as its overall foreign policy are rising "when it comes to iran the russians want to have their cake and eat it too " said one senior u s official "they want to look tough in working to keep iran from getting nuclear weapons while also standing in as irans friend and weapons provider " tensions are likely to sharpen again after the u n international atomic energy agency found last week that iran was adding hundreds of new centrifuges at its main nuclear research site at natanz and accelerating efforts there to enrich uranium the work is a sign to many in the west that tehran despite its protestations to the contrary is seeking to develop nuclear weapons the u s france and britain immediately called for another sanctions resolution but russia warned that it would resist any moves to hit irans economy diplomats met in london monday but have yet to negotiate details russian officials insist they share the u s goal of preventing a nuclear armed iran but russia has argued that the bush administrations confrontational approach to iran wont work and could pave the way for another war in the region the kremlin also looks at iran as an important customer for its weapons and civil nuclear technology and says economic ties give it much needed leverage over tehran moscows much softer carrot and stick approach toward iran also serves russias other goals it allows moscow to wield its leverage within the u n security council where russia is one of just five countries with veto power fending off tough economic sanctions also allows russia to continue expanding trade ties with iran while showing other regimes in the region that friendship with moscow pays geopolitical dividends the middle east is a key target market for russias nuclear power and arms exports industries that mr putin is counting on to help diversify its oil dependent economy russias global arms exports are expected to hit a record &# billion in and they are growing fast in the middle east though still far behind the u s and europe russia is also building irans only nuclear power plant which is now unopposed by the u s and european leaders at the southern port city of bushehr under a contract signed in mr putin dismisses u s sanctions on russian arms and nuclear exporters that do business with iran as efforts by the u s to engage in "unfair competition " he says the kremlin wont sell any weapons that would change the balance of power in the region with its economy growing and its foreign debts paid the kremlin is in a much stronger position to push its view and make the u s listen "russia is not claiming the role of a superpower " mr putin told al jazeera "but russia knows its own worth and we will strive to make the world multipolar " russian officials argue that harsh sanctions would only cause iran to speed up its nuclear weapons program irans nuclear sites are too well dispersed and concealed for an air attack to be successful russian officials say an assessment shared by many in washington and europe a failed assault they warn would trigger a wave of violence and instability across the entire region dwarfing the chaos in iraq and reaching into russias southern border regions already riven by separatism "we cannot subscribe to the notion that the best path to finding a long lasting and comprehensive solution lies through isolation and confrontation " says russias ambassador to the u s yuri ushakov moscow and washington have split over thorny middle east issues in the past but until recently the conflicts didnt go far as the u s prepared to invade iraq in for example the kremlin warned that washingtons confrontational approach would prove counterproductive but in the end moscow limited itself to sounding off in public as recently as after u s and israeli warnings the weapons could fall into the hands of hezbollah moscow shelved plans to sell sophisticated portable antiaircraft missiles to syria signing a deal with washington to disclose sales of those weapons in the future but now talk of a "strategic partnership" between washington and moscow has been scrapped russian officials bristle at u s criticism of mr putins crackdown on opposition at home as well as washingtons courting of russias former soviet neighbors and moves to counter efforts by kremlin controlled energy giants to expand internationally after a visit to washington this month russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told russian tv that the u s is moscows "most difficult partner " then moscow stirred a furor in washington by vehemently opposing u s plans to build a rudimentary missile defense network in europe to counteract future threats from iran moscows top military brass in language smacking of the cold war threatened to target planned u s installations in poland and the czech republic secretary of state condoleezza rice called the threat "extremely unfortunate " russian officials from mr putin on down barely disguise their relish when they highlight setbacks for u s policy in the middle east and recount moscows prewar warnings that the invasion of iraq was a bad idea "today america is viewed as the great loser in the eyes of the russian establishment " says yevgeny satanovsky president of the institute of middle eastern studies in moscow at the same time years of careful courting of iran and the arab countries of the middle east are paying off for the kremlin as political and economic ties to the region flower in a way not seen even during the cold war russia is unencumbered by the communist dogma that made the soviet union anathema in large swaths of the middle east "there are no countries in the arab world left that we have any differences with " mr putin told al jazeera before his recent trip to the region as on his other visits his delegation was packed with representatives of big russian companies looking for deals in areas like energy arms and nuclear power while western capitals routinely criticize the kremlin for rolling back democratic institutions middle eastern leaders have publicly called for mr putin to defy a constitutional ban and remain in office when his term ends next year "theres no more ideology theres just business " says mr satanovsky just how much has changed has become clear over the last year in june russia finally agreed to let the fight over irans nuclear program spill into the u n security council signing onto an incentives package that promised iran a range of trade and other concessions including direct talks with the u s if tehran suspended its uranium enrichment work but russia also made clear that it would not endorse any moves to target irans economy or to lay the ground for possible military action two weeks later at the g summit of leading nations in st petersburg mr putin hosting the summit for the first time took the floor as leaders struggled to come up with a joint response to the war then raging in lebanon according to people familiar with the meeting he recalled that in when he took office he faced what the kremlin saw as an islamist uprising in chechnya and a moribund economy promises of support from g partners proved largely empty overshadowed by criticism of russian brutality in the chechen war middle eastern countries were ultimately more supportive sending observers to vet elections after fighting subsided noting russias big muslim population and vulnerable borders near the middle east mr putin gave his bottom line he was only ready to sign on to a g statement on the middle east if it didnt hurt moscows relations with the islamic world "by one iota " things got testier in september when russia china france britain and the u s along with germany began trying to draft a u n resolution on iran russia was adamant that any sanctions be finely tuned to limit the inflow of sensitive nuclear technology and not try to hit irans economy in a broader way moscow also insisted that nothing hamper its work at the bushehr nuclear plant the bush administration initially wanted to push for a much tougher package of economic punishments even if it meant that both russia and china abstained from the measure russia in the end succeeded in keeping the u n measures as minimal as possible to win its support and left the work at bushehr unscathed despite the view of the u s and most european capitals the kremlin frequently argues that iran isnt necessarily seeking to build nuclear weapons russian officials also say they carefully restrict what kinds of weapons to sell to iran for example refusing requests for shoulder mounted antiaircraft missiles that are a favorite among terrorists the kremlin also is partly using the bushehr project as a tool to prod tehran over the nuclear program according to some western diplomats though russian officials publicly deny any connection as iran has dug in its heels on its uranium enrichment efforts moscow has repeatedly put off shipment of the fuel for the reactor just last week russian officials said problems with payments from iran which tehran denies would lead to further hang ups after the kremlin last year offered a compromise in which iran would do sensitive work with uranium fuel only with russia tehran stalled and then ignored the offer that fueled russias u n vote for sanctions which surprised tehran "they hoped until the end that russia would block or veto " says rajab safarov director of the russian iranian business council in moscow "they were horrified " yet just as swiftly russia moved to repair its ties to tehran exchanging high level visits and delivering the air defense missiles
