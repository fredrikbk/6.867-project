corporate focus business why unions cozy up to buyout kings in their march to remake global capitalism the buyout kings are encountering opposition from unions around the globe british labor leaders have branded private equity firms "casino capitalists" and "amoral asset strippers " australian unions attack the high levels of debt and low levels of transparency involved in many private equity deals and are pushing for government restrictions in the u s however labor is surprisingly restrained in its criticism one big reason union workers are on the receiving end of most private equity investments the nations public pension funds which provide benefits to unionized teachers police officers and firefighters among others have become heavyweight players in refashioning american business theyve used massive stock holdings to push public companies for more accountability and transparency and are behind the campaign to restrain ceo pay but if you watch what they do not what they say you get a very different message public pension fund money is pouring into private equity where there is little accountability to investors limited transparency and compensation levels that would make the average ceo blush according to statistics collected by private equity analyst public pension funds were the biggest source of capital for private equity firms in providing of all new money raised the largest buyout firms say the percentage they get from public pension funds is much larger than that in short a flood of public pension fund money is helping to fuel the buyout boom its also setting the stage for a political backlash when the bust inevitably arrives the &# billion buyout of texas utility txu announced this week has given american labor yet another reason to cuddle up to private equity it puts big buyout firms on the right side of the current favorite issue of the left global warming as described by its sponsors texas pacific group and kohlberg kravis roberts the deal seems almost too good to be true shareholders get a premium some rate payers get a cut the state gets its energy needs met with eight fewer coal plants than previously planned and environmental groups get another big utility committed to capping greenhouse gases and of course the buyout firms and their investors make big returns the magic that makes this all work as with most private equity deals is debt lots of it but in this case the two private equity firms also brought some hefty political muscle to the table and helped untangle a regulatory mess that had threatened to keep txu tied in knots for months to come unlike many companies that are targets for private equity txu is a well run operation the opportunities for the new owners to increase its operational efficiency are relatively scarce politically however the hard charging company had dug a hole for itself by announcing plans to build coal fired power plants apparently in hopes of getting them grandfathered if or when limits on global warming gases were implemented in the future that had earned txu the enmity of almost every environmentally aware citizen in the state it turns out that even in texas there are quite a few of them with the help of a carload of former u s cabinet secretaries the two buyout firms concocted a way to get the company out of its hole and to pacify at least the more moderate of the environmental crusaders the public pension funds that are investing with the two buyout firms werent involved in crafting the txu solution but they are certainly happy with the result arm in arm with union leaders in washington many of them have been pressuring companies to take action on global warming perhaps that makes it easier for them to overlook the fact that private equity operates on principles antithetical to everything the pension funds have been pushing on public companies there is little chance for investors to see how their money is being used and little opportunity to have any say in how companies are run the standard private equity fee structure or of funds under management plus of profits is obscenely large and executive pay levels at least in the deals that succeed can be two or three times as high as those in comparable public companies so long as the pension funds are making money they seem perfectly willing to overlook that disconnect instead they fall all over each other for the privilege of getting into the hottest equity funds but those high returns are driven in substantial measure by high debt which in turn creates high risk some day those risks may come home to roost leaving some unfortunate group of teachers and police officers and firefighters without sufficient funds to finance their retirement when that happens the buyout kings are likely to find that their new union buddies are fair weather friends alan murray welcomes reader questions and will respond at wsj com talkingbusiness
