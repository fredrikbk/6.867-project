print this newspapers are not in the intensive care unit in response to steven rattners feb editorial page commentary "red all over " on the fortunes of newspaper publishers and how our industry can best confront the challenges that face all so called old media today coming at a point when a wide range of commentators are beginning to concede just how well the newspaper sector is adapting to a digital world with increasingly mobile and multi tasking audiences we beg to differ with many of mr rattners conclusions even the headline suggestive of companies hemorrhaging money belies the all too common short term focus on quarterly results and month target prices that mr rattner and many of his investment industry peers are fixated upon the truth is that even under competitive pressure in a fragmented media world newspapers deliver compelling cash flow and attractive profit margins and contrary to his assertions newspapers are not uniquely subject to the changing perspectives advertisers have with mass media most importantly the creative thinking he says publishers need to employ is now being done on a very large scale with newspaper web sites user generated content youth and ethnic publications and increased lifestyle coverage that are all attracting and retaining readership there is certainly a wealth of ownership models that can make sense for newspapers and for journalism in general were frankly agnostic in that regard but we really cant see how a quasi public ownership funding model which pushes us toward the slippery slope of "state run media" presents any real solution the recent debates over political influences on pbs and the corporation for public broadcasting should be cautionary tales further the type of creative thought and investment needed to thrive in a more competitive world isnt going to come from public ownership and a smart investor like mr rattner surely knows that here is something mr rattner missed if the federal government would remove the s era ban on newspaper ownership of broadcast stations in the same market the public would receive more local news and information and newspapers could distribute their locally generated content over additional platforms in a cost efficient manner removal of this obsolete ban would help newspapers and local broadcasters and this additional investment in local news would be a net plus for local audiences theres not much new investment in local news these days john f sturm president and ceo newspaper association of america vienna va mr rattner meticulously examines the wallpaper the carpet and all the furniture in the room without ever mentioning the elephant "mainstream" newspapers are almost uniformly liberal or left wing in their editorial orientation the same is true of major network tv result disillusioned readers abandon their papers in droves and circulation drops this is not the sole explanation and all the other factors mentioned by mr rattner contribute as well but to leave this key fact out is dishonest job luning prak tucson ariz steven rattner bemoans the decline of the american newspaper and offers some creative solutions heres another suggestion if editors reduced the bias of the press maybe more people would come back to it the problem with newspapers such as the new york times is that they tell you what they want you to know not what you should know last august i did a nexis search of the times i plugged in "abu ghraib" and found stories that referenced it then i searched for references to a number of the killing fields such as "mahawil" and "hatra " where saddam husseins genocidaires murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent people i turned up a total of seven stories thomas f berner new york when i pick up my local newspaper a tribune paper all i need to do is read the headlines in section a and i know how the story will be framed it will have a liberal bias and wont mention any other "side" of the story it will be negative toward the current administration and hostile to any thinking person who might offer another opinion i find myself reading fewer articles in the section and skipping to the local news sports and features the business page usually has articles that ill read in the wall street journal the day before if it wasnt for the local news sports and comics page i wouldnt subscribe to the paper gregory b crosbie bath pa see related letter "letters to the editor newspaper readership is in chronic decline" wsj mar
