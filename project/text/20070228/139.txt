when flouting convention is your best tax bet new laws amt may call for a contrarian approach a child but not a dependent when youre working on your taxes sometimes it pays to be illogical taking actions that seem to make no sense such as passing up a juicy deduction can be smart because of the growing complexity of our nations tax laws and recent tax law changes offer even more incentive to be a contrarian this year counterintuitive strategies are becoming increasingly common as growing numbers of people are ensnared by the alternative minimum tax or amt some tax maneuvers that would make sense under the regular system can backfire if youre subject to the amt a parallel tax system designed decades ago to prevent a small number of high income people from avoiding paying tax since the amt wasnt indexed for inflation its now hitting rapidly growing numbers of americans unless congress changes the law more than million people will be caught in the amts web for up from about million for here are a few examples of where upside down thinking may help filing separately if youre married you can file jointly with your spouse or separately in most cases its better to file jointly as most people do but not always for example consider filing separately if youre a two income couple and one of you had especially large amounts of medical bills or casualty losses such as losses suffered from fires or storms medical expenses are deductible only to the extent they exceed of adjusted gross income on personal casualty or theft losses you generally can deduct them only to the extent they exceed of your adjusted gross income after subtracting &# for each loss the lower your income the greater your deduction it may also pay to file separately if one spouse has large amounts of unreimbursed business expenses to be safe crunch the numbers both ways to figure out which is better about million married couples filed jointly for nearly million filed separately curiously it sometimes pays to file separately even if it means paying higher taxes than filing jointly heres why when you sign a joint return you typically are liable for all taxes due on that return thus lawyers say dont sign a joint return if you suspect your spouse of fraud also be leery of signing if your spouse wont divulge key details of his or her finances or business dealings even if you didnt realize your mate was doing something wrong its "an uphill battle" to prove your innocence to the irs or in court warns karen l hawkins a lawyer at taggart &amp hawkins in oakland calif you can be held liable "even if some of that tax is attributable to a separate business run by your spouse " in some "innocent spouse" disputes "the economic and emotional agony is heartbreaking " ms hawkins says dont claim dependents some upper income parents should consider not claiming a child as a dependent says stephen w defilippis owner of west suburban income tax service in wheaton ill that might save money if the kids are in college and have taxable income of their own in some cases that may allow the child to claim education credits the hope credit and the lifetime learning credit that wouldnt be available to the parents because of income limits among the parents who may benefit are those whose incomes are so high that most of the deduction for the dependent exemption gets phased out anyway mr defilippis an enrolled agent which means hes authorized to practice before the irs says this wont work in every situation but is something that should at least be considered working abroad last year congress raised taxes on some americans working and living abroad prior to this law those americans could have excluded as much as &# of pay for under the new law the "foreign earned income exclusion" for rose to &# but income above that level is taxed at higher rates the new law also reduced the amount of housing expenses that expats could deduct or exclude heres the counter intuitive idea u s expatriates who are paying taxes to another country may want to consider not claiming the exclusion says kent klaus a partner with deloitte tax llp in chicago in "many cases " he says they may be better off using just foreign tax credits rather than the exclusion to reduce their u s tax liability in other cases the u s liability is the same whether the expat claims the exclusion or not but by not claiming it the employee may have a larger foreign tax credit carryover he says "forgoing the exclusion is so counter intuitive that were getting surprised looks from our clients " its difficult to generalize on this subject since there may be other key considerations says michael abdalian of ernst &amp young "you really need to look at each persons facts and circumstances to make a choice to determine whether to elect the exclusion or revoke a previously elected exclusion " he says check with a trusty tax adviser on this one it can be surprisingly complex deduct sales taxes if you itemize you can deduct either state and local income taxes or sales taxes sometimes it pays for someone affected by the amt to deduct sales taxes even if the amount is lower than state and local income taxes heres why taxpayers cant deduct either state and local income taxes or sales taxes in calculating their amt however some people may save money on their state returns by deducting sales taxes even if the amount is lower than their income taxes this wont work for people in every state but a new york city accountant says some amt clients have benefited from deducting sales taxes even when the amount was lower than their state and local income taxes itemizing deductions nearly two thirds of all taxpayers choose the "standard" deduction instead of itemizing for the standard deduction is &# for married couples filing jointly or half that for most singles sometimes though its better to itemize even if the standard deduction is higher than the total of your itemized deductions ernst &amp young tax advisers say this oddity can occur if youre subject to the amt the standard deduction has to be added back in full when calculating the amt "you might have a lower overall tax if your itemized deductions consist of amounts which are allowed for amt purposes such as charitable contributions and mortgage interest " an ernst &amp young tax guide says there may also be state tax benefits to itemizing if you do choose this counterintuitive option youre supposed to check a box at the bottom of schedule a of form many people are missing out on a new tax break before firing off your federal income tax return check to see if you qualify for a one time payment known as the telephone excise tax refund its designed to refund previously collected long
