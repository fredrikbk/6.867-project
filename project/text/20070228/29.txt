common sense covered calls can help hedge against declines smartmoney with no fanfare the nasdaq composite crossed my selling target of last week the nasdaq barely made it on wednesday closing a hair above it was still there friday before nose diving this week needless to say you wouldnt call this the "explosive climax" that technicians say often signals market peaks nor did the nasdaq get any reinforcement from the dow jones industrial average which declined the same day the nasdaq hit a six year high but a virtue of my system is that it focuses on one thing which in this instance is the fact that the nasdaq had gained since its interim low point which was last july so it was time to take some profits its true the selling window wasnt open that long two trading days if you missed it theres no reason to panic the nasdaq will cross the threshold again though whether sooner or later remains to be seen over the years ive often sold calls which has the advantage of raising cash while retaining ownership of the shares a call is an option to buy a security at a specific price i consider selling calls a conservative strategy since you cant lose any money that you already have every time i say this someone writes to argue that selling calls is risky since you forgo the possibility of profits if the stock price climbs above the strike price of the option and you have to deliver the shares at a below market price since a stock can theoretically rise to infinity the forgone profit could also be infinitely high but how likely is that by selling calls when the nasdaq hits my selling target i have never had to deliver a share i have kept the cash i gained from selling the calls and the shares when those options expired worthless this past year my covered call options strategy has been working well even as the market has continued its climb i sold some calls when i bought devon energy last september even though oil prices have rallied since then once again reaching &# a barrel devon recently at &# has remained well below my strike price of &# the options expire in april and were recently trading at cents by contrast i bought chevron calls which carried a much lower premium given the recent rally in oil prices they have gained nicely along with chevron shares the technology positions on which i sold covered calls last fall amidst the euphoria of the djia setting a new record above have also fared well with benefit of hindsight i would have stuck to my system and waited until now to sell even so until this week i thought the exception would prove to be bmc software it climbed steadily past the strike price and until this week bmc shares were trading well above my &# strike price but by yesterday they were barely above it if the correction continues ill be keeping those shares too these experiences have reinforced my view that selling covered calls works well at market peaks its especially suitable for long term investors who wouldnt mind holding positions but want some kind of hedge against the prospect of decline indeed with a few of these positions incorporated into your portfolio youve got your own hedge fund without any of the exorbitant fees most hedge fund managers charge james b stewart a columnist for smart money magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
