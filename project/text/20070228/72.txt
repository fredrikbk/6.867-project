japans shareholders find their voice and use it increasing pressure from activists could boost stock prices adding momentum to market tokyo the recent spate of shareholder activism in japan has sparked expectations that investors will use their growing voice to push companies to maximize value a development that could help take the countrys already peppy stock market even higher the latest example of an activist fund forcing managements arm came last week when ichigo asset management ltd rallied shareholders of a small steel company tokyo kohtetsu co to block its proposed merger with an osaka based rival the fund argued that the terms of the deal shortchanged tokyo kohtetsus stockholders a total of of them voted with ichigos proxy ballot enough to derail the merger the victory boosted the companys shares almost before the stock exchange halted trading because of the news ichigo isnt alone in victory during the past three months other activist shareholder funds have succeeded in forcing companies to take action that improves their stock price that has included forcing undervalued companies to look for parties to buy them analysts say they cant quantify just how much kick activism alone will give the market but say it could add momentum to what has been a perky stock market japanese shares even after a decline yesterday that wasnt as severe as other global markets are trading near seven year highs as corporate profitability appears on track to rise for a sixth consecutive year in the year ending march a weak yen has helped lift the profits of companies that have sizable overseas operations improving the yen value of their overseas revenue the benchmark nikkei stock average of companies yesterday closed at down or points while the broader topix index fell or to "during the past several weeks a number of encouraging developments have emerged which suggest activism may be making a comeback " goldman sachs strategist kathy matsui wrote in a feb report activist funds work by taking sizable stakes often close to in an undervalued company usually one with lots of cash in bank accounts or real estate that it isnt using the funds then request changes that benefit shareholders those are generally simple requests already the presence of activist funds has prompted companies to think more fully about their shareholders in japanese companies paid a record trillion yen &# billion in dividends a increase from trillion yen in and more than the trillion yen paid in according to research by nikko citigroup ltd increasingly however shareholder demands are becoming more complex sometimes encompassing requests for changes to real operations like the sale of certain businesses often the funds announce theyd like to buy an entire company and operate it themselves that forces the target company to look for a "white knight " usually a company in the same industry to buy the target eliminating the funds buyout threat companies have tried to stop the momentum by crafting protectionist measures many have adopted poison pills but recent cases suggest that activists are increasingly able to make management react to their requests that is what happened in late october when u s investment group steel partners japan strategic fund amassed a stake in myojo food co steel partners later announced takeover plans for the company which forced the noodle maker to scramble in search of a white knight it turned to nissin food products co the nations biggest noodle maker by revenue nissin ended up offering yen per myojo share more than the yen that steel partners was offering steel partners is currently employing a similar strategy with sapporo holdings ltd the countrys third biggest beer maker by market capitalization the investment group currently has a stake in the brewery which it says it wants to raise to though it hasnt yet opened a tender offer under new japanese regulations a party that amasses more than of a companys shares a threshold the steel partners plan doesnt cross must bid for all the rest the wave of activism is heartening to most observers who view the developments as the beginning of shareholder democracy in
