the cost of coverage thanks to widespread concern about the millions of americans without health insurance several states have recently mandated universal coverage for their residents massachusetts enacted legislation last spring other proposals are brewing in california pennsylvania and elsewhere such reforms are likely to affect health care spending which has been growing faster than the overall economy for decades it makes up approximately of gdp and is a prime area of policy concern right up there with the number of uninsured for evidence of how such programs can lead to increased spending just look at the effects of the introduction of medicare in medicare provides health insurance coverage to virtually all americans aged and over prior to its enactment only about one quarter of these individuals had any meaningful health insurance as a result of medicares introduction about three quarters of the elderly or about of the total u s population gained health insurance coverage for perspective this is a similar increase in the share of the population with insurance coverage as what will happen in massachusetts under its new universal coverage program research i conducted shows that medicare had a substantial effect on the health care sector by the program caused a increase in hospital spending this is an enormous number if i extrapolate from the medicare experience to compute the effect of the overall spread of insurance both public and private between and it suggests that it is responsible for about half of the sixfold growth in real per capita health care spending during this period why does increased health insurance lead to increased health spending one factor is that when individuals have insurance they tend to consume more health care this makes sense if you only have to pay some fraction of the cost you are more likely to go for an extra doctors visit or get an additional diagnostic test than when you have to pay the full cost out of pocket another reason is that hospitals and doctors respond to the increased demand for health care by changing some of the ways in which they practice medicine for example hospitals were more likely to adopt new medical technologies after medicare was introduced because now with greater insurance coverage there were more people who could afford these new technologies this in turn may have encouraged the development of a new generation of health care innovations all of this contributes to higher health care spending of course the effect of health insurance on health spending tells us only of the costs of expanding health insurance coverage we can also ask what are the benefits and once again we can learn something from the medicare experience robin mcknight of the university of oregon and i have examined the data and as best we can tell medicare did not have any effect at reducing elderly mortality in its first years of existence of course mortality is only one measure of health and it is possible that other aspects of health improved it is also possible that in the long run the new technologies adopted and perhaps developed because of medicare had important health benefits that our year analysis would not capture while the health benefits from medicare therefore remain uncertain we found clear evidence of a different type of benefit it provided substantial financial protection to the elderly prior to medicare they faced the risk of large out of pocket medical expenditures about one in of elderly individuals spent one fifth of their annual income on medical expenses that were subsequently covered by medicare by we estimate that medicare had reduced this risk of extremely large out of pocket medical expenditures by half what all this means is that as best we can tell the elderly were not foregoing life saving treatments prior to medicare rather they were getting these treatments albeit at large or even enormous personal financial cost but overall medicare did not so much save lives as it did provide financial security this is the goal of insurance not to prevent an awful event from occurring but to make sure that if it does occur you are not devastated financially the medicare experience offers valuable lessons for today recent state efforts to create universal health insurance coverage would reduce the fraction of the population in a state without insurance by similar amounts as did the introduction of medicare nationwide and if that program is any guide we may perhaps see changes in the structure of the health care system such as the development and adoption of new medical technologies we are likely to witness an improvement in the financial security of the currently uninsured there are also likely to be increases in health care spending quite possibly substantial ones ms finkelstein is an assistant professor of economics at mit and a faculty research fellow at the national bureau of economic research see related letters
