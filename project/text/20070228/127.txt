the mossberg solution testing tv on your cellphone mobitv service sends crisp images lips out of sync just when you think technology has turned you into the laziest person possible another invention comes along to cater to your every whim this week i tested just such an invention and a dream come true for the ultimate tv fanatic television on your cellphone for lovers of portable video the arguments in favor of tv on phones are speed and convenience rather than waiting to download movies video podcasts and tv shows to a computer and then to transfer them to a portable player like an ipod some would rather see current live content streamed onto the device they already carry their cellphone whenever they want wherever they are live tv on cellphones isnt new we first tested it in but it was awful then choppy and almost unviewable because the cellular networks were too slow and the phones were too wimpy so i decided to try it again many cellphones are capable of displaying streamed television using built in services but few people are aware of these capabilities and not every phone will work as well as the next the best results are delivered on devices with good quality screens that can retrieve and display the content using high speed networks i used a mobile content streaming service called mobitv on three phones serviced by two carriers sprint nextel corp and at&amp t inc s cingular wireless watching a variety of shows on screens smaller than the palm of my hand monthly usage for watching cellphone tv with these two carriers costs about &# and &# respectively on top of your voice plan mobitv is compatible with more than handsets offering roughly channels about half of which show live content like that found on your home tv all in all mobitv offers a fun and simple solution for people seeking tv on the run high quality images appeared on screen just moments after i opened the mobitv application and an on screen guide labeled each channel tlc espn the discovery channel the oxygen network and major news channels are entertaining enough and though my eyes hurt after minutes of watching such a small screen i only ran into a few other snafus on screen images disappearing while audio continued certain channels cutting out and lips moving out of sync with audio in more cases than not these instances were rare or corrected themselves in seconds other carriers offer video clips that might easily be confused with mobitv inc s technology verizon wireless for example offers its v cast service but v cast requires that you download clips onto your device sprint and cingular also offer video on demand options but the mobitv service streams content onto your phone showing it just about a minute later than the same content on live tv if you dont use sprint or cingular and youd like to download mobitv to your standard cellphone or to your palm or windows mobile smart phone you can do so through third party vendors like handango com these options can be found on www mobitv com vendors charge about &# a month on top of any data charges that you might owe your carrier sprint and cingular encourage you to buy an unlimited monthly data plan in addition to your voice plan if youll be watching tv on your cellphone sprint calls its live tv service sprint tv live though its really mobitv beneath the covers and offers tv inclusive data plans for &# &# or &# these return and channels respectively sprints exclusive content includes the nfl network to further confuse matters you can also buy stand alone sprint tv live on top of those three data plans it costs about &# monthly cingular charges users about &# for its unlimited data plan plus &# for mobitv usage this carrier keeps the mobitv name mobitv worked relatively the same way on all three handsets with both carriers two windows mobile devices the sprint ppc and cingular and a basic cellphone samsung electronics co s sgh a with cingulars g network in my tests mobitv came pre loaded on the devices letting me simply select it from a list to start watching streaming content on the cingular a smart phone running the windows mobile operating system i browsed through a guide until i found the oxygen network the isaac mizrahi show not a favorite of mine was just ending it was followed by a quirky game show called "can you tell " mobitv streams two types of programs live and made for mobile live shows are like those on your regular tv though slightly delayed and with different commercials in the local ad slots i watched msnbcs "hardball with chris matthews" using mobitv and my regular tv and an interview with mia farrow started about a minute earlier on my tv than it did on my mobile device made for mobile channels include special mobitv content such as music video channels or content for certain channels that mobitv stitches together to show in a better format for mobile the latter is the case with espn in minutes i watched clips about football nascar baseball boxing and basketball with only a few quick commercials in these snippets however lips werent synched with the audio i often opted to view content in full screen mode which in seconds alters the image to take over the whole screen in horizontal view a few times while watching full screen view my on screen content froze and had to restart in the regular view mobitv says that using its service to watch programs saps battery at a rate equal to that of voice calls people who use digital video recorders at home to pause or rewind live tv will be disappointed to find you cant do that with mobitv the company is hoping to offer these capabilities in the future but because of the smaller screen you probably wont want to watch your mobile screen for as long as you would a regular tv reducing the need to pause and rewind mobitvs services will never replace your home entertainment center experience but the ability to watch tv on your phone is a great way to stay plugged into news and entertainment just be sure that youre using a fast network and a generously sized screen edited by walter s mossberg
