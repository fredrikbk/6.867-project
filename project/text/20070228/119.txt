sudden retreat markets slide spotlights risks after a rough morning a data backup jolts the blue chip average the stock market was having a bad day and briefly it looked even worse spooked by a selloff of chinese shares the dow jones industrial average started the day under pressure by midday the average of blue chip stocks was already down around points and it continued to slide through early afternoon suddenly at about p m eastern time the dow industrials fell out of bed logging one of their fastest declines in history behind the abrupt point plunge a glitch in the mechanism that calculates the average "the system fell behind " said mike petronella president of dow jones indexes which is owned by dow jones &amp co the publisher of the wall street journal the result briefly made a tough day look like an investors bad dream until around p m the three leading barometers of the nations stock market the djia the nasdaq composite index and the standard &amp poors stock index tracked each other downward with the nasdaq performing a tad worse than the other two then they parted company over the next hour the nasdaq and s&amp p started declining more sharply than the dow at p m the dow suddenly caught up within minutes it was down on the day roughly matching the performance of its two major counterparts behind the scenes the team that compiles the djia had noticed at about p m that heavy trading volume was overwhelming the system creating a data backlog that was affecting all of the dow jones indexes the dows component stocks were falling but improbably the dow average wasnt falling as much just before p m the team switched over to a backup computer system almost immediately the dow caught up tumbling points for an eye popping plunge on the day of more than points on wall street the benchmarks dizzying descent set off a frantic guessing game with traders speculating about whether it was caused by a trading glitch a single giant computerized trade or a torrent of forced selling into a market that lacked buyers mike driscoll a senior stock trader at bear stearns cos said he was on the phone around p m when the market tanked "as im looking the market goes down from to down in a heartbeat " mr driscoll said he quickly theorized more or less correctly that the sudden downdraft was caused by a backup in reported trading prices on a day of exceptionally heavy trading when the backup cleared mr driscoll said "the dam broke " mr driscoll said that traders who had been bidding for stock at prices &# below the last sale suddenly had their bids hit and quickly absorbed losses as prices continued downward "people were bidding for stocks and all of a sudden they got plugged " he said adding to the confusion the new york stock exchanges new hybrid electronic trading system was overloaded as investors frantically tried to buy and sell shares the nyse is now investigating what happened including whether the dow jones problem played a role in the exchanges woes and what might be done to prevent another trading traffic jam mr petronella blamed the problem with the djia on a dow jones computer system that feeds data to another system that calculates the dow average and indexes every few seconds and distributes them to the public the glitch affected all of dow joness roughly real time indexes futures contracts tied to the dow jones indexes werent affected mr petronella said because those contracts are usually calculated by exchanges such as the american stock exchange and the chicago board of trade investors who bought or sold shares of the main exchange traded mutual fund that tracks the dow the dow diamond probably didnt get erroneous prices because its share price is based on the actual prices of the dows stocks not on the average itself in fact the price of the dow etf fell faster than the average for nearly an hour before the fix was made to the dow industrials data after the dow problem was resolved other woes bedeviled traders about a half hour before the closing bell rang at p m eastern time traders reported having problems sending electronic buy and sell orders to the nyse which recently began converting to a largely electronic system at one post on the floor traders resorted to writing buy and sell orders on a dry erase board most of the letters next to the stock symbols said "s " for "sell " "go manual if you can " said art cashin a longtime floor broker for ubs to traders at about p m "take paper if you have to " traders were still negotiating stock closing prices minutes after the p m close "youre done grand at " michael rutigliano a floor broker at the nyse yelled into his headset shortly after the markets were supposed to have been closed mr rutigliano reflected the frustration floor traders are feeling these days as their role becomes diminished by the electronic age "we were able to revert to a manual process that never breaks down " he said louis pastina an executive overseeing trading systems at the big board said "a rush of orders" in the last hour of trading overwhelmed the exchanges computers leading to delays and an unknown number of orders that were never completed some trades may have been done on alternative markets or in an after hours crossing session the nyse extended by a half hour to p m he said he added that floor traders were finishing trades manually until around p m about minutes later than usual a spokesman for the nyse said the new hybrid trading system which matches most trades electronically but sends some to traders on the exchange floor worked fine but that another system that feeds it couldnt handle the onslaught of orders the nyse said that circuit breakers delaying the market wouldnt have kicked in unless the djia dropped points or about trading collars which restrict some types of trading in volatile markets worked as designed yesterday exchange officials said the nyse sent an email out to brokerage firms at p m acknowledging that some orders remained unfilled at the end of the day "at this time all stocks are closed " the nyse said "reports in queue may come back to member firms at this time there is no estimated time as to when reports will arrive " tom lauricella contributed to this article see related article "chinese shares tumble and investors reassess u s economic outlook fleeing to safe
