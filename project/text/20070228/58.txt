yield especially with the stock markets wobbly performance in recent days with everything from long term treasury bonds to dividend paying stocks offering relatively low payouts a growing number of people are pursuing aggressive new strategies to generate income among the strategies gaining favor with income hungry investors are publicly traded energy partnerships foreign real estate securities and more rapid trading of dividend paying stocks mutual funds and closed end funds which have a fixed number of shares that usually trade on an exchange are quickly adopting these strategies as they aim to attract baby boomer investors who are on the brink of retirement and eager to generate a steady stream of income the new strategies give investors a relatively high and rising stream of income

ing funds have recently rolled out new funds investing in foreign real estate though dividends generally have become more attractive thanks to the tax law changes which lowered the top tax rate on qualified dividend income to much of the income produced by the new strategies doesnt qualify for this lower rate foreign investments can be pummeled by currency fluctuations or political upheaval

year is down about from the same period last year heres how some funds are pursuing bigger payouts dividend capture a number of new funds are aiming to boost their dividend income by rapidly moving money among dividend paying stocks in this "dividend capture" strategy a fund typically buys a dividend paying stock holds it long enough to qualify for the next dividend payment then sells it and uses the proceeds to purchase another stock expected to pay a dividend in the near future the strategy allows a fund to collect more dividends per dollar of assets than it could if it simply followed a buy and hold approach the henderson global equity income fund launched in november uses a dividend capture strategy as do a handful of new closed end funds while the strategy boosts dividend income it also increases trading costs which cut into investors returns and it can potentially result in higher tax bills for investors since these funds often hold stocks for short periods they may generate short term capital gains which are taxed at higher rates than longer term gains and unless the funds meet certain holding period requirements the dividends they generate wont qualify for the lower tax rates certain funds such as the new eaton vance offering are managed to minimize tax consequences foreign real estate investors who have enjoyed the steady income and strong returns of domestic reits

consider the slight but significant risk that new legislation could reduce mlps tax advantages experts say late last year canada announced plans to change the rules governing its mlp like income trusts causing sharp price declines though many mlps such as energy pipelines have traditionally been insulated from commodity price fluctuations many new offerings are more susceptible to these
