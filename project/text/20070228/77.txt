markets find it hard to break the greenspan habit washington as chairman of the federal reserve alan greenspan had ph d economists at his disposal to help decipher economic and market trends now in the year since retiring from the job he held for years he relies on less than a half dozen staffers to analyze the same economic trends the last hours have made clear though that investors can be just as devoted to what he has to say about those trends a devotion some say makes it harder to concentrate on what his successor ben bernanke has to say mr greenspan told an audience via satellite early monday hong kong time that a u s recession was possible "when you get this far away from a recession invariably forces build up for the next recession and indeed we are beginning to see that sign " he said according to dow jones newswires "for example in the u s profit margins have begun to stabilize which is an early sign we are in the later stages of a cycle " mr greenspan didnt say a recession was likely indeed he said most forecasters dont see one the global environment is "benign" and there has been no "significant spillover" from the contraction in housing activity his comments appeared more aimed at questioning the conviction of many investors that because each of the last two expansions lasted a decade this one now five years old will too but the perceived pessimism of the remarks grew as headlines made their way around trading rooms and were blamed for helping contribute to a two day world wide selloff in stocks a plunge in bond yields as bond prices rallied and increased market expectations of a cut in interest rates by the fed in a widely distributed email yesterday stan jonas of hedge fund dutch book partners llc wrote "mr gspan says a recession is likely " the power of mr greenspans remarks both awed and frustrated some in the markets "somehow hes still the maestro " said thomas joseph marta a fixed income strategist at rbc capital markets "even though bernanke is the one calling the shots greenspans crystal ball is somehow given more weight " he compared it with a retired general commenting on military matters on cable television "theyre loose cannons and can do a lot more damage than good and i see greenspan the same way " alan blinder who served as vice chairman of the fed under mr greenspan in the mid s said "from the feds point of view its a little off message what greenspan said was noticeably more pessimistic than the feds outlook " there are no formal prohibitions on what a fed official talks about after he leaves the fed other than confidential fed deliberations upon retiring though mr greenspan went further and said he would follow the example of his predecessor paul volcker and not comment on his successors monetary policy by most accounts he has stuck to that commitment in an interview yesterday mr greenspan said "i have been scrupulous not to respond to any questions which refer directly to monetary policy what the fed is doing or what it should do " he added "what i do talk about are the global forces that are functioning how the world is running and how the economy is developing in a manner that i used to do when i was an economic consultant the only difference is back then id discuss what the fed was going to do as a consequence of all this now i just dont do that " but mr greenspans observations on economic and market developments have been inevitably interpreted for their significance toward interest rates barely a week after he left office a year ago he appeared at a private event for fewer than a dozen clients of lehman brothers mostly prominent hedge fund managers reports of his remarks filtered out the next day roiling markets at the time some in the market and some of his former colleagues questioned his judgment for hitting the speech circuit so soon after leaving office yesterday that criticism was largely absent in part because mr bernanke is widely considered to have established himself as a credible fed chairman in his own right "you cant expect him to be quiet forever " said mr blinder who now teaches at princeton university but also analyzes fed policy for fee paying clients adds robert parry former president of the san francisco fed "its hard for me to blame him for what could turn out to be an overreaction by markets " yesterday mr greenspan said "i recognize there is no way i can fully insulate myself but i do my best " as chairman from to mr greenspan became famous for his carefully crafted often opaque remarks when he spoke clearly it often took markets by surprise triggering an outsize reaction and often a later re examination of what he really said in he asked if stock investors were seized with "irrational exuberance " triggering a brief stock selloff in he said the fed needed a "firebreak" against deflation triggering a plunge in bond yields on expectations of steep rate cuts that ultimately didnt come since leaving office he has become a more relaxed speaker willing to say things in language that a fed chairman usually avoids such as the possibility of recession "an entire niche within the market was dedicated over the period of two decades to interpreting the musings of the oracle " said joseph brusuelas chief u s economist for ideaglobal a financial advisory service since leaving the fed mr greenspan has set up shop in a plush sun drenched office in downtown washington with a bloomberg terminal and a handful of staffers including two research associates that along with the internet gives him the ability to study most economic data with the same intensity he did at the fed he is also continuing to work with fed economist james kennedy on a project the two began at the fed building a database to examine the flows of money through the housing and mortgage market the two have published one paper on the subject and another is forthcoming other than that he has little contact with his former colleagues except at social occasions other than his speaking engagements for which media reports and clients say mr greenspan is usually paid &# his main activity is completing his book with some fact checking help from a few retired fed economists titled the "age of turbulence " it is due to be released by penguin group on sept a central theme of the book according to people with whom he has spoken is a theme he addressed monday the u s and global economies are far more resilient now to economic and financial shocks but in a telling note he also warned his audience "we do not and cannot look into history without being very concerned when you see the absence of awareness and concern about risk that we see today " as for how mr bernanke feels about mr greenspans comments al broaddus who served with mr bernanke on the fed says he cant imagine the chairman being ruffled by his predecessors remarks or their impact on markets "hes just going to do what he feels he needs to do the first year of his tenure has shown that he keeps his eye on the ball recently the perceptions of the fed in markets seem very favorable " auction results here are the results of the treasury auction of four week
