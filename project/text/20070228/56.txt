high doses of antioxidants may hurt more than help consumers gobble down vitamins in hopes of boosting their health but a major review of antioxidant research shows high doses of the popular supplements appear to do more harm than good in a massive review of the medical research into beta carotene vitamin a and vitamin e danish researchers found that supplement users had higher death rates during the various study periods compared with nonusers according to the report published in the journal of the american medical association the review follows a slew of other studies in the past few years that have suggested patients have more health problems not fewer when they take high doses of antioxidants it is estimated that of american households buy vitamins and annual spending on vitamins reached &# billion last year according to industry figures the jama study of clinical trials compiled by investigators from copenhagen university was quickly criticized as biased by the council for responsible nutrition a vitamin and supplement industry group the group contends the review used flawed statistical methods and excluded some key studies but the publication of the study by such a respected medical journal is certain to raise questions about the safety of high doses of antioxidants which are taken by consumers in a bid to boost the immune system improve heart health and ward off cancer "its not a perfect study by any means but i think it is one more piece of evidence that antioxidants in high doses are not helpful in preventing disease or mortality from chronic disease " says robert russell director of the jean mayer usda human nutrition research center on aging at tufts university in boston "weve seen a long history of research now that shows these things in high doses are not helpful and in fact in very high doses may produce some harm " the jama study however also raises important questions about how best to study the health effects of vitamins and supplements the vast majority of the research uses high doses of antioxidants to treat unhealthy people many of the studies look at antioxidant use by smokers or people with existing heart disease for instance vitamin proponents say more study is needed of the health effects of vitamins in healthy younger people another concern is that the analysis excluded two major positive studies of vitamins an italian study from the respected medical journal lancet and a study in china that was published in the journal of the national cancer institute the researchers who couldnt be reached for comment noted in the paper that they excluded those studies because of bias or design flaws "its a flawed analysis of flawed data that doesnt really reveal the truth about the health effects of antioxidants " says balz frei professor and director of the linus pauling institute at oregon state university who says he has no financial relationship with the supplement industry "im not saying theyre the magic bullet but i think we need to do more work to find out if they do work " the jama report looked at studies that were considered "low bias risk " meaning they had adequate quality control blinding and follow up the analysis of those trials concluded that use of antioxidant supplements increased the risk of dying during the various study periods by among those studies beta carotene use increased mortality risk by vitamin a boosted risk by and vitamin e increased risk by however the study has been criticized because it initially looked at a total of clinical trials that broader analysis showed no increase in risk or benefit from using antioxidants but the researchers concluded that of those studies had flaws that warranted excluding them from the review the study showed no increase risk with vitamin c and a potential benefit from selenium that the researchers said needs more study part of the reason the research is so confusing is that numerous observational studies show that people who eat diets rich in vegetables which contain antioxidants have far better health than nonvegetable eaters but in studies of vegetable eaters the dose of antioxidants is typically far lower than used in studies of antioxidant supplements heres what the jama analysis showed about the health effects of vitamins users of beta carotene vitamin a and vitamin e at higher risk of dying during study period vitamin a was riskiest with a higher mortality risk no increased risk with vitamin c potential benefit of selenium needs more study
