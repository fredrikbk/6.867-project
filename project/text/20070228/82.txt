mutual funds avoid risk to lift ratings is your mutual fund too average theres a good reason why you might feel that way returns for mutual funds are increasingly congregating around a broad middle often failing to equal their benchmarks according to new research from goldman sachs group inc goldman found that large company equity mutual funds have consistently failed to beat their benchmarks over the past years this is a result of fund companies and fund managers sidestepping risk for a variety of reasons goldman concludes one reason funds are trying to reduce their price volatility to earn higher morningstar ratings in trying to attract and retain assets goldman says it believes fund companies are trying to "reverse engineer the morningstar process" to earn coveted four and five star ratings that consumers often solely rely on when researching mutual fund investment options "morningstar did something thoughtful in evaluating what mutual fund managers say theyre doing " says don mulvihill a managing director at goldman sachs "but the fund industry has reacted to it by trying to game the system to get star ratings " the result lower risk and returns inside the funds a measurement of the active risk that funds are taking today has declined to the lowest level in the history for which data is available according to goldman research part of the problem behind the average fund returns may be that the growth of the hedge fund industry has lured away the better mutual fund managers according to goldman also as the mutual fund industry continues to grow fund companies are becoming more risk averse for fear of losing the value of the franchises they have built don phillips managing director at chicago based morningstar inc says the investment research company has also noticed that funds are clustering around the middle part of the reason he says "probably is us " but other reasons he notes are that "managers who stuck their neck out and lost in recent years lost their jobs so risk taking is penalized " moreover mr phillips says because morningstar puts more weight on multiyear returns instead of short term performance "the penalty for taking a risk as a fund company stays on your performance longer " finally he says fund companies are "increasingly linking manager pay to performance over a rolling period of time creating an incentive not to gun the fund for one year returns " so how might investors respond goldmans mr mulvihill says these results strengthen the argument for pursuing a so called core and satellite portfolio the core of this approach is built around large cap u s and foreign shares owned through index funds exchange traded funds or similar funds that charge low fees and take on little more than the risk of the underlying benchmark then with the satellite investments you venture into other asset categories such as emerging market debt real estate investment trusts and others where "active management is more likely to earn the fees" with benchmark beating returns
