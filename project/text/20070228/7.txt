life not any wine but a &# bottle of cheval blanc from this fabled village near bordeaux "it was fruity and the alcohol wasnt too strong " says the year old from the chinese coastal province of jiangsu the experience steered the newly minted business school graduate away from her parents dream of a career in pharmaceuticals and toward an idea whose time she hopes has come helping her homeland learn to savor the finer things in life one of those things being french wine "wine is an art " she says "like painting or music " that attitude has made ms yan a hot commodity among the creme de la creme of french vintners eager to groom an asian ambassador worthy of their silky reds and fruity whites last month after weighing nine job offers she settled on a position with jean luc thunevin a former bank teller who in the s scraped together his meager savings and started chateau valandraud renowned critic robert parker considers his wines to be among the worlds best reds mr thunevin hopes ms yan can help him crack the code of marketing wine that has world class taste but not the backing of a famous name to the nouveaux riches of the middle kingdom he needs the help last year he managed to sell just bottles on the mainland "she speaks three languages and her parents are doctors so she knows people in the upper classes " he says whether that will matter is an open question without well schooled palates chinese consumers are known for favoring brand cachet over taste the droll among saint emilions vintners like to tell the story of one chinese businessman who orders the occasional bottle of chateau lafitte valued at some &# only to mix it with coca cola ms yan allows "people i know still put ice and juice in their wine " european trade officials say fine wine is one of the few agricultural products in which europe enjoys a clear advantage over asia "we need to exploit niche products like cheese and wine " says european union trade commissioner peter mandelson since chinese wine imports have grown to &# million from &# million wine experts think that one day the high end of chinas wine market for imports could match americas valued at over &# billion a year elite vintners from saint emilion medoc and other prestigious regions have the most potential in china experts say the low end of the market belongs to chile spain and australia the french education of ms yan began in when she decided to pursue a masters degree in business administration in rennes hoping to land a spot in one of frances big pharmaceutical firms but last spring a cousin who imports wine to china helped her land a six month internship at a year old chateau called maison riviere when owner philippe riviere picked her up at the saint emilion train station she introduced herself as "jessica " a name she thought more in tune with western culture and one that the chinese apply as a reference to any successful businesswoman her chinese name pronounced in french sounds exactly like the word for china chine pronounced sheen surrounded by romantic chateaux "i felt like i was a princess in a movie " she says it didnt take long for ms yan to catch the eye of christophe lebail rivieres japan export manager the year old mr lebail an accomplished chef spent hours preparing sumptuous meals for the novice developing her palate for the wonders of foie gras and pungent reblochon cheese they recently moved in together mr lebail has also helped ms yan discover that some chinese stereotypes of the french simply arent true "in china people say the french are the world leaders in perfume because they dont take showers " she says she is puzzled though at how much the french seem to go on strike and smoke "in china if you strike they just tell you to go home " she says "and i thought that in a developed country like france people wouldnt smoke so much " when ms yans internship with riviere ended last november she opted to work with mr thunevin whose etablissements thunevin produces brands and bottles with annual sales around &# million its finest wine sells for up to &# a bottle after training ms yan will frequently travel to her homeland where mr thunevin hopes she will use her language and social skills to begin making inroads among restaurants stores and wine dealers for now ms yan is a familiar sight among the wine bars and chateaux in saint emilion she walks among the cobblestones in high heeled boots and wraps her slender frame in a fake fur coat fluent in mandarin french and english she is also mastering the stilted argot of the sommelier "i used to like wines that were easy to drink " she says "now i believe in a long finish and a complicated structure " she still has a few things to learn however one recent day she betrayed her naivete by asking a colleague whether the french wine world could take a lesson from coca cola why not she suggested generically label all french wine as "bordeaux " even those made in saint emilion "you can still have different kinds like coke light and coke lemon " she said "xin thats against the law " said colleague cecile montsec patiently explaining frances strict labeling rules based on regional classifications nonplussed ms yan turned her attention to translating postings from mr thunevins blog http thunevin over blog com into chinese and sending email solicitations to chinese distributors restaurants and hotels shes also preparing her own blog "about what its like to be the only chinese person in saint emilion " eventually says ms yan the chinese will warm to luxury wines she is so confident of the market potential she wants to be paid on commission in the meantime she is still struggling with some of the basics "remind me how many bottles do we manufacture a year " ms yan says to ms montsec who replied "we dont manufacture anything xin we create luxury "
