copper surplus is seen for on output rise a number of analysts are looking for the global copper market to have a surplus this year citing an expectation for steadier production after a strike filled and potential of more substitution for the mineral consultancy bloomsbury minerals economics said last week that it expects the copper market to have a metric ton surplus this year compared with a deficit of metric tons in data for from the international copper study group suggest the market already has moved into a small surplus the group listed a surplus of tons for the first months of compared with a deficit for the same period in "im looking for a moderate surplus somewhat larger than we saw last year " said dan vaught futures analyst with a g edwards inc "but im not looking for a major one by any means " he put his estimate at roughly metric tons chuck bradford metals analyst with soleil securities looks for a surplus in the ton area "one of the interesting things in the international copper study group piece of feb was a rebound in the operating rate at the mine level " mr bradford said "if you look at the operating rates in earlier they were well below where they had been any time during the rest of the decade "in fact if we would have had a normal operating rate during the first nine months of we would have been swimming in copper well in the last two months we got back to a normal operating rate " production was lost during much of due to a series of strikes mr bradford said the icsg report said global mine output was up in november compared with the same month in but production disruptions in the first part of the year left output for the first months of essentially unchanged up compared with the same period in mr bradford said he doesnt anticipate a "huge" copper surplus in "because i think well have strikes again " also he said when prices are high companies are willing to mine lower grade material that they may not have otherwise mr vaught said some new mines are expected to come on stream either late this year or early michael skinner of base metals sales with standard bank said his firm looks for a modest surplus this year assuming there is a "constant stream of production" without as many labor disruptions as in standard bank several weeks ago forecast a surplus of roughly metric tons for mr skinner said there is a possibility it could be revised downward at the beginning of the next quarter but likely still would be in the s "it mainly has to do with continuity of production this year " he said "there is certainly incentive to do that at these prices that will help take us into surplus " mr skinner cautioned there can be wide variations in the supply and demand estimates by various researchers this is especially the case for copper due to the difficulty in obtaining data from china mr skinner said while the icsg put the surplus at metric tons for the first months of his firm estimated a surplus of metric tons in all of in its report bloomsbury said a surplus emerged in october due to a surge in secondary production and a decline in u s consumption as the housing market slowed this was compounded by weak consumption in china which has begun to recover again bloomsbury said while the consultancy looks for a ton surplus this year it anticipates this will narrow to tons in mr bradford said a measure of demand may be how much substitution for copper occurs due to historically strong prices "my biggest fear is substitution " he said "i keep asking people about it and i get very conflicting stories the aluminum guys are all convinced they have benefited materially from substitution away from copper into aluminum "copper has been losing markets because of the price it just takes a long time for that to happen " mr bradford said an example he said is the move toward plastic piping in home construction mr skinner also said industry appears to be making some effort to find substitutions for copper he said his firm believes the economy wont slow as much as some have forecast if demand in other parts of the world holds up overall demand could increase "marginally" this year he said the key may be the level of chinese imports he said "the market is looking at that very carefully the scrap substitution is also a key " mr skinner said while many analysts look for chinese buying to pick up this year some caution it may not be as aggressive as some expect in particular many suspect china has drawn down inventories that must now be rebuilt "if they do rebuild inventories they will do it in a way that does not get in their own way in the sense that they wont buy so aggressively that they actually force the market upward thus forcing themselves to pay more for those supplies " said mr vaught
