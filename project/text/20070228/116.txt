sudden retreat markets slide spotlights risks chinese shares tumble and investors reassess u s economic outlook fleeing to safe treasurys yesterdays plunge in stock prices around the world including the steepest percentage decline in the dow jones industrial average in nearly four years signals that investors may finally be re evaluating their insatiable appetite for risky investments the catalyst was tuesdays nearly fall in stock prices in shanghai one of the hottest and most volatile markets in the world that helped send u s stocks on a roller coaster that ended with the djia down points or to for a moment yesterday it was even worse starting just before p m eastern time the dow plunged more than points in minutes to a low of after a technical glitch delayed the reporting of its true value for months global stock markets had been pointing almost straight up ignoring admonitions that investors were excessively complacent the amount of compensation in the form of higher yields that investors usually demand for lending money to riskier companies or countries had been shrinking steadily and with credit plentiful and cheap private pools of capital have been borrowing to buy up bigger and bigger companies even prices of art and wine have soared the mood changed sharply yesterday u s treasury bonds rallied in a flight to safety by suddenly nervous investors the year treasury notes yield which falls when the notes price rises sank to at one point the treasury notes yield ended the day at a two month closing low of the atmosphere first began to shift sunday night new york time when former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan speaking by satellite to a hong kong audience used the word "recession" and appeared to question the widespread notion that the current expansion will last all decade "we do not and cannot look into history without being very concerned when you see the absence of awareness and concern about risk that we see today " mr greenspan said stocks didnt flinch at first but on tuesday a day after hitting a record high the shanghai composite index fell for no obvious reason its biggest drop since jitters in about the death of communist party elder deng xiaoping analysts suggested investors wanted to get out of the soaring market before beijing made any moves to cool it such as new trading taxes then in the u s the commerce department made mr greenspan appear prophetic yesterday with its report that orders for big ticket factory goods fell sharply in january that raised questions about the strength of capital spending a force that many have been counting on to offset housing market weakness about the same time mortgage lender freddie mac said it was tightening standards on subprime loans it was one more sign the market for loans to the least creditworthy borrowers was deteriorating rapidly defaults are up lenders shares are down the prospect that lenders will grow increasingly tightfisted has raised concerns that the worst isnt yet over for the housing sector which has been showing some signs of stabilizing a weaker than expected u s economy could undermine many assumptions that have been underlying investors embrace of risk it could lead to higher defaults among companies that have taken on large amounts of debt and it could undermine the outlook for foreign markets which tend to depend far more on the u s economy than the u s depends on theirs the remarkably low concern about risk has been the most striking feature of markets world wide in recent years stocks have risen and the riskiest markets have risen furthest yields on bonds from the riskiest countries companies and mortgages have fallen the most these trends have had powerful effects on businesses and economies they have sparked a wave of private equity buyouts of companies such as the big bid for utility txu corp this week there are several reasons for investors appetite for risk growth has been steady and inflation low world wide for several years china oil rich countries and other emerging economies are generating savings far in excess of their domestic needs and need to invest it somewhere the concern has been that investors have extrapolated such trends too far despite yesterdays financial market turmoil there is little sign the prognosis for the u s economy has changed much strong readings on home sales in january and consumer confidence in february suggested that the u s economy may be growing at about a modest annual rate "the growth situation is not great but i dont think its much different from what the fed has been anticipating for a while " said stephen stanley chief economist at rbs greenwich capital still corporate profit growth in double digits for more than three years is showing signs of falling back to single digits this year in the fifth year of a bull market money managers increasingly have been worrying that stocks are overdue for a significant pullback so theyve been poised to sell at the first sign of trouble many central banks maintain relatively low interest rates but the shift in market sentiment comes amid increasing signs central bankers are ready to tighten the credit spigot the chinese central bank has been trying to cool lending japans central bank recently raised interest rates albeit to just from in part to discourage speculative borrowing in its markets the european central bank yesterday reported that money supply grew at its fastest rate in years in january in countries that use the euro a trend that could argue for higher european rates the major exception is the u s fed which appears to be on hold for the foreseeable future though it has a bias to raise rates again if inflation worsens futures markets are betting the next rate move is a cut the market setbacks were broad yesterday major stock market indexes in france and germany fell each britains fell turkey was down and brazil plunged investors dumped bonds of developing countries sharply widening their yields compared with safe u s treasurys this so called "spread" widened by percentage point a major increase as investors demanded higher returns for owning the riskier assets some investors in these emerging markets believe a correction is long overdue "we need to be paid a lot more for the additional risk we are taking " said andrew feltus a bond fund manager at pioneer investments in boston in another sign of risk aversion the japanese yen strengthened more than against the u s dollar its biggest jump in about a year global speculators have for years been borrowing yen taking advantage of japans low interest rates and then investing in markets that promised higher returns the practice known as the carry trade has been an emblem of investors seemingly limitless appetite for risky strategies yesterdays tumult spurred some traders who used this strategy to begin reversing it that meant closing out some of their riskier bets and putting the money back into yen thus giving the yen a boost these sales by investors in the carry trade apparently contributed directly to the global stock declines yesterday was the heaviest trading day ever for stocks listed on the new york stock exchange billion shares one trader said he was unable to fill all his orders on the nyse trading floor in the last minutes of the trading day instead he was rerouting orders to alternative electronic venues away from the big board "we just hit a brick wall " said stephen porpora an nyse floor broker with william oneil "these markets move faster than anyone can " with increased electronic trading in which stocks are bought and sold by computer instead of on a traditional trading floor traders "cant slow things down" as they used to when a crush loomed mr porpora said at around p m he saw the dow slip by more than points in seconds as he tried to trade a large volatile stock one order entered around p m took minutes to process even though the market officially closes at p m he said usually trades are processed in less than a minute volatility which has been tame for months soared yesterday as measured by the cboe volatility

take up stock trading officials have expressed concern about the pace of the runup after the benchmark index surged in traders said the indexs close above earlier this week made them nervous that the
