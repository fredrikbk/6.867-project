thai violence damps rubber production singapore natural rubber processing companies based in thailands troubled south could be forced to reconsider their future in the region if they find themselves targeted by insurgents a senior industry official said analysts say rubber production is one of the few viable industries in the rural provinces of southern thailand and if businesses stop investing it could have a major socioeconomic impact on the region last week suspected muslim insurgents set fire to a large warehouse in yala owned by southern land rubber co destroying about metric tons of sheet rubber valued at around &# million based on current market prices "the amount of rubber destroyed in the fire was relatively small accounting for only about of thailands total monthly output " said sang udomjarumani chief executive officer of the international rubber consortium based in thailand but he said businesses will be forced to reassess their future investment plans in the area if they find themselves targeted by insurgents "the police have said the fire at southern lands warehouse was started by insurgents if that is true then it could have a detrimental effect on future investments and rubber production in southern thailand " he added a spokesman for southern land rubber a joint venture between thai and malaysian businessmen said the blaze which began in the early hours of last wednesday at the square meter nearly square foot warehouse the biggest in the region took around nine hours to bring under control while the exact tonnage of rubber lost in the blaze wasnt yet clear "there was around tons at the warehouse awaiting export and we believe it has all been destroyed " he said the spokesman declined to comment on the companys future in the region or on what security measures were in place southern land rubber currently operates factories in southern thailand with a combined capacity of around tons of natural rubber a month the three troubled southern provinces narathiwat pattani and yala traditionally produce around of thailands total natural rubber output but mr sang said this has been reduced to around since the separatist violence flared two years ago thailand is the worlds biggest producer of natural rubber and produced around three million tons in mr sang said that security in the south has been stepped up because of the continuing violence but that arson attacks on rubber facilities can be difficult to stop because of the materials flammable nature and because large storage facilities are vulnerable to potential attacks in august rubber factory based in pattani operated under contract to japans bridgestone corp was set alight at the time a company official said investigations showed that a gasoline soaked cloth was thrown from outside the factorys fence onto flammable rubber sheets stored in an open shed within its grounds according to official police reports the incident was classified as arson escalating violence in the south one of the countrys main natural rubber producing areas has left around people dead since muslims who are the majority in the far south have long complained of being treated as second class citizens in predominantly buddhist thailand the insurgents usually target predominantly buddhist plantation workers but following last weeks fire some analysts said insurgents may ramp up their campaign and start attacking higher profile targets like factories and warehouses southern thailands violence has escalated in recent months despite a step up in security in the area by the military imposed government rubber traders based in tokyo said news of the fire had given a slight psychological lift to rubber prices on the influential tokyo commodity exchange last week but said the news would have little long term impact "the amount of rubber destroyed isnt too much though at this time of year when thailand is entering its wintering season and supplies are getting tighter it could have a very small impact on sentiment in the short term " said tetsu emori an analyst with tokyos mitsui bussan futures "but there are far more influential factors to take into account when analyzing long term market trends and price movements " he added analysts said if companies are forced to relocate due to the violence it could effect raw material supplies coming out of thailand "there is a possibility that warehouses in the lower south will be targeted because most are located in isolated rural areas " said yium tavarolit a senior economist based in thailand "if companies are forced to move out of the area that could have a long term effect as raw rubber from the unrestive areas will slowly flow to factories relocated in the upper south of the country meaning the delivery period will be longer than usual " he said
