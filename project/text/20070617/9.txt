love &amp money update the lake house and belly dancing its time to tie up a few loose ends on occasion i update readers regarding previous columns to explain how the original issue ultimately played out or is currently unfolding this week im returning to two issues the lake house that my wife amy and i bought a little more than a year ago and my decision to give amy belly dancing lessons rather than a treadmill she had been asking for just over a year ago we spent a large part of our liquid savings to buy our retirement house decades before we plan to retire the way we saw it buying this lake house so early meant that we would have years to build memories there with our kids memories we can take into retirement by contrast waiting until we retired meant our kids would have no emotional ties to whatever house we retired to worse wed have no memories of them at the house in addition both amy and i love the lake its especially important to me because its the lake where my grandparents had a house when i was a kid still as i originally wrote this was no easy decision we debated the purchase for months the cash outlay necessary to keep our mortgage affordable was substantial we wondered whether wed be better off taking this money and investing in stocks ultimately that would likely give us more money for our retirement well its a year later and i think we made the right decision but it hasnt worked out exactly as we had planned in particular we were too optimistic about how much time we would actually spend on the lake with our children though the house is just an hour from home life as a family of four is often more hectic than we realized between our year old sons soccer seasons my soccer season and our jobs we havent had the chance to get away as much as we had hoped our nearly year old daughter just signed up for dance so thats likely to consume even more time while thats certainly frustrating our original sentiments havent diminished in fact theyve grown stronger recently we love the time we do have at the lake even if we drive up saturday afternoon and return by lunchtime sunday our little girl adores the place ready to pack up and go the moment she hears either of us casually mention the words "lake" and "house" in the same sentence our son has been a different story though early on he didnt buy into the house the way his sister did a function of his age and the fact that he would generally rather hang out around the neighborhood with his posse of friends and suddenly everything changed amy bought me a kayak for my birthday months ago and only in the past few weeks did i get to test it out after paddling around a while i let my son climb inside to get a feel for it it was love at first paddle now i get as much joy just lying on the deck watching him paddle as i do paddling myself in fact these days he is eager to get to the lake and quick to help me ferry the kayak down the long stretch of stairs to the water he wants his own kayak for christmas so we can paddle together moreover hes showing growing interest in fishing with me off the pier a couple of weeks ago his line tightened and he hauled in a three pound catfish exclaiming "i caught my first catfish dad " in a voice so loud and excited that a woman yards across the cove clapped for him these are exactly the sort of memories i want to bank though it has taken some time to get to this point and though not all is exactly as we had hoped we consider this purchase a victory and were both happy that we followed our hearts instead of our wallet last fall i wrote about amys wanting to buy a treadmill a purchase i saw as just another waste of money on just another piece of exercise equipment that almost certainly would largely go untouched an expectation built on years of similar experiences instead of adding another multihundred dollar contraption to our collection i figured i would find some other means of helping her exercise and shed a few pounds she has been trying to get rid of for the past several years so i bought her belly dancing lessons my rationale amy needs a reason to work out because she finds it too easy to put off until tomorrow the workout she wanted to do today if she had a reason to be at the dance studio at a set time then shed go some people argued that it was controlling of me to dictate the kind of exercise amy would do but amy disagreed she was fine with it whats more she went to the classes and enjoyed them she would practice the moves in front of a bathroom mirror while our son giggled and our daughter tried to imitate them but after the eight weeks ended amy didnt sign up for additional classes instead she went and bought the treadmill insisting that she would get more out of daily workouts on a treadmill than a weekly dance class early on she was fairly consistent with her workouts and i agreed to wake up early every other morning to take the kids to school so that she could spend time treading that arrangement lasted only a short while however because she grew frustrated that she didnt see immediate results so the treadmill like the weight bench and the exercise bike was soon sitting largely unused in a spare room i felt i had been both right and wrong wrong to think that a weekly belly dancing class would be enough for amy right because i knew the treadmill would end up as just another piece of gymnasium art in our house amy may prove me totally wrong yet though in the past couple of weeks she has renewed her drive to get back into shape she has joined a weight watching program and im cooking to her specifications im also back to getting up early several days a week to take our daughter to school so amy can exercise in the morning on the treadmill or the bike for the time being its working amy has already lost four pounds and last saturday was almost giddy when a previously tight fitting pair of pants was loose personally i dont care as i keep telling her she looks perfect to me and believe me objectively shes hardly what anybody would call overweight but if this effort makes her happy so be it jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall
