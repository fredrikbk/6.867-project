special report retirement planning ok i admit it i need some help im almost years old and my wife and i have been doing our best to save for retirement for the most part we feel good about our efforts and then we hear something like we heard last week a friend who has been retired for more than a decade mentioned in an email that he and his wife had more than &# in uninsured medical expenses last year including several thousand dollars for dental work and &# for hearing aids sound familiar i have been reporting and writing about retirement for the wall street journal for almost a decade in that time ive been fortunate to speak with and hear from many people who are working hard to prepare for later life and few things are more discouraging for them and me than the latest research or email that warns in so many words you better save a gazillion dollars for retirement buddy or be prepared to keep working until age i know these studies and my friend are well meaning and i know its important to have a healthy nest egg for later life but i cant help but feeling at times that no matter what my wife and i do well come up short in retirement which is why its time to start practicing what i preach im going to get some help with my retirement planning yes you can glean and we hope you have a lot of information from these pages and other resources but lets be honest most of us dont have the expertise and most of us dont take the time to develop a solid financial plan for retirement what we need and what i urge people to get a decade or so before leaving the office is a good financial check up in doing so you should end up with an answer to this question are my retirement finances heading in the right direction i know im doing some things right i have a fairly healthy k account to which im contributing the maximum allowed each year and getting the maximum match from my employer im also taking advantage of catch up provisions in my k for people age plus uncle sam allows me to invest an additional &# in the account each year i even rebalance my nest egg annually unfortunately fewer than one in five workers go to the trouble my wife and i each have an ira as well as a taxable savings account if all goes well we hope to retire in about eight years still i want a "second opinion" about my financial preparations i dont want to find out a year before retiring that back in i was far too conservative or aggressive in how i allocated my investments i dont want someone to tell me at age that back in i should have considered buying long term care insurance full disclosure ive written a number of articles about such insurance and im still on the fence i dont want to learn eight years from now just as im getting ready to walk out of my office for the last time that i should have converted my traditional ira to a roth when i had the chance or that i should have opened a health savings account or that i should have saved more money when my earnings were at their highest or that i should have paid off my mortgage or that i should have taken a closer look at the possibly exorbitant investment fees i was paying which left my nest egg smaller than it could have been i can hear your question "fine so where do i find a good affordable financial adviser " thats the trick of course its going to take some work and good help wont be cheap i could easily spend &# or more for a good review of my finances and a plan that takes me forward if that figure gives you pause consider that many people wouldnt think twice about spending a similar amount on carpeting for their home a trip to walt disney world or the "leather package" in their next car all of which will last considerably shorter than their retirements heres where reporting helps i know i want a "fee only" adviser and not a "fee based" adviser theres a big difference the former tends to have fees that are easier to understand and i know i want an adviser who acts as my "fiduciary " who puts my financial interests ahead of his or her firms all financial advisers are not created equal certified financial planners brokers insurance agents and "financial counselors" can have very different obligations and agendas failing to understand these distinctions is asking for trouble this means i start by looking at groups like the national association of personal financial advisors napfa org cambridge advisors cambridgeadvisors com and the garrett planning network garrettplanningnetwork com which can direct me to fee only advisers in my area garrett advisers in particular charge by the hour a more affordable way for many people to begin this process it means i start interviewing prospective advisers with a list of questions like the one found at the certified financial planner board of standardss cfp net under "learn about financial planning" and "how to choose a planner" and it means i get my own financial paperwork in order so i can save time and money when i actually sit down with an adviser speaking of studies its estimated that about half of all americans are on track to maintain their lifestyle in retirement the rest might or will have a tough time i have no idea if ill get hit with &# in uninsured medical expenses in later life or if my nest egg whatever its final size will cover every contingency in retirement but i do know this i plan to be in that first glenn
