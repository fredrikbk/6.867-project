its a wild wild market look for clues wall street is torn between optimism and pessimism and thats showing up in a sudden jump in stock market volatility professional money managers are sharply divided about whether the economy is getting stronger usually a plus for stocks or slowing down jitters about the housing market and its dampening impact on the broader economy have been offset by a rebound in manufacturing activity and resilience in the labor market to be sure there are always stark divisions on wall street bulls and bears are eternally squaring off but rarely have the two sides been as far apart as they stand today for now the strong economy group has the baton pushing up stocks the past few days but that bounce doesnt necessarily mean that stocks will continue to charge ahead signs of a growth uptick triggered a selloff of treasury bonds in recent weeks causing interest rates which move in the opposite direction to surge higher rates could potentially crimp consumer spending and prolong the housing downturn ultimately bad news for the economy diverse views caused the dow jones industrial average to fly into spasms last week after hitting a record of on june tuesday the blue chip average tumbled points partly due to a jump in the year treasury notes yield to a five year high on wednesday however the dow rallied points after the federal reserves "beige book" report showed that economic growth remains solid despite the housing markets weakness stocks shot up again thursday and friday as separate reports on wholesale prices and consumer prices eased concerns about inflation and worries that rates may go higher the dow benchmark closed friday a hair shy of its record up for the week and so far in the nasdaq composite index gained for the week and is up for the year to date what happens next will depend on whether the economy keeps charging ahead despite rising rates or whether higher rates cause growth to cool there are a number of things investors can do to try to figure out which way the economic wind is blowing and one is watching the stock market itself since stock prices tend to respond to expectations about future profit growth tracking sectors of the stock market that are sensitive to growth can give early signals about the economys direction "the thing that im focusing on is what the underlying leadership is " says james paulsen chief investment strategist at wells capital management in san francisco one of the easiest tricks is to track whether stocks with large market valuations over &# billion or so are outpacing small stocks with less than &# billion in shares outstanding if large stocks are rising faster than small stocks that might indicate "that rates have gotten up to a level where theyre starting to bite " says mr paulsen if small stocks rally "thats telling you rates arent high enough yet" to crimp the economy large companies tend to be more resilient to economic downturns than their smaller brethren since theyre more diverse and often have operations overseas they also have more funding options such as bond or secondary share offerings while small companies are usually more reliant on rate sensitive bank loans this year large stocks have taken the lead after trailing small stocks for several years while the dow is up in the small stock russell index is just higher if that continues it could mean growth is waning if small stocks move ahead thats a sign the economy is heating up one of the most economically sensitive sectors of the market is so called consumer cyclical stocks which tend to perform well when the economy is picking up but are hit hard when the economy is contracting the dow jones u s consumer goods index which tracks stocks such as jetblue airways jblu papa johns international pzza and radioshack rsh is up this year trailing the dow investors can track the indexs daily performance through an exchange traded fund the ishares dow jones u s consumer goods sector index fund iyk while the etf took a hit earlier this month it has stabilized since then if it picks up speed that could be an indication that the economy is also accelerating on the other hand a move higher by consumer staples stocks such as procter &amp gamble pg or health care stocks like pfizer pfe would signify that investors expect the economy to slow while consumers will cut back on discretionary items like expensive gadgets or takeout pizza when times are tough theyll keep spending on health care and diapers "youre going to buy eggs and aspirin no matter what the economy does " said barry ritholtz chief market strategist at ritholtz capital partners transportation stocks are also highly attuned to the economy the dow jones transportation average which tracks railroads truckers and airlines dipped earlier this month amid worries about higher rates but in the past week its moved up again signaling an economic rebound if the transportation group loses momentum that could signal slower growth down the road one group of stocks that hasnt fared well this year is at the core of concerns about a slowdown home builder stocks the philadelphia housing sector index which follows large builders such as toll brothers tol and kb home kbh is down year to date the jump in treasury yields caused even more pain to the sector since higher rates make it tougher for prospective home buyers to get a loan they also make it more difficult for homeowners with onerous loans to refinance their mortgages last week a survey by the mortgage bankers association showed that a record number of homeowners were in some stage of foreclosure in the first quarter tomorrow the national association of home builders reports its index of home builder confidence for june in may the index dipped to its lowest level in years tuesday the commerce department reports on may housing starts if those reports signal the housing market has hit bottom home builders may bounce a big plus for the
