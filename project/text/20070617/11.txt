special report retirement planning are your finances ready for retirement research shows that almost half the people who put numbers on paper who actually take the time to estimate how much money will be coming in the door during retirement and how much will be going out end up changing their savings plans and yet most of us dont make the effort first there are the emotional aspects for most of our adult lives weve had the "right" to spend our money as we wish suddenly in retirement we have a finite amount of resources second retirement has many unknowns life expectancy health costs and inflation among others how are you supposed to know what your expenses will be what follows are two of the most straightforward approaches to estimate how much money youll need in retirement and to determine whether your nest egg is sufficient the first takes about one minute and gets you in the ballpark the second approach takes a bit longer and gets you a seat behind home plate one minute drill this method developed by charles j farrell a tax attorney in denver is based on the idea of replacement ratios first to calculate your annual budget multiply your current gross income by the replacement ratio of this means were estimating that you will need a "salary" in retirement that amounts to of your pre retirement income then to calculate the size of the nest egg needed in later life multiply your current gross income by lets see what this math would look like for a couple well call them andrea and scott who are a year or two away from retirement and are making about &# combined a year multiplying that income by shows they will need &# a year in retirement multiplying &# by shows they will need a nest egg of &# its important to note that we start with a big assumption that the average american can in fact live comfortably on of his or her pre retirement income in retirement itself while the rule of thumb has long been that most of us will need about to of our pre retirement earnings once we leave work this assumes that about to of our money while were working goes to things like taxes transportation and savings and that all those bills will drop off in retirement in recent years though some financial planners have begun arguing that we actually need or more of our pre retirement income in later life because if anything expenses increase in retirement for travel home improvements and health care among other items as one financial planner told us "i have yet to see a client who the day he or she retired started living on less than the day before " as you might imagine research supports both sides of the argument the employee benefit research institute found that more than half of current retirees had replacement ratios of or more in retirement conversely some of the best research on replacement ratios done by aon consulting and georgia state university has found that the "average" retiree making about &# a year before retirement needs about of that income after leaving the workplace for his part mr farrell the denver attorney reasons that if individuals entering retirement have paid off their major debts including a mortgage and if they already were saving about of each paycheck during their working years as almost all financial advisers recommend then of pre retirement income should suffice in later life for the moment lets accept that figure and finish examining his math so now you know what your yearly "salary" should be but where does that money come from again we need to make some assumptions first that your nest egg will earn between and a year in retirement after inflation and second that you can safely withdraw of your savings each year so lets return to our couple andrea and scott who are making &# a year before retiring if they have managed to build a nest egg totaling &# a withdrawal yields &# add to that figure a minimum of &# that our retirees will collect each year from social security thats a rough calculation from the social security administration and voila you get &# or of pre retirement income the numbers above as you may have already figured out dont account for pensions annuities or other sources of income most important the math doesnt account for your particular needs and expenses building a budget in order to figure your retirement finances more precisely lets turn to a framework developed by t rowe price group the baltimore based mutual fund company while we dont have room to get into all the details here you take the time to tote up your expected expenses and sources of income and then revisit both categories as needed to bring them into alignment expenses expenses can be broken down into as many categories as you wish our framework has five essentials discretionary special debt and reserves essentials are fairly self explanatory housing food transportation as are discretionary travel entertainment gifts "special" would include major purchases like a recreational vehicle or major investments like andrea and scotts desire to help with their grandsons college education debt includes mortgage payments car payments and the like and reserves a critical but often overlooked category include savings for future purchases like a car new furnace or new roof on the house income most retirees have two sources of income "benefits" income which involves relatively predictable payments like social security and pensions and "income from assets" money withdrawn from individual retirement accounts personal savings and the like identifying the former is fairly easy using benefits estimates you can obtain from social security and your employer calculating the latter will take a few extra minutes in looking at your assets add up taxable and tax deferred holdings such as k s and individual retirement accounts the next step is a crucial one selecting a rate of withdrawal how much to pull from your nest egg each year to make the decision easier we can use a technique called monte carlo analysis which has nothing to do with the european resort city and everything to do with "probability theory " this analysis made with various software programs gives us a probability that our savings will last as long as we do given tens of thousands of potential economic market mortality and spending possibilities the accompanying table shows some withdrawal rates and their chances of success as calculated by t rowe price in this case "success" is defined as having at least &# in your savings at the end of each time period so if you expect your retirement to last years and your investment mix is stocks and bonds for example theres an chance that your savings will last for those years at a withdrawal rate of increasing the withdrawal rate to lowers the likelihood of having at least &# at the end of years to just these numbers simply represent the "likelihood" or the "probability" of a particular outcome and monte carlo analysis does have its detractors some financial planners argue that the results can give clients a false sense of security many financial advisers though agree that such calculations because they consider variability are superior to those built around averages taxes dont forget that your income will be reduced by taxes you can review your most recent tax returns to figure your average tax rate or to simply pick a figure is a reasonable estimate for many families and takes into account both federal and state taxes results and revisions you now have all the pieces to estimate your surplus or shortfall for the first year in retirement theres good news even if you are looking at a shortfall you are no longer operating in the dark instead with all these figures clearly in front of you you can start making some decisions about possibilities such as delaying retirement or trimming some spending you are able to consider and see the consequences of each option because you took the time in the first place to estimate your expenses and income
