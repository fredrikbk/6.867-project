getting going big gains are tempting but what if ponder the price of failure every day we face tough financial choices spend or save bet on the highflier or go for the sure thing invest everything right away or buy slowly over months these might seem like tricky decisions until that is you think through the possible consequences take a basic choice that all investors make you can spend your days trading in and out of big investment bets or you can settle down with a diversified portfolio "there is a trade off between financial entertainment and financial security " argues william bernstein author of "the four pillars of investing " "by keeping expenses down and diversifying widely youre forgoing a lot of the fun of investing but at the same time you minimize the odds of an impoverished old age " the fact is if you save regularly and own a diversified portfolio you have an excellent shot at retiring in comfort but if you roll the dice retirement could be a grim affair true your big investment bets could pay off handsomely thats unlikely however in part because of the hefty brokerage commissions and other investment costs you incur in addition you have to contend with a phenomenon known as "skewness " the most an investment can lose is but its potential gain is or more indeed most years the market averages are driven upward by a minority of stocks that post spectacular gains these big winners enthrall investors who are then tempted to abandon their boring diversified portfolios but if they do that they will likely be disappointed because the market averages are propelled higher each year by a select group of big winners a majority of stocks suffer below average performance and these are the stocks that our dice rolling investors will probably end up owning to a lesser degree the same issue arises when choosing between actively managed stock funds and index funds an index fund replicates the performance of its target index while an actively managed fund offers the chance to earn market beating returns that chance however brings with it the risk of failure standard &amp poors a unit of mcgraw hill regularly analyzes stock funds in nine "style boxes " such as large company growth funds and midsize value funds result over the past five years between and of actively managed funds underperformed their benchmark index depending on which style box you look at to be sure if you buy actively managed stock funds you probably wont fail as badly as those who make big bets on a single sector or a few stocks still theres a risk of lagging far behind the market averages something index fund owners dont have to worry about if you have a large sum to invest in stocks you could buy right away or you could spoon your money into the market over say months stocks rise most years so investing immediately should earn you the higher return trouble is that also increases risk what if you invest everything and the market promptly plunges if you are dealing with a large sum the loss could be devastating that potential hit will for most folks loom far larger than any potential gain admittedly you could invest gradually over months and then get whacked with a decline but presumably you would have clocked some gains over the initial months so the overall hit to your wealth wouldnt be quite so punishing lately theres been some debate over whether americans are saving too much for retirement even if you find the studies involved convincing which i dont it still makes sense to err on the side of caution and sock away a healthy sum each month after all if you later discover you have saved too much you can always spend more or retire earlier but if you find you havent saved enough you may have to continue working long after age frankly its hard to imagine many folks will reach retirement and find they have too big a nest egg as vanguard group chairman john brennan notes retirement is a risky time you could get hit by inflation or rotten markets and you might live longer than expected the best way to protect yourself is to save during your working years and amass a good size portfolio "you never want to face the risk of running out of money " mr brennan says "there are few things as valuable as the peace of mind that comes with a nest egg " according to limra international in windsor conn of adults dont have any life insurance and among those with coverage the average death benefit is just &# some folks dont have any financial dependents so they are right not to bother with life insurance but for others who have a family to protect its a bad decision consider the trade off if you dont buy life insurance you might save yourself &# or &# a year in term life insurance premiums the money saved seems awfully modest when you consider the financial peril your spouse and kids could face if you died unexpectedly with irritating regularity i advocate that retirees rely on their savings during their initial retirement years meanwhile delaying social security retirement benefits so they get a larger monthly check i often also suggest that seniors sink maybe a quarter of their savings into an immediate fixed annuity that pays lifetime income once again its all about consequences if you ignore my suggestions and you die before age you will likely have made the right choice you wont have wasted money on the annuity you will have collected a fair amount from social security before your death and as a result you will have a fatter portfolio this is good news for your heirs meanwhile if you live into your s you will likely have made the wrong financial choice you wont have the annuity income and your social security check will be on the skimpy side and of course you will be well aware you made a mistake because you will still be very much alive email jonathan clements wsj com
