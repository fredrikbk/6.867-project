real time consumers stay out in copyright cold decision ruling against cablevisions remote dvr elevates tech fetishism over helping consumers online edition last week a federal judge ruled that cablevision cant offer digital video recorders that store programs remotely agreeing with movie studios and cable networks that the devices violate copyright law u s district court judge denny chins decision is remarkable for hitting the trifecta of digital age frustrations it fetishizes technology at the expense of common sense points out once again how out of step copyright law is with our digital world and raises the question of who if anybody will speak for consumers cablevision like all cable tv providers has lots of subscribers with dvrs that have built in hard drives a category led by tivo the company also offers its own such product the io dvr it had hoped to replace those dvrs with network dvrs which work the same way as regular dvrs except they store programs recorded by consumers on remote servers maintained by cablevision as someone who recently replaced a failing hard drive in his tivo id certainly be interested in the idea of a dvr with remote storage cablevision argued that since the consumer was controlling recording and playback remote dvrs are fine under copyright law a decision that reaches back to the supreme courts ruling that videocassette recorders are legal mindful of the law cablevision even said it would dedicate separate storage space for each subscriber instead of say keeping one recording of an episode of "the sopranos" for use by anyone to record it but the studios and cable networks argued that the remote dvr was more like a video on demand service and cablevision needed permission to "rebroadcast" the programs judge chin agreed saying that with a network dvr cablevision "would be engaging in unauthorized reproductions and transmissions" of copyrighted programs so lets break this down if the bits that make up your recording of "the sopranos" go to a hard drive in your living room everything is presumably legal but if the bits that make up your recording of "the sopranos" go to a hard drive in a cablevision data center somewhere thats illegal got that this is of course nonsense in a sensible world a dvr would be a dvr regardless of where the hard drive happens to be located and those who argued otherwise would be sent on their way with the old saw about the forest for the trees what if cablevision took the hard drives out of its io dvrs stacked them in its data centers and ran cables from the drives to customers homes would that be illegal but we dont live in a sensible world if youre thinking the paragraph above sounds a lot like one you read in a recent real time youre right this is the same tech fetishism thats resulted in a clear channel radio station paying no performance royalties when it plays a song over conventional radio but then having to pay those royalties when the same broadcast is streamed over internet radio and this tech fetishism is at least kissing cousins with publishers thundering that google is violating copyright law on a massive scale by making digital copies of books an issue discussed in real time here that charge ignores the fundamental difference between a server copy thats searched against quite possibly leading to a sale and a photocopy of a book that you resell on a street corner quite possibly preventing a sale a disingenuous use of a narrow reading of copyright law in order to mislead a problem lurking around all these events is the steady erosion of the right to fair use in favor of the rights of content owners who have found the simple threat of copyright litigation is a valuable weapon take youtube where content owners have negotiated with google by alternately enjoying the promotional benefit of users uploading snippets of their shows and ordering google to take such snippets down en masse and as with too many other digital age battles the arguments surrounding youtube clips miss the point episode after episode of this lawyerly drama is about sparring over laws instead of debating the appropriateness of those laws look at the national football leagues claim of copyright infringement for a brooklyn law school professors posting video of its copyright notice as covered by my colleagues on the law blog last week the nfl spokesmans first point to the law blog is that the clip included "game footage" as well which is true the copyright notice was followed by seconds or so of an utterly mundane kickoff but to be blunt who cares forget what the digital millennium copyright act might or might not say for a moment and ask yourself this what possible harm there is in posting of seconds of a play no sane football fan would ever care to see again and even if the play had been an important one would that second snippet really have destroyed the market for nfl highlight films would it have impacted that market in any way does the ability to see bits from "the daily show" or "saturday night live" really mean youll never buy a dvd of a given season if the answers "no of course not" as i argued in this real time from last fall then its intolerable that such material routinely appears and disappears from our cultural conversation or that artists from hip hop auteurs to documentary film makers should have their creativity de facto limited by the daunting time and expense of clearing samples and snippets ever wonder why "behind the music" rarely includes a bands music or concert clips and if the answers "maybe " shouldnt we give dire predictions time to play out rather than assuming theyre true should the possibility that a content owners bottom line might be impacted really outweigh the artistic and social value of making bits of video available for people to view reinterpret and comment on why is the argument with the nfl spokesman instead of with the law the nfl uses to threaten youtube the conventional wisdom is that these lawsuits and maneuvers are just tough negotiating tactics on the way to deals being struck and clarity emerging and maybe thats true but isnt there a better way to get to a middle ground than piecemeal negotiations that do nothing to address laws that both seem out of touch with technology and astray from their original intent walt mossberg wrote about the youtube wars last week and mourned the fact that the dmca and other laws serve media companies with a "get out of jail free card" for internet companies that would be conduits for copyrighted content he called for changes to copyright law that would give ordinary consumers some clarity about what they can and cant do right now that clarity is sorely lacking because no one involved in the making of current copyright law seems to speak for users like you and me and thats whats so fundamentally infuriating about the cablevision decision the flap over internet radio the argument over google book search and the weekly whack a mole of youtube takedowns in each case regular consumers who would benefit from new products or services have been reduced to voiceless bystanders mutely watching parade after parade of litigious foolishness and cynical negotiations through lawsuits who speaks for us when these laws are made and these cases come before judges why are we reduced to hoping the interests of a cable company radio conglomerate or internet giant temporary align with our own how much more of this must we endure before some fairness is restored and when that day finally arrives if it does at all what will we have lost write to me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
