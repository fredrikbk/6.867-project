love &amp money you pay tuition so do you pick the school to this day my dad still gives me a hard time about my dumbest plan ever the one in which i a high school senior would attend an obscure university to study astrophysics a university where astrophysics wasnt even a degree program i chose this school because a friend was moving to the city where the school was located so i tried to make up a parent friendly reason to attend the school astrophysics sounded plausible even respectable my dad laughs about it today just as he did back then only his laugh back then was followed by the warning that he wasnt paying good money for me to attend a third rate school to study a subject about which i had never shown the slightest interest and which the school wasnt known for my point isnt that he was right to shoot down my plans although he was my point is that he stepped in with a threat to revoke funding for college if i chose what he saw as a futile path and that raises a question parents and their kids regularly confront when mom and dad are footing the bill what say do they have in where their kids go to college do they have final say or is it their role simply to provide counseling but in the end still open their wallets no matter what lots of parents take the position that they get to pick the college threatening to close the checkbook if a kid insists on pursuing some throwaway degree from a university where party participation tops classroom attendance the case for parental authority seems pretty clear what parent wants to shell out tens of thousands of dollars on a degree that offers little hope for a more secure future sure kids are allowed to make mistakes in college they change classes they change majors they even change schools but no parent wants to fund a degree they feel certain beforehand has little promise its a waste of all that money you scrimped to save over all those years besides parents often do know best it would be hard to find a parent who doesnt have a tale about some clueless decision their year old child made certainly my father knew there was no inner astrophysicist screaming for release inside of me and yet what if my father had been wrong what if we parents are too quick to assume our life experiences are a better measure of our childrens potential success than what our kids know about themselves a few years ago the son of a longtime friend was accepted at one of the top public universities in the nation however the teen didnt want to go opting instead to head to a less prestigious school closer to home my friend initially considered threatening not to pay tuition for the lesser school hoping that withholding funding might alter his sons position ultimately my friend never made the threat even though he was certain his son would one day agree that he had made a terrible choice his son is just graduating and now wishes he had gone to a different school yet while his son learned a lesson so too did my friend his son he says "recognized in himself that he wasnt ready to be off on his own away from home he knew himself better than i did i now believe that if he had gone away he would not have done well and probably wouldnt have stayed if i had imposed that school on him i think things could have been worse than they are now " as my friend discovered its easy as a parent to say that this school is better than that school and this degree tops that degree but such arguments even if correct take place in a vacuum it ignores all the other factors swirling around in a kids head involving maturity emotion and desire as a parent you can rule those out and say "if its my money youre spending then youll go here " but it doesnt always mean youve done your child a favor given that my dad lived through this with me i sought his thoughts on what role parents should have his comments "look you dont have to go to harvard to be somebody but it does come down to the fact that this is the parents money youre spending you just want to cringe when your child wants to study some useless program at some throwaway school " my father also recognizes that saying that to your kids isnt the best approach think back to your own youth when your parents mocked your wants what did you do rebel feel belittled you dont want to make your child feel that way you want to make your point but you want to be smart about it so how do you do it my friend deanna in milwaukee has spent the years brainwashing her kids with visits to and chatter about the university of wisconsin which deanna and her husband attended though shed willingly pay for her kids to go elsewhere her efforts have paid off her oldest daughter wants to enroll there that only works over time though so it isnt likely to sway older kids who have already begun shaping their own thinking at that stage says my friend anne in minneapolis your role is to "guide and encourage kids " anne basically interviewed her son questioning him about the kind of college environment he sought what he might study and whether he wanted to stay closer to home or travel farther afield at that point i believe you should do homework on your own you research whether the various schools mentioned are good for the degree your child is interested in maybe youll find out that the school of choice isnt particularly strong in say astrophysics or that its low academic ranking would make it tough to get a job after graduation you hope to persuade your child to see the light but heres where i come down in the end its your money and you make the decision i want to empower my son to make his own choices of school and classes and degree but if he after all my efforts is dead set one day on wanting to pursue a marginal degree from a marginal school i will let him but he will do so without as much funding from me i now understand my dads position from all those years ago if youre going to make this kind of mistake youre going to learn about the financial repercussions the hard way jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal write him at lovemoney wsj com
