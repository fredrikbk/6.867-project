eyes on the road will your automobile become a tattle tale new technology research fosters debate over crash data and driver privacy online edition what if you had a bad auto accident and your car could automatically notify an emergency response team giving doctors detailed information about the force and direction of the collision and the speed at which the car was traveling that data could be crucial to guiding an ambulance crews decision about whether to rush you to a fully equipped level one trauma center says dr richard hunt of the center for disease control research by the cdc has shown that a severely injured person who is transported quickly to a level one trauma center has a better chance of survival "i know from clinical experience as an emergency physician this is a life or death decision " dr hunt says but what if after you survived the wreck that same technology turned tattle tale and divulged to police or the insurance company that you were speeding or driving recklessly thats one dilemma confronting consumers auto makers safety regulators and medical professionals as they sort out the potential rewards and risks of increasingly sophisticated "telematics" technology available in new vehicles the issue of how much a car should tell about driving behavior isnt new as insurers rental car firms police and plaintiffs lawyers have discovered that the "black boxes" that control safety systems can capture and store increasingly detailed data about vehicle behavior just before a crash the issue of who owns that data and what should be done with it has been on the table some privacy rights advocates have argued that what goes on with a car should stay in the car the national transportation safety board in contrast has urged that such black boxes be required in all vehicles in part so safety researchers and regulators can harvest data to guide decisions about new technology or engineering standards mindful of the potential pitfalls nhtsa has avoided coming down hard on one side or the other of the debate so far but framing the issue of privacy behind the wheel in terms of life or death changes the nature of the debate driving the discussion about telematics is general motors corp and its onstar subsidiary onstar an early and aggressive mover in the field of in vehicle communications or telematics is a key part of gms effort to rebuild its image as a technology leader for about a decade onstar equipped cars have had the capability to call when the cars airbag deployed giving the cars location to emergency response teams but now gm is launching a new generation of onstar with what the company calls advanced automatic crash notification or aacn this system has the ability to transmit more detailed information about the circumstances of a crash the direction of the impact whether the car rolled over the "delta v " or the change in speed and other data gm plans to put this advanced onstar system on about two million models and ramp up to three million vehicles for the model year says chet huber the president of onstar but gm isnt stopping there the company and the cdc announced last week that onstar and the gm foundation the auto makers charitable arm will indirectly fund work by the cdc to make it easier for doctors and emergency responders to make use of the aacn data from onstar gm is making a &# grant to the cdc foundation a nonprofit entity that can accept corporate donations to finance cdc studies the cdc isnt allowed to endorse any commercial products but with gms money the cdc can pay for a group of about experts in the fields of emergency medical response trauma care vehicle safety and related disciplines to work during the next year on how best to take the raw data from an onstar crash notification and translate it into something an emt racing to a wreck can understand dr hunt who will coordinate the panels study of how real time data about vehicle dynamics in a crash correlates to injury says hed like a system thats as simple to use as the interfaces developed for portable defibrillators in which a voice prompts the user to shock or not shock based on the softwares interpretation of the patients vital signs perhaps a display in an ambulance could read the raw data from a car and tell the emergency technicians "trauma center or not trauma center " he says dr hunt says specific data about a crash such as whether the forces came from the side which can cause more harm to the body are crucial as cars have become better engineered and padded inside its often not obvious just by looking at a crash victim that the person has suffered a dangerous internal injury he says onstar officials speaking at a conference in washington d c last week outlined a long term vision that every car sold should have advanced crash notification technology according to a report in automotive news gms work with the cdc and its ongoing discussions with federal safety regulators at nhtsa cant hurt progress toward that goal which would be a boon to gm cdc research that boosts the perceived value of telematics technology would be one more arrow in gms quiver as it seeks to generate demand for its service mr huber in an interview last week said "market forces are going to shape that leading vehicle manufacturers are going to need something in this space to maintain competitive positioning " onstar he notes has patents on its telematics technology dr hunt at the cdc is careful not to venture his own opinions about whether systems like those in the latest onstar should be mandatory but he says privacy issues are a concern to the cdc and to him as a healthcare provider "those privacy issues are real " he says but so are life and death decisions that could be made more quickly and appropriately with better data "how that is balanced is something we need to pay attention to " send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
