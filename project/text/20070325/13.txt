utilities power ahead as market revives as fears of a weakening global economy and concerns about subprime mortgage lending roiled wall street in recent weeks utility stocks held fairly steady theres a reason utilities have long been considered the ultimate safe harbor stocks traditional utilities with their fat dividends are the archetypal "widows and orphans" investments delivering steady income and regular if modest appreciation meanwhile a second type of utility company the flashier more growth oriented merchant power generator has flourished in the era of deregulated gas and electric rates mix in merger speculation and soaring power prices and investors could see the sector continue growing for some time to come the stock market bounced back strongly last week with the dow jones industrial average gaining and the nasdaq composite index rising the two benchmarks are back in the black for the year up and respectively meanwhile the dow jones utility average gained for the week bringing its year to date gain to even before counting dividends one factor pushing up utility prices in recent weeks an investor consortiums agreement in late february to acquire dallas based energy holding company txu txu for &# billion other stocks rose on speculation that more mergers are in the offing "people are kind of sniffing around the industry to see what kind of company would make the best acquisition " says judith saryan the manager of the &# billion eaton vance utilities fund meanwhile soaring power prices buoyed by an increase in demand for electricity and in the cost of natural gas have driven earnings growth across the sector over the past three years utilities have outperformed most other stock sectors over various time periods researcher morningstar says utility stocks returned over the month through thursday compared with an average loss of for all other sectors over the past five years utilities returned an average a year compared to for other industries all figures include dividends more risk averse investors should favor traditional utility companies which deliver electricity direct to consumers more aggressive investors can look to the merchant or independent power generation companies which own and operate power plants that sell their output to the wholesale market merchant power companies cant pass the cost of building power plants and generating electricity on to consumers in the form of rate increases when power prices fell sharply in following the collapse of enron independent power producers many of which had launched aggressive plans to build new natural gas fired plants landed in dire financial straits txu is one company that has both regulated and merchant operations but many other power companies sold off their riskier merchant businesses after the power market downturn leaving pure play regulated utility companies that are less vulnerable to declines in commodity prices with those lower risk regulated companies "were really looking at a return to the traditional grannies and orphans utility stocks " says jon kolb a senior equity analyst for zacks investment research in new york traditional utility stocks may prove particularly attractive to baby boomers who are looking for a steady stream of income in retirement but dont want to invest in the bond market says lowell miller the president of woodstock n y based miller howard investments and manager of the &# million total return utilities fund "theres this great wave of a new constituency for dividend producing stocks " he says as electricity demand grows the need for new power plants and transmission lines is likely to be a boon for utilities mr miller says regulators guarantee utility companies a healthy return on infrastructure investments companies like northeast utilities nu in berlin conn and american electric power aep in columbus ohio which have already won regulatory approval for large infrastructure projects are good bets he says new yorks consolidated edison ed could prove to be another strong bet in the utility sector according to zackss mr kolb coned has a solid position in the growing new york power market and zacks views the utility as a potential takeover target he says however some companies have become overvalued amid the hype about industry consolidation analysts say shares of txu rose dramatically after the buyout announcement constellation energy group ceg a baltimore based energy company similar in structure to txu has been trading well above morningstars fair value estimate both stocks however remain below the prices at which morningstar recommends selling another concern is how state regulators will respond to proposed utility acquisitions including the txu deal some proposed mergers between large utilities have been scuttled in the past amid opposition from regulators and lawmakers midsize utilities have had better luck in winning regulatory approval for mergers they have been "the biggest beneficiaries of consolidation " says miller howards mr miller companies such as great plains energy gxp and aquila ila two midwest energy holding companies that inked a merger agreement in february could see significant earnings growth from future acquisitions experts say consolidation is also expected among independent power generators "scale is clearly an advantage in the merchant power sector " says morningstar analyst paul justice bigger companies can fund large scale power plant projects and can own diversified power plant fleets merchant power companies with plants in growing electricity markets such as the northeast texas and california are poised to be at the forefront of stock gains in the sector mr justice says for example he points to nrg energy nrg in princeton n j which has valuable power generation assets in the northeast and california and a sizable portfolio in texas edison international eix an energy holding company based in rosemead calif is another attractive stock analysts say increasing natural gas prices and growing electricity demand have been a boon to edison which has a merchant coal fired power plant fleet that can generate power more cheaply than natural gas fueled plants can one thing to keep in mind if natural gas prices decline merchant power generators could find it more difficult to turn a profit email forum sunday wsj
