acer buys gateway bulks up for global fight the banding together of taiwan based personal computer maker acer inc and gateway inc of the u s underlines how crucial scale is in the consolidating global personal computer market where margins are thin and competition is increasing acers latest push into the u s also marks a new stage in one of the pc industrys biggest turnaround stories acer yesterday announced its &# million acquisition of irvine calif based gateway vaulting the combined company into the no spot in global pc market share by unit shipments the new acer would supplant chinas lenovo group ltd which rose to the third spot in the industry two years ago by purchasing the pc operations of international business machines corp "scale is important and will become even more important in the future " gianfranco lanci president of acer said in an interview he added that for the time being he planned to consolidate gateways supply chain into acers to gain efficiencies but keep gateway running as a separate company "this transaction provides the scale to compete in todays global market " acer chairman j t wang said on a conference call pc companies have their components built by suppliers that discount their prices based on the size of an order now hewlett packard co and dell inc which together accounted for more than of the u s pc market in can put in the biggest orders and get the biggest discounts they then often use such discounts to underprice their competition which helps maintain or increase their share the vicious cycle makes it nearly impossible for smaller pc players to compete profitably while gateway and acer were respectably sized their market shares were tiny compared with h p and dell together however the combined company would have had revenue of more than &# billion for and it expects to ship about million pcs this year executives said acer executives said they will continue to use the gateway and emachine brand names after the acquisition mr wang acknowledged the multibrand move is a "major change in corporate strategy" for single brand acer but he said it would be a strength to have three brands as it would enable the company to better target different segments of the consumer market mr lanci added "the other good reason is that the gateway brand is a very well recognized brand in the u s and we want to continue to leverage on the brand in the u s and to expand it outside the u s because we see opportunity in some emerging countries in asia " acer executives said they expect the union to save the combined company about &# million next year by giving it better purchasing power for components and by cost cuts through combining parts of overlapping operations like customer services gateway is in talks to sell its unit that sells pcs to education government and businesses the company has said under the terms of the deal acer will launch a cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of gateway for &# a share a premium to the closing price of gateways shares on the new york stock exchange on friday yesterday gateways shares rose cents to &# the companies said the deal was approved unanimously by the boards of both companies and is expected to close by december acer has been plotting an acquisition for about a year mr wang first disclosed the companys intention to do a deal in march though he didnt specify any possible targets monday he said acer and gateway have been in contact for some time but that serious discussions about the deal began about six weeks ago gateway decided to sell itself when its board determined that a combined acer gateway would benefit from greater scale and efficiencies making it more competitive said a person familiar with the matter the once highflying pc maker known for boxes with a cow hide print referring to the companys founding by ted waitt in an iowa farmhouse had in recent years been buffeted by stiff competition and declining sales its purchase once again narrows the ranks of u s pc manufacturers which once included powerhouses such as compaq computer corp nevertheless the u s still has the worlds two biggest makers hewlett packard and dell for acer a company that once made pcs for big name western brands and is now buying one the purchase marks a major though potentially risky step owning gateway which has roughly employees will dramatically increase acers foothold in the u s a market long dominated by dell and h p but where acer has been making some headway selling its laptop pcs through big retail chains like best buy co thats a contrast to the mid s when acer tried to grab market share in the u s before effectively retreating in later acers chairman mr wang jokingly called the u s the companys "land of sorrow " acer has since recovered and successfully pushed into europe where it is a dominant seller but while a combined acer and gateway would hold about a share of the u s pc market it still remains far smaller than h p and dell in the second quarter of this year h p had a share of the u s pc market while dell had overall a combined acer and gateway would have about of the global pc market compared with h ps and dells according to idc if the deal goes through managing three different brands could increase the complexity of acers operations retailers may want to condense the shelf space they allot to the brands for example now that theyre all owned by one company the new tie up could also strike a blow to chinas lenovo which in acquired ibms pc business and this year has been battling with acer for the industrys no spot earlier this month lenovo disclosed that it was in talks to buy a stake in packard bell bv a netherlands based pc maker but in a separate statement issued yesterday gateway appeared to throw cold water on those talks saying it intends to exercise a "right of first refusal" to acquire all the shares in packard bells parent company pb holding co gateway said it had acquired that right in june from john hui the chinese american businessman who owns packard bell gateway said it had recently received a notice from mr hui offering to sell all the shares of packard bells parent to gateway its unclear what the price would be lenovo says it remains interested in acquiring packard bell a packard bell spokesperson didnt immediately respond to requests for comment many analysts said they werent surprised gateway is being acquired the pc maker hit its peak in the late s with its quirky cow logo and gateway country retail stores however it suffered when competitors such as dell priced their wares more cheaply in gateway expanded into consumer electronics such as flat screen tvs but the efforts didnt bolster its sagging pc business by it had closed its stores and refocused on pcs its stock price which once hit &# has fallen around to its current level its unclear who will manage the gateway business and what happens to current chief executive ed
