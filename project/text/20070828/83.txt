smartmoney fund screen large company funds after several weeks of market swings it has become clear that nervous investors are getting out of riskier equity positions in favor of the apparent havens that funds investing in large company stocks can provide we just looked at these offerings at the beginning of the summer but we think it is a good time to review how they fit in a retirement account this week we tweaked our criteria a bit besides our usual performance and fee benchmarks we included tenure the funds had to have a manager who had been in place for at least five years in times like these it pays to have a person in charge who has seen this kind of a situation before in addition we looked for funds with median market capitalizations of &# billion or more using that piece of data allowed us to find funds that were invested in large and megacap companies these stocks are well suited to withstand any rough times because they are diversified and their revenues are usually generated not only in the u s but across the globe this cutoff lets us include multicap funds that would have been weeded out if we just searched the large cap growth or value categories multicaps can scour the entire market for good buys while funds carrying a large company growth or value label are somewhat confined that said we decided to include all three because they have proved themselves as worthy core holdings for now it appears multicap offerings have the edge over the long haul with an average annual return of in the past five years according to lipper two percentage points ahead of their large cap competitors but year to date and in the past month the race is dead even we limited our list to no load funds that were open to new money required a minimum investment of less than &# and charged an expense ratio under we further trimmed our list by looking for funds with three year and five year performance track records that put them in the top of their peer groups the funds also had to have a year to date gain of at least the tally recorded by the broad market so far in searching for safe havens these funds invest in large companies and are top performers in their categories  year year year to average average fund date annual annual managers ticker return return return tenure cgm focus cgmfx janus contrarian jsvax janus orion jornx bridgeway aggressive investors ii braix amana trust income amanx st source monogram income equity fmiex cgm mutual lommx amer cen strat asset allocation aggress twsax fidelity stock selector fdssx gamco growth gabgx note data as of august source lipper
