lessons learned from doctors patients and my mother when my mother was diagnosed with a life threatening cancer a few summers ago she was convinced that my knowledge of the medical system would help save her part of me believed it too i have spent the past eight years writing this column which is predicated on the belief that we all have the power to take charge of and improve our health usually we make health decisions about everyday issues like the foods we eat and how much we exercise but sometimes theres more at stake in the course of doing research for my job ive been inspired by a number of people who facing a serious health problem have armed themselves with information and lived to tell the tale theres jan guthrie of conway ark who has researched treatment options in her year battle against ovarian cancer barry fitzpatrick a rancho santa fe calif attorney cast a wide net to find a skilled houston surgeon to remove a rare and risky brain tumor they used information to navigate the health system find the best doctors and treatments and beat the odds i knew it was possible but the odds my mother faced were daunting she was diagnosed with esophageal adenocarcinoma a deadly cancer fueled by years of acid reflux the day before our first mother daughter vacation my mom had choked on her lunch and was having trouble swallowing i was already in florida but she was certain she would be delayed by only a day but two days later i was boarding a plane to dallas instead the choking episode had been caused by a tumor blocking her esophagus we knew my mothers chances of stalling her cancer were slim but we also believed her best hope was to find a doctor we trusted we asked other doctors where they would go and they all recommended the same oncologist unfortunately he wasnt taking new patients so we saw one of his colleagues after he covered the basics of my mothers treatment i asked him about new targeted therapies being studied for esophageal cancer he shook his head in annoyance "i can tell someone has been spending time on the internet " he said dismissively i was stunned but my mother was emboldened she explained boasted actually that i was a journalist it was clear from his expression that being a member of the media lowered his estimation of me the experience rattled me and even made me question the premise of this column after all im not a doctor is it naive to think that taking charge and arming yourself with information can change the course of someones health my mother left the appointment wishing she could see the first recommended doctor she knew him from a consultation years earlier after breast cancer surgery i clapped my hands suddenly realizing that this doctor wouldnt view her as a new patient we called his nurse who found a file on my mom and set up an appointment the recommended oncologist was caring and communicative he answered my questions about new treatments most important he was interested in my mother her children and grandchildren and the fact that she wanted to aggressively battle her disease after just a few treatments her cancer had all but disappeared from her body we were hopeful but the cancer eventually rebounded with a vengeance less than nine months after the diagnosis my mother entered hospice care her confidence in her doctor gave my mom an unwavering calm as she faced death "you just have to let me go " she told me she died a few weeks later in recent weeks i have been reflecting on the power of information to improve our health although health journal will continue to appear in this space every week this is the last time i will write it im grateful to the many doctors health researchers and patients who have shared their stories and knowledge over the years and even though my mother didnt beat the odds her illness affirmed my belief that everyone has the power to take control of their health taking charge didnt save my mothers life but it made the end of her life better and gave all of us confidence in her care and the choices she made in the last weeks of her life my mom encouraged me to keep arming readers with the best weapon they can have against both disease and a sometimes unyielding health care system and thats information she believed just as i do in the power of information to save a life even if it wasnt her own email tpp wsj com join my online forum at wsj com health
