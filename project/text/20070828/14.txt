business technology trialpay helps turn browsers into buyers start up has high rate of success getting people to pay for online content with so many products on the internet available free it can be tough to persuade people to pay for online content last year zagat survey llc found a way around that zagat which sells popular city restaurant guides and also has a web site began bolstering its ranks of paying online subscribers with new electronic commerce technology from a company called trialpay inc the technology lets zagat lure new users with a tantalizing offer if they accept another unrelated marketing pitch such as taking out a new credit card or spending &# at gap inc they get a free subscription to the zagat web site zagat sends the offers by email to people who have registered to use its site but arent paying subscribers the messages announce a "unique offer" to get a free zagat web subscription if customers are "interested in any of the partners were working with " zagat online marketing manager ryan charles says consumers who click on a button in the email are taken to a zagat web page to see specific offers from various vendors the gambit is paying dividends for zagat mr charles says about of those who open the new email offers from his company sign up for one it is a "huge huge conversion rate " higher than some other zagat marketing campaigns mr charles says even better is that zagat gets paid by the partner web merchants for directing business their way sometimes even more than the &# cost of a yearly zagat subscription mr charles says trialpay of mountain view calif orchestrates the whole process behind the scenes using algorithms to tee up targeted marketing offers and handle all the payments the little known start up is backed by investors including battery ventures index ventures and former america online president bob pittman it has more than corporate customers including software company winzip part of corel corp and online photo and video site photobucket inc says alex rampell trialpays year old founder and chief executive many of trialpays customers sell nontangible "digital goods" that can be hard to persuade people to pay for the unprofitable firm has about employees and annual revenue of more than &# million mr rampell says the logic behind trialpay which started last year isnt complicated while people who wont pay for zagats online service or premium new york times crossword puzzles on the web are "bad customers" for those companies they are "good customers for something else " he says the trick is presenting them with the right marketing offer at the right time it involves luck and a lot of math not dissimilar to the algorithms google inc uses to match advertisers with web searches trialpay correctly pegged rebecca choy a year old honolulu engineer who used the service earlier this summer when she balked at forking over &# for a copy of winzip the popular file compression software product available on the web she got it free when she used trialpay to connect to a web site called petcarerx com where she bought about &# in flea treatments and other products for her cats and dog she says the price tag was high because she was buying a full year supply of treatments she says winzip has been using trialpay almost a year and "were very pleased with the results " says craig kallin winzips director of e commerce and marketing but trialpay and other web marketing companies face a challenge in recruiting new customers for web merchants without violating their privacy or sending them email spam trialpay competes with other online marketing outfits such as webloyalty com inc and adteractive inc though webloyalty mainly offers rewards for customers after they make online purchases not before adteractive buys online keywords and other ads to generate leads for customers mr rampell says trialpay which has had million individual consumers use its service rarely encounters customer complaints most occur when people dont receive their free software or other products quickly enough sometimes because an order confirmation was blocked by an email spam filter sometimes orders can be held up by snags such as a credit check for a new credit card trialpay also works to offer customers products and services specifically targeted to them when shoppers enter their names and addresses to start the payment process on a web site trialpay can see if a customer is a man or a woman for instance and send them specific offers such as lancome cosmetics for women people using the firefox web browser instead of microsofts industry standard internet explorer are pegged as especially tech savvy and receive offers for high tech products mr rampell says trialpay even knows if you have broadband or not "if you have dial up access well show you different ads for a high speed internet connection " he says for companies such as zagat which has struggled to find the right mix of paid versus free content on its web site trialpay has helped "its boosting traffic its getting more people to come to the site and getting them involved in the site " zagats mr charles says when zagat first went online in the sites content was mainly free three years later zagat decided to charge consumers for the information and then a year ago the site offered a significant amount of information free to "registered users" such as restaurant menus and new reader discussion forums but held back the sites core reviews and ratings for paid subscribers "every subscription counts and helps " says mr charles who declined to reveal subscriber or revenue details in general the share of consumers visiting an e commerce web site who buy something is "extremely low " often less than says roger lee a partner at battery ventures in menlo park calif and a trialpay director he calls trialpay "a very creative way to increase the conversion rate "
