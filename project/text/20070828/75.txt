rich alumni stiff elite alma maters give to needier colleges princeton chicago graduates donate millions to lake forest bargain for name on a building laurence lee is the sort of alumnus that the university of chicago craves with two degrees from the school and plenty of money that he is looking to give away but when chicago solicits mr lee for donations he says he thinks to himself "what do they need me for what difference can i make when they already have billions " instead of contributing much to chicago where he earned bachelors and law degrees mr lee who is retired gave &# million to a school he never attended lake forest college a small liberal arts school located in the chicago suburb where he lives its endowment is about &# million just over of university of chicagos &# billion mr lee says he hasnt totaled the amount he has given to chicago over the years but describes it as "a modest annual gift for the hell of it " "my money means a lot more to lake forest " he says mr lee is among a rising cohort of philanthropists who are eschewing their richly endowed alma maters in favor of schools with meager resources turned off by massive endowments at the nations top schools they seek to make a greater impact at less wealthy institutions they are probably also aware of a fringe benefit getting your name on a building is a cheaper proposition at schools not accustomed to seven figure donations contributions to higher education by nonalumni rose last year to &# billion according to the council for aid to education in new york in comparison alumni gave &# billion to their own schools the council says a review of the councils data indicates that less prosperous schools are more likely to rely on gifts from outside their alumni base than their own graduates colleges with modest endowments are stepping up their pitch to nonalumni who graduated from more moneyed schools steven d schutt president of lake forest says he tells potential donors "your return on investment is going to be greater here than at places like harvard or yale a million dollars gets lost in an endowment of three or five or &# billion " mr schutt was formerly a vice president at the university of pennsylvania which has a &# billion endowment last week harvard university announced that its endowment by far the largest in higher education had grown to &# billion last fiscal year the cambridge mass university which is continuing to solicit donations says it needs the resources to ensure future growth and to support operating expenses at its schools but harvard is aware that some potential donors may question the universitys claim it still needs financial gifts materials distributed to harvards fund raising volunteers include a response to the question "does harvard really need more money with such a large endowment " the suggested answer begins "yes " it goes on to note that much of the universitys endowment carries spending restrictions and that some parts of the university including information technology have "little or no existing endowment" and require alumni donations to meet annual expenses members of the "billion dollar club " as schools with endowments of that size are sometimes known rely heavily on alumni gifts princeton which has one of the largest endowments per student in the country receives about two thirds of its donated money each year from graduates of the school well over the nationwide figure of "the bond between alumni and their schools is possibly the strongest donor charity bond in all of philanthropy " says ann e kaplan director of caes annual survey of giving to colleges and universities experts in higher education philanthropy say several factors drive alumni donations not all of them altruistic donors may have emotional attachments or feel they owe something to the schools they attended some also are seeking an advantage in admissions for their children that many colleges and universities offer to major alumni donors poorly endowed schools are trying to break that bond by arguing they are in greater need of money some including cleveland state university in ohio and the university of the cumberlands in williamsburg ky have begun giving potential donors copies of a july opinion piece in the chronicle of higher education that made the case for more parity in donations "when your alma mater is already fabulously wealthy it is advisable indeed wise to shun your sentimental attachment to the institution and adopt other institutions that can yield better returns " wrote steve o michael a professor of higher education administration at ohios kent state university in an interview he said that data show schools with smaller endowments are more efficient in their use of resources lake forest with students has an endowment that is less than half the per student average for private baccalaureate colleges the schools alumni giving rate also lags behind its peers but lake forest has found other bonds with donors successfully tapping its surrounding community an affluent town of the same name about miles north of chicago very few residents of lake forest ill graduated from lake forest college but they have been generous nonetheless james p gorter who served as chairman of the schools board says he hasnt donated very much to his alma mater princeton but he has given "several millions of dollars" to lake forest a &# million gift he made this year funds a professor of islamic studies "living in the middle west i dont have much contact anymore with princeton " says mr gorter a former partner of goldman sachs group inc in its investment banking division "my kids went to duke i lived right near lake forest those are the places i feel a connection to " mr lee who made his fortune as the top attorney for abbott laboratories based in abbott park ill says his emotional ties to the university of chicago waned as it amassed "its fancy endowment " which has tripled in the past decade the school is at the tail end of a &# billion capital campaign a spokesman for chicago wouldnt respond to mr lees comments chicago is naming a new performing arts center after reva and david logan for their &# million donation this year new buildings at princeton and harvard recently were named after donors who gave respectively &# million and &# million mr lee got his name added to lake forests library after donating a &# million gift to renovate the building he also has been awarded an honorary degree and serves as a life trustee he says he didnt give to lake forest for the recognition "but it does go to show that you can get a lot more accomplished at a smaller school you can see it happen and you get some credit for it "
