enterprise voluntary pricing lets small eateries give and get back generous payments of some patrons offset meals for the needy terra bite lounge has no prices listed on its wall menu the kirkland wash coffee shops customers pay what and whenever they like and leave the money in a locked box on the counter ervin peretz one of the cafes founders figures that generous patrons cover the tabs of those who pay less than whats fair and the business saves money by not having to pay for workers or services to handle financial transactions the approach has allowed terra bite to both make money and help out those who cant always afford a good meal "were not nearly as selfless as a soup kitchen " says the year old mr peretz who also works as a lead software development engineer for google inc "were able to operate without charity " such a business model contradicts the basic concept of running a business the exchange of goods for a set amount of money but a crop of eateries and shops in utah colorado washington and other places are finding that doing away with set prices and making payment voluntary can be both a profitable and charitable way of doing business and the marketing buzz such a scheme generates can help a business stand out from the pack while such a social and business experiment can be financially risky it can draw the kind of clientele that understands the concept and therefore contributes appropriately and its a model that can work beyond the food industry "you can encourage people to donate as much as they want " says sandeep krishnamurthy associate professor of e commerce and marketing at the university of washington at bothell campus "and if you do that to the right audience in the right way what ends up happening is that you save money by not having to invest in a large paid staff or credit card services and people feel good that youre trusting them so much and i think youre going to end up seeing people giving good sums of money " tina cooper a year old real estate agent says she pays above what she would normally pay for her morning double soy latte at terra bite at least &# "i feel like some people might not pay so i pay a little bit more " she says "i want to be more than fair " terra bite averages about customers a day with an average &# to &# payment per person mr peretz says the shop makes substantially less per food item than other establishments but terra bite has been breaking even operationally since it opened in november it also keeps costs low by having just one paid barista per shift terra bites employee handbook even stresses the point of not suggesting a price to customers whats ok to say "we dont have set prices you can pay what you feel is right " banned words "free tips donation and contribution " a barista tip jar isnt even allowed "we depend on public honesty " mr peretz says "but were also a demonstration of that high level of public honesty " but can the good karma model be a smart long term business strategy its worked for one world cafe in salt lake city which has been serving an ever changing menu of organic fare for the past four years the business has been profitable since and is on track to bring in revenue of &# this year with about a profit margin customer payments averages about &# denise cerreta a former acupuncturist and founder of the cafe says the business helps in her mission to end hunger but the cafe is a "hand up not a hand out " she says meaning that people down in their luck may not be able to pay now but theyll eventually pay later in resolving the businesss tax obligations had been taken off the total amount collected each day but the cafe recently received a nonprofit designation from the internal revenue service and a foundation now serves to manage the cafe and promote its pay what you think system around the country ms cerreta plans to move to new york in the fall to open up a similar cafe concept brad and libby birky who have day jobs as a computer technician and teacher respectively have already tapped ms cerretas experience the couple who were regular soup kitchen volunteers say they didnt quite know how to pursue their dream of providing a healthier option than soup kitchen fare to those who couldnt afford a good meal then they stumbled upon oneworldeverybodyeats org the site of ms cerretas foundation ms cerreta moved to denver for a month to advise the birkys on starting same so all may eat cafe a not for profit eatery the couple opened in october same is a volunteer run establishment with a donation box and a rotating menu of soup salad and pizza and no set prices to give some guidance to diners however small posted signs alert consumers what a fair price for a full meal would be &# to &# mr birky says about customers come in each day dropping about &# to &# per visit the business is doing a little better than breaking even he says "its been pretty gratifying to prove doubters that were right " he says "and that people arent always out to rip you off or go get something for nothing " but the pay what you think model doesnt always pay off the six restaurant in carbondale colo ran a "pay what you think" event at the end of october for four years where the regular contemporary american menu including pan roasted angus filet with madeira reduction was stripped of prices mark fischer the restaurants owner and chef says customers embraced the idea check averages were identical to priced menu dinners about &# per person with wine but last year he says customers view of the event completely changed patrons who didnt want to underpay or afraid to overpay were dumbfounded and servers were uncomfortable "i felt bad for everybody involved because the energy was kind of odd " mr fischer says the restaurant has shelved this years event
