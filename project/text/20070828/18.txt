have been fortunate in my investments and all of my contributions have been my money " mr hsu in an email last night wrote "i have never asked a single favor from any politician or any charity group if i am not asking favors why do i have to cheat ive asked friends and colleagues of mine to give money out of their own pockets and sometimes they have agreed " lawrence barcella a washington

sometimes dont even appear to be aware of such payments executed on their behalf the law also raised penalties for infractions and included the prospect of prison sentences for offenders for the first
