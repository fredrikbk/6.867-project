making all the right enemies tough liberal by richard d kahlenberg columbia university press pages &# it is odd and perhaps unfortunate that albert shanker may be remembered principally as the man who in as head of the new york city teachers union shut down the citys schools with a series of strikes it was all in a good cause to be sure but the controversy of that episode over the years has stolen drama from much else of note in shankers long and admirable life as richard kahlenberg reminds us in "tough liberal " a thoroughly researched and engaging biography shanker was a charismatic labor leader at a time of union decline a powerful voice for educational reform at a time of bureaucratic complacency and not least an eloquent advocate of an aggressive pro democratic american foreign policy at a time of defeatism and retreat shankers convictions derived from his early experiences as the child of poor hard working jewish immigrants in new york his father labored long hours delivering newspapers his mother worked knitting garments and young al a frequent target of anti semitic assaults found solace in schoolwork and in his role as an avid and skillful high school debater he went on to get an undergraduate degree in philosophy at the university of illinois and in the early s pursued a doctorate at columbia it was not long after that he began teaching in new yorks schools and organizing teachers into a single powerful union for shanker the promise of american democracy meant public schools trade unions the aspirations of the new deal and the tenets of cold war liberalism an outlook that was in mr kahlenbergs words "tough minded about human nature the way the world works and the reality of evil " he functioned throughout his life in a decidedly liberal environment but he was often at odds with american liberalism especially as it evolved in the late s and s he came to oppose multiculturalism bilingual education racial preferences and post vietnam doubts about americas positive role in the world like others of his generation shanker drew inspiration from the civil rights movement he joined the congress of racial equality at a young age and championed the civil rights protests throughout the s and early s but during the late s his integrationist convictions clashed with the demands of black radicals for control of the new york city schools the schools had long been governed by a system of centralized control under a single citywide board of education in radicals led by a thuggish activist named sonny carson claimed that black children were the victims of cultural genocide and demanded local control of the schools in the hope that carsons own movement could install its members as administrators and teachers shanker with his union members argued that such a program would undermine americas integrationist ideal and threaten the idea of a common school for all the epicenter of the conflict was ocean hill brownsville an impoverished black neighborhood in brooklyn racial polarization and bitter charges and countercharges went on for weeks punctuated by anti semitic rhetoric from some of the community control advocates white teachers were threatened and occasionally roughed up shanker led his union in a series of crippling strikes eventually a mild form of school decentralization was agreed to far different from the community control advocated by the radicals and the schools returned to a semblance of normality in short shanker won but the whole episode for him spoke volumes about the troubled fate of liberal ideals under the pressure of radical imperatives he was particularly disturbed by the episodes political implications he saw new york mayor john v lindsay perhaps a bellwether for other american political leaders forging a coalition of white elites at the top and minorities at the bottom that would govern at the expense of the middle class such a coalition shanker felt would undermine liberalism as a universalist creed inevitably he was vilified as a racist for his views the columnist jimmy breslin went so far as to say that shanker was "an accent away from george wallace " like daniel patrick moynihan whose report on the dysfunctions of the black family had earned him similar calumny shanker found that there were risks to challenging the racial orthodoxies of the day nonetheless he emerged from the new york school wars as a powerful national figure in the years that followed he devoted himself primarily to building up the status and influence of the american federation of teachers aft whose membership grew from in to one million members by the mid s he also became a kind of public intellectual writing columns and giving speeches about all sorts of subjects from foreign policy to the anti americanism of american history textbooks union power then as now can easily be used to protect privilege and entrench the status quo indeed the national education association the larger rival to the aft has an appalling record of resistance to reform shanker by contrast emerged as a leader in the reform movement advocating among other things stiffer standards for students and regular testing for teachers he consistently opposed vouchers however shanker worried that the dramatic decline in the performance of american schoolchildren if left unchecked would have catastrophic effects on individual lives and no less important erode social support for the public schools shanker always regarded the american public school as a key institution of democracy the one place where different groups might come together to learn what it means to be american without it he believed america would devolve into a balkanized society with few common ideals obviously many of the problems that vexed shanker are still with us and little wonder the challenge of sustaining a robust democracy under conditions of racial ethnic and religious differences is enormous public schools especially in the inner city are far from thriving today the performance levels of american schoolchildren are far from high and the balkanization that shanker resisted sometimes seems more real than ever yet shanker was an optimist to the end he died of cancer in at the age of he never stopped believing in americas promise mr puddington is director of research at freedom house and author of "lane kirkland champion of american labor "
