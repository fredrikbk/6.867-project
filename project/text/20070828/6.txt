cash all gone in caspian big oil fights ice lethal fumes and kazakhs officials suspend work in vast kashagan field a new balance of power kashagan kazakhstan on an island in the caspian sea the hub of the worlds largest oil development project a thousand men in orange jumpsuits train for catastrophe oil in the kashagan field here is potentially lethal with high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide gas so workers carry oxygen canisters and gas detectors and do daily evacuation drills high tech getaway boats stand ready to whisk them to safety the place feels more like a hazardous chemical plant than an oil rig "one breath would kill you " says offshore installation manager ian king since an unlikely alliance of western oil companies received rights to drill for oil here a decade ago theyve struggled to cope with a combination of rig wrecking ice packs bone chilling winters and noxious high pressure gases yesterday the consortiums bid to exploit one of the worlds top oil deposits encountered its biggest challenge yet kazakhstans government stung by delays and rising costs suspended the groups permit for the field halting work there for the next three months "from today work on kashagan will be frozen " said a kazakh official it wasnt immediately clear whether the project had been shut down the fields operator italys eni spa declined to comment saying only that consortium representatives were meeting yesterday with local authorities sources close to the negotiations said the delay was an attempt by the kazakh government to pressure eni and squeeze additional money out of the project the days wrangling added yet another layer of complexity to kashagan a field that shows the increasingly hostile environment encountered by western energy companies in pursuit of crude with the era of easy oil long gone and international demand climbing to new heights the majors are focusing on increasingly remote and hazardous corners of the globe the ultradeep waters of the gulf of mexico and offshore west africa are big oils new frontiers the rewards are potentially huge kashagan discovered in in kazakhstans sector of the caspian was the worlds largest oil find in years in production there is expected to plateau at million barrels of crude a day more than the output of established producers angola or qatar but such projects are also pushing the majors technical capabilities to the limit often leading to holdups and soaring costs that in turn is testing the patience of host countries which see their payday recede with every fresh delay as their frustration grows so does the petro nationalism that has shifted the balance of power between western oil majors and oil producing nations kashagan is a prime example under eni the original production start up date had been pushed back from to the end of earlier this year eni announced that the cost of the fields initial phase would be &# billion rather than the &# billion it had previously flagged oil majors blame rising costs on a shortage of skilled engineers and project managers soaring steel prices and expensive leases for new drilling rigs kazakhstan was unconvinced "when costs increase by by thats one thing " kazakh prime minister karim masimov said in an interview earlier this month projected costs over the year life of the project he said had increased to &# billion from &# billion "when they rise by two and a half times either the planning was wrong or the execution is wrong or it was deliberate " kashagan is now increasingly resembling another energy project that fell victim to its hosts rising assertiveness sakhalin in russias far east when royal dutch shell plc announced costs at sakhalin had nearly doubled russian environmental regulators began bombarding it with complaints they ended their campaign only when shell ceded a majority stake in the project to a kremlin run gas company rising out of the caspian sea some miles offshore kashagan is breathtaking in its scale its center is an island set in a shallow lagoon and enclosed by an atoll of long curved reefs on closer inspection the islands and reefs turn out to be man made artificial defenses against a destructive sea "this is not like the arabian desert where you just extract the oil and put it in a pipe " says paolo campelli enis head of operations in kazakhstan as his helicopter touches down on island d the heart of the kashagan operation locals have long known of oil deposits in the caspian the soviets carried out seismic tests there but lacked the technology to drill offshore focusing instead on easier fields in siberia soon after the soviet union collapsed in the newly independent kazakhstan invited foreign oil companies to bid for exploration rights in november a group of western oil majors clinched a deal with the kazakh government to develop reserves in the northern caspian consortium members included agip a unit of eni statoil asa of norway mobil corp of the u s now part of exxon mobil corp shell frances total sa and britains bp plc and bg group plc signed in washington the pact sealed kazakhstans emergence as one of the worlds next energy giants at the time the country lacked the know how money and manpower to operate big complex projects on its own most of its petroleum engineers had been russian and a lot of them fled in the chaos of kazakhstan lured foreign companies with production sharing agreements or psas special deals under which companies bear all exploration development and production costs but can recover them before having to share much revenue with the government the more costs go up the longer the host government has to wait for its share of the income as kazakhstan was to discover named for a th century kazakh poet kashagan was unusual rarely have so many big rival companies all with similar size stakes been partners in a single consortium "you had to wear a helmet in meetings " says one person close to the consortium "it was far from friendly " there were also the challenges of the kashagan deposit itself its buried about miles beneath the seabed under pressures of roughly times that of the atmosphere at sea level extracting the oil requires costly stress resistant pipes as well as powerful compressors to pump the noxious gases back below the sea also the caspian here is like a shallow wading pool that freezes over for nearly five months of the year in winter the wind whips up mounds of pack ice that can destroy a conventional oil rig "weve had experience with hydrogen sulfide low temperatures and high pressure but never all together " says mr campelli the eni official the consortium faced hurdles from the beginning shell delegated by its partners to lead the exploration phase decided to use a huge swamp barge from nigeria to drill for oil it was taken to louisiana and refitted for frigid conditions then chopped into pieces and sent halfway around the world to landlocked kazakhstan the barge had to be towed across the atlantic through the black sea and up russias volga don canal to the caspian port of astrakhan there it was reassembled and extended with pontoonlike structures until it was the size of a football field it all took months longer than planned in astrakhan fires destroyed equipment and tools were stolen some of shells partners nicknamed kashagan "cash all gone " shell declined to comment finally in july the majors struck oil lots of it it was the biggest discovery since alaskas prudhoe bay in with recoverable reserves of some billion barrels but the other members of the consortium had lost patience with shell and decided to choose a new field operator exxon mobil total shell and enis agip all vied for the job a long struggle ensued as contenders presented their rival designs say participants "everyone was blackballing everyone else " said one oil executive familiar with the negotiations eni the smallest of the four was the compromise option after winning the most votes in the selection contest it took over as operator in february as it began work eni sought cost estimates from oil industry consultants they all declined "they said there were no benchmarks for an offshore field like kashagan " says mr campelli enis challenge was figuring out how to drill for kashagans oil without using normal rigs which would collapse in icy waters its solution was to house the production platforms on an archipelago of artificial islands kazakhstan annoyed that enis plan promised a delay beyond the original start up date rejected it a month face off ensued the short summer construction seasons of and came and went with little work done in february kazakhstan approved enis proposal under which oil was to start flowing in the government imposed a &# million fine on the partners for every year kashagans production was postponed beyond the kazakh government continued to apply pressure when bg said it wanted out of the consortium in and arranged to sell its stake to two chinese companies the other members exercised their preemption rights intending to divide the stake between them but the kazakh national oil company kmg stepped in and laid claim to half the bg stake for itself that led to still more negotiations further slowing work the uncertainty was compounded by the partners doubts about kmgs ability to finance its share of the projects mounting costs the kazakh company was admitted to the consortium in may meanwhile eni started building islands it dumped more than four million tons of rock on the seabed secured it with steel piles and covered it with concrete slabs gradually pontoonlike modules and helipads were added the larger of the two islands d was surrounded by reeflike barriers to protect against ice environmental issues weighed heavily on the project enclosed waters such as the caspian are seen as more vulnerable to damage from spills than open seas where crude is more easily dispersed by currents winds and tides also kashagan is in a nature reserve and breeding ground for rare caspian seals and caviar yielding sturgeon including the endangered beluga on the consortiums initiative eni collects all discharges dirty drilling debris as well as run off rain water and sends it for processing to a logistics base on the caspian shore still local environmentalists say kashagan related pollution is behind the deaths of hundreds of baby seals in the area this year eni denies any link more immediate eni believed was the threat of hydrogen sulfide leaks "ive worked in doha where the hs content of the oil was and that was dangerous " says mr king manager of island d "here its " eni commissioned a fleet of four ibeevs ice breaking emergency evacuation vessels in case workers need to flee evacuees enter through an air lock are given personal co scrubbers that filter carbon dioxide from the air of the crowded boat and then move into sealed compartments "it can run on its own air supply for minutes enough to escape a gas cloud " mr king says "it cuts through the ice like a knife " eni also came up with a way to divert the toxic gas it installed compressors capable of re injecting it back into the oil reservoir at a pressure virtually unheard of in the industry bars or times the pressure inside a car tire in a hitch emerged eni discovered that its staff living quarters were to be located too close to island ds treatment plant which cleanses the oil of impurities and reinjects the hs that meant they were at risk of being exposed to a gas leak eni reconfigured its plans all of this flowed through to the timetable and price tag in february eni broke the news kashagans initial phase would cost &# billion nearly double its original estimate oil would start flowing two years later than billed in company officials blamed the overrun on the weak dollar inflation in the industry the lack of benchmarks for the project and the expense of changing island ds layout enis chief executive paolo scaroni was unapologetic "what is really crucial in a project of this kind is to be sure not to make mistakes particularly because the natural environment is so sensitive " he said in an interview the rest of the consortium fumed "theres bitterness about the way eni has handled this " says alex turkeltaub of frontier strategy group a consulting firm that has advised some of the other kashagan partners in the past "theyve misled the market with remarkable consistency about the production start up and costs " consortium members declined to comment referring all questions to eni eni tried to sugar the pill by stressing kashagans size company officials have revised upwards their estimates for peak production to million barrels a day from million barrels "the more we look at kashagan the more we realize that this is a super supergiant " said mr scaroni "this is a field thats going to last until " industry insiders note one benefit from the delays they have given eni and its partners more time to figure out how to get kashagans oil out of landlocked kazakhstan and onto world markets kashagan is one of the few megaprojects in the world without a dedicated pipeline there are currently two running from the western shore of the caspian one to russias black sea coast and another to the turkish port of ceyhan on the mediterranean both would need to be expanded to accommodate kashagans oil another export pipeline from kazakhstan to china also has limited capacity perhaps the most direct route would be across iran to the persian gulf a plan that regional analysts say would likely be unacceptable to the u s government at the end of june eni presented its revised figures to the kazakh government the reaction came a month later and it was furious in an interview in his office in kazakhstans new capital astana prime minister masimov said eni should be fired as the fields operator eni he said had breached the agreements terms overall costs had ballooned that meant kazakhstan would have to wait much longer for its share of proceeds from kashagans oil delaying construction of schools and hospitals "thats going to provoke a lot of resentment " he said yesterday the consortium was subjected to a barrage of reprimands kazakh authorities said they were suspending the consortiums nature use permit one of many licenses it requires to operate meaning work on the project would have to be halted for three months a probe would be launched into unidentified consortium officials for alleged customs violations and the operator would be sued for breaching fire safety rules at its oil and gas processing facility observers see the announcements as an attempt to put pressure on eni as the two sides started yesterday what is expected to be months of hard bargaining kazakh officials say they want to revisit the terms of the production sharing agreement aiming to secure a larger take "the balance of economic interests has been upset and to our detriment " said mr masimov enis shares closed down at the end of trading in milan most analysts say kashagans risks have long been priced in mr scaroni enis ceo still hopes that kashagan will catapult eni to the major league of companies capable of operating big technically complex fields "this has been a transforming operation for us " he says "eni is a different company to what it was before kashagan " mr masimov is unimpressed "sometimes you wonder whether the investors really want kashagan to happen at all " he says international oil companies could profit from high prices on world markets he suggests by leaving such a large deposit in the ground "do they need our oil or is it just a game "
