the wonder who is stevie lake tahoe nev you hear stevie wonders influence everywhere in contemporary pop and r&amp b the use of synthesized polyrhythms lyrics that report on inner city life romantic ballads that soar to their peak if we cant say mr wonder invented these staples of todays scene lets agree that no ones ever done them better as a vocalist his impact is unsurpassed r&amp b singer and producer raphael saadiq once told me "everybody who has a tone tries to sing like stevie " todays r&amp b and hip hop stars see him as a man who rose from motowns stable of artists to seize control of his own musical destiny as a songwriter producer and performer as such hes the model for the pop entrepreneur while mr wonders influence is ubiquitous he isnt his current tour which began in san diego on aug is his first in years hes done the occasional one off benefit and private performance its a curiously brief tour only dates in small and midsize venues including two at wineries in late summer as vacations end and students head back to school but to my mind any opportunity to see mr wonder perform is an event given his gift and how hes presented it for four decades i attended the second show on the tour on saturday at harveys lake tahoe casino and resorts outdoor stage as excited as ive been for a show in years though not without some trepidation mr wonders most recent album of new material s "a time love" motown was his first in a decade and was fairly tepid at least by his high standards that and his lengthy absence from the stage hinted at a cooling passion though mr wonder is only years old and seems in robust health two web sites dedicated to him www steviewonder net and www steviewonder com suggest neglect compare them to sites associated with some of his greatest contemporaries www bobdylan com www bobmarley com or www paulmccartney com for example and youll insist he deserves the kind of lovingly comprehensive overview these others receive but as the moon rose over heavenly mountain and the garish glass and steel casinos and hotels mr wonder arrived onstage and quickly dispelled any fears that his fire has diminished joined by his daughter aisha morris a singer who made her recording debut as a newborn less than minute old on "isnt she lovely " on her fathers album "songs in the key of life" mr wonder took a moment to thank the audience and dedicate the tour to his late mother then he sat with his daughter at a grand piano and performed a flawless "loves in need of love today " it was a touching moment and one that foreshadowed the intensity of the evenings performance backed by musicians mr wonder easily shifted from ballads to crackling up tempo numbers of the former "visions" and "overjoyed" allowed him to display his prowess as a singer especially in the upper register using his characteristic flights of note bending vocalese known as melisma with seeming ease blaming mr wonder for the overused often poorly executed melisma in todays "american idol" school of pop singing would be as off the mark as blaming miles davis for smooth jazz a good idea done well by some has been bludgeoned into cliche by the imitative and less gifted in "golden lady " which simmered with an undertone reminiscent of "mercy mercy me" by marvin gaye mr wonders former drummer and motown colleague and in "ribbon in the sky " he pushed the technique to an extreme challenging the band especially bassist nathan watts to find a way to respond the up tempo songs from his mid s albums reminded us how mr wonder blended rocks boiling undertones with the urgency of soul as the insistent sound of his synthesizer set the groove in "higher ground" and allowed the tension to mount as he ushered in "living for the city " yet "signed sealed delivered im yours " which came at the end of his classic soul period hinted that that kind of interplay was already in his jazz inflected work for the song he moved from the synth back to the grand piano and performed a descending bass line that revealed the funk and snap hed carry forward charming effusive mr wonder was in a mischievous mood throughout the evening "im a blind man with a shotgun " he declared to anyone whod think to approach his daughter he told a long story of how he came to write "my cherie amour" he was a young teen and wanted to impress a resistant girl and mr wonder did both coy voices to explain how the attempt at conquest unfolded realizing drummer chris johnson was having an extraordinary night his cymbal play on "master blaster jammin " dazzled mr wonder a terrific drummer in his own right suggested theyd have a one on one battle behind the kits before the tour was over at the end of "signed sealed delivered im yours " he shifted into a country version of the song prompting the audience to sing with a twang a few bars of ernest tubbss "walking the floor over you" followed but his most playful moments came during the music he compelled the band to stutter stop and start during a fierce "i wish " which came out of a knotty "sir duke " his tribute to ellington basie and those who preceded him as an inspiring bandleader he toyed with the riff of "superstition " playing off the beat and showing the songs roots in both rock and jazz he extended the ending of the latin flavored "dont you worry bout a thing" and later offered a snippet of chick coreas "spain " throughout the evening the audience middle aged couples teens parents with their kids was enthralled singing and dancing along from my perch in the bleachers i couldnt help but notice that with mr wonder you dont just clap on the two and four his music makes you a polyrhythmic machine too tapping your feet on the one and three bobbing your head between beats and swaying as you smile suddenly if only for a few hours everybodys got soul i walked away beaming never for a moment was there a sense that mr wonders best days are behind him in the presence of his talent and energy it was far from a foolish thought to believe that he will continue to add to his legacy mr fusilli writes about pop and rock music for the journal
