the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources transportation bridge tragedy blurs bigger risks on roads is americas transportation infrastructure crumbling the collapse of a bridge in minneapolis has created a misleading sense of crisis about the state of u s roads and bridges economist gary becker says the terror and tragedy of a bridge failure hides how small a risk such events pose to people using the interstate system each year drunk driving for example is linked to out of about u s deaths a year from automobile accidents money spent on reducing those fatalities might make people safer than investing more in infrastructure mr becker says on a blog he co writes with u s circuit judge richard posner addressing issues such as the number of vehicles on the road with worn tires also would have a much greater impact on safety than increasing road funding mr posner agrees with his blog counterpart that the infrastructure panic might be overblown civil engineers have an interest in declaring roads and bridges unsafe because repairs bring them revenue whats more engineers tend to emphasize optimal construction at the expense of economic logic "there is such a thing as making a product too safe " mr posner says still he says governments tend to neglect road maintenance because politicians often prefer to spend tax money on programs with immediate benefits such as health care than on maintenance whose payback will be felt mostly after a politician leaves office one way around that problem say the authors longtime advocates of market oriented solutions would be to privatize the operation of roads and bridges private companies are more likely to strike the right balance when weighing safety against costs there would be a chance of companies acquiring a monopoly power because highways face little competition from other forms of transportation but that risk could be minimized by having states lease roads and bridges to the private operators and making lease renewals contingent on meeting safety standards and private operators would have an interest in maintaining their roads because delays from wear and tear would reduce toll

los angeles times aug health fat and fit draws fire in fresh analysis of study research suggesting that being slightly overweight can be healthy shouldnt obscure the far greater number of studies linking excess fat with a higher risk of illness and premature death some studies and books have challenged the conventional wisdom that being overweight is harmful katherine m flegal a researcher at the centers for disease control and prevention published a statistical survey two years ago that concluded that mildly overweight adults had a lower mortality risk but the preponderance of research supports the conventional wisdom on being overweight james a greenberg a researcher at brooklyn college examined dr flegals study and adjusted for factors such as a history of serious illness mr
