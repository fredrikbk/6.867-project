some markets mr beuls says his rivals have invested in new technologies that may not be suitable for emerging markets "customers at the end of the day in emerging markets dont care about technology " he says "its about what benefits you provide they want accessibility " mr beuls prefers to hire employees from fast moving consumer goods companies that he believes better understand distribution patterns like seagram co a unit of diageo plc rather than other telecom companies millicom first introduced prepaid calling cards in its markets in removing the need for credit checks which are a major barrier to acquiring a cellphone for people who often lack identity papers since then millicom has introduced e pin a way to allow users to add minutes to their phones without having to purchase a prepaid card a customer pays cash to a vendor such as a clerk at a corner store for a specified number of minutes the vendor then sends a text message to millicom with the buyers phone number and a request to add minutes to the customers phone within seconds the company returns a text message to the buyers phone confirming the new balance by relying more on e pin millicom has been able to sell fewer calling cards which is a more costly way of providing service the lower expenses have allowed it to lower the minimum amount of airtime available for purchase to roughly cents from &# "each time we lowered the value of the reload people were buying more " mr beuls says also boosting sales anyone with a cellphone and several minutes worth of airtime can become a tigo vendor the company allows customers to send a text message to millicom requesting that minutes be transferred from their phone to anothers the company also introduced a "share balance" program that lets customers who have exhausted their minutes send a free text message to a friend asking for more the friend can then send a text message to millicom requesting a transfer from his or her own phone recently the company started selling seconds not minutes under per second billing instead of rounding up a second call and charging the user for the full minute millicom charges for only the exact duration of the call after testing per second billing in paraguay calls per user increased after introducing e pin and per second billing in paraguay in millicom saw subscribers rise and revenue rise within a year already
