webs niche tv programs win sponsors quality is consistent and viewership loyal customized for product in november freelance writer irina slutsky was frequenting parties for executives from tech start ups that were trying to make it big after a few weeks she told a friend to bring a video camera along to the events "ill interview a few friends and well pretend we have a show " ms slutsky recalls telling her friend geek entertainment tv was born almost two years later the web tv show which has developed a loyal following among tech enthusiasts signed its first sponsor internet registrar godaddy com last month inked a deal to sponsor new episodes of the show "geek entertainment tv" as well as the plus archived episodes available through blip tv the video site that hosts videos for geek ads will appear both as banners that run underneath the video during the program and as short commercial spots created by "geek" producers based on three scripts provided by godaddy com neither company would discuss financial aspects of the deal geeks signing of godaddy reflects how a rising tide of marketer interest in web video is lifting all sorts of internet boats online video has become the fastest growing category of internet ad spending in the past year according to research firm emarketer so much so that advertisers now frequently complain about the shortage of video content worthy of sponsorship marketers are finding it hard to buy enough space on traditional tv networks web sites which stream some network prime time programs ad space is available alongside the user generated videos that draw millions of visitors to video sharing sites like youtube but advertisers are wary about sponsoring videos that might be embarrassing or risque youtubes new ad format unveiled last week to intense advertiser interest limits ads to videos from selected partners as a result niche web programs like "geek" and others on subjects ranging from comic book news to fast cars and fashion are attracting the attention of some big marketers while their audiences are tiny geek entertainment tv says it averages to viewers a show though its most popular shows attract as many as viewers their viewers are loyal such programs also provide content of a consistent quality in advertisers eyes "marketers are very careful about their brands and some of those user created videos can be pretty raunchy but brands are willing to experiment more with higher quality videos " says martin reidy chief executive of publicis modem and publicis dialog digital marketing units of ad holding company publicis groupe new york based next new networks is planning to launch as many as web tv networks with shows that advertisers can sponsor similar to the way ads work on traditional tv networks the company now has networks and recently sold its first major sponsorship to lionsgate for the jet li movie "war " in addition to banner ads that appear on the different networks web sites promotions can be woven into plot lines or included as short commercial spots during a show on the jet set network about internet pop culture the host mentions "war " a trailer for the movie plays and viewers are encouraged to upload videos showing their martial arts skills on the indy mogul network which focuses on independent filmmaking the host shows how to recreate special effects from a scene in the movie when a hand is stabbed these shows are an easier sell to advertisers when a single video site hosts several and can negotiate deals for all of them the "geek" ad deal with godaddy for instance was negotiated by blip tv a closely held new york video site that also hosts several other series including "alive in baghdad " about iraq and "break a leg " about show business blip tv splits the ad revenue with the program producers traditional media companies are getting in on the action in recent months cbs acquired wallstrip com a daily show about wall street culture and pop culture and discovery communications bought treehugger com an eco lifestyle web site that produces video segments further adding to these niche programs appeal for advertisers is that many of them offer customized sponsorships some are willing to produce a segment on an advertisers product or have the programs host mention the sponsor to promote its fall denim collection clothing chain express created a campaign with "ford models tv " a web series produced by modeling agency ford models that features models talking about fashion and other subjects during two different videos a male model and a female model talk about how they wear their jeans each mentioning express jeans during the segment "we sent the models a few bags of clothes before the shoot but we didnt send them a script with lines we really wanted them telling the story " says pam seidman director of communications for express ms seidman says she is pleased so far with the campaign to be sure advertising on niche web tv shows isnt for every marketer not only are audiences relatively small but pricing models and measurement systems arent yet established most advertisers view the outlets as a testing ground or as one piece of a bigger ad campaign "i dont know that video sites like this are attractive across the board they have to fit contextually " says babs rangaiah director of media and entertainment at unilever which recently ran a campaign on a web show hosted by blip tv to promote a consumer generated contest in which people were invited to submit ads for a new body wash dove cream oil
