gerald murphy was more than a dilettante making it now the art and style of sara and gerald murphy wiliams college musuem of art through nov the exhibit will be at the yale university art gallery from feb may and the dallas museum of art from june sept williamstown mass there are many reasons to come to "making it new the art and style of sara and gerald murphy" at the williams college museum of art most people are not coming for the most important one the small but powerful oeuvre seven oils a handful of drawings of a man who took up painting in his early s and abandoned it a decade later had he stuck to his craft gerald murphy might have been hailed as a th century painter of enormous influence instead he is simply one of americas finest if he never painted we would remember gerald murphy only as a footnote to cultural history a charming wealthy well connected dilettante who had a good time calvin tomkinss "living well is the best revenge" and amanda vails "everybody was so young a lost generation love story" give you the details and the ambiance as do the assembled memorabilia wall labels and video clips that constitute the bulk of the exhibit here gerald and sara his slightly older wife from a "better" family knew everyone cole and linda porter ernest hemingway zelda and scott fitzgerald who famously characterized them in "tender is the night" they moved to paris in gerald took up painting they helped establish the riviera as a summer resort in addition to a winter one they impressed picasso they inspired coco chanel they introduced american style and taste breezy informal jazzy and insouciant within their european circle they made art out of their lives they became myth tragedy struck in the form of the early deaths of their two young sons a daughter survived to old age more important after the depression hit gerald returned home to take over the family business the mark cross leather goods concern he gave up painting lived in snedens landing and east hampton n y and worked in midtown manhattan where he passed the museum of modern art every day and averted his glance thats the story and thats what captivates most visitors in two separate viewings i was impressed by how little time relative to the size of the show people spent in the room containing six of murphys paintings a seventh is in an adjacent room he did oils half of them were lost destroyed misplaced no one knows how three of the missing ones are represented by photographs theres a double sadness in all of this not just that murphy stopped his career as it began to flower but that most people regard him more as an amusing figure who harks back to a glamorous age when people knew how to enjoy themselves come to the museum familiarize yourself with the murphys story you can do all of that by reading the books and curator deborah rothschilds elegant catalog nothing however can replace an actual close up look at gerald murphys works see what they are like its not too much of a stretch to say that all of these pictures even more than those of more important or prolific artists are autobiographical consider a small detail a small collage by gerald incorporating a watercolor figure by sara of a character called "the immigrant" for the stage show "within the quota " in between the mans legs gerald added the mark cross logo mark cross was the cross that gerald murphy had to bear the oils tell even more but more subtly about their maker omission is as important as inclusion "bibliotheque" is a subtle allegory of a bookish life everything is halved or partial we see half a globe significantly the western hemisphere half a bust half a column a magnifying glass at the bottom as if the picture asks us to look more closely most poignant books whose spines are bereft of letters or "villa america " a premonition of jasper johnss flags the title refers to the murphys riviera villa the picture offers fractured stars and stripes on the left five white stars descend vertically beside a piece of a large yellow star on the right eight bars of red and white fill out the picture the words "villa america" occupy one line each but are also bisected "vil" and "ame" in white on the left as part of the yellow star and "la" and "rica" in black on the white as part of the stripes a presentation of divided allegiances absolutely the most beautiful of the pictures "cocktail" is a metaphor for the good life like the others it is exquisitely and precisely painted murphys application of paint could give many younger artists a lesson in technique cuban cigars a corkscrew a cocktail shaker a lime a martini glass all shown in parts sit squarely in rectilinear patterns as though it were a premonition of richard diebenkorns "ocean park" series and in a cool palette murphy absorbed cubism leger corbusier amedee ozenfant and others and americanized them "watch" the largest picture offers the inner workings of a timepiece that doesnt tell time a symbol of beautiful mechanization gone awry one thinks of charlie chaplin and "modern times " murphy had a repressed homosexual side which he called his "defects" in a letter to archibald macleish saying that his post adolescent life "has been a process of concealment of the personal realities " "razor " a hidden cri de coeur as well as a precursor of roy lichtenstein and andy warhol is a still life like all of these pictures but on an enormous scale a gillette safety razor crosses a parker fountain pen like dueling weapons is the pen mightier than the sword in bold colors and virtually no perspective the heroic objects sit in front of a box of safety matches but the razor cuts in and "matches" lacks its final letter there is no safety the accoutrements of masculinity have undone something either the artist or the world he valued murphys last oil "wasp and pear" suggests a new palette and a more frenetic sense of space the weirdly shaped figures looking like nothing in nature dramatize the nervous destruction of something innocent tasty and sweet like the jazz age gerald murphy and his art seem both long ago and very much of our moment mr spiegelman writes about art for the journal
