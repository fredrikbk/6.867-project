this isnt civil war baghdad we are winning this war i write those words from my desk in the red zone in downtown baghdad as hundreds of iraqis working with my company shia and sunni arab and kurd execute security construction and logistics missions throughout the capital and sunni triangle we have been here now over three years american iraqi solutions group which i helped co found in march has been intimately involved with creating the new iraqi security services our principal business as a u s department of defense contractor is to build bases for the iraqi army and police and then supply them with water food fuel and maintenance services we are on the cutting edge of the exit strategy for the u s military stand up an effective iraqi security structure and then we can bring our troops home we are not out of the iraqi desert yet but the primary problems we now face on the ground are controllable given a strong american military presence through these problems include the involvement of iran in fueling shia militancy the british failure to uphold their security obligations in the south and the tumultuous nature of a new democracy ambassador ryan c crocker recently said the one word he would choose to describe the feelings of the iraqi people was "fear " a bad choice from my observation thats not the prevailing state of mind except maybe for those sheltered souls in the green zone who are getting hit on a regular basis for the first time in more than a year by primarily iranian supplied rockets and mortars what i see on the faces of the thousands of iraqis working with us including our subcontractors and suppliers as well as on the faces of the iraqi army and police patrolling and manning the checkpoints and assisting u s soldiers in searching for the insurgents is grim determination to get the job done i also see exhaustion exhaustion with the insurgency whether it be al qaeda neo saddamist or jaish al mahdi jam or the shia militia of moqtada al sadr the exhaustion is real and the evidence of the falling support among the iraqi people for the insurgency in its various guises is inescapable unless you are deliberately looking the other way a large proportion of our thousand man work force of which are iraqi citizens comes from sadr city the shia slum in east baghdad many carry weapons these shia warriors have emphasized in the past several months that they and their neighbors are tired of conflict and only want to feed their families you only have to note the lack of u s casualties in the ongoing surge to clear jam out of the highly dangerous urban terrain of sadr city to realize that the people there do not want to fight us they are sick of fighting as for sunni resistance i recently visited the boot camp we operate for the iraqi army at habbaniyah in al anbar former heartland of the insurgency for the first time we are seeing entire sunni arab recruiting cohorts at the camp where before we only saw shia from outside the province the sunnis of al anbar finally tired of al qaeda assassinating their sheikhs when they disagreed with the terrorists have committed their children to the security services of a government dominated by the majority shias and paid for and run by the americans with such a development you have real progress in integrating the diverse elements in iraq slowly but surely iraqi security services are building up you only have to travel outside the green zone to see them undertaking heroic risks as they work to control the streets in growing numbers and with growing professionalism in the past couple of months the ministry of the interior established an operations center for all of baghdad that effectively coordinates nonmilitary logistics movements throughout the capital a function previously only undertaken by a coalition contractor from chaos has come order and in turn step by step the iraqi military is becoming a truly national not sectarian force i see no civil war between the shias and sunnis as i travel practically every day on the roads of iraq with my arab and kurdish security team the potential for renewed internecine warfare faded earlier this year when al qaeda failed to reignite the waning sectarian struggle the second time around with another attack on the golden mosque in samarra the perfect storm at the beginning of created the necessity of reconciliation the sunni arabs who had used al qaeda as leverage in the political struggle to re establish their minority rule faced genocide in baghdad from the shia death squads with pressure from the new democratic majority in congress the shia government of nouri al maliki realized that time was running out for a dominant american presence in iraq and finally allowed the u s military to clean up sadr city thus alleviating the death squad activities both the sunni and shia arab sides of the iraqi political equation the kurds have sided with us from the beginning now see that there is no alternative to american protection as a result sadrs people and the sunnis have both returned to parliament as always democracy is messy but it is working we have to be patient particularly because this nascent reconciliation has left al qaeda as the odd man out just as the rockets landing in the green zone are from a foreign source iran the jihadis who destroy themselves in explosions aimed primarily at mass killings of shia civilians are almost all foreigners this is al qaeda not iraq even more to the point the iraqis basically ignore the al qaeda car bombs mourn the dead and then go to work to school join and continue to serve in the military and police and life goes on there is no terror if no one is terrorized let us the american people not be terrorized into retreating before our enemy al qaeda just when they have begun to stand alone stripped of allies in a country beginning to enjoy the fruits of a democracy we have sacrificed much blood to help create mr andress ceo and
