rough justice resignation marks turning point washington the downfall of attorney general alberto gonzales was triggered by the justice departments firing of eight u s attorneys but the brawl over his tenure turned on a far broader issue the bush administrations six year effort to impose greater political control over the federal bureaucracy from his confirmation as attorney general in february mr gonzales set about corralling his departments far flung parts and employees in the civil rights area mr gonzales promoted aides who sidelined career prosecutors deemed liberal leaning in favor of political appointees in corporate crime new rules gave washington greater oversight over prosecutors daily activities antiterror operations were unified under a political appointee each of the eight fired u s attorneys ran afoul in one way or another of loyalty tests set by mr gonzaless chief of staff a process that largely bypassed even the deputy attorney general for seven months members of congress pilloried mr gonzales as inept accused him of lying and threatened him with impeachment for perjury it ended yesterday with mr gonzaless resignation president bush said his friend received "unfair treatment" and "his good name was dragged through the mud for political reasons " mr gonzaless struggles reflect a deeper and still simmering source of controversy for the administration in fights ranging from executive privilege to global warming the bush administration has run into trouble as it tried to keep control within a tight and loyal coterie of executive branch political appointees mr gonzales a bush confidante and former white house counsel was dispatched to a department that has struggled with mixed success to maintain its independence republicans have long been suspicious of career bureaucrats in the federal government believing they tend to be liberal and the programs they administer are apt to be wasteful the bush administration moved especially forcefully to tamp down what it saw as obstructionism it increased the number of political jobs across the government by since according to a congressional oversight committee report and the number of political jobs not requiring legislative confirmation has grown these numbers add up to the biggest attempt to reassert the political control of the president since watergate which led to president nixons resignation in and weakened the presidencys powers both vis a vis congress and within the executive branch scholars say "the bush administration has penetrated more deeply into the hierarchy than past administrations " says paul light a new york university professor who has studied the federal bureaucracy at the national aeronautics and space administration a political appointee with no scientific training created a ruckus after insisting on editing reports written by scientists the head of the general services administration the governments chief purchaser improperly convened a videoconference so that political appointees could discuss ways to help "our candidates " earlier this year the white house ordered every regulatory agency to designate a political appointee to supervise the creation of rules affecting regulated industries while the administration has retreated in some cases officials have defended beefing up political oversight saying it helps mr bush push through the principles that got him elected they say political appointees are entitled obligated even to tell bureaucrats what to do it was at the justice department where the policy hit the wall "you can bring your politics to agriculture " says a senior bush appointed justice department official "you can do that at interior but the justice department is supposed to be different you have to be careful and thats where they got in trouble " if mr bush chooses a successor who signals a similar interest in reducing the justice departments independence congress could turn the confirmation hearings into another battleground a more conciliatory selection would suggest the administration intends to dial down its ambitions during its last year in office as the president sinks into lame duck status possible replacements include homeland security secretary michael chertoff federal bureau of investigation chief robert mueller former deputy attorney general larry thompson and frances fragos townsend the white house homeland security adviser mr gonzales resigned on friday during a phone call with president bush the two had lunch together at mr bushs crawford texas ranch on sunday along with mr gonzaless wife administration officials said the attorney general came to the decision on his own mr bush who had vowed to stick by his friend acknowledged that the controversy over the u s attorney firings was creating a "harmful distraction " mr gonzales may also have been unwilling to battle on in congress where legislators were threatening further investigations joshua bolten the presidents chief of staff had told senior administration officials that anyone who stayed after labor day would be expected to stay for the remainder of mr bushs term karl rove the presidents senior political adviser cited that directive in stepping down earlier this month while mr rove was also enmeshed in the prosecutor firings controversy a justice department official said mr gonzaless move wasnt tied to mr roves even after months of hearings and the release of more than pages of documents mr gonzales and other justice officials havent identified where the idea for the firings originated it eventually became clear that mr gonzales had little republican support to counter the democratic offensive his woes multiplied to include a host of other matters including his role in the governments program to wiretap conversations involving people in the u s as part of antiterrorism efforts the justice department is now in disarray when mr gonzales formally leaves his post sept at least six senior positions including the top three jobs will be held by officials in an acting capacity at the justice department politics and the law coexist in an uneasy balance u s attorneys are presidential appointees but they are also supposed to be impartial stewards of the law it is common for presidents to replace u s attorneys on first being elected president clinton requested the resignation of all but its much rarer to make changes midstream as president bush did with the eight u s attorneys in one of mr gonzaless initial attempts to exert political control over the department involved the bush administrations signature issue terrorism the previous attorney general john ashcroft though often a whipping boy for liberals had quietly raised hackles within the administration by agreeing with concerns that career officials raised that conflict reached a climax in march when mr ashcroft and his deputy refused to reauthorize the administrations program to monitor certain conversations involving u s parties without a warrant mr gonzales then white house counsel visited mr ashcroft in the hospital where he was recovering from gallbladder surgery in a bid to change his mind details of that encounter came to light this year in a senate hearing orchestrated by new york democratic sen charles schumer mr gonzales cracked the whip on the departments office of intelligence policy and review previously it was part of the criminal division and answered to a career bureaucrat some officials there had played a role in stoking mr ashcrofts concerns about terrorism surveillance in march the office became part of a newly created national security division headed by a political appointee the change was carried out over the objections of christopher wray the criminal divisions chief who was then on his way out officials say it was in keeping with the bush administrations philosophy that terrorism is a unique threat to the u s and suspected terrorists cant be treated like normal criminal suspects the law that created the national security division was a revised version of the patriot act passed in early the law originally approved by congress shortly after gives the government more powers to gather intelligence from financial and other records and use immigration laws against terror suspects mr gonzales rounded up the department in favor of the laws renewal pressing some u s attorneys to speak with their local members of congress about the issue according to two people involved in the lobbying while terrorism was a natural priority for mr gonzales his efforts to centralize authority and advance mr bushs political goals went further when mr gonzales first took over u s attorneys across the country quickly received an insight into how close their new boss remained to the white house when some prosecutors voiced complaints about budget cuts proposed by the president mr gonzales shot back immediately according to a person present admonishing them that the presidents budget was their budget and that their job was to support the president two months later joseph rich chief of the voting rights section of the departments civil rights division resigned mr rich says that the treatment of career lawyers in the division grew worse with the arrival of certain political appointees notably bradley schlozman who served as head of the division from to republicans have long grumbled that the civil rights division with its history of defending the rights of minority voters spent too much time pursuing cases that favored democrats mr schlozman boasted to friends that he hired republicans to even things out a comment he confirmed in testimony to congress and for which he has since apologized he also overruled the advice of career lawyers in giving approval to a texas redistricting plan that increased the number of republican leaning districts mr rich in an interview says "every administration comes in with different priorities " but he said under mr gonzales "i felt that my position as chief of the voting section was marginalized for political reasons " mr schlozman quit the department earlier this month he didnt immediately return a call seeking comment wan j kim the head of the civil rights division quit effective at the end of august susan brooks the u s attorney in southern indiana and vice chairman of committee of prosecutors that advises the attorney general dismissed the perception that mr gonzales "ran roughshod" over u s attorneys "he shared with us new initiatives thats what we look to our leaders for to help provide direction " she said in an interview yesterday ms brooks added "its hard moving a big institution like this and there was bound to be some resistance " mr gonzales is a longtime friend and counselor to the president dating back to their days in texas his nomination as the first hispanic attorney general was greeted favorably at first mr schumer initially praised him as "less polarizing" and "a better candidate than john ashcroft " polite and reserved mr gonzales is known as "judge" among staff and colleagues its a reference to his time on the texas supreme court but also an honorific that sums up his temperament mr gonzales grew up in the small town of humble texas one of eight children of mexican migrants in june mr gonzales and his then deputy paul mcnulty found another opportunity to centralize power this time with the support of congress and critics outside the department a federal judge in new york slammed some career prosecutors in the department of justice for high pressure tactics in a white collar case involving accounting firm kpmg llp among other things the prosecutors tried to block kpmg from paying lawyers fees for former partners under attack from republican members of congress and from business interests the department moved to exert closer control over prosecutors in the field in what became known as the mcnulty memorandum it says department headquarters must approve aggressive tactics such as prosecutors demanding that corporations waive attorney client privilege mr mcnulty in an interview earlier this year agreed that the changes represented a power shift back to washington but he said it was more of a "pendulum swing" reflecting the changing needs of the department ultimately it was the u s attorney ousters that turned mr gonzaless style from a middling issue of concern among liberals into a raging political storm the ousters became known among some prosecutors as the pearl harbor day massacre a reference to the date dec when mid level justice officials telephoned seven of the eight attorneys to inform them of the decision democratic suspicions were fanned by shifting explanations of what happened this february mr mcnulty testified that with one exception the prosecutor ousters were for "performance" reasons but documents released by the department immediately undercut this explanation showing that some of the fired prosecutors had exemplary performance reviews while the full explanation for the firings remains unclear emails released this year suggested politics played a role in an email to mr gonzales shortly before he took over the attorney generals job aide kyle sampson discussed firing all u s attorneys it would be unprecedented mr sampson said but if "karl rove thinks there would be political will to do it then so do i " yesterday democrats were gleeful and some republicans relieved at mr gonzaless decision sen schumer urged the administration to identify a successor who would be "above all a professional not a partisan not a pal " republicans cautioned against what may well be a drawn out political battle over a replacement "now the question is once the president chooses a new nominee will they conduct a fair confirmation process or will they continue the partisanship and endless investigations that have been the hallmark of this congress " said sen john cornyn a texas republican democrats said their investigations of the justice department will continue in july the house judiciary committee approved contempt citations against white house chief of staff josh bolten
