u s probes design flaw in jet blast investigators increasingly believe a maintenance error resulted in a fuel tank rupture that caused a china airlines boeing airliner to burst into flames after landing last week in okinawa japan while the planes manufacturer considers a potential design change to prevent a recurrence according to people familiar with the probe after the accident in which the last of the aboard escaped seconds before a fireball destroyed the jetliner both boeing co and u s regulators warned airlines flying more than late model s to check that movable bolts controlling panels on the front of the wings dont pose a hazard to nearby fuel tanks at the same time engineers at the chicago aerospace giant began looking into whether changing the design of the bolt assemblies could reduce chances of a maintenance error leading to another such inferno said people familiar with the details within hours of the explosion an international team of investigators ruled out mechanical or maintenance problems with the two engines manufactured by a u s european joint venture instead people familiar with the matter said the probe is focused on a suspected maintenance mix up that apparently allowed parts of the bolt mechanism that moves panels called slats on the front of the wings to dislodge investigators believe mechanics failed to replace a washer during a routine inspection of the assembly weeks earlier permitting a bolt to come loose punch through the front edge of the planes fuel tank and create a major leak slats typically are deployed during landings to help airliners descend the u s federal aviation administration over the weekend issued an emergency safety directive mandating airlines flying late model boeing aircraft to conduct detailed inspections "to verify that proper hardware is installed" and to assure that the nut and bolt assemblies are properly tightened airlines also were ordered to keep checking for possible loose parts of the slat control mechanism boeing issued its own warning to check that washers and other parts were installed about jetliners are affected world wide including the latest and longest range versions of the workhorse models inspections after the explosion turned up at least one other instance of a missing washer according to people familiar with the matter though it isnt known which carrier was involved investigators from the national transportation safety board are focusing on whether a redesigned bolt could provide an increased safety margin boeing among other things is considering whether a differently shaped head would prevent the bolts and associated parts from rupturing the fuel tank people familiar with the matter said without going into details boeing spokesman jim proulx said company teams are "looking at everything we can possibly look at" to preclude a repeat accident at this point the safety board isnt expected to issue additional safety warnings masanobu ohtsuka an official of japans ministry of land infrastructure and transport working on the accident said a missing washer and dislodged bolt appear to be the most likely cause of the problem "we dont have another idea at this point in time " he said while stressing that further investigation is under way to pinpoint precisely what happened and how leaking fuel sparked the explosion in december boeing issued a voluntary notice warning airlines flying certain late model s about "a few cases" of loose slat control parts causing fuel leaks according to spokesman mark hooper "we said at the time that any leak caused by a loose nut would only be a small one and not enough to threaten the airplane " china airlines said yesterday that following boeings service letter its maintenance engineers had "disassembled and then reassembled the slat track downstop assemblies on this plane" during a routine july inspection an official at the airline said "the record showed the inspection was normal " pressed for more details the official said "china airlines is not in a position to reveal any information at this point because the investigation is still under way "
