lbo repair job its too soon to say that the credit market contagion is over but at least the death spiral many feared seems to have stopped the latest good news comes from the repricing of the home depot supply buyout this weekend a signal that all parties involved are adjusting to life in the post credit bubble world under the terms of the new deal the price was cut to &# billion from &# billion the private equity firms buying home depots commercial supply business will put in more equity and the debt that the business takes on will pay a higher interest rate in other words everyone the banks the buyers and the sellers gave up something in exchange for getting the deal done banks are apparently no longer going to write blank checks to private equity firms by making low interest rate loans with little in the way of conditions on the borrowers or protections for the lender somewhere the ghost of j p morgan is smiling restoring sanity to the debt markets cant be a bad thing as carlyle group co founder david rubenstein noted in an interview with the journal on saturday the terms on some of these loans had gotten so good for the borrowers that it had become hard not to take the money this was bound to happen when the federal reserve kept short term interest rates below the observed rate of inflation for as long as it did loose monetary policy combined with historically low interest rate spreads between treasurys and corporate borrowing contributed to a race to gain market share by throwing overboard the conditions on debt that had been mandatory for years better to phase out this euphoria now than to wait for it to come acropper later in the past few weeks banks have taken a hard look at the debt that they have committed to issue and in light of newfound circumspection from the potential buyers of that debt these same banks have decided to rein in the money making machine that the fed helped to build the alternative was unchecked growth of a potential debt bomb born of easy money the home depot supply deal was it is true hit by the confluence of the tightening of debt markets and its exposure to a weakening housing market other buyout deals may be reworked on different terms while still others may go through as planned but the broader lesson holds the markets are still clearing losses will be taken and bank earnings will suffer yet theres no reason to believe that the majority of the oft mentioned &# billion committed to pending private equity deals wont ultimately be provided on terms acceptable to all sides in the meantime the lawyers and bankers on some of those deals can expect some long weekends at the office and sleepless nights the easy money and loose lending standards that enabled private equity firms to pay top dollar for some acquisitions may be going away but the home depot deal is a sign that even under current conditions banks can still lend and buyers can buy
