immigration reform must work for all it never ceases to amaze me how many government officials condone illegal activity in her editorial page commentary pia orrenius exposes the real flaw to immigration reform in the united states "no match no sense " aug failure to uphold the law she makes the excuse that the social security administrations no match letter program will cause "serious economic harm " the harm to all of us and illegal aliens being that they will have to take lower paying jobs their wages will be untaxed they will default on morgages and credit cards and put a strain on health care services since they cant pay by her logic we shouldnt prosecute bank robbers because they really went into the bank to get money to pay for food clothing health care and their mortgage payment putting them in jail will only hurt the economy who gave jobs and issued mortgages and credit cards to "illegals" in the first place the ssa no match program at least begins to address the job side of that issue if an illegal alien has applied for a green card it indicates they are willing to take a legal path to work in this country otherwise "illegals" have broken the law and they should pay a price when politicians government offiicials and businesses understand that fact we may then begin to construct real immigration reform that works for everyone jim vleisides souderton pa
