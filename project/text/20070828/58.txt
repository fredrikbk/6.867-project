moving the market browsers but no buyers for an lse stake nasdaqs toughest trade may be to sell its shares in london exchange stock exchanges are selling like hotcakes these days but nasdaq stock market inc chief executive officer robert greifeld is expected to have some trouble unloading the exchanges big stake in london stock exchange plc on paper it wouldnt seem to be a problem no fewer than four suitors tried unsuccessfully this decade to buy the lse europes largest stock market by the value of shares traded on it and many of them including deutsche boerse and new york stock exchange parent nyse euronext have been on the prowl for more deals as bidders start kicking the tires on nasdaqs stake valued at gbp million or &# billion in the lse some complications are arising among them what is the value in a minority stake in the lse where the management and many shareholders have had no interest in selling "i dont see why anyone would want to buy this stake especially at a premium" price says michael gooch founder of trading firm gfi group he says exchanges will be reluctant to buy a stake in lse if they arent sure that it will lead to a full fledged merger gfi is one of nasdaqs listing and trading customers still lse is considered a trophy property and about a half dozen potential investors have either considered a bid or have talked to nasdaq representatives about bidding according to a person familiar with the process they include deutsche boerse nyse euronext macquarie bank ltd borse dubai singapores state owned investment company temasek holdings ltd and asx ltd owner of the australian stock exchange and sydney futures exchange some of the potential buyers have said they arent interested asx said in a statement that "there is no basis to support the market speculation that asx is intending to purchase nasdaqs stake in lse at this stage " some at temasek and nyse euronext have indicated that they arent interested either say people familiar with the matter but another person involved said temasek and at least one other potential bidder have contacted lse itself about their interest in the nasdaq stake a spokeswoman for the lse declined to comment a main question for a potential buyer is whether the lse would be comfortable merging with another exchange some potential buyers such as nyse wont want to buy nasdaqs stake unless lse expresses optimism about a full fledged deal a person familiar with the matter says it is a dilemma for mr greifeld who unsuccessfully chased the lse for more than a year while rivals merged he will likely have to get creative or accept a lower than market price for nasdaqs stake in lse nasdaq paid a currency adjusted gbp for the stake that now trades above gbp per share after more than a year of trying to buy the lse nasdaq ran out of patience when it became clear that its minority stake for which it paid more than &# billion wouldnt lead to a full deal with the reluctant lse mr greifelds ability to sell it at a profit will be crucial because the lse strategy has been both distracting and strategically unsuccessful for nasdaq nasdaq needs money to fund an alternative deal it has with nordic exchange operator omx ab this month rival bidder borse dubai put in a higher cash bid for that company which means nasdaq may need more firepower to increase its omx cash and stock offer to finish the transaction borse dubai and nasdaq in recent days have been looking to set up a meeting to talk about their respective bids for omx and possibly whether they can come to some agreement about them a person familiar with the matter said it is unclear whether lse will play a role in these discussions another possibility is that lse would buy the stake back itself this would be a large show of confidence by lse management but no talks have occurred on this idea according to one person involved and it is unclear how lse shareholders would react selling the lse stake will allow nasdaq to pay down debt and possibly buy back some shares which could potentially help nasdaqs stock price and improve the value of its bid for omx whether nasdaq is able to complete its deals on the lse stake and with omx will go a long way toward showing the resilience of global consolidation among exchanges in and exchanges paired at warp speed after selling shares to investors who wanted to see the cost cutting and bigger profit margins of combined technology platforms but this summer increases in exchanges share prices have stalled amid concerns about the health of global credit markets and the impact on stocks a protracted market downturn could hurt exchanges profits casting some doubt about the valuation of some deals complicating matters is the gain in the lse share price in the past two years some people think it is overvalued during its campaign to buy the lse nasdaq officials said as much now that the exchange is trying to sell its stake it finds itself in the awkward position of having to make the opposite case a spokeswoman for nasdaq says "the market dictates the value of the stake " ian mcdonald and edward taylor contributed to this article
