the new latin quarter new orleans after hurricane katrina slammed into the gulf coast two years ago tomorrow officials asked for help to rebuild damaged communities hundreds of thousands of volunteers from churches colleges corporations and civic organizations responded but one group has received little attention for the big role that it is playing immigrant latinos shortly after katrina hit while the majority of the citys residents were still in exile and despite inhospitable conditions a stream of latino workers and entrepreneurs poured into new orleans they were followed by friends and family there are now perhaps latinos in the new orleans area although nobody knows for sure pundits began to speculate on what the influx would mean just weeks after katrina new orleans mayor ray nagin asked "how do i ensure that new orleans is not overrun by mexican workers " critics generally fall into two camps the first believes that the immigrant latinos in new orleans are ignorant helpless and in need of protection the second maintains that they are stealing jobs sponging off of welfare and crippling the citys fragile infrastructure neither claim is true out of our surveys and interviews with latino workers in the post katrina new orleans area we see a microcosm of immigration and immigrants generally self sufficient hard working entrepreneurial law abiding people simply trying to make a better life for themselves and their families take lucy a pseudonym who came to new orleans in late from michigan where she had lived since leaving her native guatemala years earlier she worked in demolition cleaning roofing and construction after four months and a minor accident she bought two coolers and an industrial coffee maker and began selling breakfast out of the back of her ford fiesta to be sure most of the latinos who arrived after katrina are probably undocumented but what of it there is widespread bipartisan agreement in washington and baton rouge that the recovery efforts are too slow does it really matter who does the work as long as it gets done and quickly there is little evidence that these immigrants are the scroungers or welfare cheats their detractors claim they came here for one reason jobs as one said to us "i do not need help i need a job thats all i need " and they plan to stay as many people told us "as long as there is work to do " nor is there evidence that they are taking jobs from native new orleanians as of april the last month for which data are available unemployment in orleans parish was compared with nationwide by comparison in july the orleans parish unemployment rate was two percentage points above the national figure moreover the latino immigrants in new orleans are not merely doing construction theyre also opening stores and restaurants breathing economic vitality into a city still badly in need of a boost st claude avenue one of the two main drags through the lower ninth ward remains close to deserted with only perhaps a half dozen businesses open but with its spray painted sign and impressive selection of latino groceries soft drinks phone cards and compact discs tienda latina essentially "latin store" is bringing commerce back into the most devastated neighborhood in new orleans its customers as might be expected are mostly latino although a handful of anglos come through as well it was the first store between the industrial canal and st bernard parish to reopen loncheras or "taco trucks " are everywhere although jefferson parish officials have banned them from their suburban community on dubious health grounds orleans parish officials have been considering doing the same although the chief proponent of the ban councilman oliver thomas resigned earlier this month after pleading guilty to accepting a bribe tony osorio came from houston in september with his lonchera a year later he turned his profits into a fleet of four loncheras and a mexican restaurant in st bernard parish which he bought for &# cash on the barrel this is the stuff from which communities rebuild whether doing temporary construction work or settling into the community and opening businesses latinos are playing a critical role in rebuilding new orleans the days are long the work is hard and the living conditions are frequently trying but the work is getting done people are moving back businesses are reopening the most striking thing is that in new orleans the opportunities for immigrants to add to the local economy are obvious there are roofs to repair drywall to be hung trees to be planted but less apparent opportunities exist in every city from opening new stores and restaurants to building new homes and offices immigrants a versatile and entrepreneurial group remain an integral part of the american enterprise its unfortunate that it takes a disaster to remind us of that mr villarreal is professor of public policy at the instituto tecnologico y de estudios superiores de monterrey mr rothschild is associate director of the mercatus center at george mason universitys global prosperity initiative see related letter "letters to the editor throw caution to winds throw open all
