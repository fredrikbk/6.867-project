venture firms vs investors yale and the like quietly cite pressure to back offbeat funds some top venture capital firms eager to expand into new markets are twisting their investors arms to get them to go along or so say the investors investors said big name firms such as sequoia capital and north bridge venture partners have been exerting subtle and not so subtle pressure on some of their limited partners as these investors are called to put money into unproven investment vehicles including funds that invest in china india and so called later stage u s companies these investors including big university endowments foundations and pension funds worry that if they dont comply they could damage their relations with the venture capital firms and possibly lose out on the chance to get into the firms more typical funds which invest in small start ups one limited partner feeling the heat is yale university and its &# billion endowment fund yale declined to invest in some funds launched in the past few years by sequoia including a fund focused on chinese companies sequoia later decided to "oust yale from its partner group" because the university passed on the new funds which targeted "later stage deals china and israel " according to a september internal yale review of the endowments private equity portfolio sequoia told yale it preferred investors that would give the menlo park calif venture capital firm a "blank check" to invest as it saw fit according to the page yale memo parts of which were reviewed by the wall street journal a yale spokesman declined to comment sequoia partner doug leone declined to comment on the yale situation citing privacy agreements with the firms investors he said sequoia doesnt pressure its investors and has "multiple" investors who have declined to put money into the firms many overseas funds "without repercussions of any kind we encourage our limited partners to invest only in the funds they believe in " some sequoia investors said they felt no pressure to invest in the firms overseas funds one sequoia investor massachusetts institute of technology provided a statement at sequoias request saying the university has "on more than one occasion declined to invest in name brand venture capital firms affiliated products that did not match our portfolio requirements " and "we continue to maintain excellent relationships with those firms " the discord offers a look inside the culture of the venture capital world highlighting the increasing power of the industrys top firms with median industry returns lackluster lately spots in venture funds that are performing well are more highly prized than ever and new spots seldom open up except when firms launch new investment vehicles so even large investors like universities and foundations generally are loath to publicly criticize the firms partly for fear of getting kicked out of their funds many investors also pony up for new types of funds because they dont feel they really have a choice of not investing even though some venture firms tell them they wont be punished for passing still some investors are skeptical about the ability of even the best performing firms to succeed in such areas as investing overseas and in larger companies at home in some cases investors "have really felt like theres been a gun held to their heads " says josh lerner a harvard business school professor who has studied the venture capital industry some venture capital firms tell investors that "if you want to continue to be able to invest in the mother ship youve got to play ball and invest" in the secondary funds he says apart from sequoia investors said north bridge pressured some existing investors to put money into a new growth fund of roughly &# million the waltham mass firm raised last year at least one institution said it was told that how much it put into the growth fund would help determine how much the institution could invest in a coming early stage fund the other criterion was how much money it had invested in north bridges previous early stage fund these investors said north bridge declined to comment three investors with the firm who were asked by north bridge to comment on the issue said they werent pressured to put money into the growth fund some investors said they dont mind any subtle arm twisting over secondary funds because they are happy to put money into any product offered by such top ranked firms as sequoia and north bridge many investors said they dont begrudge the best venture capital firms using their increasing influence to expand into new markets sequoia which has funds targeting china india and israel said in june regulatory filings that it was raising two additional china funds of about &# million and &# million kleiner perkins caufield &amp byers which famously backed such companies as amazon com inc and google inc started a &# million china focused fund this year and last year launched a &# million fund focusing on companies that make drugs or disease detection products used in health pandemics and silicon valleys accel partners this summer said it had teamed up with idg ventures to launch a &# million fund focusing on china two years after the firms raised their first joint china fund "all the first tier funds are sort of rolling into this new model of multisector venture funds which is a way of having your finger in a lot of pies " said paul kedrosky executive director of the william j von liebig center for entrepreneurism and technology advancement at the university of california at san diego it also means funds can collect more fees from investors because fees generally are based on assets under management most venture capital firms expanding overseas said they are simply responding to increasing globalization in the industries in which they invest still limited partners who dont want to go along worry they may get cut out of future funds if they dont invest in the new offerings sometimes the pressure is subtle with firms saying that declining to participate in new funds is "fine" but may "change the relationship" between the firm and the investor according to one university endowment official what makes yales falling out with sequoia so unusual is that big investors known for their long term outlooks such as ivy league endowments and well known charitable foundations often have more clout and receive better treatment from venture firms "with our relationships were close enough with the fund managers that were part of the dialogue when theyre thinking about doing something with a new fund" and are rarely "approached after all is said and done " says dan feder who helps manage the endowment at princeton university in new jersey "but i understand that our experience is probably not typical "
