politics &amp economics japans abe chooses experience new ministers seen as better equipped to implement policy tokyo prime minister shinzo abe started his effort to rebound from an election defeat by naming a cabinet of older more experienced ministers who may be better equipped to implement measures to cope with an aging society mr abes liberal democratic party suffered a stinging defeat last month just months after he took office his ruling coalition lost its majority in the upper house of japans parliament after a series of mishaps made him look like a weak leader who didnt know how to control gaffe prone ministers his answer yesterday was to select for some of his major new appointments ldp heavyweights in their s many of whom served in the administration of junichiro koizumi mr abes popular predecessor the new appointments appear less likely to embarrass mr abe and could provide a contrast to the lack of government experience in the resurgent democratic party of japan the largest of the opposition parties that together took over the upper house from mr abes coalition up to now "hes been naive in choosing his people " said richard jerram an economist at macquarie securities in tokyo "this is an attempt to respond to that criticism " mr abes appointments appear to reflect a belief that his government has the right ideas in terms of policy but has failed in implementation and presentation his governments main policy council in june came up with some forward looking ideas such as forging more free trade agreements which could increase overall economic output but hurt japans inefficient farmers it also proposed to deregulate the airline industry through "open skies" accords and to promote tokyo as an international financial center but the council was criticized for vagueness over the timing and extent of these measures whats more mr abes previous cabinet presented a series of difficulties for him from offensive remarks to questionable expense claims the new appointees though unlikely to present radical new policy initiatives might prove better at getting things done while creating fewer distractions mr abes new finance minister is fukushiro nukaga years old who previously has served as defense minister and as economy minister he says he is in favor of "small government " mr abe retained hiroko ota an academic economist as economics minister she was a member of the teams that designed mr koizumis economic policies and has headed economic policy discussions for mr abe the new cabinet contains mainly veteran ldp faces these might put off a public that recently has voted for parties that promised change and renewal mr abe still faces a difficult balancing act between trying to introduce more competition into the economy and trying to reduce the growing wealth disparity between japans big cities and rural provinces while he said at a news conference that there is a need to address such concerns he added that globalization and japans aging society necessitated big changes "we have a responsibility to future generations and must implement reforms continuously " he said the cabinet will face a struggle to carry out government business because of the loss by the ldp and its coalition partner of its upper house majority though the upper house has only limited powers the lower house chooses the prime minister it can hold up or even block certain legislation and appointments the first big challenge comes in the next few months when mr abe will try to renew a counterterrorism law that allows japan to provide support for u s led efforts in afghanistan by refueling warships in the indian ocean the opposition dpj has said it will oppose the extension of the law which expires later this year the new foreign minister nobutaka machimura who served in that post under mr koizumi told reporters yesterday "the u s japan relationship remains the cornerstone of our foreign policy "
