large beginning this fall theyre adding a new one small environmental concerns and high fuel costs have given diminutive efficient vehicles a boost in the size obsessed u s marketplace as consumers begin to swap their large thirsty vehicles for alternatives such as the mini cooper in the past year or two general motors corp toyota motor corp nissan motor co and honda motor co have all introduced new low cost subcompacts to satisfy the perceived demand now volkswagen ags audi bmw ag and ford motor co s volvo are getting into the act those high cachet brands are lining up products that will test american tastes for small vehicles with outsize performance posh amenities and premium price tags other manufacturers like gms saab unit and daimlerchrysler ags mercedes benz have similar models in development that could make the leap to north america the first of the new crop to hit u s shores was audis luxurious but small a hatchback which has been sold in the u s since volvo is set to launch an all new two door c hatchback in the coming weeks that gently echoes the companys sleeker s models bmw which built its reputation on smaller efficient fun to drive vehicles is bringing its small premium series to the u s next spring having sold it in europe since prices for the smaller luxury models range widely anywhere from two to four times as high as those for the newest batch of economy oriented similarly sized hatchbacks and small sedans made by mass market brands such as toyota and gms chevrolet unit whose aveo at &# is one of the cheapest cars on the market by contrast volvos entry level c model starts at &# a slightly sportier model will cost &# though the company has yet to finalize pricing bmw says the series should cost about &# audis smallest vehicle meanwhile ranges in price from &# to well over &# for a well optioned model with all wheel drive david gasser a retired banker in big sky mont has already placed his order for the most powerful i version of the series "i actually desire the smallness of the because itll be more sporty have more pickup and be more fun to drive around curves " he says yet the broader market for more expensive small cars is still untested and sales of currently available models have stayed relatively low says erich merkle an analyst and director of forecasting at irn inc audi sold just a models in according to j d power

luxury manufacturers have tried to lift sales by providing less expensive models bmw produced a series compact hatchback in which while popular in europe didnt sell as well as expected in north america in mercedes tried to broaden its popular c class line by introducing the sportcoupe a small three door version like its main competitor the bmw compact it failed to connect with the younger buyers it was aimed at partly because of high prices mercedes stopped selling the model in the u s in but since then according to product planners the mini cooper which is made by bmw and was launched in the u s in has proved consumers will buy well designed premium small cars in the company sold of its mini cooper models currently the smallest car on the u s market its competitors hope that their small luxury vehicles will help draw in younger customers "people still say were boxy and boring " says art battaglia volvos c product manager "what c is supposed to do is help change the perception of what the volvo is we can be fun " volvo says the small peppy package could help its image its line of high performance "r" cars has gone little noticed in the marketplace it hopes the c both

when ordering which it thinks will particularly appeal to younger buyers early marketing materials feature somethings toting snowboards and yoga mats bmw for its part says the series is partly an attempt to recapture some of the low pretense high performance mystique its original models had the model will be marketed as a high performance car not an economy vehicle like the companys previous small efforts the most powerful version will rocket from zero to miles per hour in seconds with a top speed of miles per hour in contrast audi says its a is aimed at the companys traditional customers

strategy with power information network a division of j d power still the segment is only likely to get more crowded other manufacturers are studying the space with some going so far as to design future models saab recently discontinued its small car offering the x a modified subaru wrx that it had sold through an agreement with fuji heavy industries it drew a rabid if small following that nicknamed the model the "saabaru " but saab sold only about models in north america now the company is actively looking at developing a new vehicle smaller than its sedan model says jan willem vester a saab spokesman the model could arrive by while the company is remaining tight lipped gm has confirmed that it has the capacity in its swedish factory to produce the vehicle so far mercedes benz hasnt yet jumped on the bandwagon in europe it sells a b class which could compete with the new u s small luxury offerings as well as an even smaller compact the a class a mercedes spokesman says the company is looking at the market but has yet to make any decisions still if small premium cars catch on with american consumers it could set off a wave of new imports from europe
