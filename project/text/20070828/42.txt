health mailbox columnist tara parker pope answers readers questions q i saw the article on grilling and cancer risk we use a propane gas grill that prevents for the most part a lot of direct exposure to flames does this type of grilling hold the same risks as grilling with charcoal j b a many readers asked me about gas grills gas grills are a better option because they make it easier to control the temperature and the flame height remember the risks from grilling are due to cancer causing compounds deposited on the surface of the meat as well as compounds created inside the food high flames can create charred and blackened spots that shouldnt be eaten the smoke created from the fat drippings rises up and deposits carcinogenic compounds called pahs on the surface of the meat grilling also triggers a chemical reaction inside the food where high temperatures cause amino acids to react with creatine forming heterocyclic amines or hcas the amounts produced are tiny but hcas do have cancer causing properties and studies have linked high consumption of grilled well done meats with a higher cancer risk gas grills help because they give you more control of cooking temperature allowing you to turn down the flame preventing food from charring and keeping the temperature lower if you dont have a gas grill you can still grill safely buy wood chips made from hardwoods because they burn at lower temperatures than soft wood dampen coals that become too hot or flare up cover the grill with hole punched foil or wrap the food in foil to reduce contact with the smoke and to reduce fat drippings use lean cuts of meat and use tongs instead of a fork which punctures the meat and releases the juices and marinades are a good idea no matter what type of grill you have because they inhibit the formation of hcas q are the risks of grilling similar when grilling fish such as salmon or tuna as when grilling meat i s a grilling of any "muscle" meats whether its red meat chicken or fish has the potential to trigger the chemical reaction that can lead to carcinogenic compounds in the food its not the type of meat but high temperatures time on the grill and charring that cause the health worry although hcas can form in fish as well the advantage of fish is that it cooks more quickly on the grill than red meat or chicken so it doesnt have to be exposed to high heat for long periods of time in fact time matters a lot according to the harvard health letter experiments show that meat cooked at minutes at degrees has twice the hcas than meat cooked at the same temperature for just minutes the solution is to precook meats for just a minute in the microwave that will drain off some of the juices that can trigger chemical reactions on the grill and precooking means the meat has to spend less time on the grill before its well done q i think your article on grilling should have addressed the possible health risks of cooking meat to only rare or medium rare d c a food poisoning is always a concern with cooking meat chicken should always been cooked all the way through because chicken has to stay on the grill for longer stretches the solution is to precook it slightly in the microwave flip the meat often to keep internal temperatures from getting too high and keep the flames low to keep the temperature lower with red meat the goal is to bring the internal temperature to degrees and rare hamburger typically is a bigger health worry than rare steak thats because with a steak the high temperatures typically would kill e coli germs that lurk on the surface of the meat but with ground hamburger the germs can be mixed into the middle so its important that burgers are cooked all the way through q you didnt mentioned whether broiling meat in the oven also has the same risks factors as grilling at high temperature w o a grilling usually is the biggest concern because its a double threat hcas form on the inside and other cancer causing compounds form on the outside when fat splashes into the coals and flames leap up on the meat however frying and broiling meats also has the potential to create hcas if you are going to broil or fry make sure its only for short periods of time in general the safest way to cook meat is at degrees or lower hcas form around degrees fahrenheit
