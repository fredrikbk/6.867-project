the game credit turmoil may clean up buyout world ceos clouded moves and staple financing could come to an end the receding tide of todays credit markets is already leaving some gnarly residue in its wake one can only hope some of the worst practices of the credit boom will also be left behind the chief executives flirting with buyout barons the dubious "staple financing" plans the self important private equity rhetoric and the over the top buyout bashes all were practices that just a few months ago seemed commonplace they now carry an air of the unreal the first example that comes to mind is of txu corp chief executive john wilder who helped arrange the &# billion buyout of the texas utility earlier this year according to txus own filings mr wilder gave confidential information to the two private equity firms that ended up buying txu without first alerting his board this kind of practice can damage a company which loses some negotiating power when a buyer gets an early advantage even a leading delaware judge vice chancellor leo strine has said publicly that such free lancing ceos are "not as legally protected" as in deals run by independent board members a spokeswoman for mr wilder said it wouldnt have made sense to get the board involved until "there was something substantive to discuss " ethical worries didnt slow down "staple financing " a common practice in which a bank selling a company offers to fund the buyer with financing thats "stapled" to the pitchbook nowhere was that more clear than in the recently salvaged &# billion deal for home depot inc s supply unit having closely advised home depot on the deal lehman brothers holdings inc pushed further asking to finance the group of three private equity firms buying the company it was a coup until the buyout shops lurched into open battle about the price and terms of the transaction the result turned into a mess for lehman which was in such a conflicted position that it had to be replaced by goldman sachs group inc in advising home depot banks say their split roles are misunderstood one big use for the staples is to set a floor price on a transaction that might otherwise lack one that was supposed to be the case in number of auctions that came to market in recent weeks such as the sale of heating products maker goodman global inc but its banker goldman sachs pulled the offer such self proclaimed pieties seem to be evaporating across the street thats especially true with private equity firms which regard their work as the vanguard of economic progress the idea at the heart of their business that paying down debt instills managerial discipline became subverted over the past months as one leading private equity player put it a few months ago some buyout shops began "solving backwards " by that he means they first calculated how much money they could raise to finance a purchase rather than first calculating a targets intrinsic worth this meant debt markets were doing the exact opposite of disciplining they were enabling ever steeper prices deal values climbed accordingly according to data compiled by factset mergerstat in for instance private equity firms paid nine times cash flow for their targets a number that climbed to times this year private equity firms have been selling companines they own "to people who could borrow even more and thats not going to happen now theyre going to be stuck with a lot of deals for a long time " said michael weisbach a finance professor at the university of illinois who just released a study of private equity buyouts and how will the buyout firms rectify things two to three years from now when some of their investments are still losers the most direct path will be to cover the overpayment by slashing costs that means greater chances for the things that private equity groups insist dont much exist job cuts factory closings offshoring juxtapose that scenario with fancy living in new york which continues to rage on just last week apollo management lp chief leon black threw a beach bash for about family friends out in the hamptons the group enjoyed catering from nobu and daniel two of manhattans priciest eateries while taking in a private concert by tom petty &amp the heartbreakers for some tough times thats a pretty nice day at the beach email to dennis berman wsj com
