politics &amp economics kremlin aims at foes in arrests prosecutor ties journalist killing to mastermind living abroad moscow russias top prosecutor announced the first arrests in the murder last year of a prominent opposition journalist and blamed the crime on enemies of the kremlin the assertion echoed statements by president vladimir putin and came amid a broader kremlin strategy of vilifying opponents abroad to rouse popular support anna politkovskayas murder in october highlighted the dangers faced by russias independent press which has crumpled along with opposition parties as the kremlin has tightened control ahead of legislative elections later this year and a presidential election in some of mr putins critics blamed the kremlin for the killing and western leaders had pressured moscow to bring the murderers to justice at a news conference yesterday chief prosecutor yuri chaika announced the arrest of people including five men linked to russias security services who he said helped organize and carry out the shooting mr chaika said the mastermind of the killing was a person living outside russia and "aims to destabilize the situation in the country " while mr chaika wouldnt name the suspect he said those who ordered the killing seek "a return to the former system of rule under which money and oligarchs decided everything " such references from the kremlin often point to boris berezovsky a onetime kremlin insider who fell out with mr putin after he became president and fled to london to avoid prosecution mr berezovsky dismissed mr chaikas comments as "psychopathic" and said the kremlin was behind the murder ms politkovskayas former colleagues condemned mr chaikas statement ms politkovskayas former editor dmitry muratov said he is convinced that police found the men who shot her but that prosecutors appear to be naming a mastermind for their own political reasons "its a political statement he made for a political purpose " said mr muratov "its political pr advantageous for the leaders of this country " while the prosecutors version of events might be met with skepticism in the west within russia it is likely to be picked up and repeated by government officials and the state run media which has a strong influence on public opinion mr putin facing criticism at the time of ms politkovskayas killing for curtailing freedom of the press cast the crime as part of a foreign inspired effort to weaken the government "this murder has done more damage to russia and the current authorities of russia and chechnya than politkovskayas articles " he said he suggested the killing was the work of "people hiding from russian justice" seeking to discredit his government at the news conference yesterday chief prosecutor chaika said investigators concluded the slaying was set up by a chechen native who led a moscow organized crime ring specializing in contract killings five people linked to russias law enforcement bodies one police major one federal security service officer and three former police officers were arrested in the past several weeks and accused of helping track ms politkovskaya so her killers could find her he said mr chaika said the crime ring may also have been involved in the shooting death of the american editor of forbes magazines russian edition paul klebnikov another murder that has damped the environment for journalists in russia the prosecutors announcement suggests the death of ms politkovskaya will remain like many russian contract killings before it a matter of conjecture while police have arrested the triggermen in some high profile killings in russia kremlin critics say masterminds are seldom brought to justice ms politkovskaya was a lead reporter at novaya gazeta a feisty moscow based newspaper that specializes in muckraking and probes of government corruption she was the third journalist at the paper to die under mysterious circumstances one reporter was beaten to death with a hammer and another died of an apparent poisoning because ms politkovskaya wrote hundreds of articles for novaya gazeta colleagues said her possible enemies were numerous her work often bitterly critical of mr putin brought her into contact with some of the kremlins fiercest critics including mr berezovsky whom she met in london as well as alexander litvinenko who last year died of a fatal dose of radioactive polonium after meeting with some former russian security agents for tea moscow has refused to extradite the russian that british prosecutors have indicted in the litvinenko case ms politkovskaya feared her own critique of the brutal war in the breakaway republic of chechnya could endanger her life she believed she was poisoned aboard an airline flight in to prevent her from flying to the region to report on the chechen seizure of an elementary school in beslan her newspaper assigned her bodyguards after she received death threats but colleagues said she had stopped
