traffic jams at airports as airlines vie for popular departure times as a pilot and aircraft owner i applaud dick armey for wanting to take the politics out of flight control "fixing the air traffic mess " editorial page aug however he misses the bigger picture regarding the nations problems with air traffic the number of faa en route centers and approach control facilities are not the barriers to reducing air traffic issues via successful implementation of nextgen that mr armey claims the issues are much more fundamental the use of gps navigation systems have been in place in aviation for a number of years and while nextgen expands on that capability it does not solve the issues created and promulgated by the airlines themselves the airlines in their quest to dominate market share are ever increasing the numbers of flights all arriving at the same time into major cities with strained airport infrastructure while using smaller aircraft that hold fewer passengers nextgen does not eliminate the delays due to lack of runway availability for these planes to land depart on nextgen does not eliminate the continued use of the "hub and spoke" system that legacy carriers use to overload airways and airports nextgen does not eliminate the need to delay flights from departing and arriving due to extreme weather conditions summer thunderstorms winter snow and ice nextgen also doesnt solve the problem of crew scheduling problems created by bad airline management practices in the name of cost cutting i agree with mr armey that "bureaucratic inertia at the federal aviation administration and congresss penchant for micromanagement" is a large part of the problem i certainly dont agree with mr armeys wanting to create another government bureaucracy to dictate the solution dave jablon boston mr armey misses the real crux of the problem of increasing number and duration of delays granted it would be nice to have all the bells and whistles of an up to date system to manage air traffic however the real bottleneck amply covered in a recent wall street journal article is the inability to handle all the arrivals departures and aircraft on the ground at the airports the problem is caused by the competitive desire of all air carriers to have departures at the most popular times the air travel equivalent to clogged roadways during morning and evening drive time finding runways and gates enough to handle the rush hour crush is what is tying things up in knots it is not as mr armey implies the moving of planes along at cruise speed up at plus thousand feet between point a and point b the solution is to limit the number of arrival and departure slots each airport can safely handle at any time if anytown municipal can only handle x number of operations an hour thats the number permitted and if youre the scheduling manager of flash airways and you didnt pull a lucky numbers tough youll have to take another time or airport william j schulz leesburg fla with all due respect to mr armey i feel that a much simpler solution exists to the air traffic control problem usa today recently revealed that a large part of the problem is the greatly increased volume of commuter flights the commuter flights take up the same space as large jets in the air traffic control system yet move much smaller numbers of passengers per take off and landing if there are commuter flights to newark each day from winston salem to of them could be eliminated by putting those passengers on four or five larger planes multiply those flight savings by the commuter problem in the whole air traffic control system and the existing system becomes adequate the real problem stems from a fundamental flaw in the deregulation of the airlines in the s while it solved the issue of ease of new entrants to the market at the same time it greatly complicated the reservations process and pricing the airlines would have anti trust immunity restored to agree on collective rate making and revenue sharing and would be forced to schedule and book flights for each other like they used to i do not disagree with mr armeys suggestions realignment and consolidation of the current air traffic control facilities should be de politicized and coupled with "nextgen" to take the system into the future philip lattavo canton ohio
