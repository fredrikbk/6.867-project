onset of lame duck phase gives bush fewer levers to move agenda president bushs loss of another close longtime aide closes one particularly messy stage of his second term but suggests a new one may be opening the lame duck phase that hardly means mr bush is irrelevant but it does suggest his means for exerting influence are going to be different and perhaps clumsier from hereon increasingly it appears he will be preoccupied with three objectives managing the iraq war using presidential vetoes to thwart democratic plans and spending impulses and advancing a republican agenda as best he can through regulatory moves and executive actions that skirt congressional input over the past several months the controversy over attorney general alberto gonzales and his firing of eight u s attorneys has impeded parts of mr bushs agenda notably the effort to expand wiretaps of terror suspects the attorney general chose to use congresss august recess period to put a stop to such distractions by ending his embattled term this august break though marks a broader turning point for the bush presidency since republicans lost control of congress in last falls elections it has been an uphill struggle for mr bush to move big items on his domestic agenda past an uncooperative legislature or to shake the shadow of the war in iraq by his aides own admission those tasks will get even more difficult when congress returns this fall in retrospect the failed attempt during the spring and summer to pass a broad overhaul of the nations immigration laws is beginning to look like the last best chance mr bush had for a significant legislative accomplishment in his final two years in office the politics of an election year in which both the presidency and control of congress are to be decided in wide open races will intrude more and more into debates on domestic as well as iraq policies having failed to build a workable and durable bipartisan coalition in congress the bush administration is unlikely to be able to do so now the departure last week of top bush political strategist karl rove seemed to underscore how much the presidents room for political maneuvering has narrowed a white house spokesman tony fratto rejected the notion that the administration is losing momentum "the term lame duck is for dime store political scientists " he said "it demonstrates a misunderstanding of the power of the presidency and a miscalculation of the energy and intentions of this president " he said the white house has an "aggressive" agenda that will address an overhaul of surveillance laws the iraq war spending education and free trade and he pointed to solid support among republicans in congress for blocking bad legislation if necessary through upholding vetoes mr bushs final push to add to his legacy will begin unfolding rapidly next month when the commander of american troops in iraq delivers a highly anticipated report to congress at the same time democratic leaders will try to compel mr bush to open an expected autumn veto showdown on their terms where he would face killing legislation expanding a childrens health program and funding education in both cases the white house is deeply unhappy with spending and other provisions democrats have attached and democrats are essentially daring mr bush to run the political risk of vetoing items that can be portrayed as designed to help kids meanwhile initiatives that havent come to closure far outnumber those that have in addition to the failure on the immigration front a much ballyhooed energy bill is unfinished as is a farm bill and important trade legislation the administration finally convinced congress to pass the bill expanding the governments ability to conduct wiretaps without a court order after delays exacerbated by fighting over mr gonzales but the renewal expires in five months and congressional democrats signaled anew yesterday their intent to continue sparring with the white house over the law there is ample debate over who is to blame for this state of affairs a white house that hasnt figured out how to compromise with democrats or democrats who have shown no particular eagerness to negotiate with a damaged republican president but the effect is the same some republicans argue mr bush still can be effective even if he is less able to get deals done on policy "he will have the next year to redefine the republican party as the party that holds down spending to reconfirm the republican party as the antitax party and to remind voters that democrats want to spend more and tax more " said grover norquist president of the conservative americans for tax reform "its best to dramatize the very real differences between the parties in order to influence the election in and to do things now that will change the world in three to five to seven years " attempts by mr bush to champion spending cuts though could be undermined by the fact that federal discretionary spending has risen about since despite republican control of the white house and of congress racking up big achievements is never easy as a president draws toward the end of his eight years though not impossible ronald reagan signed a big welfare bill in his closing months in office and got congress to ratify a hotly contested treaty limiting medium range nuclear forces in europe bill clinton oversaw a kosovo peace deal and an expansion of medicare and medicaid in his seventh year and in his final year got congress to approve chinas world trade organization membership mr bushs position may be weaker than those predecessors though and not only because of iraq mr bushs vice president dick cheney isnt seeking the presidency himself an unusual situation that diminishes the need for republicans with an eye on the next election to support their partys incumbents democrats not surprisingly insist they are ready to work with the president to get some things done now illinois rep rahm emanuel the chairman of the house democratic caucus calls the bush legislative record so far this year "a barren shelf" dominated mostly by the renewal of a highway spending measure but adds "if he wants to get things done he can get them done if he doesnt he can stay the course hes on and that highway bill will be his only accomplishment " and democrats actually run their own risks if washington is seen as paralyzed for the rest of mr bushs term for one they are vulnerable to charges that they are more interested in investigating the bush administration for their own political profit than in making substantive progress on the publics business yesterday texas sen john cornyn the vice chairman of the senate republican conference seized on mr gonzaless resignation to highlight democrats "more than investigations and more than oversight hearings " which he said are distracting from important legislative matters in fact there are still some areas for potential legislative accomplishment remaining this year for example a big farm bill that both parties want and need for political reasons seems likely to move forward on the financial front industry experts say the white house has shown interest in working with the democratic chairmen of the banking committees to enact changes to the federal housing administration in the wake of the subprime mortgage tumult the revisions would make fha products more appealing to home buyers with imperfect credit histories and create competition in the subprime market there is also renewed interest in passing an overhaul of the government chartered mortgage market giants fannie mae and freddie mac otherwise the white house is increasingly focused on salvaging what it can through administrative action perhaps the area with the most potential for far reaching action is the energy front where the environmental protection agency and transportation officials are figuring out how to go about reducing carbon dioxide emissions associated with global warming through tougher fuel efficiency standards and greater use of alternative fuels those are ideas mr bush floated as signature legislative proposals in his state of the union address in january susan dudley the administrations new regulatory chief said yesterday that officials hope to put out a proposed version of those new regulations by the end of in order to promulgate a final rule by the time mr bush leaves office the white house also is putting together proposals for a series of international negotiations on climate change that are set to begin in september that offers another chance to advance the administrations agenda on global warming at a critical juncture as world leaders try to put together a follow on to the kyoto protocol which expires in homeland security officials also will be rolling out regulations requiring airlines to provide more passenger data to federal officials so the agency can match it with terrorist lists ms dudley said there also will be more relating to passports as well as a big automobile side impact protection rule coming from transportation and safety officials this conservative administrations basic impulse is to deregulate of course rather than to advance policy through additional rule making still "there are going to be a lot" of new regulations ms dudley said "there have been a variety of studies showing a significant increase in new regulations at the end of a presidents term" regardless of his party "im not promising we wont see that at the end of this presidents term " she said "but ive been stressing with agencies that we want to make sure its well thought out we dont want things that are just rushed out at the end "
