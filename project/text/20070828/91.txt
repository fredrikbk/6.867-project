the gonzales resignation gonzales successor faces political and time hurdles democrats may oppose some of likely choices short tenure to lead washington in seeking a replacement for attorney general alberto gonzales the bush administration must find a candidate acceptable to congress and able to reinvigorate a demoralized fractured justice department president bush speaking yesterday after mr gonzales announced his resignation didnt name a successor an administration official said the nomination might be delayed until after mr bushs trip to australia next week the names of several possible candidates were making the rounds in washington but all of them face potential hurdles they include homeland security secretary michael chertoff former deputy attorney general and current pepsico inc executive larry thompson former solicitor general theodore olson and utah republican sen orrin hatch others include homeland security adviser frances fragos townsend securities and exchange commission chairman christopher cox and federal bureau of investigation director robert mueller for a white house that usually has replacements lined up for top jobs the uncertainty over mr gonzaless successor underscores the difficulties the administration faces in finding a suitable candidate any candidate is likely to face a tough confirmation hearing by a democrat controlled congress for a job that will only last at most about months mr gonzales is one of the highest ranking members of the bush administration to step down since november when former defense secretary donald rumsfeld announced his resignation in that case mr bush named robert gates as his replacement at the same news conference for now paul clement the justice departments solicitor general is serving as acting attorney general mr chertoff a former federal prosecutor and former head of the justice departments criminal division has one of the strongest legal resumes for the job but his position at homeland security would be hard to fill in addition his tenure at that agency was damaged by its slow response to hurricane katrina and he has riled democrats over how counterterrorism grants are doled out those miscues "should be too difficult to overcome " said rep jerrold nadler a new york democrat mr chertoff who served as an assistant u s attorney under rudolph giuliani in the s and was appointed by former president george h w bush to serve as the u s attorney for new jersey has support from an unlikely group defense attorneys carmen hernandez president of the national association of criminal defense lawyers said the department needs someone to restore morale and integrity to the justice department as well as to depoliticize how decisions are made "he was a u s attorney and hes much more steeped in the tradition of the department of justice than gonzales ever was " she said "although nacdl frequently disagrees with mr chertoff at least he is someone who will consider bona fide arguments " the possible candidate with the least negative image is mr thompson widely respected by prosecutors and defense attorneys his departure from justice in caused concern among career employees at the department who respected his work and thought he was in line to succeed then attorney general john ashcroft the question is whether he would leave pepsi for a short tenured job legal experts said "bush has openly said he wants larry to come back in the administration many times " said john yoo a former deputy assistant attorney general in the bush administrations office of legal counsel and a law professor at the university of california at berkeley but mr yoo concedes "you have a year maybe and the confirmation hearings are going to be unpleasant because of the presidential elections " ultimately whoever gets the job he says will "only have four or five months to lead the department in the direction you want " mr olson who served at justice during the reagan administration and the current presidents first term is also well respected one negative is his role in the florida presidential ballot recount that helped put mr bush in the white house in carl tobias a law professor at the university of richmond said mr olson is "certainly very competent the question is whether democrats feel he is too much of a republican partisan " sen hatchs name has also emerged and mr tobias predicted that senate colleagues would confirm the judiciary committee ranking member "in a minute " in addition mr tobias said while people may disagree with mr hatch "he can be bipartisan " james tierney director of the national state attorney general program at columbia law school said a hatch nomination would be interesting "people would say hes a politician but i dont think theres a reason to believe he couldnt be an honorable attorney general and thats really what we want " mr tierney said other possible replacements are long shots including messrs cox former attorney general william barr and mr ashcroft mr cox is considered more valuable at the sec although some white house officials said he is considered too independent one of the more interesting names that has surfaced is mr muellers a former u s attorney he sided with mr ashcroft and former deputy attorney general james comey in opposing the bush administration on some elements of its terrorist surveillance program and he threatened to resign along with other high ranking justice officials if changes werent made mr muellers notes from a meeting with a hospitalized mr ashcroft recently reignited questions about statements mr gonzales had made after nearly six years as fbi director the stress of heading the agency most responsible for preventing domestic terrorism may have mr mueller looking for a change one federal agent said adding "this would allow him to continue pushing for changes at the fbi while taking on a greater role in restoring credibility to the justice department " mr yoo said the white house may prefer that mr mueller stay focused on remaking the fbi "the worst thing you can do to a turnaround effort is switch captains on the boat while youre still turning it " he said john d
