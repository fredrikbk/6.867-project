enough punishment for hedge king when the markets are serving up the hedge fund implosion du jour being the worlds biggest publicly traded hedge fund company can be painful man group plc has been in that awkward position for most of the summer its shares are down since the dow jones industrial average peaked july as investors decided it was better to sell than to wait around and see if man would get caught up in the mess "the biggest most visible way to play the negativity around hedge funds is man group " said paul sloane who helps run a hedge fund that invests in financial stocks at martin currie investment management ltd in edinburgh scotland when there are question marks around the performance of hedge funds man group will be sold by investment funds and shorted by other hedge funds he said mr sloanes fund owns man stock investors had good reason to be negative on the company which is based in london and runs its own hedge funds and invests in others it had assets under management of &# billion at the end of march one of mans largest funds ahl lost in two weeks that fund uses computer driven quantitative techniques similar to other big hedge funds that are suffering including one from goldman sachs group inc with man "people are not really sure what it is investing in and they dont know that the computerized trading models they have will work this time " said leigh harrison head of united kingdom retail funds at threadneedle asset management ltd in london he declined to say if he owned man shares other setbacks included the initial public offering of the man financial brokerage which didnt raise as much as the company had hoped and the company had to cancel the planned ipo of a small new york hedge fund making matters worse a portion of that fund was supposed to be managed by thyke capital which reported double digit losses recently according to people familiar with the matter man also has money invested in thyke a close look at man reveals a company that is surprisingly tame and that has significant long term earnings power mans investing strategies seek to make money when markets both rise and fall when man last reported results in may man chief executive officer peter clarke said the company "will outperform when equities arent doing so well which fundamentally is what hedge funds are supposed to do " hedge funds are supposed to be a hedge against market downturns because they can short securities invest across assets classes and use derivatives the company has earned the benefit of the doubt on this front in the past in the last bear market its shares doubled between january the top of the u k market and march when the market bottomed out according to evolution securities some analysts have described the company itself as defensive too because its earnings should hold up even when markets are falling bulls would argue the companys shares are worth a leap of faith in this choppy market because the price is low and management is returning heaps of capital to investors man shares trade at about times expected earnings for lower than asset management peers according to an aug note by simone glass an analyst at ubs ag in london who rates the stock a "buy " her month price target of pence &# is higher than the stocks closing price friday man shares closed friday at pence down on the london stock exchange the u k markets were closed for a holiday yesterday moreover investors potential losses in a volatile market likely will be cushioned by hefty payouts man plans to give investors the proceeds of the &# billion sale of its brokerage business later this year it also has &# billion in excess capital on its balance sheet according to ubs together this adds up to nearly of the companys current market value the stock also has a dividend yield of about and the company plans to use performance fees to repurchase shares some analysts maintain that mans shares are now a bargain five analysts came out with "buy" ratings recently including one that upgraded the view from "hold " their message mans decline is more to do with sentiment than fundamentals some investors agree "we think it is good value the market volatility is creating a good buying opportunity " said mark lovett chief investment officer for european equities at rcm ltd in london rcm held man shares as of last tuesday according to thomson financial in an attempt to shore up confidence mans mr clarke bought gbp or about &# of his companys shares this month other executives have also purchased shares a man spokesman declined to comment on the funds recent performance or stock movement the company is expected late next month to report investor redemptions and detail how its funds are performing finally man has a more secure revenue stream and is less dependent on performance than many investors may realize nearly half its assets are in funds in which the initial investment is guaranteed investors would need to pay early redemption fees to sell out of these funds which limits potential withdrawals even ahl the fund that has tumbled shouldnt dent earnings to the extent the share price decline suggests it accounts for of assets under management if its current performance was translated into earnings it would mean a decline next year and in according to ubs thats in part because performance fees accounted for of pretax profit which is above that for more traditional asset managers but well below other big hedge funds ian mcdonald contributed to this article
