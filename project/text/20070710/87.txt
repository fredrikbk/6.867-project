privilege fight with bush poses risk for congress to discontented voters lawmakers may seem too focused on probes a looming constitutional showdown over the white houses right to shield internal communications may pose less risk to president bush who is resisting subpoenas from congress than to lawmakers faced with deepening public discontent for the white house which notified the senate yesterday that mr bush is asserting executive privilege to block the subpoenaed testimony of former staffers the move appears aimed at either winning in the courts or running out the clock before a judgment is rendered for the democratic controlled congress which has multiple investigations under way into the republican administrations firing of eight u s attorneys a prolonged fight could have a clear political price congresss approval ratings are plummeting it hasnt been able to pass many major bills amid divisions within the democratic majority and the white house is starting to portray the body as one more concerned with investigating than law making the clash is the first significant confrontation over the doctrine known as executive privilege since mr bush took office in in part that is because republicans largely controlled congress until this year but it also reflects shifting stances after initially pledging to cooperate with democrats on immigration energy and other legislative priorities the administration has in recent weeks settled on a tougher stance in response to multiple congressional investigations which are themselves becoming more strident in tone although the president is on the ropes over iraq immigration and other issues he may be able to gain the upper hand in this fight over the years administrations of all stripes have asserted the right to seek unvarnished guidance from advisers claiming that wouldnt be possible amid a constant threat of congressional subpoenas the administrations tack makes it more likely the current fight will end up in court there the president may have the benefit of waiting out a resolution given that he has only about months left in office under those circumstances the battle might appear to voters to be mere partisan infighting and would in any case be of little practical use to lawmakers "congress is surely concerned that a court fight could create lengthy delays in obtaining the information potentially many months of delays " says michael bromwich a partner at fried frank harris shriver &amp jacobson llp in washington and former inspector general at the justice department but while the white house would relish the chance to portray lawmakers as overzealous he says "there is a built up public appetite for oversight that has not yet been satisfied " the white house counsel fred fielding in a letter to the democratic and republican leaders of the senate judiciary committee also shot back at what he called the accusatory tone of an earlier letter from the senators and questioned the committees authority to demand documents after enjoying six years of a largely pliant republican congress the bush administration has been buffeted by probes and hearings by democrats seeking to uncover information about a range of subjects from domestic wiretapping to the leak of a former central intelligence agency operatives name to the use of intelligence before the invasion of iraq hints of the white houses more aggressive response to congressional questions could be seen in recent press briefings such as one last thursday in response to a question about the senate investigation scott stanzel a white house spokesman said congress had launched "over investigations had over requests for documents and interviews and they have had over oversight hearings in just about days " while passing only six major bills sen charles schumer the new york democrat who has led the senate probe of the firings said in an interview that the white house will fail if it believes it can "run out the clock" on the congressional inquiry based on past executive privilege fights he says it is likely congress can persuade a court to issue a contempt citation which will prompt negotiations to hand over documents before the courts give a final ruling "we think theres a good likelihood that well hear this information within months " mr schumer says "stonewalling never looks good to the public " mr schumer dismissed the administrations accusation that congress isnt doing enough legislating "weve always thought it our role to do both legislating and oversight " he says "theres been no oversight for the last six years of this administration " jim manley a spokesman for senate majority leader harry reid of nevada responded more aggressively to the white houses critique of congresss oversight hearings "the white house needs to get used to the fact that after years of getting away with absolutely no oversight while republicans controlled congress democrats are finally going to hold it accountable to the american people " as for congresss priorities and the amount of oversight it is doing he added "the administrations numbers are as faulty as the intelligence they used to mislead the country into war and democrats are wholly committed to delivering on our promises to the american people to make our country safer clean up washington and put working families first " but congresss beefed up oversight might not be playing well with voters while mr bushs popularity has fallen to its lowest levels of his presidency in the latest wall street journal nbc poll in june approval ratings for congress are even worse at that is the lowest level measured since democrats won control of capitol hill in november and matches the rating the republican led congress had in june of just of respondents said they think the nation is headed in the right direction while believe it is on the wrong track levels not seen since the fight has come to a head this week because senators have subpoenaed sara taylor the former white house political director to testify tomorrow about her involvement in discussions between the justice department and the presidents aides about the prosecutor firings the white house has offered to make staffers available for questions but only in private interviews with congressional investigators with no transcript or other record democrats and some republicans have rebuffed the offer it is the latest in a series of hearings some of which have produced dramatic testimony about the inner workings of the administration but none of which have so far uncovered any illegal behavior in the prosecutors ousters key players in the controversy however have continued to point the finger elsewhere in response to questions about how the eight fired lawyers were selected fueling demands for further scrutiny ms taylors attorney told senators during the weekend that she wants to testify but will decline to do so because of the presidents executive privilege claim ms taylors attorney asked that she not be held in contempt for her refusal to testify and that instead sanctions be leveled at the white house there is potentially more at stake for the white house than the probe into the u s attorney firings however the bush administration also could assert executive privilege soon in a range of other congressional investigations including some such as the conduct of its warrantless wiretapping program that are even more sensitive to the white house some legal experts say the recent history of congressional success with its subpoenas isnt encouraging for the white house but the house and senate face problems of their own since cabinet level or senior executive officials have been cited for criminal contempt by committees or the full house or senate for failing to produce subpoenaed documents in each instance the executive branch eventually complied with many or all the demands forestalling the initiation of criminal proceedings and reflecting the executive branchs typical reluctance to fight such cases to the end while contempt cases involving senior officials have rarely made it to court in recent years the house did vote in to hold former environmental protection agency official rita lavelle in contempt for defying a subpoena to testify according to a senate report she eventually was acquitted in court of the contempt charge although she was convicted of lying to congress about her management of the superfund program but there is a complicating factor that might prevent the current fight from progressing further one that could thwart congresss moves under the criminal contempt procedures that congress typically uses a u s attorney has to bring the matter before a grand jury for action it is an open legal question whether a justice department employee is required to bring a case before a grand jury when the white house has asserted executive privilege in fact following a contempt vote against anne gorsuch burford a reagan era head of the environmental protection agency the justice department raised that very question the documents in question ultimately were handed over before the case was litigated leaving the matter unresolved as a result of the confusion congress could consider some novel alternative to the criminal contempt citation for instance the senate and possibly the house could bring something called a civil contempt charge there is also an unwieldy proceeding known as inherent contempt that hasnt been used since the s but it could be refashioned and modernized some experts believe see related letter "letters to the editor enough laws already" wsj july
