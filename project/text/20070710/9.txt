ahead of the tape a less visible way to cut jobs reduced hiring even as the economy slowed in the past year the job market has looked relatively healthy a little followed report from the labor department which tracks the churn in the job market could shed light on what is happening beneath the surface the job openings and labor turnover survey asks employers how many people are quitting their jobs getting laid off and getting fired every month notably slow economic growth hasnt been marked by increased layoffs as is often the case instead companies have slowed the pace of hiring in april employers laid off about of their workers equal to the average rate of firing from last year the hiring rate at was down from a peak of last july may numbers come out today layoffs make the news and make workers worry reduced hiring isnt nearly as visible it might help explain why workers have remained confident about the economy amid high energy prices and a housing crunch goldman sachs economist jan hatzius points out that when companies cut back hiring it affects workers who are just entering the labor force or who like many teenagers are only there temporarily layoffs hurt established workers who are more often family breadwinners another reason the economic slowdown has been bearable on net the economy is adding an average of jobs a month this year compared with monthly last year still if the slowdown continues it could grind some households down over time workers would notice that opportunities are drying up and that their kids havent gotten jobs and moved out of the house not as bad news for builders isnt enough for investors some bulls used to believe the shares of home builders would rebound when bad news about the housing market became a little less bad they have kept an especially close eye on the rate of deterioration in orders for new homes in the third quarter of last year orders were down from a year earlier according to citigroup analyst stephen kim the rate of decline in orders slowed to a year on year drop in the fourth quarter and a drop in the first quarter historically a slower rate of decline preceded a turnaround one reason mr kim had been urging investors to buy the builders now he has changed his view "investors are very reluctant to buy into things which are getting worse at a lesser rate " the longtime bull said in an interview last week after dropping his buy recommendations on several builder stocks "i think they are sensing that there is another shoe to drop " today d r horton the nations largest home builder by number of units reports orders for its third fiscal quarter ending june this comes a few weeks before its quarterly earnings report penciled in for july its orders dropped last quarter from a year earlier but analysts like mr kim think it wont be as bad this time around orders may be misleading in part because builders are propping up sales with lavish incentives such as discounted kitchen appliances and price cuts the real sign of the bottom might be when they stop slashing prices to attract buyers michael corkery send comments to justin lahart wsj com or michael corkery wsj com
