its moodys vs the shorts bearish bets emerge as firm faces questions over its credit ratings short sellers love to target companies heading into financial turmoil now some of those investors who bet on a stocks decline are targeting a company that is paid to spot financial problems before they occur moodys corp but unlike some of the blowups in the recent past that the new york based credit ratings firm and its main rivals caught too late such as worldcom inc and enron corp its profitability and cash flows remain strong that makes it a tough stock to bet against still moodys and other credit rating firms are again taking heat for the meltdown in the subprime mortgage market "i think they did a bad job but theyve weathered reputational storms before " says glenn tongue managing partner at t partners llc a hedge fund in new york that manages about &# million "there might be a black eye on the franchise associated with subprime mortgage securitizations but the business flow and probably the liability will be contained " bearish investors are betting that moodys shares will tumble as the companys lucrative business in providing ratings for structured debt products such as collateralized debt obligations or cdos could dry up due to fears spreading from rising defaults in those mortgages extended to borrowers with poor credit histories together with some analysts and academics who believe the rating agencies played a key role in the subprime crisis by giving high ratings to thousands of bonds that fell quickly in value some short sellers also are wagering that legislators regulators and disgruntled investors will shake up the existing oligopoly structure and put an end to its fat margins and profits "its a great business model as long as you can get people to pay for it " says james chanos president of kynikos associates a new york hedge fund with about &# billion in assets that specializes in short selling mr chanos among the most vocal of moodys critics is known for having bet early against enron "if they have no predictive power over that which theyre rating then why bother " many of moodys ratings for subprime debt represent "shoddy goods " according to joseph mason a professor of finance at drexel university "if the quality of the good isnt going to be maintained by the producer then it has to be maintained by a regulatory authority " he adds in a paper co written with joshua rosner an independent research analyst prof mason argues that the ratings agencies including standard &amp poors corp and fitch ratings as well as moodys are deeply involved with investment bank underwriters in structuring pools of assets which places them in a more active role than simply publishing opinions on the creditworthiness of the underlying assets the ratings companies have stated that they dont advise on the structures but do provide guidelines on how pools of assets can be set up to achieve good ratings in past lawsuits that involved corporate debt ratings judges have ruled that such rankings are opinions like newspaper editorials and are protected under the first amendment but if lawyers can convince a judge that moodys debt ratings shouldnt be treated as opinions the company could be hurt by lawsuits the argument against ratings agencies appears to be gaining traction at least in ohio the states attorney general marc dann is investigating the role of the credit ratings firms including moodys to determine whether they have any culpability in the subprime mortgage breakdown moodys says it cant be held responsible for drops in market value of certain assets "our ratings predict the probability of default we do not offer views on market pricing and valuation " says linda huber chief financial officer of moodys "people enter the market and trade these securities at their own risk " indeed moodys hold on the market along with s&amp p has proved bullet proof despite criticism during the russian and asian debt crises and after accounting scandals turned investment grade telecommunications bonds into "junk" overnight it has taken fitch about years to compete as a distant third in the market behind moodys and s&amp p so it will likely take a while for competition to erode moodys big margins and profits to date moodys hasnt been sued in federal court for any of its subprime credit ratings which constituted around of its revenue last year and while structured finance ratings made up of its total revenue last year another came from non u s revenue where there also is strong growth "subprime debt clearly hasnt been the only driver of the business " says neil godsey an analyst at friedman billings ramsey which has a "buy" recommendation on the stock for most of the past decade even when moodys was under fire for the worldcom and enron debacles its operating margins have held steady at about which is higher than google inc s margin it generates a lot of cash with a healthy cash flow yield of
