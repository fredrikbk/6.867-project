politics &amp economics fuel rules soak soap makers alternative energy subsidies pinch supply of a key ingredient washington government efforts to reduce u s reliance on imported oil are forcing up prices for another indispensable commodity soap soap and detergent makers say they are being hurt by a double whammy of federal subsidies and mandates that has reduced the supply and pushed up the costs of a key ingredient beef tallow the steeply rising price of corn driven by a federal requirement to use more ethanol has pushed up corn prices making animal feed more expensive and prompting farmers to blend the less expensive tallow and other fats into their feed the upshot in the past year beef tallow prices have doubled then in april the internal revenue service issued a tax ruling that will expand an existing subsidy for turning animal fat into a diesel additive the chief beneficiary will be a joint venture by conocophillips a houston oil company and tyson foods inc a major food producer that will make a new "renewable" diesel oil later this year tyson says it plans to shift about a quarter of its animal fat output into the joint venture by the companies expect to produce million gallons per year which would be eligible for a &# a gallon tax credit the oil will be added to diesel fuel burned in cars and trucks tallow is a solid nearly colorless fat extracted from the natural fat of cattle already rising tallow prices "are causing a radical change in the structure of our marketplace " says dennis griesing a vice president of the soap and detergent association he says some major u s companies are importing more expensive palm oil as a tallow substitute but that makes those companies more vulnerable to competition from soap makers in indonesia and malaysia which enjoy better access to palm oil and have cheaper labor "our companies will have to change their formulations " he says "theyll never come back to the tallow base and pretty soon voila weve killed off another american industry " andrew desouza a spokesman for the treasury department says the irs revenue ruling was intended to extend the administrations efforts to "incentivize the growth of alternative energies and alternate and renewable fuels " jeff webster general manager of tysons renewable energy program says he is aware of the soap makers problems and says his company will try to keep supplying them with the beef tallow they need mr webster says the governments fuel subsidies are creating market changes for lots of companies including tyson which must buy high priced corn for its big animal feeding operations "were all having to make trade offs if you will in terms of bringing renewable fuels to market " the issue will surface later this month when the house takes up the energy bill rep lloyd doggett of texas a democrat on the ways and means committee will attempt to narrow the definition of renewable fuels in the bill his move would prevent conoco and tyson from collecting the &# per gallon credit to make sure as he puts it that "green energy initiatives are not converted into public boondoggles " an earlier effort to restrict the tax credit in the senate failed mr doggett is strongly backed by a group of small refiners called the national biodiesel board which rely on the tax subsidy to make a different diesel additive called "biodiesel " out of animal fats and vegetable oils that are blended into diesel oil one consequence for consumers is that higher prices for soap are already on their way "if you monkey with the markets you never get quite the result you intended " says june a stahl president of stahl soap corp a small family owned business in east rutherford n j her company is trying to renegotiate its contracts to pass the higher costs for raw ingredients to its customers "in some cases we can and in some cases we cant but were trying to do everything we can to avoid going out of business " a stable market for animal fat has been part of the economic foundation for u s soap makers for more than years niek stapel general manager for akzo nobel inc a chicago maker of surfactants a chemical used in fabric softeners estimates the conoco tyson venture will use as much as of the available beef tallow which his company needs to make the chemical "if you have one or two more of these ventures the oil companies can gobble up the whole tallow supply in an afternoon " he says "that is a big problem for us " his company is a subsidiary of akzo nobel nv a dutch pharmaceutical and chemical giant joe jobe chief executive officer of the national biodiesel board a trade association of small refiners that use soybean oil and other fatty materials to make biodiesel says his members deserve the &# a gallon tax credit because they have built new refineries to make their products conoco on the other hand will run its new additive through an existing oil refinery he notes "we regard that as an oversubsidization " he says adding that a cents a gallon subsidy for the conoco tyson venture might be "ok " lou burke manager of conocos new biofuels program counters that a lowered credit would make it impossible to go ahead with the joint venture to produce the new "renewable" diesel which he asserts will result in lower pollution and is easier to transport than biodiesel "without the tax credit you would lose money on any volumes you produced " he explained while conoco critics have argued the company is responsible for roiling the traditionally tranquil beef tallow market mr burke notes that its venture wont start using fat until the last quarter of this year he blames the market gyrations on hedge funds that have been bidding up futures prices for soybean oil anticipating a boom in alternative diesel fuels the move he says has spurred a sympathetic rise in other fat related commodities one possible way out of this mess is for some soap companies to make their products out of petroleum for example mr stapel says some of akzos products can be derived from a petroleum feedstock which like most petroleum used in the u s would have to be imported "but that would defeat the whole purpose of having renewable products in the first place " he says
