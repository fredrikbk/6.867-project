public diplomacy for dummies late last month president bush gave an address at the islamic center in washington d c where he announced that the united states would for the first time appoint an observer to the organization of the islamic conference "our special envoy will listen to and learn from representatives from muslim states and will share with them americas views and values " he said "this is an opportunity for americans to demonstrate to muslim communities our interest in respectful dialogue and continued friendship " to say public diplomacy hasnt been this administrations forte is a truism and an understatement still its hard to recall any presidential initiative as spectacularly misjudged and needless since ronald reagan paid tribute to nazi soldiers at bitburg the oics signal contribution to date has been a decades long boycott by muslim countries against israel the islamic center is a saudi funded institution that as freedom house documented in distributes wahhabi religious literature charming tidbit "it is forbidden for a muslim to be the first in greeting an unbeliever even if he had prestigious position this is due to many established holy traditions in this matter like his prophet muhammad saying peace be upon him do not be first in greeting the jews and the christians " dutifully in attendance at the presidents speech was undersecretary of state for public diplomacy karen hughes critics of the administration usually point to mr bushs policies and his public persona as the source of americas declining stock in global public opinion surveys but public diplomacy is also the job of american embassies and ambassadors taxpayer funded broadcasting corporations such as voice of america military officials and especially ms hughes in theory their job is to wage a battle of ideas against radical islam in practice and effect however too often reality is otherwise take the case of career diplomat francis riccardione currently the u s ambassador to egypt in interviews with the egyptian media mr riccardione has said that american officials have "no right to comment" on the case of ayman nour the former opposition leader imprisoned on trumped up charges that faith in egypts judiciary is "well placed " and that president hosni mubarak now in his th year in office "is loved in the u s " and "could win elections in america as a leader who is a giant on the world stage " mr riccardione also admits he "enjoyed" a recent film by egyptian artist shaaban abdel rahim best known for his hit song "i hate israel " or take the voice of americas persian service according to a farsi speaking source who tracks the broadcasts during last years war between hezbollah and israel voa reporter nazi beglari opined that "hezbollah ended the israeli occupation in the past and is doing it again " camera shots lingered over toys scattered near bomb sites and a burnt page of the quran evidence presumably of israels intent to destroy islam and murder muslim children then there is ms hughes herself during one of her first overseas ventures as public diplomacy czarina ms hughes visited indonesia the worlds largest muslim country where she met its very own bono rock star ahmad dhani mr dhani had recently released his album "laskar cinta " or "warriors of love " a deliberate and political response to the terrorist atrocities perpetrated by laskar jihad ms hughes seemed enthralled by both the message and the messenger "hughes met dhani praised him to the skies and said people like you are exactly what we need " recalls c holland taylor an american who runs the libforall foundation with which mr dhani is associated "she then asked us whether he would be willing to work with the state department whether hed be willing to travel and whether there was anything she could do for him we answered all three questions affirmatively since then theres been a vast silence " libforall is itself a model of what a competent public diplomacy effort in the muslim world should look like mr taylor a former telecom executive who moved to jakarta in the s and speaks fluent indonesian has engaged influential and genuinely reform minded muslims as opposed to the faux "moderates" on whom mr bush lavished praise at the islamic center to articulate and defend a progressive and tolerant version of islam in its brief life libforall has helped turn back an attempted islamist takeover of the countrys second largest muslim social organization with million members translated anti wahhabist books into indonesian sponsored a recent multidenominational conference to denounce holocaust denial brought mr dhani to colorado to speak to u s military brass and launched a well researched "extremist expose" in order mr taylor says "to get indonesian society to consciously acknowledge that there is an infiltration occurring of radical ideology financed by arab petrodollars that is intent on destroying indonesian islam " for his efforts mr taylor has been cold shouldered by the u s embassy in jakarta more proof that when it comes to public diplomacy the u s government functions with its usual genius and efficiency but theres more at work here than a bumbling and insipid bureaucracy as the scholar carnes lord notes in his useful book on public diplomacy "losing hearts and minds " americas public diplomatists "are today no longer as convinced as they once were that americas story is after all fundamentally a good one or believe an alternative negative story is at least equally plausible " hence someone like mr riccardione can say when asked about discrimination in egypt where a coptic population amounting to about of the population has one member in the seat parliament that it "happens everywhere even in the u s " no doubt a dose of moral equivalence served mr riccardiones purposes in getting through his interview without a rhetorical scrape no doubt too maintaining or pretending a blissful ignorance about the ideology being propagated by the islamic center served mr bushs political purposes but if effective public diplomacy is really as vital in the war on terror as everyone appears to agree it is we need better ambassadors better administrators and a better sense of who we need to engage and how at least mr taylor has a clue the administration could stand to learn from him see related
