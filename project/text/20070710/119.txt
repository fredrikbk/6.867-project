why a billionaire lost on wall street the billionaire co founder of subway the fast food chain known for promoting the slimming effects of its sandwiches charged that the brokerage house of ubs ag slimmed down his bankroll by more than &# million because of a big bet on tech stocks after the stock market bubble burst but in a decision that recently became public a three person national association of securities dealers arbitration panel rejected fred delucas claims that ubs mismanaged trusts created for him which he argued resulted in big losses the trusts were heavily invested in technology and telecommunications stocks that fell to earth after soaring in value during the dot com stock bubble the case opens a rare window into arbitration claims by wealthy individuals against their brokers showing how difficult it can be for them to recover losses from wall street brokerages as is often the case with arbitration awards the panel didnt give reasons for its decision but rich people have a tough time winning claims because they tend to know a lot about how the stock market works and as a result dont get a lot of sympathy when they do cry foul and while the decisions in these cases are made public the tangled mesh of trusts that some wealthy people use to invest their money can make it hard to determine who filed the arbitration claim the decision also underscores how hard it has been for investors to recoup bubble era losses despite widespread allegations that wall street hyped stocks for its own benefit and sold clients unsuitable investments investors have had trouble prevailing as they are usually required to prove that they relied on wall streets advice or that the investments were unsuitable in the first place in mr delucas case people familiar with the proceeding said ubs argued that the investments were authorized and directed by the year old mr deluca and were consistent with his objective of aggressive growth "arbitrators place a difficult burden on wealthy smart people to establish that they relied on professional advisers " says atlanta attorney boyd page who represents individuals in such claims the stocks in the accounts according to the arbitration ruling included onetime telecom darlings mci worldcom inc lucent technologies inc and tellabs inc and tech stocks altera corp america online hewlett packard co and microsoft corp they also included two health care issues bristol myers squibb co and oxford health plans inc one of the largest dollar losses was incurred on a software stock pmc sierra inc which fell more than between and according to people familiar with the case a spokesman for ubs said the firm is "pleased with the outcome in this case " adding that "the panel agreed with ubs that the claims lacked merit and accordingly dismissed them in their entirety " not only did the deluca trusts fail to recover any of their losses they also were ordered to pay &# to reimburse ubs for document production costs mr delucas florida based broker joined painewebber group inc in the s and ubs acquired the firm in a spokesman for subways owner doctors associates inc of milford conn declined to comment saying the matter "has nothing to do with subway " mr deluca a resident of fort lauderdale fla has a net worth estimated by forbes magazine at &# billion fresh out of high school he co founded subway in with &# in start up money from a family friend today subway is the worlds largest sandwich chain with more than stores in countries a lawyer for the trusts that brought the action steven caruso said he believes the outcome shows it is difficult for wealthy investors to win big ticket damages in such cases out of claims for more than &# million that were decided on in he said more than were "dismissed in their entirety " mr caruso is president of the public investors arbitration bar association a group of lawyers who represent investors in such claims in a landmark case filed in the late canadian investor henryk de kwiatkowski the owner of famed horse breeder calumet farms sought to recover &# million from bear stearns cos for currency trading losses but a may jury award of &# million was overturned on appeal it is rare for these cases to end up in court since brokerage contracts that customers sign when they invest with a big firm generally require that investor gripes be handled via arbitration although the trusts whose five trustees filed the claims against ubs werent publicly identified as connected with mr deluca people familiar with the case said they were created for his benefit some trusts were set up offshore in lichtenstein the isle of man and guernsey the people said during days of hearings between january and april ubs lawyers argued that the claims covering the period hadnt been filed in time which can range from two years to four years under different state laws and that the losses were merely a reduction in huge paper profits from the stocks earlier run up in value in a civil lawsuit filed in connecticut civil court in former subway controller thomas w hislop said he managed some of mr delucas personal investments between and and that they soared in value to as much as &# million in his own filing in the same case mr deluca said mr hislop incurred losses by failing to heed mr delucas instructions to sell tech stocks in in an interview with the new haven register last year a lawyer for mr hislop said mr deluca signed a form in september directing mr hislop to "stay aggressive " asked for information about the case last week the same lawyer replied that he was on vacation
