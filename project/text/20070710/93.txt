anywhere else what captivated new yorkers more than anything was incredibly competitive baseball and this decade saw some of the best in the giants beat the dodgers for the national league pennant with bobby thomsons "shot heard round the world " in mid august the giants were a distant games behind the dodgers the giants went on a late season tear winning of their final games and forcing a three game playoff with the dodgers they split the first two games in game three the dodgers were leading going into the bottom of the ninth the giants scored a run and then thomson stepped to the plate to face dodgers relief pitcher ralph branca his three run homer gave the giants a victory the story was so big that it made the front page of the oct new york times of course we now know that
