truth in global warming this weeks prize for honest liberalism goes to michigans john dingell who is having fun with his fellow democrats while also making a useful point about the politics of global warming the venerable chairman of the house energy and commerce committee first elected in has announced that he plans to introduce as early as this week a new tax on carbon emissions now thats the way to clear a capitol hill hearing room americans are already miffed at paying &# a gallon for gasoline a fact that has the members assailing oil companies on a daily basis so the last thing democrats seeking re election want to do is pile on another dollar or two a gallon in taxes especially in the name of "saving the planet" from the speculative danger of global warming or years from now their voters have to deal with the more immediate danger of missing the mortgage payment mr dingell knows all this his point is to force his colleagues and the voters to be more honest about the cost of their global warming posturing its one thing to pay bucks to hear madonna at the "live earth" concert or impress your girlfriend by wearing an "i reduced my carbon footprint" t shirt its quite another to accept that energy prices would have to rise by many multiples to make even a degrees worth of difference to the worlds climate "i sincerely doubt that the american people will be willing to pay what this is really going to cost them " mr dingell said on c span last week thats why most politicians prefer policy artifice that disguises the cost of raising energy prices these policy tricks include higher automobile mileage standards and a "cap and trade" regime for swapping "credits" for carbon emissions these schemes shift the direct costs onto businesses which then pass them along indirectly to unwitting consumers these policies still amount to taxes on energy use but they allow politicians and green lobbyists to pretend that you can "save the world" for the price of a concert ticket they also impose more costs on some industries than others the most notable losers being u s auto companies and their workers around detroit mr dingell is sore and rightly so that the cost of indulging nancy pelosis well to do san francisco environmentalists on global warming would fall disproportionately on his blue collar constituents as it happens neither cap and trade nor higher fuel mileage standards would reduce emissions all that much if at all most of europe has been busting through its carbon limits under the kyoto protocol while the mileage mandates imposed in the u s in the s didnt stop americans from purchasing suvs and trucks the only thing that has slowed those sales is &# gasoline thus the policy logic of mr dingells tax proposal regarding such a tax democrats already have some hard political experience in vice president al gore convinced bill clinton to propose an energy tax on btu british thermal units usage that would have added about cents a gallon to the price of gas house democrats walked the plank and passed it only to have senate democrats kill it as much as anything else that vote cost democrats control of the house in now mr gore has embraced the carbon tax once again though we still havent heard him endorse a direct tax on gas or consumers speaking for ourselves we dont favor a carbon tax in theory such a tax might make sense if it were offset by lower taxes on income tax rates and capital investment which would be a net plus for economic growth however theres not a chance in melting greenland that the current congress would offset any new carbon taxes it would merely pocket the extra revenue to permanently increase the governments share of gdp if congressional democrats are really serious about global warming theyd nonetheless have the courage of their professed convictions take the dingell honesty test and vote to raise carbon taxes we suspect along with mr dingell however that keeping senate and house seats is going to trump saving the planet
