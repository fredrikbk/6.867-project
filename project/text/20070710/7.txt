a ceos personal touch revs up mitsubishi in u s tokyo when hiroshi harunari took over as chief executive of mitsubishi motors corp s struggling north american operation in january morale among dealers and employees was at an all time low the car maker as a whole had lost more than &# billion a year earlier and had been losing money in the u s for three consecutive years the unit had gone through three chiefs in four years and its partner daimler chrysler ag had sold its stake in mitsubishi in many predicted it was a matter of time before mitsubishi pulled out of the competitive north american market mr harunari embarked on a cross country pilgrimage to win back dealers trust in the first two months on the job the earnest japanese executive visited mitsubishi dealerships in states he didnt propose any sweeping changes but focused on listening to dealers long lists of grievances and assured them that mitsubishi was committed to the u s market he then took steps to address such basic problems as slow delivery of parts from suppliers "i knew the situation was bad " says mr harunari years old formerly the head of overseas operations based in tokyo he also had an additional challenge because the dealers he had to woo arent employees but independent small business owners who need to make a profit to stay in business "i had to show i was ready to pick up the chestnut " he says citing an old japanese proverb that says you should try to pick up a chestnut out of a burning flame in other words embrace a big challenge so far mr harunaris personal touch seems to be working in a surprise turnaround japans no car maker by sales volume swung back to a full year operating profit of &# million in north america in the fiscal year ended march sales in the u s in that period led by the new lancer sedan and outlander sports utility vehicle reached vehicles an increase from the previous year reversing a four year drop sales per dealer increased by as much as compared with a year earlier indicating that dealers were encouraged to order more cars from mitsubishi don herring sr owner of three mitsubishi dealerships in dallas had doubts about mitsubishis future before mr harunari dropped by on at least three occasions and "just asked us what we thought " he says mr herring says the personal visits indicated the company was sincere about trying to make a comeback he recently remodeled one of his five acre lots and converted a square foot former circuit city store into another giant mitsubishi showroom while case studies abound of charismatic chief executives announcing ambitious goals to jump start a company mr harunari has invigorated mitsubishi in the u s by focusing on good old fashioned bonding with people in the trenches this "inverted pyramid" style of management is a growing trend in corporations says paul rogers the london based head of the global organization practice for u s consulting firm bain &amp co top executives are realizing that getting to know the frontline can build employee loyalty and "loyal customers are driven by loyal employees " mr rogers says mitsubishis turnaround poses an added threat to other asian rivals such as japans nissan motor co which saw its sales drop last year in the key u s market it also adds more competition to detroits big three which have been reporting heavy losses mitsubishis challenge isnt over yet even with stronger sales the company holds less than of the u s market share and at a time when the overall demand for cars in the u s is showing signs of slowing competition is heating up both from higher end models by toyota motor corp and honda motor co and from lower priced cars by hyundai motor co whats more mitsubishis results were helped in the latest fiscal year by the weak yen which increases the value of overseas earnings when converted into japanese currency the company forecasts that the yen will be much stronger this year causing a slight drop in operating profit in north america in the year ending march despite a rise in sales volume analysts have said however that the yen has been much weaker so far than the companys estimates unlike many top executives in japanese car companies mr harunari who likes to read german science fiction novels in his spare time didnt spend his whole career at mitsubishi motors he worked for over years at trading house mitsubishi corp another company that is part of the umbrella mitsubishi group the trading house was among several companies in the group that rushed to &# billion bailout of the car company after daimlerchrysler sold its remaining shares in mitsubishi mitsubishi motors equipped mr harunari with a sweeping revitalization plan after racking up bad consumer loans by targeting young drivers with poor credit records the company switched to older more financially secure drivers with new models like the lancer mitsubishi also tied up with merrill lynch &amp co in the u s to fund its loans to car buyers rather than finance its own loans but mr harunari felt his biggest task was to win back the disgruntled dealers who felt alienated by the string of management changes and persistent rumors that mitsubishi was pulling out of the u s while he had never lived in the u s he made a point of driving himself to many of the dealerships on a recent trip to texas he flew to dallas then drove a borrowed outlander to visit dealers in san antonio austin and waco "visiting a dealers place of business is like visiting their home " says mr harunari it shows "we appreciate them " to underscore mitsubishis intention to remain in the u s market mitsubishi launched in april last year a th anniversary advertising campaign "its been years since we made our first mark in america the next years begins today " said the ads which ran in print and on television to show dealers his responsiveness mr harunari launched a "dealer co op" program that gives individual dealers financial assistance with local marketing efforts such as sponsoring local charity events or running ads in a community newspaper mike graeber owner of a mitsubishi dealership in san bernardino calif says the co op program was something nationwide dealers had been pushing for but that no one else had responded to "we finally feel like our voices and concerns are going to senior management " mr graeber says back in his office in cypress calif mr harunari gets to work at a m to respond to emails from employees and dealers before a m often about new problems cropping up "frustration can build up like a volcano " he says "my job is to settle it before it explodes " mr harunari says that for now he is keeping his goals modest he would like the company to capture to of the u s market share this year up from about in "if i said were going to sell like toyota everyone would laugh " mr harunari says "were just aiming for satisfied customers "
