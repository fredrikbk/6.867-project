are privately run public schools worth the effort and money we take serious issue with your statement in a june editorial "success in philadelphia" that a study by paul peterson of harvard "exposed several methodological flaws" in a study the rand corp conducted of academic improvement among students attending philadelphia public schools managed by private operators in fact the study by rand and research for action which underwent rigorous external review by experts in statistical methods was methodologically sound and we stand behind it like the peterson study our work concluded that the philadelphia schools have shown strong improvement our study went on to show that academic improvement among students attending philadelphia public schools managed by private operators kept pace but did not exceed the achievement gains of students in the rest of the district in the past four years private managers given extra funds to run elementary and middle schools did not achieve additional gains exceeding district wide trends prof petersons analysis looked at fifth and eighth grades only and he examined of privately managed schools and eight of restructured schools our analysis includes all of the privately managed schools all of the restructured schools and students in the second through eighth grades in philadelphia it is not surprising that prof petersons examination limited to less than half of the relevant schools and a subset of the relevant grades would produce different results than our more thorough examination average results are better assessed by including all the schools rather than only some of them in addition our study compared students as a whole and also compared children of similar backgrounds with one another jolley bruce christman research for action susan j bodilly director rand education arlington va you overlook the fact that there have been five separate studies on philadelphias "experiment" with privatization and education management organizations emos four independent studies agree that emos despite having received more than &# million in management fees over five years have failed to significantly outperform district managed schools the only study that was a cheerleader for the emos was the peterson study you cited which incidentally was partially underwritten by edison schools inc the largest emo operator in philadelphia furthermore while test scores improved over a four year period they plateaued last year the rand report also noted that for the lowest quartile of students overall gains in the school district were comparable to achievement gains in the lowest quartile of the state the stats on philadelphia are not unique in fact they have been replicated across the country for more than a decade in school districts which have "experimented" with privatization district after district has found that the money for emos doesnt warrant the largely average to poor results what works is when districts invest in quality instruction and staff support not by hiring out some manager to run the business of education in philadelphia as we face bankruptcy and declining classroom investment emos like edison schools inc remain a dividing line between people genuinely concerned with concrete improvement in our schools and those who trumpet "reform" without results helen gym philadelphia the author is a philadelphia public school parent and a member of the advisory board of the philadelphia public school notebook a philadelphia based education newspaper
