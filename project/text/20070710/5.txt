alternate fuel hunt gives plant biologist a lift stephen long has spent his career studying grass in particular a sugarcane like grass called miscanthus x giganteus but until this year the university of illinois biologist had difficulty getting research grants and could count on one hand the invitations he received annually to make presentations at academic conferences then in february mr long was one of two plant biologists invited to the white house to brief president bush on how plants like miscanthus might begin replacing foreign oil that same month energy giant bp plc announced a &# million grant to the university of california at berkeley the university of illinois at urbana champaign and lawrence berkeley national laboratory to develop fuels made from plant materials mr long was named acting deputy director of the project called the energy biosciences institute now mr long says he gets more academic conference invitations than he could possibly accept more than a year some from as far away as australia and japan hes also inundated with calls and emails from prospective students interested in studying plants "when i tell people what i do they dont think im crazy " adds the year old spurred by high oil prices and concern over greenhouse gases the push for alternative fuels like plant based cellulosic ethanol is putting plant biologists at the forefront of energy exploration unlike corn based ethanol which is made from fermented sugars cellulosic ethanol is made by breaking down cellulose the fibrous carbon based molecules that give plants structure plant biologists are crucial to identifying and engineering a high yield drought resistant plant and an efficient cost effective method of breaking down plant cellulose into biofuels cellulosic ethanol can be made from such plant materials as rice straw wood chips switchgrass poplar trees and miscanthus the problem is that energy companies like bp chevron corp and conocophillips traditionally populated by geologists and petroleum engineers largely lack the scientific skills to create a biofuel as a result the companies are now pouring money into universities hoping to tap the ivory tower for plant biologists as well as for chemical engineers molecular biologists agronomists and geneticists in april conocophillips established a &# million biofuels research program at iowa state university chevron has given more than &# million to such schools as the university of california davis and texas a&amp m for biofuels research in the past few years "the whole intersection of biology and energy is unexplored territory " says steven koonin chief scientist at london based bp "universities are the best places for that research " while bp has fewer than four biological scientists on its staff of mr koonin says he expects to hire around in the next two years big energy companies arent the only ones recruiting plant biologists biotechnology companies like mendel biotechnology inc in hayward calif and ceres inc in thousand oaks calif are also working to commercialize plant breeds seeds and enzymes for breaking down plant cellulose and they are hiring so too is the government in february the department of energy committed &# million over four years to building six cellulosic ethanol refineries last month the department announced an additional &# million investment in three new bioenergy research centers to develop biofuels all of this is a turnaround for plant biologists who havent been in the spotlight since the green revolution in the s and s when newly engineered high yielding varieties of corn rice and wheat transformed agriculture in developing countries "things had been dragging along slowly for years and suddenly now theres a huge amount of interest " says david bransby a professor at auburn university in auburn ala who specializes in switchgrass mr bransby says his colleagues once looked down their noses at his switchgrass experiments most students never showed any interest in the plant either which he understood as there were no jobs in the field these days however he gets more than emails a day from everyone from kids researching science fair projects to other professors he has met with president bush twice in the last year to talk about cellulosic fuel and private consulting now augments his academic income he says he recently set up a meeting between a texas based biotech firm and a silicon valley venture capital firm that invests in biotech companies working on cellulosic fuels at universities student enrollment in plant biology is rising and the programs are expanding particularly at schools with new energy industry grants the university of illinois had more than applications for five graduate student research positions in biofuels this year up from fewer than three applicants last year uc davis is in the process of getting nine new biofuel research projects up and running on campus and it is looking to hire at least three new faculty members to work on biofuels chris somerville a stanford university plant biology professor says he fields queries every day from students wanting to get involved in biofuels stanford university graduate student charlie anderson is one such student for years mr anderson studied animal cell biology specifically the structure of mouse skin cells but in february the year old decided to change his focus to biofuels and he hopes to pursue postdoctoral work on cellulose fiber in plant cell walls "if a company like bp is willing to give &# million to a university for biofuels research its not just a flash in the pan " mr anderson says indeed recruiting plant biologists and investing in biofuels is a long term endeavor few realistically expect cellulosic biofuel to be produced commercially or affordably for at least five years partly because of the complexity of determining how best to convert plant cellulose into fuel bps mr koonin says hes hoping for some "quick wins" from the &# million his company gave to the energy biosciences institute but he acknowledges that scalable production could take as long as years ten years is a drop in the bucket for mr long who has studied plants since he was a teenager in his native england four decades ago in college at reading university in the early s mr long specialized in agricultural botany he began researching miscanthus in after he saw the plant growing in gardens across england mr long particularly homed in on miscanthus x giganteus the plant is a hybrid of two grass species making it "strong and sterile like crossing a donkey and a horse to make a mule " he says the grass which grows up to feet high and is native to asia produces more living matter per acre than switchgrass mr long who says hes getting a raise in his annual salary because of bps &# million grant helped make this hardy perennial grass a front runner species in the race toward cellulosic fuel because his research hasnt always been in vogue mr long says he discouraged an undergraduate student when she approached him in wanting to pursue ph d research on miscanthus "i told her there wouldnt be any jobs " he says but by the time she graduated in she had two job offers from biotech companies and one from a university "was i ever wrong " he says
