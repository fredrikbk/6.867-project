casting a ballot with a certain cast of mind the myth of the rational voter by bryan caplan princeton university press pages &# william f buckley jr once said that he would rather be governed by the first names in the boston phone directory than by the entire faculty of harvard university bryan caplan must think that mr buckley is a boob "the myth of the rational voter" brazenly argues in essence that the american public is made up of morons whose misjudgments about economic policy will have parlous effects on the state of the nation and its future prosperity at a time when "american idol" draws more voters than most local elections or when larry kings questions seem dumber than paris hiltons answers one is reluctant to dismiss mr caplan as just another ivory tower elitist at the very least he relies on a proven formula like a few recent best sellers "freakonomics " "the tipping point " "the wisdom of crowds" "the myth of the rational voter" unwraps economic theories and applies them to everyday life mr caplans thesis though lacks any semblance of a compliment the "unwisdom of crowds" is closer to his point he believes that the american public is biased against sensible empirically proved economic policies about which nearly all economists agree voters he says are not just ignorant in the sense of having insufficient information they actually hold wrong headed and damaging beliefs about how the economy works the know nothing voter is hardly a new character he is a staple of h l mencken and sinclair lewis he is also a central player in the modern public choice theory economists such as anthony downs and gordon tullock have argued that because one particular vote is unlikely to sway an election there is little incentive for any individual to invest his time in learning about the issues under discussion during a campaign fortunately they say because voting is scattered and random such "rational ignorance" is harmless this view has become a shibboleth of most economic and political science departments mr caplan thinks the rational ignorance theorists are not only wrong but in deep denial about the deficiencies of democracy citing reams of survey data he shows that unschooled voters have consistent opinions about free trade they dont like it foreigners they dont like them wage and price controls helpful and the economic condition of the world things are getting worse the majority of economists according to mr caplan maintain that these opinions have no factual foundation they are simply a form of bias or ideology if mr caplan is right many popular nostrums about the majesty of american democracy need to be thrown out the window "trust the people " for instance ends up as a disastrous mandate for tariffs government interference and declining prosperity democracy in mr caplans view is not merely the least bad choice it is a flawed system that delivers socially suboptimal results to its deluded citizens as an analysis of how far voters are out of step with settled economic thinking mr caplans argument seems irrefutable yet as a work of political theory it is pretty dismal survey data do indeed show that americans hold some irrational views but nowhere in "the myth of the rational voter" does mr caplan demonstrate that dumb voter bias triggers bad public policy take free trade mr caplan reports that support for free trade hit bottom in when only of americans favored eliminating tariffs yet three years later ronald reagan campaigned on a platform of free trade and proceeded to sign historic free trade agreements with canada and laid the groundwork for free trade with mexico later administrations have fought to grant china most favored nation trading status true there has been a lot of populist noise against free trade but for decades not a single presidential nominee from either party has run for office while waving the protectionist flag mr caplan also claims that voters revile a corporation that downsizes at home and sends jobs abroad a business decision that most economists view as socially productive yet to the chagrin of lou dobbs cnns ultra populist there has been no serious proposal to stop such downsizing or to punish the companies who outsource their labor voter bias has fueled some foolish national debate in recent years but imposed very little foolish national policy the deeper problem with mr caplans thesis however is its lack of any reference to the special character of american democracy for him democracy fails because it doesnt produce the most economically efficient results he would prefer to see independent experts shape policy or to put more power into the hands of the unelected solons on the supreme court such a strategy might be more efficient but then again american democracy has never been about efficiency hamilton and madison conspicuously absent in "the myth of the rational voter" consciously set out to create an inefficient system that let one faction counter the other and factions are naturally and rightly driven by a complex mix of interests and passions not just the syllogisms of an economics textbook tocqueville mentioned only in passing observed that one of the strengths of american democracy was its citizens greater interest in community and local associations than in national governance the founders cared about letting everyone put in his two cents even if it meant for messier politics that sort of democracy disappoints mr caplan because it doesnt rise to the standards of ludwig von mises or other libertarian thinkers economists may well agree with his thesis in part because it makes them feel better about themselves but it should not make ordinary americans feel any worse about their democracy mr casse is
