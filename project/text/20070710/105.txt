the morning brief executive privilege battle could take widespread toll online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here in the escalating battle between congress and the white house over the firing of u s prosecutors and the use of executive privilege all parties have much to lose except perhaps president bush himself mr bush yesterday invoked executive privilege for the second time in two weeks directing two former aides ex white house counsel harriet miers and former political director sara taylor to defy congressional subpoenas to testify as part of an investigation into the firings of u s attorneys as the associated press reports the move prods lawmakers toward their first contempt citations against administration officials since ronald reagan was president the ap writes it also places the two aides in the "awkward position" of choosing between defying the president and risking criminal contempt citations by congress the washington post notes in the past such standoffs have been resolved before the full house or senate has voted on referring a congressional contempt citation to a u s attorney but a weeklong holiday for the fourth of july didnt help cool tempers the ap notes the undiminished tension reflects a tougher stance by the administration in recent weeks toward multiple probes in congress which the white house is striving to portray as "more concerned with investigating than law making " the wall street journal writes as splits within the democratic party have hampered it from passing major legislation congresss approval ratings have fallen to their lowest point since the party seized control of capitol hill and even lower than mr bushs ratings the journal notes a prolonged fight could have a "clear political price" for the party while a referral to court could allow mr bush to ride out the issue until the end of his term the paper says the white house has backed down on the issue of executive privilege before the new york times points out and administration officials may bear in mind congresss recent success with subpoenas in light of the possibility that executive privilege will surface again in other investigations the journal writes for example democratic rep john conyers yesterday asked mr bush to waive privilege claims and let white house aides testify about the decision to allow i lewis "scooter" libby to avoid going to prison in the cia leak case the washington post reports however peter shane an expert on executive privilege at ohio state law school tells the los angeles times "given that no one in the white house is seeking re election it is unclear whether they will compromise short of receiving some extraordinary pressure from congressional republicans who may be more concerned than the president" with the appearance of having something to hide for congress to press ahead it would need a majority vote of the judiciary committee issuing the subpoena plus the full house or senate the l a times reports and the matter then would be referred to the u s attorney for the district of columbia but "the current situation seems murkier " the l a times writes because it isnt clear exactly who congress would want to hold in contempt and as the ap notes the u s attorney who would decide whether to prosecute is a bush appointee a surplus surplus in china chinas trade surplus surged to another record high in june "surprising even the most bullish observers and signaling the countrys economic growth in the second quarter likely stayed as red hot as in the first quarter " dow jones newswires reports surging exports pushed the surplus to &# billion bringing it to &# billion for the first half of the agency says more than half of the surplus was with the u s bloomberg reports citing goldman sachs economist liang hong as saying the size of the surplus is "unprecedented for china or any other major economy in the world " the increased surplus can partly be attributed to merchants seeking to fill orders before july when value added tax rebates on a swathe of products were either reduced or scrapped reuters reports still reuters says the latest figures support a longer term trend that could lead to increased pressure particularly from washington by critics who say beijing keeps its currency undervalued giving its exporters an unfair advantage in global markets and the liquidity caused by trade inflows will continue to counter beijings efforts
