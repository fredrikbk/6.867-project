pricing power in a tech backwater a profit fortress rises maker of arcane chips earns better margins than google microsoft milpitas calif erik soule had been waiting months for this moment the semiconductor engineer was about to launch a new chip and he needed his pricing approved in a conference room at linear technology corp mr soule anxiously explained why his amplifier chip is so advanced that it should sell for &# a third more than its rivals his bosses reaction charge even more the chip is times better than the competition they asserted and high end customers will crave it on any terms why not boost the &# list price by cents mr soule was nervous "i can live with that " he guardedly replied "but what does that accomplish " "its a dime " declared linears chairman and founder robert swanson "and those dimes add up " for many u s companies such exuberant pricing power vanished long ago they now struggle to deliver more at lower prices amid intense global competition but linear has built one of the worlds strongest profit fortresses by staying strictly at the fringes where competition is low and margins are still high away from the semiconductor industrys frenzied center stage this midsize company makes arcane unglamorous products that solve real world problems for a long list of customers instead of the better known digital chips that power the brains of the worlds computers and bring in of the industrys revenue linear makes so called analog chips that are too cheap for customers to haggle over but perform chores too important to ignore pick apart a medical ultrasound machine a hybrid car battery or thousands of other costly devices and somewhere inside is a linear chip that helps monitor power consumption or guard against voltage surges its a backwater of high tech well suited to linears engineer driven culture where quirky developers shop for old part testers at flea markets to keep costs down many of linears chips cost less than cents to build and sell for three to four times as much but customers seldom complain about the markup linear made a profit on its &# billion in sales in calendar more than five times the average for u s industrial companies linear easily outpaced even the tech industrys best known profit powerhouses microsoft corp and google inc which earned profits of and of sales for the same period now some bigger chip makers want to muscle in and linear may find it harder to keep squeezing huge margins from its offbeat specialties a big stock buyback has shored up linears share price this year but its sales growth has ebbed amid a general slowdown in microchips dallas based texas instruments inc more than times linears size says analog chips now account for of its chip sales and its analog operation is growing faster than the rest of ti other rivals such as richtek technology corp of taiwan and freescale semiconductor inc of austin texas are targeting linears specialty of power management more big chip makers may follow says suzie inouye research director of databeans inc a reno nev market research firm "they can all see how profitable power management has been " she says linears mr swanson asserts that his companys sprawling product line without a single blockbuster makes it a tough target for competitors in the digital chip world a single winning design bought by a few big customers such as intel corp s pentium can yield huge profits at its peak but that market is fraught with huge capital costs rapid obsolescence and brutal competition linear has customers none of which represents more than of its sales "we built this business one brick at a time " the company chairman says "anyone who wants to take us on will have to do it one brick at a time too " in fact mr swanson says he gets nervous if one chip starts selling too well that invites competition it also means customers may peer harder at costs linear learned that the hard way in the early s when ford motor co was its biggest customer what started out as a lucrative contract selling transmission system chips turned into a quagmire as ford kept pressing for discounts "we got out of that business and for years afterward we refused to do anything with automotive " mr swanson says linear would rather see its order book packed with small to midsize orders from companies too busy to bargain over prices "shaving the last penny or two off our price quote just isnt a priority for them " says lothar maier linears chief executive agilent technologies inc fits that bill the santa clara calif instrument company uses a smattering of linear chips to keep power systems running smoothly inside oscilloscopes that measure electrical signals and sell for &# or more "power management is something wed really like not to worry about " says mike boyers an oscilloscope product planner at agilent "wed much rather concentrate on our own technological contributions " agilents purchasing managers have noted linears fat profit margins as a negotiating point in seeking discounts but their leverage is limited about of agilents purchasing priorities are based on nonprice factors such as quality and reliability linear gets high marks in those areas says mr boyers for the past few years it has been an agilent preferred supplier in other cases customers pay linears markups in the hope of gaining a competitive edge in everett wash intermec inc makes mobile data scanners including hand held units that weigh as little as ounces and can operate for a full eight hour work shift without being recharged its devices cost as much as &# apiece they are used in warehouses by boeing co and others intermec uses linear chips to coax extra life from its devices batteries their total cost is less than of the materials budget "linear is a relatively small part of our spending but its a vital piece " says intermec marketing director dan bodnar performance is crucial in his world price isnt "if our product doesnt last as long as customers expect " he explains "it doesnt matter what it costs " traditionally the dozen or so major analog chip companies have tiptoed around one anothers product lines helping keep profit margins high linear ti and national semiconductor corp have carved up various areas of power management with overall market shares of to apiece analog devices inc has focused on analog to digital converters such as the chips inside nintendo corp s wii game machine other companies have focused on buffers sensors or filters each company established its strength decades ago making it easy to extend existing product families and deepen relations with longtime customers "we chip away a little at each others specialties " says jerald fishman chief executive of analog devices "but there isnt a lot of direct competition " linear was formed in by mr swanson chief technical officer robert dobkin and three other engineers most of whom broke away from national semiconductor because they felt it was too bureaucratic and wasnt making the most of its analog opportunities at the time right away linear created a corporate structure that showcased individual chip designers instead of being roped together in big teams designers took solo command of a new chip they brainstormed with potential customers they sketched circuits and they even participated in advertising meetings successful designs were posted on the walls as art designers cherished the autonomy and recognition top executives found that designers worked faster and smarter when they felt in command of everything linear avoided putting so many people onto a &# million project that it would risk delays or runaway costs linear became a magnet for gung ho engineers who had been messing around with circuits since they were children often the slyest rascals turned out to be the cleverest designers as a year old in the s steve pietkiewicz stored electrical charges in capacitors then tormented his little sister by leaving them on the kitchen table to shock her when she touched them at linear a few years ago mr pietkiewicz designed some of the first chips that let cellphone batteries create enough juice to trigger a camera flash robert reay who joined linear in won acclaim for creating "hot swap" chips that made it easy and safe to switch circuit boards while a computer was running he had more than a casual interest in the problem as a teenager he had ruined his fathers apple ii computer by trying to yank out boards in an effort to install a speech synthesizer at a recent job fair at the university of california los angeles linear engineer atsushi kawamoto jostled for attention with recruiters from walt disney co and a big mutual fund complex "they had frisbees and stuffed animals to give away " mr kawamoto recalls "all i had was the accuracy translator" a thin strip of gray plastic that helps engineers convert decibels to powers of two among other things most visitors scoffed at the linear booth as too geeky but one student was enchanted "he kept saying i didnt know that companies like you existed " mr kawamoto recalls "thats the kind of person we like to hire " linears quirks include a resolutely low tech approach to its high tech mission mr swanson refused to put in an email system for much of the s telling people to wander down the hall and talk to colleagues instead he only reluctantly accepted voicemail and rejects modern "customer relationship" software to manage the business instead sales updates are distributed on old style green and white striped printouts with rows of holes on each side meanwhile linears bosses have pinched pennies as if the company were teetering on the edge of insolvency mr swanson uses a scuffed desk chair from the early s and tells subordinates that they can live with worn furniture too "they call me the neanderthal man " mr swanson says "but im right " mr dobkin the chief technical officer wont spend much for test equipment instead he encourages chip designers to scour flea markets for used voltmeters oscilloscopes and the like to test the electrical performance of their chip designs aging models that cost &# or less are ideal mr dobkin says and if repairs are needed engineers can learn by fixing the machines instead of rebelling linears engineers have turned their lab into a haven for vintage electronics gear "theres some beautiful design from the s " explains jim williams a linear engineer who has surrounded himself with tools from the era such eccentricities sometimes help linear make money mr williams says in the early s when he was trying to improve battery life and screen lighting for laptop computers without electrical distortion mr williams says he patterned part of his approach after the design of a oscilloscope his laptop project helped linear become a major supplier for apple inc s computers hoping for another deja vu moment mr williams spends many saturdays prowling through silicon valley junk shops looking for interesting electronic parts he was delighted one recent afternoon to snap up a used electricity meter like those bolted to millions of homes for &# "this is a huge market " he told a companion "im going to take it apart perhaps theres something we can do to help improve it " linears thrifty ways carry over to its factories digital chip makers such as intel spend as much as &# billion to outfit a plant that may last only a few years before new technology makes it obsolete not so in the analog world chip designs from the s still attract customers and ancient chip making tools still suffice for some functions in linears newest factory built in modern chip etching machines jostle for space with some old workhorses made by companies that went bust years ago "weve got great mechanics " explains robert barber linears director of process engineering who says the old equipment hasnt become obsolete "if our guys took care of your car you could still be driving a mustang "
