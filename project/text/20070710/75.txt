omg my boss wants to friend me on my online profile paul dyer was always able to hold off his bosss invitations to party by employing that arms length response "well have to do that sometime " hed say but when his boss in his s invited mr dyer years old to be friends on the social networking sites myspace and facebook dodging wasnt so easy on the one hand accepting a persons request to be friends online grants them access to the kind of intimacy never meant for office consumption such as recent photos of keggers and jibes from friends "still wearing that lampshade " but declining a "friend" request from a colleague or a boss is a slight so mr dyer accepted the invitation then removed any inappropriate or incriminating photos of himself "id rather speak vaguely about them " he says and accepted the bosss invitation mr dyer it turns out wasnt the one who had to be embarrassed his boss had photos of himself attempting to imbibe two drinks at once ostensibly mr dyer ventures to send the message "im a crazy young party guy " the boss also wore a denim suit "id never seen anything like it " mr dyer says and posed in a photo flashing a hip hop backhand peace sign it was painful to watch "i hurt for him " says mr dyer like email and "buddy lists" before them social networking sites such as facebook and myspace provide a definition of the word "friend" so expansive that it includes perfect strangers yet strangers are the easy part it can be a lot creepier to interact intimately with someone you sort of know than someone you dont know at all "nothing changes when a stranger invites you to be a friend " says nina singh a market research consultant but when one of her clients "friended" her she saw a semierotic photo of him topless posed and softly lit "when you see your clients pubic bone something has changed " victor sanchez a senior development director was once invited to join a site and was surprised to see a photograph of a younger colleagues seahorse tattoo "sometimes its good to learn things about a colleague much later or never at all " he says these networking sites assist existing social relationships letting people easily plan events share pictures and keep up to date with far flung friends once they penetrate the office however such sites can create awkward moments particularly with colleagues who commit the social felony of attempted hipness dare i say "whatup homey " when it comes to the boss there is a real dilemma youre caught between a career limiting rejection of virtual friendship or a career limiting access to photos of yourself glassy eyed at a party "all these social relationships apples and oranges are getting crammed into one category of friends " says tom boellstorff associate professor of anthropology at the university of california irvine who is writing a book on the virtual community second life after one senior marketing coordinator at a law firm was invited by one of the lawyers to be his friend she felt compelled to accept the invitation even though she had no intention of socializing with him outside the office he remarked once after an office meeting that he noticed she had a boyfriend as listed on her online profile "it was strange " she says "i was like why are you on facebook " once "friended" by a colleague people feel compelled to employ privacy features which itself can be a snub or to sanitize their online profiles which is akin to hiding something under the bed the same marketing coordinator removed college pictures of herself doing a keg stand a handstand on top of a beer keg for a direct mouth to tap connection prospective employers also seem to have no compunction conducting searches on job applicants before they call them in for interviews "well google them and i know that weve done myspace searches " says attorney caroline kert of prospective hires shes mostly looking for slams against a former employer or exposed proprietary information she says shed never hold against applicants something like say a photo of them wearing a fur bikini good thing ms kert a regular at the burning man festival has pictures of herself sporting just that on myspace j d lloyd a law student working at a firm isnt taking any chances at foot and pounds he removed a photo of himself in a florida marlins baseball jersey that was a mere "youth large " "it was tight " he says "there may or may not have been midriff in some of those pictures " it used to be that employees were told to keep their personal lives out of work now some bosses beg for it data analyst valerie jewett accepted a boss as a friend even though she likes to keep her personal and professional lives separate hes a nice guy she says but his late s ungrooviness was evident when he wrote a message to her on the "wall" on her homepage the message made her roll her eyes "what a ko wink i dink to find yall on here yeehaw " email me at jared sandberg wsj com for a discussion on todays column go to wsj
