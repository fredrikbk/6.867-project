the daily fix federer outlasts perilous nadal in five set wimbledon thriller online edition a winner take all fifth set in a grand slam final match is the ultimate in tennis excitement and in the otherwise remarkable reign of roger federer over the sport fifth sets on a majors final sunday have been too rare federer has played in of the last grand slam finals all of the last nine and won times yet until sunday he had never been extended to a fifth set in his victories hed yielded just five sets fans had waited more than three years for a five set final at the one major that has eluded federer the french open but yesterday all that changed and more federers rival rafael nadal four years his junior and getting better with each major pushed the world no to a fifth set shaking off a poor fourth set and four break points against him early in the fifth set federer summoned his best tennis to sweep the final four games of the match "playing what might be the finest tennis of his life and from absolutely nowhere he ripped nadals service apart " simon barnes writes in the times of london "a running forehand pass an outlandish flip to the corner and then a miraculous rally all of a sudden federer was home and the history boy was saluting bjoern borg knowing that five wimbledon championships in a row put him unequivocally in the category of the all time great nadal did his best to spoil it for that is his job but it was federers day just as it has been federers half decade the battle for world domination with nadal will continue and good for this is a rivalry that brings the best from both " the best from mr nadal keeps getting better and if he starts winning majors outside of paris the fix will consider dropping the "mr " before his name as is traditional here for all time greats such as federer "in last years final nadal pushed federer hard " steve bierley writes in the guardian "this time he was within a couple of shots in the fifth and final set of becoming only the second spaniard to win the wimbledon title and surely one day he will there is something elemental about nadal although this should not disguise his huge ability to produce the most fantastic shots there were times when federer looked back across centre court thankfully bathed in sunlight for the final and shook his head the rivalry between them is intense the respect enormous " in the end federers superior serve was the difference "it is not the worlds biggest but one of the most imaginative being phenomenally accurate and deep " mr bierley writes adds barry flatman in the times of london "increasingly it is harder to find a dividing line between the brilliance of these two marvellously gifted players but so long as federer serves like this he will have an advantage on the faster surfaces " federers feat of winning five straight wimbledon titles matched that of bjorn borg who also has temporary company on the chart of career majors federer seems likely to soon pass borgs total of but to san francisco chronicle columnist bruce jenkins federers closest stylistic forbearer is seven time wimbledon champ pete sampras who won major titles overall "serving now with that lead federer won at love with three punishing aces " mr jenkins writes of yesterdays fifth set "that was strictly sampras rendering an opponent statue like except for the trudge from one receiving position to the next and like sampras federer didnt fool around at the key wimbledon moments are always about service breaks and this one forged on an overhead smash behind a murderous cross court forehand ended the match with a flourish " not surprisingly sampras is a federer fan "i dont see anyone really threatening him seriously so you know i am pulling for him " sampras said recently on a conference call "i always pull for the favorite " that tidbit is one of collected at the tournament by si coms jon wertheim another fix favorite "man these british spectators are clumsy a player hits an overhead or a mishit into the stands and without fail three fans got konked in the head before the ball comes to rest seriously watch for this next year " before wimbledon serena williams garnered most of the attention accorded to her tennis minded family thanks to her australian open victory but the south florida sun sentinels charles bricker says that on a practice court before the tournament began "despite what the oddsmakers had portended for the coming fortnight there was no question who was striking the ball better both sisters knew at the onset of this wimbledon it was venus who was playing better " and it was venus williams the seed who won her fourth wimbledon title on saturday beating frenchwoman marion bartoli in straight sets between them the two surprise finalists had ousted five of the top six seeds at the tournament in often exciting action yet the final was rather tepid with ms bartoli starting to challenge the hard serving ms williams in the second set only to see it all end in two sets tennis writer neil harman says that now that womens prize money equals the mens its time for the women to play best of five finals "the womens drive for equal prize money and professional recognition has been determined and painstaking " mr harman writes in the times of london "how could they not in the circumstances embrace the concept of a five set final in the grand slam championships to help to silence those who remain fundamentally opposed to the principle " as the women fought for equal pay the tournament overlooked the th anniversary of althea gibsons historic title making the american the first black player to triumph at wimbledon espn coms jemele hill argues that ms gibsons feat was in its way as remarkable and important as jackie robinsons breaking the color barrier in baseball and theyre off the tour de france began on saturday in london without seven time champ lance armstrong and without winner floyd landis and champ jan ullrich both plagued by drug charges why london as a way to recognize and support cyclings burgeoning popularity with britons "it is the must see event of the year with the wonderful bonus of requiring no effort or expense in terms of securing admission " richard williams writes in the guardian "there are no booking fees or ticket touts at the tour de france which is one of its glories " race officials estimated that millions of spectators took that incomparable deal and lined up to watch sunday among them was one who stood too far out in the road and brought down cyclist mark cavendishs tour when it had just barely begun mr cavendish is mostly gracious toward the rest of the spectators but ends his sorrowful piece in the guardian with this "someone out there has got a pair of limited edition oakley sunglasses that i dropped on the road when i fell so if anyone sees a guy with a set of white oakleys with a pink o logo just tell them never to go and watch another bike

video highlights in detroit tigers centerfielder curtis granderson leapt at the wall to snare what looked like a sure home run off the bat of bostons wily mo pena "granderson just had to sprint to the
