the kpmg fiasco the judge in the "largest criminal tax fraud case in history" is now preparing a ruling that may result in the dismissal of all charges against two thirds of the so called kpmg defendants this would itself be a remarkable outcome but we think the judge has every right to go further and tell the government it has forfeited the right to prosecute this case in even diminished form the kpmg prosecution was supposed to illustrate the bush justice departments post enron efforts to be tough on white collar crime instead it has become a symbol of how ambitious prosecutors can exploit an anti business political climate to bring a dubious case and then abuse due process to browbeat the defendants into submission the history is worth recounting as a cautionary tale to prosecutors and business alike in late and early the senate was holding hearings on tax shelters for rich clients and bringing a prosecution had a dual appeal the pursuit of rich people avoiding taxes had populist flair and in the wake of arthur andersens post indictment collapse prosecutors knew they could swing a heavy club to bring corporate suspects to heel the case made for such good headlines that it went largely unnoticed at first that the tax shelters in question had never been challenged in court by the irs this is an extraordinary and troubling precedent the u s tax code is full of loopholes written by congress and while tax evasion is a crime tax avoidance can be entirely legal just as a person is innocent until proven guilty a tax reduction strategy has long been understood to be legal until proven otherwise this is a principle of law but also of fairness taxpayers deserve notice that they are exposing themselves to potential criminal liability for engaging in certain forms of tax avoidance so the theory of the case was at a minimum legally aggressive but the aggression didnt end there the u s attorney for the southern district of new york wielded the threat of a firmwide indictment against kpmg to compel a series of extraordinary actions by the firm kpmg was told for example that if it continued to pay the legal costs of partners under suspicion for marketing the tax shelters that decision would be "looked at under a microscope " the u s attorney vetted kpmgs internal communications with its employees in a bid to encourage individuals to make incriminating statements and to meet with investigators without the benefit of counsel under pressure kpmg offered the doj a "statement of facts" about its tax shelter operations justice felt it was too weak and it told the firms leadership that if kpmg didnt admit its own guilt in no uncertain terms an indictment of the firm was virtually assured kpmg gave justice the statement it demanded reversing its previous position in defense of the shelters in exchange for adopting the governments view of the case it was spared indictment or to put it another way kpmg sold out the employees now on trial rather than run the risk of an indictment that might have meant a la andersen the end of the firm kpmg also abrogated the severance agreement of one fired employee and sent the rest of the future defendants packing this was no mere housecleaning the u s attorneys office took an active interest in what was happening to those under investigation at times asking about the employment status of future defendants by name kpmg also conditioned payment of its former employees legal fees on their cooperation with prosecutors and said legal assistance would be cut off if charges were filed against them when asked about this in the spring of one assistant u s attorney stood before judge lewis a kaplan and declared that kpmg had made its own decision about paying the legal bills at a hearing last week in manhattan judge kaplan noted that hed seen people convicted of making false statements for less that same assistant u s attorney justin weddle also said last year that the governments interest was only to see that companies under investigation did not shelter "wrongdoers " judge kaplan reminded him that the accused had to be found guilty before they were "wrongdoers" under the law the decision due soon from judge kaplan will focus on the narrow matter of the legal fees it is a serious issue not because it is important that lawyers get paid the hundreds of dollars an hour that they charge but because the government has been caught trying to interfere with the right of the accused to choose their own counsel and mount a defense seen in its proper context the legal fees issue is a proxy for what has been wrong with this case from the beginning prosecutors hoped to starve the defendants of support compelling some or all to cop a plea to avoid financial ruin the fees business was only one element of a plan to set the defendants against each other just as it had set kpmg against its former employees in this way the prosecutors hoped to get their scalps without the messy business of proving a dubious legal theory to a jury this case has been shot through with prosecutorial overreach from the first and the u s attorneys office pushed the boundaries of the law to win it due process is the sine qua non of a just system of criminal law when those entrusted with upholding it instead trample on it they have surrendered any claim to be acting in the public interest judge kaplan has suggested in court that if private citizens had done some of the things that the kpmg prosecutors have done they would be on trial if attorney general alberto gonzales wont dismiss the case judge kaplan should do it for him
