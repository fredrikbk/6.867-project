home &amp family best of the juggle excerpts from wsj coms work &amp family blog etiquette at issue in email thank you my daughters recent third birthday party went off without a hitch and she had a great time but gifts mean thank you notes it seems that in this electronic world the tradition of writing and mailing thank you notes is still alive and well writing the notes and getting them in the mail isnt hard but the method also involves tracking down the home addresses of people with whom i communicate almost exclusively by email the whole process is just a few minutes here and there but as any juggler knows those minutes add up this round ive decided to opt for email the email thank you is more efficient and theres something to be said for the almost instantaneous thank you rather than a card that shows up after the event has already drifted off the radar screen im curious to hear what other busy parents think are emailed notes or even a phone call common or do many people still take time to dash off a handwritten card and at what point age can you cross birthday thank yous off of your own to do list and make your child responsible readers say "i see no problem with an emailed thank you i agree its so much faster i once got a thank you card via snail mail three weeks after the event showing appreciation for a gift is true manners regardless of how you do it " "email is no excuse for sending a proper thank you note those people took the time and effort to shop for your daughter and spent their hard earned money on a gift not to mention time coming to and attending your event " when teaching about chores is a chore from juggle contributor and wsj editor jamie heller im tough as nails when the kids get tony or fresh or dont say please or thank you those are zero tolerance offenses but when it comes to chores or teaching the kids to clean up after themselves i havent stepped up to the plate my husband is better than i am in pushing responsible behavior but he at times succumbs to the easier do it yourself path too im determined to do better with my kids ages and if not this summer then starting labor day for sure i know my biggest challenge is going to be overcoming the exhaustion factor im sure the same goes for stay at home parents probably more so but when i get home from work im so tired the last thing i want to do is fight with my kid over cleaning up its easier to clean up and since we have such limited time together i dont want to spend it in conflict readers how do you get your kids to do their share and take care of themselves while maintaining the positives in your relationships and your sanity readers say "i think if you make chores part of the regular routine the kids will initially complain but after testing the limits and finding you wont cave will grow to accept it i think having kids do chores is an important way to communicate that "being part of the family means doing things to help out the family " "i never understood the concept of chores i learned how to be polite responsible and hard working from watching my parents not from doing their housework for them its the parents job to run the house its the kids job to be a kid " does having a baby zap your ambition does having a baby erode your interest in work at least in the short term some may argue that society pushes women to curb their ambition after becoming a parent or maybe we can chalk it up to biology perhaps women are wired to be hyperfocused on their kids in the early years i realize that im far more excited and motivated about my job now than i was when my toddler was still a baby and im guessing that sentiment will only grow as she grows starts school and becomes more independent have other working parents felt their career motivation dip after having a child if so does having a child alter your ambition for good or as the demands of child rearing ease does your interest in work return readers say "instead of excelling by doing my job the same way every day but for longer hours pre baby ive learned to do my job in better more efficient ways to keep my at office hours at a minimum so having my daughter did not change my interest in work so much as it forced me to evaluate how to manage it in such a way to let me maximize my time with my daughter " "having kids changes your perspective and your definition of success im still ambitious at work but not at the expense of my relationship with my husband and the well being of my kids im no longer willing to work ungodly hours and travel of the time " whats the right age for a cellphone from juggle contributor and wsj editor tom weber my wife and i are considering something we didnt expect to deal with for at least a few more years getting our older daughter a cellphone shes eight years old headed into third grade this fall equipping a third grader with a cellphone has sounded ridiculous even to me a confirmed technophile who rushed to supply my daughter early on with a computer and digital camera some of her friends already have phones and it has been high on her please please please list for at least a year but ive remained solidly against it we havent decided what to do yet but were considering the phone much more seriously than before the fact that my wife and i both work is definitely a factor if we cant always be available physically should we at least make it easier to connect virtually readers say "our approach is to not provide a cellphone for our kids until they are able to fund a majority of its cost it then became a purchase we considered together within the confines of their budget and ours " "i dont think there is a set age for a cell phone i think the guidelines should be centered on how much time is the kid spending going to and from activities that need rides coordinated " sara schaefer munoz blogs about work and family issues for the journal post your thoughts on these and other topics at www wsj com thejuggle
