engine spat could slow airbus new a may face tougher going without ges aid an escalating dispute between airbus and jet engine supplier general electric co could set back the european plane makers a project yet again just as the proposed long haul plane was regaining credibility among customers several false starts on the a have pushed the billion euros &# billion project at least five years behind rival boeing co s competing dreamliner plane unveiled sunday at boeings manufacturing facilities in everett wash airbus was able to win a raft of orders for the proposed twin engine twin aisle plane at the paris air show last month helping its efforts to catch up but a stalemate in talks over ge supplied engines for the a could make it less attractive to customers as they evaluate the two currently boeing has firm orders for its airbus has for the a the spat between airbus and ge offers a reminder that although airbus and boeing lead the jetliner business they are critically dependent on some major suppliers for key components the two have long relied on outside companies for engines boeing increasingly outsources other big and essential pieces as well and airbus intends to follow in hopes of reducing the cost of developing and building jetliners airbuss engine dispute illustrates the potential complications of that approach by enlisting more suppliers the unit of european aeronautic defence &amp space co potentially puts itself at the mercy of its supply chain boeing is dealing with its own supply issues with the customers airlines and aircraft leasing firms buy planes and their engines separately though there are a growing number of exceptions customers generally like to be able to choose from more than one engine maker so they can negotiate prices some airlines also have longstanding relationships with a particular supplier customers who order s will have a choice of engines made by two suppliers ge and british engine maker rolls royce plc but because of its disagreement with ge airbus has only one engine choice for the a officials from airbus and ge say they are at loggerheads because the largest version of the a is designed to compete with the largest version of another boeing model the for which ge is the exclusive engine supplier ge officials say they wont build a new engine that competes with the one they already supply for jets instead ge has offered airbus a version of the new genx engine it is creating for boeings dreamliner airbus executives say ges proposal is insufficient because it would work only for the two smaller of airbuss three proposed sizes of a "we have a family of airplanes with the a and we want to keep the family concept " said airbus chief executive louis gallois in an interview although airbus and ge both say they are continuing to negotiate over the a engines and that ge might still join the program in several years no resolution appears imminent "what we put on the table complicated their world " ge engine division president scott donnelly said recently he said customers are pressing ge to supply engines for the a but that he wasnt certain it would be profitable for his company the dispute has recently become more acrimonious airbus managers say ges reluctance is a sign that it is playing favorites "the problem we have with ge is they go to boeing in seattle and say what kind of engine should we design for your airframe " said john leahy airbuss chief operating officer for customers and its top salesman "then they come to airbus in toulouse and say here is the kind of airframe you need to build to fit our engine " mr donnelly disputes the accusation noting that ge remains an important supplier of engines for airbuss popular single aisle models ge officials argue that the european planemaker pulled a switch on them in july of last year when it redesigned the a and made it larger before that redesign ge engines had been in the pole position for the proposed a on the first version mr donnelly said "we were the guys with airbus " but orders by customers for those original ge engines have evaporated ges genx engine has a list price of about &# million each but customers generally negotiate discounts ge and rolls royce make up for that by providing spare parts and maintenance that can be valued at several times the price of the engine while customers typically want a choice of engine providers the aircraft makers sometime partner exclusively with one maker to ensure a return on developing a new engine or in cases when the market for the plane in question is expected to be small some airbus officials fear nationalistic consequences from the rift "if ge doesnt come on the a it will become europe versus the u s " said olivier andries head of strategy at airbus in an interview "rolls royces interest will be to proactively support the a and ge will support the and " engine makers largely have been immune to nationalistic tendencies ge supplied engines that made airbuss first plane possible years ago while rolls invested massively through the s to support models from boeing and other u s plane makers recently however links between ge and boeing and between airbus and rolls have deepened ge was already the exclusive supplier of engines for boeings single aisle model the best selling jetliner in history boeing in selected ge over rolls to supply engines for a planned update of its rolls royce is the exclusive engine supplier for two large versions of airbuss four engine a model if these relationships cement the engine industry could fall into a longstanding u s european row like the one over boeing and airbus the u s and european union have filed rival suits in the world trade organization over each others alleged subsidies to the plane makers rolls royce chief executive sir john rose tried to defuse the tensions saying in an interview that the differences simply result from a series of independent decisions "its absolutely not the intent for us boeing or airbus" to chose sides sir john said in an interview he predicted the situation will rebalance over time mr donnelly also said ge doesnt want to see a split across the atlantic meanwhile boeing is happily watching the fight "airbus happened to build an aircraft that overlaps with the where we have an exclusivity agreement with ge " said scott carson chief executive of boeings commercial aircraft division in an interview "are we going to give that up not on your life " j lynn lunsford contributed to this article
