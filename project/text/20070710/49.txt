former milberg partner may help u s build case in their criminal investigation of milberg weiss &amp bershad llp prosecutors yesterday enlisted the cooperation of a major player who could potentially help them snare bigger targets including the class action law firm and prominent plaintiffs lawyers melvyn weiss and william lerach david bershad years old a former senior milberg partner with deep knowledge of the firms finances pleaded guilty to a conspiracy count in federal court in los angeles he said in court papers that he and others agreed to conceal from judges secret payment arrangements that the firm had with named plaintiffs in class actions he will forfeit &# million and pay a &# fine he could face as much as five years in prison how much time if any he serves may depend in part on his cooperation the plea agreement says "david bershad is committed to making amends for what he has done " said his attorney robert luskin "his efforts to right these wrongs together with his many good works throughout his career should be remembered along with the offense he admitted today " milberg weiss was indicted last year on charges of paying millions in kickbacks to clients to induce them to serve as lead plaintiffs in class action lawsuits the firm a pioneer in the area of securities class actions pleaded not guilty until yesterday the government had failed to land any major figures despite a probe that has lasted more than six years opening it up to criticism that the prosecution lacked legs mr bershad who was indicted with the firm last year is the first person who worked at milberg to plead guilty a longtime member of firm management mr bershad had many close dealings with mr weiss a top partner at milberg and mr lerach who left milberg in to form his own firm neither mr weiss nor mr lerach have been charged though the government has offered both of them plea deals which they rejected that would have involved prison time earlier this year mr lerachs law firm said he was considering retirement so that the milberg case wouldnt distract the firm yesterday a firm spokesman confirmed reports that mr lerach would retire by the end of the year "the fact that mr bershad has been signed up as a cooperator suggests strongly that the investigation is not over and that targets the government views as more culpable are still on the radar screen " says timothy coleman a former federal prosecutor who isnt involved in the milberg case "usually the government does not allow the person that is viewed as the most culpable to cooperate " a statement of facts accompanying mr bershads plea agreement include new details about alleged wrongdoing by partners "a" and "b " believed to be messrs weiss and lerach respectively according to people familiar with the investigation an attorney for mr weiss declined to comment mr lerachs attorney didnt return a call seeking comment prosecutors allege that mr bershad "was told by partner a that partner a had personally provided cash payments" to at least one florida client who served as a named plaintiff in a class action the client wasnt identified in the earlier years of the alleged conspiracy mr bershad along with partners a and b and others "pooled their personal cash into a fund bershad maintained in his office at milberg weiss which was used by the conspiring partners to supply cash for secret payments to paid plaintiffs and others " according to the statement prosecutors yesterday also drew links from partners a and b to steven cooperman a former milberg client who has agreed to plead guilty and is scheduled to enter a plea today according to the statement partner b told mr bershad that milberg was going to pay mr cooperman about &# for having served as a named plaintiff in a case separately prosecutor richard robinson told the court the parties have agreed that mr bershad wouldnt be criminally prosecuted regarding cash paid for household help from to now that the government has struck a deal with mr bershad the spotlight will also turn to milberg weiss which has held settlement talks with prosecutors according to people familiar with the case the terms discussed include milbergs paying a fine and agreeing to increased oversight of its business practices talks could break down but if milberg were able to avoid a guilty plea it would stand a better chance of remaining in business albeit in a diminished capacity once a dominant class action firm milberg has lost lawyers and business since its indictment but it is still operating and is participating in some large settlements including a recent one against tyco international ltd in a statement milberg weiss said that the firms relationship with mr bershad had been terminated "we remain confident that his actions will have no effect on the firms commitment to its clients " milberg said steven schulman a former milberg partner who has since retired from the firm was also indicted and has filed motions asking the court to dismiss the charges against him rhonda rundle contributed to this article
