as for canada finding the border is a bit of a trick with weeds to be whacked and markers to be found its a mile problem beebe plain vt kyle hipsley a chain smoking year old iowan has spent summers looking for america more often than not he has trouble finding it "the boundarys in those bushes " mr hipsley said one morning driving his rented dodge along a line of scrub just to the south of the border with canada "thats got to be cleared " a mile later he said "the boundarys out there in that swamp monuments buried in the bog been that way for years " from the beaufort sea in alaska to passamaquoddy bay in maine mr hipsley sees a lot of work to be done on the u s canadian border trained as a geodetic surveyor he is deputy chief of an organization called the international boundary commission in partnership with canada the commission is supposed to stake out the border and keep a foot strip mowed on either side of it the border is miles long aside from mr hipsley the commissions u s section has four full time employees an unpaid commissioner appointed by the president and a federal budget of &# million as its diplomats pointed out to the state department in march canada contributes nearly twice as much money putting the u s in violation of the treaty of washington which obliges each country to chip in the same amount mowing the grass between the u s and canada though doesnt weigh heavily in the arena of border security with the collapse of its immigration overhaul the bush administration is promising to keep on spending billions for guards fences radar towers and robot airplanes the focus is on the dry expanses of the mexican border where weed whacking isnt the main issue meanwhile the boundary commission whose officials think its probably the smallest and poorest independent agency in the federal government is still working with the maps it drew up in it often has trouble finding the canadian border much less mowing it "they talk about securing the border well nobody ever came to talk to us " mr hipsley said he circled around lake memphremagog just west of beebe plain turned north up a dirt road and stopped at a border gate with a rusty padlock on it "thats what we dont understand what could be the most basic thing youd think of how can you protect it if you cant see it " mr hipsley got out of the car and jumped the gate "thatll shake em up " he said "border patrol will be here in a minute " he knew the roadway had sensors buried in it products of heightened post vigilance there were cameras in the trees too but where the road fell off into a gully running down to the lake the undergrowth was feet high "if you have a camera up on a pole nobodys going to see you " mr hipsley said "theres no way you just walk on through " between and the border patrol caught people sneaking into the u s from canada most came from countries where a canadian visa is easier to get than an american one in this sector a mile stretch from new hampshire to ogdensburg n y the patrol caught with instructions from a smuggler the interlopers usually tramp through the brush to a waiting car once mr hipsley ran into a family of russians at this very spot they were looking for a bus ride to new york city he leaned against the gate and smoked until a patrol car pulled up after mr hipsley showed his diplomatic passport and explained the commissions treaty obligations the border patrol officer said "you going to hire little kids to get out here with lawn mowers " in another thicket the political one the job of explaining treaties passes to mr hipsleys boss dennis schornack mr schornack was commissioner of low level radioactive waste for john engler the former michigan governor and friend of president bush after the election he remembers "word came around anybody interested in presidential appointments i said yeah " mr schornack got a paying job monitoring u s canadian water disputes which automatically elevated him to boundary commissioner as well he has since made the washington rounds expounding on how the treaties of paris and ghent the ashburton webster treaty and the treaty of all require the u s and canada to shell out equally to cut the grass on the border "im not allowed to lobby but im allowed to beg " the commissioner said "im on my knees to everybody wholl listen they make sympathetic sounds lots of clucking but nothing happens " the homeland security department confirms that mr schornack has come calling on the matter of cash though a spokeswoman will only say "we fully support the presidents budget " the department of state aware of canadas protest responded with a statement "the u s agrees " it said that the commission "could benefit from additional funds " and the department is "currently considering ways of assisting the commission in securing these " its enough to try mr shornacks diplomatic skills "if youre out hunting moose " he said "you need to know where the boundary is right so you can say uh oh im stepping into another country right because its different laws and all that stuff right " that was the general idea years ago when the u s and canada agreed to cut "a clear vista to the sky" along their border and mark it with monuments but monuments get shot up by hunters on the alaskan tundra they freeze and bust open prairie winds erode them and they fall over in the rockies avalanches wipe them out the commissions contractors cleared the vista with herbicides at first but during the vietnam war a rumor got around that they were using agent orange that was it for herbicides now the crews go in with bulldozers where they can where they cant they go by helicopter and canoe wielding chain saws and machetes alongside their lawn mowers and weedwackers that costs even with canadas &# million the boundary commission has dropped hundreds of miles behind in its work on quite a few stretches in fact the border sometimes gets lost "by the looks of it the streams taken a turn into the u s " said joseph harrietha canadas head border surveyor toward the end of a long days work mr harrietha was standing ankle deep in water about miles east of beebe plain consulting a gps navigator and squinting at a year old map "canada " he said "well its over there i have a feeling " at canadas expense he and an man crew are spending all summer on one of the boundary commissions priority projects trying to locate the border between quebec and new hampshire in it was fixed for miles along the center of halls stream in the commission set about marking it but halls stream hasnt stayed put it has meandered yards into canada here yards into the u s there the original stream bed is still the official border but now its dry squiggling through dense woods the commission has never cleared it mr harrietha bets the border patrol hasnt put in any cameras either tromping through the brush he came upon a cast iron obelisk in an earth crusted concrete base hours earlier his crew had dug it out of the mud mr harrietha picked up a twig scraped away some crust and exposed an inscription "renewed " "this needs some attention " he said noting its coordinates mr harrietha rolled up his map and slogged on back and forth along the overgrown old bed of halls stream looking for america
