a cast of one for king lear new york shakespeare wrote great parts for dogs but none in "king lear " that has not prevented wu hsing kuo co founder and artistic director of the contemporary legend theatre of taiwan from adding one but no the company has no need to stock puppy chow mr wu is his productions cast of one since its premiere in this tour de force has been seen in nearly a dozen countries on july the lincoln center festival presents it for one night only "its the first one man show in the history of peking opera " says mr wu speaking through his wife and interpreter the dancer lin hsiu wei "it has brought me the greatest satisfaction of my career but also the biggest challenges when the gong strikes i feel pulled onto the stage by some great power getting into the play and coming out again is like being reborn " shakespeares "lear" has some two dozen characters "i play " says mr wu let me guess that dog the aged lear his vicious daughters goneril and regan his true hearted daughter cordelia the fool who follows lear out into the storm gloucester a loyal vassal of the kings gloucesters son edgar gloucesters other son the illegitimate edmund a villain mr wu nods but who is number would it be kent another loyal vassal of the king "no " says mr wu "not kent he has wonderful speeches but in the terms of peking opera his role is too much like some others and dont expect too much of the dog hes hidden in another character " so who have i missed osric the scaly go between one of lears sons in law the doctor "no " comes the answer "the actor me " mr wu is plainly no stranger to the canonical western avant garde of the th century "in a way i try to reinterpret traditional peking opera through deconstruction using the modern mind set to re enter into that tradition " his script for "lear" is a collage of shakespeare in straight translation free paraphrase and outright invention the performance is kaleidoscopic partly in the flamboyant cries and flourishes of peking opera interweaving martial arts acrobatics songs dances and mime and partly in splintered stripped down existentialist meditations reminiscent of samuel beckett at his sparest the most searching of those meditations is the finale replacing shakespeares death scene for lear with the corpse of cordelia when mr wu began training at age prohibitions against women on the peking opera stage were still in place actors specialized in roles of a single type male roles female roles larger than life "painted face" roles or clowns who paint their noses white with his slight frame delicate features and refined gestures mr wu seemed a natural for womens parts in fact when he and ms lin were courting she was jealous to discover him carrying about his person the portrait of a lovely young lady until she realized it was him decked out for the stage at the contemporary legend theater many old restrictions including the ban on actresses no longer apply but by when the company was founded mr wu had already begun venturing beyond his niche of female roles "this play " he says of "lear " "needs every type " and perhaps more than those established types of tradition but the actor makes do for the first of mr wus two acts he wears fierce peking opera war paint along with a flowing white beard that makes it hard for him to breathe and a robe sumptuously emblazoned with silver embroidery in the wave and dragon pattern there are five layers of costume underneath in the second act which includes some of the most painful moments of the tragedy he appears with the shorn head of a zen monk and a face bare but for the tofu nose of the clown a maximally daring choice from its opening production adapted from "macbeth " the contemporary legend theatre has been refracting western classics through the prismatic high artifice of peking opera the stretch may not be as wide as we think "shakespeare is better known in china than peking opera " mr wu remarks "but in many ways his plays and peking opera are very similar in london years ago they played on an empty stage just like in china one big difference is that peking opera reaches out to the popular audience with lots of songs and dances shakespeare uses satire and comedy for that purpose but in both traditions theres great freedom in moving from scene to scene both are full of poetry characters in both traditions are given monologues to explain who they are and they step outside the play to speak to the audience directly " mr wus "lear" was launched in when ariane mnouchkine a french director steeped in eastern traditions invited mr wu to develop a peking opera style "lear" as a demonstration for her students "i thought i would need to explain things " mr wu says "so i tried to combine eastern and western techniques " the resulting minute mad scene played well in paris from it grew the full length version originally three crushing hours since distilled to minutes and while the one man cast may suggest otherwise the scale of the show is epic backing up the star is a team of including nine musicians as well as the lighting and stage crews and the specialist in charge of wardrobe for many "lear" stands supreme among shakespeares tragedies and its central themes pride self delusion filial ingratitude sibling rivalry the indignities of old age leave no audience untouched to the chinese steeped in ancient traditions of elder and ancestor worship the premise of the story lears division of his kingdom among his daughters yet feels both infuriating and absurd for mr wu the personal associations are more specific "i grew up as an orphan " he says "i never knew my father tradition was my father i had a master who said i want to teach you he had no son and i was his disciple the time came when he wanted me to acknowledge the bond in the ancient way kowtowing to him in a public ceremony " shades of lear who precipitates disaster by demanding of his daughters a public declaration of devotion which of you shall we say doth love us most that we our greatest bounty may extend where nature both with merit challenge only cordelia who later gives her life for him refuses to play the game and lear casts her away "i felt a great conflict " mr wu continues through ms lins fluent english "i wanted to honor my master but i also wanted to do new work later i found out that he was telling people i love wu i want to give him my house my pictures my books he never spoke of these things to me and once when he was drunk after an awards ceremony he confronted me and said you told people you dont want what i want to give you is that true " mr wu looks pained "i never wanted to learn my masters art to get his stuff i loved him and respected him i didnt want to be him " "theres more to the story " ms lin interjects over her husbands evident protest "when wu was preparing lear in paris he dreamed that he killed his teacher with his sword and when he got back to taiwan the teacher was dead " a moment of silence "i have a disciple now " mr wu begins "ive taught him for years i feel that i will pass the torch to him others say make him kowtow to you in the traditional ceremony i say to him you are always welcome to study with me but i dont want him to kowtow "i dont want to be lear i like cordelia i think her situation is mine i loved my teacher and i hated him lear is my apology to him and my tribute " mr gurewitsch writes for the journal on culture and philanthropy
