how to size up your hospital improved public databases let people compare practices and outcomes the importance of looking past the numbers amid a broad push to bring more accountability to the u s health care system consumers have access to a growing range of data on hospital quality just a few years ago only a handful of resources offered such data some of it too broad to apply to individual hospitals but now the federal government state agencies and a number of private entities are stepping up their push for greater "transparency" on hospital practices they are mining medicare data and state records and surveying hospitals to come up with user friendly databases to help consumers comparison shop for care to be sure many communities still have just one or two hospitals to pick from and in an emergency choosiness may not be an option even in major cities but hospital systems are expanding and high profile institutions are increasingly competing for patients across broad swaths of the country the push for more public hospital information is also part of a larger effort to improve health care quality and ultimately lower health care costs such public comparisons sometimes make hospitals and doctors uneasy but disclosure can also inspire change says marc volavka executive director of the pennsylvania health care cost containment council which analyzes data on hospitals in that state "if in the light of day problems are shown " he says "that spurs improvement more than anything else you can imagine " here is as look at the mass of data being published online hospital practices perhaps the biggest category of data involves so called best practices such data available from a variety of public and private entities tracks whether hospitals adhere to recommended guidelines for certain procedures so you can find out for instance how consistently your local hospital gives heart attack patients a kind of medication called beta blockers or what proportion of surgery patients get antibiotics an hour before surgery but experts caution that sites that primarily delve into hospital processes rather than outcomes wont tell you how well patients actually fare the best known source for hospital data may be hospital compare www hospitalcompare hhs gov set up jointly by the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services hospitals and other groups the site lets consumers search by city state or other criteria and look up a variety of statistics comparing more than hospitals against one another and to state and federal averages the site covers essentially all acute care hospitals in the country and although it draws on medicare data its findings can be applicable beyond elderly and disabled patients other groups track similar data on best practices including the joint commission the independent nonprofit group that accredits most of the hospitals in the u s on the groups site www qualitycheck org consumers can search by hospital location or type of service and get reports on hospital practices that draw on the commissions inspections of facilities it accredits much of the best practices data available focuses on three of the most common areas of hospital care heart attack pneumonia and surgery there are some groups that include a broader range of procedures the leapfrog group a not for profit consortium of big health care buyers like general motors corp provides hospital ratings that are available to the public at www leapfroggroup org like medicares many ratings focus on process rather than outcomes but it collects some data of its own and analyzes different practices at about hospitals measures include whether hospital procedures consistently encourage hand washing whether specialized doctors and nurses staff intensive care units and whether doctors enter orders electronically in an effort to avoid errors the assumption is that hospitals with the best practices will provide the best care chief executive suzanne delbanco says the group also tracks how hospitals handle "never events" mistakes that should never happen like a newborn abduction or amputating the wrong leg but it doesnt track how often such events occur "were not counting problems " ms delbanco says overall research shows that such "best practices" tend to be good for patients but they ultimately are just a few of dozens of elements that determine good care hospital experts warn "i frankly dont care whether i get a beta blocker or not what i want to know is whether i live or die " says mr volavka of the pennsylvania health care cost containment council tracking outcomes some resources including some state governments are increasingly publishing data on how patients actually fare at least for some conditions new yorks state health department for example combines state and federal data to let consumers compare mortality rates for cardiac surgery at all hospitals in the state at hospitals nyhealth gov consumers can compare facilities against one another and against state averages the site also provides some data on how often a hospital does a particular procedure as well as some best practices statistics such as those on the hospital compare site mr volavkas agency in pennsylvania collects a broad variety of data from hospitals in the state and publishes quarterly reports on mortality rates readmissions and complications for some conditions and average lengths of stay adjusted for how sick patients are among other details the agencys web site www phc org also publishes reports comparing costs and outcomes for specific procedures like open heart surgery and examining the frequency of patients acquiring new infections while at different facilities many states gather data from hospitals for public health and other purposes but only about provide public quality reports for consumers says denise love executive director of the national association of health data organizations among the others florida california and texas to see the associations map of reporting states see www nahdo org qualityreports aspx last month medicare started providing some mortality information for heart attack and heart failure cases through hospital compare specifically measuring how likely such patients are to die of any cause within days of admission at all of the hospitals it tracks but critics say the information is too vague to be of much use the site indicates only whether a given hospital is better no different or worse than national averages and virtually all hospitals fall into the "no different" category seventeen u s hospitals are "better" than the u s rate for heart attack deaths and seven are "worse " for example the rest are labeled "no different " a private company health grades inc of golden colo also rates doctors and hospitals and provides information on a broader range of outcomes the companys site www healthgrades com rates hospitals on conditions and procedures from appendectomies to heart valve replacement surgery the site which offers data on more than hospitals draws on medicare billing data to calculate the rate of complications or deaths in the wake of each procedure giving a star rating and specific percentages much of the information is available free on the site which is searchable by state procedure and other criteria or for &# the group will provide more elaborate reports including average length of stay data and price comparisons however you wont get much on smaller hospitals if a facility doesnt report handling a condition or procedure at least times in three years health grades says its data arent statistically significant some insurers and large employers provide members and employees with access to reports from health grades or other companies that provide similar information to clients including subimo a seven year old portland ore company and healthshare technology inc recently acquired by webmd corp of elmwood park n j dont stick with just one tool says samantha collier health grades chief medical officer "go to all the sites you can see if youre getting similar data " end of life care for the intrepid consumer willing to wade through volumes of statistics the dartmouth medical schools dartmouth atlas of health care at www dartmouthatlas org is a gold mine of information comparing hospital practices across regions and states suggesting for example that some procedures may be overused in some areas aimed primarily at researchers and policy makers much of the information is too general for evaluating individual hospitals but it does provide copious hospital specific data on end of life care for each hospital users can explore a variety of data including how often patients in the past six months of life were seen by specialists and what proportion were admitted to hospice programs as well as what proportion of patients died in the icu the site which tracks all but specialty hospitals and very small facilities or about facilities also lets users compare hospitals to one another beyond end of life treatment the data can also help consumers gauge how aggressive a particular hospital is in its overall care says kristen bronner the atlass editor "were not going to tell you go to this hospital " ms bronner says "were going to tell you the profile for this hospital is very aggressive specialist oriented high tech probably theyre going to try everything and youre going to see everybody " beyond the numbers although online tools make hospital comparisons more thorough than ever experts say other factors matter too including such abstractions as reputation "what most consumers have to rely on is not hard data " says john conolly president and chief executive of castle connolly medical ltd which publishes lists of top doctors "reputation becomes probably the most important thing consumers rely on " major brand name institutions like the mayo clinic of course are well known even far from their home turf but for other facilities reputation often boils down to word of mouth pay particular attention to recommendations or warnings from people who work at hospitals youre considering experts say patients should also probe beyond a hospitals general reputation even a good hospital may not be good at everything "you dont necessarily want to shop your hospital in general " dr collier says "you want to shop your specific procedure or condition " and consider calling the hospitals directly quality departments or medical staff offices can be a good place to start most facilities will take pains to answer questions about how often they and individual doctors perform procedures for example they know its bad business to refuse dr collier says shopping around what to look at when comparing hospitals best practices data a number of resources including medicare publish statistics on how well hospitals adhere to treatment guidelines outcomes data a growing range of public and private entities disclose information on how well patients actually fare especially with cardiac care reputation word of mouth can help fill in the gaps that the numbers dont address
