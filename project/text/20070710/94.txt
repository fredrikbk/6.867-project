the afternoon report raid on the red mosque online edition a standoff between pakistani government forces and islamist radicals reached a violent climax today showing that president gen pervez musharraf is willing to stand up to militants but also raising anxiety over the countrys stability troops staged a pre dawn raid on islamabads lal masjid or red mosque in an attempt to flush out fundamentalist militants who had barricaded themselves in the sprawling facility following clashes with government forces the groups efforts to institute taliban style morality in the streets of the capital had led to conflict with pakistans security services that culminated in the standoff which began july with followers vowing to battle to the death rather than surrender the government had sought to avoid a cataclysmic outcome but after attempts to forge a negotiated settlement collapsed last night troops moved into the complex twelve soldiers were killed in the fighting as were more than militants including the radical cleric abdul rashid ghazi who had vowed to become a martyr rather than turn himself over to the authorities the raid dragged on for over hours as troops moved from room to room across the compound pakistani military officials said the fighters inside had amassed a vast arsenal it was unclear how many of the people inside the mosque were there against their will adherents had swept many people including prostitutes off the streets in order to "reeducate" them the raid showed that the musharraf government still has the muscle to crack down on violent fundamentalists washington demanded that pakistan take sure steps to bring such groups to heel following the sept terrorist attacks in the u s but gen musharraf has often been criticized for not confronting more directly the radical mosques and madrassas that pepper the countrys rural areas if the raid is a signal that the musharraf government is prepared to take tougher steps against radical groups it may also be a cause for concern while the red mosque group had little support in the broader population one islamabad resident told reuters the raid "had to happen one day but thank god its over" some may be angry that the government allowed the situation to deteriorate to the point that a violent confrontation was necessary at all criticism of gen musharraf is growing even among many of pakistans moderates after what many said was a misguided attempt to unseat the countrys top jurist worry over possible declining support for the government and concern that the raid might be used by al qaeda and other groups as a pretext to increase attacks is unnerving international onlookers javier solana the european unions top foreign policy official said that the eu is "gravely concerned" about the battles between government forces and islamists in pakistan because of the possibility they may spill into neighboring afghanistan bloodshed there has intensified in recent weeks a suicide

signal that chinas scorching economic growth isnt slowing despite the attempts of regulators in beijing to press on the brakes and seems likely to revive international calls for beijing to revalue the yuan critics say that by keeping the value of the yuan artificially low relative to other world currencies beijing gives chinese exports an unfair leg up on the global market economists said that strong external demand is the key source of chinas strong trade performance and unless that abates or china allows for significant capital outflows and more yuan appreciation the liquidity caused by the trade inflows will continue to counter beijings efforts to tighten the taps china executes former food regulator zheng xiaoyu the former chinese food and drug regulator who was sentenced to death
