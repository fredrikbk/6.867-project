energy iea forecast underlines oil gas supply worries by production is expected to fall short of global demand the industrialized worlds energy watchdog added to rising concerns in some quarters that oil and natural gas production wont keep up with the worlds growing thirst for energy in coming years highlighting worries over supplies and prices the paris based international energy agency which monitors energy markets on behalf of the worlds most advanced economies yesterday released its annual medium term forecast projecting conditions through the agency expects oil supply to be tighter in coming years than it had forecast with little prospect of relief unless world economic growth falters the iea doesnt forecast oil prices but its conclusions imply that consumers should expect continued upward pressure on the cost of energy "oil and gas price pressures look set to remain in the coming years " the iea report said "slower than expected gross domestic product growth may provide a breathing space but it is abundantly clear that if the path of demand doesnt change on its own it may well be driven to change by higher prices " the report said august delivery crude oil on the new york mercantile exchange fell cents to settle at &# that is close to the &# nominal high reached nearly a year ago but still well below the inflation adjusted highs reached years ago based on may consumer price data in the u s a barrel of crude fetched &# in april when adjusted for inflation the iea forecasts that the organization of petroleum exporting countries the cartel that supplies more than of the worlds daily oil needs will have little spare capacity left by it also expects supply increases from non opec oil producers and biofuel producers to start flagging after natural gas markets also will be tight because of inadequate supply increases limiting the ability of consumers to switch between oil and natural gas still demand for oil and gas is expected to rise at a brisk pace in the years to critics of the iea point to the number of revisions it makes in its data and some notable misses like a surge in demand from china three years ago that helped send oil prices surging still the iea is one of the consistent sources of data on oil supply and demand and is widely respected in the industry it said global oil demand is projected to expand a year on average reaching million barrels a day by up from million barrels a day this year this forecast is based on global economic growth of about annually oil demand is expected to increase most rapidly in asia and the middle east should economic growth slow in terms of gross domestic product to an annual in the years to the need for opec oil would be reduced by some two million barrels a day but that would merely postpone by a year the point at which demand surpasses the growth in global oil capacity it pegged total growth in non opec supply at million barrels a day by to million barrels a day from million barrels a day in this is slower than the rate posted so far this decade and about half the rate of projected growth in demand it said opecs spare capacity the safety cushion in the world system is expected to remain constrained until then shrink to minimal levels by when the exporters collectively will be able to pump only a paltry extra amount the equivalent of of world demand while the iea didnt say so the shrinking of opecs spare capacity in the past decade has made the oil market skittish about any development that could conceivably threaten supply resulting in volatile markets and prices on the positive side the iea said the worlds refinery capacity is likely to increase significantly during the period
