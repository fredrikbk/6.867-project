services companies exhort us to start saving early or else "even small contributions will grow dramatically " writes usa todays sandra block a retirement saving tutorial on the web site of mutual fund

something i know rather than letting somebody else put it in stocks that i dont know anything about " he says real estate "is actually a real thing whereas a stock could just go down to nothing " all of this energetic focus is compelling but is it wise to shoot the moon if entrepreneurs invest all of their earnings in their businesses theyre in double jeopardy says william bygrave a professor of entrepreneurship at babson college in wellesley mass he acknowledges that this kind of risk is usually necessary to get a new business off the ground but "if youre putting all your eggs in one basket youd better watch that basket very carefully " he says its often seven to eight years before a business can be deemed viable and after that the founder should consider how to protect their own

save for retirement either write to emily meehan at actone wsj com the last act one column "new grads are impatient for promotions " drew a range of responses from readers heres a sample of reader letters some letters have been edited for length or clarity im and left a fortune company after two years for similar reasons as the people in your article after swinging to the extreme other end to a tiny hr consulting firm that i loved working for where i had a lot of responsibility and impact i got laid off after months when our major client went under im now looking for a middle ground where i can get security and still not be bored at my job mitzi chamakala chollampel tarzana calif your act one column "new grads are impatient for promotions" struck a chord i never cease to be amazed at the general surprise when twentysomethings act exactly as twentysomethings always have and should whether we are career theorists parents or just candid in recalling our own young adulthood we should recognize that people in their early to mid s are trying out new roles learning about themselves discovering what they can do what they value doing and what they never want to do again so they are

this prevalent in the public sector and if so what are the potential consequences for how we govern and relate to the world is academia participative or resistant to this trend how do the youth of other countries compare with their american peers your article is in tune with a lot of management dilemmas in corporate america currently there are pros and cons to this but it is definitely not a static phenomenon there are far reaching consequences to the continued prosperity of this nation kyle blodget wynnewood pa
