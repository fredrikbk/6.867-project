mba track refresher programs help previous graduates get up to date focus on academics careers and other business school trends can your m b a degree go stale thats what michele stafiniak director sales force administration for glaxosmithklines u s pharmaceuticals business started wondering last december as she reflected on the past year and looked ahead to coincidentally she opened her mail to find an announcement of a new m b a refresher program at northwestern universitys kellogg school of management in evanston ill "i was looking for some new challenges and an opportunity to brush up my skills " says ms stafiniak who received her m b a from temple university in "i thought the kellogg program could differentiate me and open new doors " ms stafiniak and other students signed up for the inaugural class in kelloggs renaissance post m b a program they spent two weeks on campus in april boning up on the sarbanes oxley act corporate governance reforms and outsourcing and offshoring in operations and supply chains classes covered such topics as the global economy hedge funds and leveraged buyouts information technology management and leading and marketing in the "nanosecond culture " in the fall the class will return to kellogg for a third week on leadership development that will include such subjects as energizing people reputation and crisis management and building trust "what leadership means to a new m b a graduate at age is very different from what it means to a year old who received an m b a more than years ago " says stephen burnett associate dean for executive education at kellogg kellogg decided to split its program into two parts to better accommodate working students who find it difficult to break free from the office for a three week stretch in most cases their employers are picking up the tab for the &# program "we originally thought our renaissance program would be less than three weeks but after talking with faculty we realized how much material we needed to cover to bridge the gap since the students graduated from business school " dr burnett says other schools also recognize the demand for continuing education for instance york universitys schulich school of business in toronto offers a post m b a diploma in advanced management students enroll in five electives that enable them to update their business skills and acquire more in depth specialized knowledge in a particular discipline "in this fast changing competitive business environment people need to raise the bar for themselves and update their skills " says ashwin joshi director of schulichs m b a program "post m b a education is a signal to employers that you are upgrading yourself and making yourself a more valuable asset " some business schools give alumni the opportunity to take a few regular m b a classes free or at a discount others have created short executive education courses ranging from a few days to a week but unlike kellogg and schulich they limit enrollment to their own m b a alumni kelloggs renaissance program will evolve to keep pace with business trends and the latest academic research for example a lesson on health cares impact on companies will be added to the curriculum for the second renaissance class "we are attracting a very global group of students who want to hear the most cutting edge stuff " says brenda ellington booth the academic director for executive programs at kellogg for brett farrell program delivery director at sap americas consulting services business the renaissance program was especially beneficial in its lessons about managing a service operation protecting "intellectual capital" and taking a customer focused approach to leading teams "when i got my m b a a decade ago the focus was much more on manufacturing than on services " he says "i really needed to revisit some of the evolving thinking about business concepts and procedures " kellogg decided to target m b a graduates at least years out of school thats a huge market but not the easiest to reach kellogg focused first on cities with the largest number of business schools including boston chicago new york los angeles and washington because many graduates tend to work within miles of their alma maters it also reached out to m b a graduates in midwestern cities like indianapolis st louis milwaukee and minneapolis where kellogg and northwestern enjoy high familiarity for its advertising campaign kellogg came up with the slogan "know it all knew it all " to indicate the limited shelf life of an m b a degree the media schedule included the wall street journal harvard business review chicago newspapers and some geographically targeted online sites in addition kellogg mailed thousands of brochures and postcards to prospective students and companies that encourage management education it also believed it could reach plenty of m b a s with big display ads at chicagos ohare airport kellogg expects its next class to grow to about students as awareness of the renaissance program builds "we were worried that the number of people with m b a degrees is growing fast but relatively few m b a graduates take executive education courses " says eric fridman marketing director for executive education "from a marketing standpoint we needed a program that was tailored just for people with an m b a but we want to be selective in whom we admit and be sure we attract people with diverse backgrounds to make the renaissance program a dynamic learning experience "
