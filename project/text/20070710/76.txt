our own worst enemy let us not delude ourselves the recent hamas conquest of gaza is a signal defeat for the united states that goes well beyond the particulars of the israeli palestinian conflict we have sought to deny the islamic terrorists a territorial base in afghanistan iraq somalia and elsewhere now they have won one on the mediterranean gaza is partly a consequence of three bad habits bedeviling the war on terror electing the anti democrats in the palestinian lebanese and iraqi elections we allowed parties hamas hezbollah sadr with standing armed militias to run even though their platforms negated the very legitimacy of the democratic vote in each case we got escalating conflict and ineffective government as the result some neoconservatives believe that if only unshackled from their current dictators people everywhere would simply vote for democracy as we know it we should have learned by now that a policy of elections at all costs and hope for the best a by product of neoconnery is a good way to discredit democracy and risks replacing bad with worse this may well result as george kennan warned in situations where "neither dollars nor bayonets could secure success " speak fast act slow in january president bush announced the "surge" but only in june did sufficient troops arrive for the plan to take full effect we telegraphed the punch then took six months to deliver it this gave the enemy ample time to adjust and that includes the iranians initially impressed by the presidents political courage but now much less impressed by the follow through so our enemys countersurge began before we could even implement our strategy the secretary of defense should explain to the commander in chief why it took six months to assemble troops and if the answer is that the army and marines are still too small then let the commander in chief tell us why we havent enlarged them the real military test for this congress and president is not deadlines for withdrawal from iraq but how quickly we can relieve the global overstretch of our forces given the challenge the five year goal of more soldiers and marines is little short of ludicrous too many generals donald rumsfelds departure and the decision to pursue counterinsurgency in iraq required fresh commanders but the administration overlooked a new source of military talent in of all places the u s senate the senate majority leader for example asserts that the war is lost and that gen petraeus is detached from reality in baghdad he and other equally qualified lay military experts are busily setting dates certain for troop withdrawal oblivious of the consequences some have questioned the constitutionality of such congressional resolutions i question their wisdom we need a debate on how to win not how to lose that would be a good topic for the presidential candidates its certainly not what theyre talking about now john quincy adams warned us against going abroad "in search of monsters to destroy " and some argue that the war on terror is just such a case i disagree on the monster found us asleep at home and will continue to find us inadequately prepared unless we muster more strength and more wisdom unless we break with illusionary democracy mongering inept handling of our military resources and self defeating domestic political debates we are in danger of becoming our own worst enemy gen haig u s army ret was the th u s secretary of state
