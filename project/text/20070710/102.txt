the junkyard dogs investors in some funds rising risk premiums hit high yield holdings i wouldnt be an owner investing in mutual funds holding "junk" may be getting costlier prices for so called junk or high yield bonds have fallen in recent weeks partly thanks to rising yields on safer bonds like treasurys investors are also pulling back from riskier bonds like these amid worries about the mortgage market and troubles at two bear stearns cos hedge funds money managers are also shying away from the slew of new junk bonds coming to the market just yesterday meat processing company swift &amp co had to withdraw its &# million junk bond offering the fifth such deal to have soured in the past two weeks mark hudoff a high yield manager at pimco says that so far "the generic assumption was that if a company had a little bit of cash flow you could lever the lights out of it" referring to leverage or the practice of borrowing heavily by issuing new bonds "i think investors are rejecting that " this wariness is hurting bond prices and by extension the mutual funds that invest in them the average junk bond fund is down for the days ended july the categorys worst monthly performance since according to morningstar inc until now the category has been doing well over the past months through friday its up financial advisers say this marks a good time for investors to re evaluate their high yield holdings currently the average high yield bond is giving a yield of only about three percentage points more than u s treasury bonds which are among the safest investments available for comparison as recently as that gap was around nine to percentage points "i wouldnt be an owner of a high yield bond fund right now " says kurt brouwer a fee only financial planner in tiburon calif for investors already holding these funds he advises reducing the allocation to around or so of their overall portfolio investors have already started voting with their feet pulling out more than &# billion from high yield funds and exchange traded funds in the four weeks through july according to amg data services previously investors were pouring money into these funds which have seen inflows of &# billion through july more than last years total inflows of &# billion high yield funds and etfs tracked by amg currently hold about &# billion in assets up from &# billion at the end of some funds that arent focused on junk bonds can still hold sizeable chunks of high yield debt for example some "income" funds like the franklin income fund or the first american income builder fund which hold both stocks and bonds hold more than a quarter of the portfolio in these bonds also many traditional bond funds with titles like "core" or "total return" in their name have the ability to buy junk bonds along with a variety of other bonds advisers say more diversified funds like these may be a better bet in the current environment as opposed to a fund focused primarily on junk bonds "it is useful to use a bond fund that has some flexibility in its fundamental investment strategies so the manager can change when conditions change " mr brouwer says ross levin a fee only adviser in edina minn says investors who have been buying these funds for their high yields need to ask themselves if the current risk is worth the potential reward "high yield is junkier than its been in a long time " says mr levin who hasnt had any allocation to high yield bond funds since high yield bonds have been in high demand in recent years amid historically low interest rates which have driven investors to turn to riskier investments to earn an extra buck also defaults on junk bonds have been at a historically low levels keeping them less volatile but observers are starting to see hints that the bull run in these bonds could be running out of steam for instance investors have recently shown less appetite for new junk bonds issued by companies being bought out by private equity firms saying they often have too few protections for investors the merrill lynch high yield master ii index of junk bonds has fallen nearly since the start of june given the current environment its increasingly important for fund managers to do homework before buying a junk bond "its no longer a market where the rising tide lifts all ships " says diane vazza managing director for global fixed income research at standard &amp poors some fund managers are now becoming more cautious many are buying better quality high yield bonds or different securities altogether "weve been set up kind of defensively for the past six months or so " says tom huggins co manager of the eaton vance income fund of boston "we just thought at the end of the last year that there wasnt much capital appreciation left " he says as a result his fund has been buying bank loans which has more protection in case of default however given the current volatility the managers expect there might be a few opportunities mr hudoff of pimco says managers at his firm had been expecting volatility to pick up in the high yield bond market and have consequently been "building up the conservatism of the portfolio" since the beginning of the year he says theyre closely watching global economic conditions and corporate earnings which are key drivers for the high yield market michael aneiro contributed to this article
