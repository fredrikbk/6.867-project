tapping the most expensive generating plants less comed hopes to sign households to the program by including this year participants get a new electric meter that measures usage throughout the day in the carolinas progress energy inc has a slew of programs intended to double the amount of energy conserved to megawatts in the next few years an amount equivalent to what four big power plants would produce in june it began distributing wireless devices that measure energy use by interacting with the electric meter that allows people to switch appliances off and on and instantly see the savings in money and kilowatt hours "just giving people information has an impact on how they use energy " says dana yeganian a spokeswoman for progress energy in raleigh n c in california utilities are midway through a &# billion program which began last year and was devised by regulators to promote "smarter" energy use southern california edison a unit of edison international has signed a thousand

ratepayer dollars is intended to make the units run more efficiently socal edison also is recruiting customers to a "cycling" program that allows the utility to turn central air conditioning units off and on with the help of a wireless controller the goal is to get a increase in participation shaving peak electricity demand enough to idle a large power plant the program involves the installation of a special controller on the air conditioning unit allowing it to be operated from a remote location pasadena resident lisa burke signed up because it looked like an easy way to help the environment she says her family wanted to put solar panels on its square foot home "but its just too expensive this was something we could do at no added cost " ms burke says her seven year old twins kara and kelsey studied global warming in school and now push her to reduce energy use "routines can change " ms burke says "you feel good when you do something positive rather than be wasteful " in northern california pacific gas &amp electric co has introduced an online tool that shows consumers the connection between energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions customers can go to the online calculator www pge com climatesmart and plug in numbers from their monthly bill and the calculator shows how small changes in energy use or equipment could reap significant results for example a household that swapped out incandescent light bulbs for compact fluorescent bulbs could cut its share of emissions by or pounds of carbon dioxide annually it also could save money from a reduced power bill more than outweighing the cost of bulbs which retail for less than &# locally the utility a unit of pg&amp e corp in san francisco is also enlisting signups for its new "climatesmart" program in
