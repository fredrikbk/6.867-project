shortage of skilled labor pinches eastern europe as workers move west continent is losing competitive weapon in recent years global car makers have flocked to slovakia attracted by the eastern european countrys plentiful supply of cheap skilled labor but this year when kia motors corp needed extra workers at its local car plant it had to place fliers in local newspapers and mailboxes urging residents to apply near bratislava an area with so many car and supplier factories its now known as detroit east rival volkswagen ag is so short of help that every day it buses workers from as far away as miles "i have the most difficult job in the company " says jaroslav holecek director of human resources at vws bratislava plant "every day people come to me and say i quit im moving to england we cant stop them " fast growth and high emigration to richer western european countries are threatening to undermine a crucial asset of the former soviet bloc nations that joined the european union three years ago plentiful skilled labor at the right price a dwindling pool of workers is driving up wages in key industries and forcing companies to go to greater lengths to recruit and retain people its also eroding one of the eus responses to competition from asia its low cost hinterland reform fatigue is compounding the problem in formerly communist countries the transition to free market economies has brought more than a decade of belt tightening and political turmoil across the region workers are growing frustrated populist governments are capitalizing by trying to roll back earlier changes to labor laws and to block new ones well beyond eastern europe global economic growth has been so strong for the past three years that unemployment rates have come down almost everywhere the euro zones unemployment rate fell to in may the lowest since eurostat the european statistical agency began calculating the measure in the u s jobless rate in june was at close to a six year low though the pace of wage increases for typical workers hasnt accelerated much the member organization for economic cooperation and development said recently that in nearly two thirds of its member countries unemployment has fallen below sustainable rates as the global economy strains against capacity constraints central bankers are worrying about rising inflation rates a sharp contrast to the worries about deflation earlier in the decade companies in many countries are operating at close to full capacity facing shortages of everything from land to equipment the car electronics and other companies operating in eastern europe arent about to pull out with average wages just to of those in countries such as germany the countries of central and eastern europe could remain attractive places to make cars and other goods for years but the labor squeeze is driving up costs giving new leverage to workers and speeding eastern europes transition from a low cost manufacturing haven to a mature market economy "our friends in eastern europe should have the same high living standards as people in western europe " says carl peter forster president of general motors corp s european division "the question is how fast you go we should avoid adjusting the standards too quickly in order not to lose many opportunities for job growth " in recent years waves of foreign investment and booming domestic consumption have spurred growth across central and eastern europe last year tiny slovakia raked in a record &# billion in foreign investment poland the easts biggest economy attracted a record &# billion last year slovakias economy grew by more than polands by the countries that share the euro currency grew on average by now central banks across the region are fretting about wage inflation if they respond by raising interest rates economic expansion will likely slow as consumers and firms curtail spending the national bank of poland cited rising wages as a reason for its surprise quarter point interest rate increase to in late june multinational firms are unlikely to scratch already planned projects but economists worry that shortages of skilled labor could crimp future spending "this may become a constraint to further foreign direct investment and economic growth " says jan rutkowski a world bank economist for europe and central asia already skills shortages are forcing companies to worry that worker turnover could affect quality "its much more challenging to keep the production lines running " says nikolaus pfister general manager of se bordnetze slovakia in nitra slovakia which supplies wiring harnesses to car makers in the past year the company has doubled the number of supervisors on its factory floor "we have new people pouring in every week " he says "you have to check their work " polish president lech kaczynski has complained of being unable to find someone to paint his house because all the painters have moved away since poland joined the eu in some poles many of them young and educated have emigrated westward by conservative estimates most go to the united kingdom and ireland which lifted labor market restrictions for eastern eu members last year the exodus helped reduce polish unemployment to from nearly three years ago polands unemployment rate is still among europes highest in part thats because many workers trained in the communist era have skills more suited to declining state industries like shipbuilding and mining for others housing shortages and higher prices keep them from moving to where the jobs are marek stanistawek a year old carpenter lives in radom a once booming industrial and textile center some miles south of warsaw although unemployment in warsaw has dipped to radoms rate exceeds on a recent morning mr stanistawek joined a throng of job seekers at radoms unemployment office he said hes been looking for a job since when the local telephone factory where he worked for years shut down he collects polish zloty a month about &# in welfare payments which helps to cover the zloty rent on the apartment he shares with his daughter and year old granddaughter mr stanistawek said he knows there are jobs in warsaw but contends that the costly commute and higher prices for food and rent in the capital would take too big a bite out of his pay "my family and friends are here in radom not in warsaw " he says "even if im not working its better to be here " in other parts of poland investment surges have tightened competition for technology and back office workers tax breaks and a surfeit of cheap educated labor have lured companies to the region around wroclaw a city of in western poland where hewlett packard co swedens electrolux and koreas lg group have set up shop in recent years by last fall the pool of skilled labor was so shallow that mayor rafal dutkiewicz put up billboards in the u k and ireland proclaiming "come back poles we have work for you wroclaw loves you " polands labor laws also contribute to labor shortages teachers and coal miners for example can retire after or years of work regardless of age as a result as many as million able bodied poles of the working age population are not part of the labor force partly due to pressure from businesses the polish government pledged to curtail some early retirement programs next year but analysts worry law makers will bow to political pressure to preserve the perks in slovakia car makers and other large employers have tangled with prime minister robert fico over government attempts to restrict their ability to hire temporary employees and to set limits on the amount of overtime work that companies can demand from employees mr fico a left leaning populist says its time for ordinary slovaks to reap the benefits of a fast growing economy starting with "a more social labor code " "i dont want companies to invest here because we have low wages " mr fico said in an interview during a visit to volkswagens bratislava factory "i want them to invest here because we have highly qualified workers and good infrastructure " shortages of skilled laborers have caused some employers to grant hefty pay increases in april skoda auto volkswagens czech unit agreed to a pay increase phased in over months for some workers after they staged a one day strike last month some workers at a general motors plant in southeastern poland got &# bonuses more than half an average months wages in addition they got wage increases this year and last this year wages in poland are expected to grow faster than

who have stayed behind are now holding strikes demanding pay increases of up to employers are also concerned about eastern europes aging work force one quarter of skodas czech workers are over a percentage thats rising fast industry executives are lobbying prague to speed the approval of work permit applications from job seekers in former soviet republics as well as from countries with young populations such as vietnam the scarcity of skilled workers is acute in the area many slovaks refer to as "detroit east " which extends in a roughly mile radius around bratislava car production in slovakia is set to more than double this year to more than half a million vehicles as early as next year slovakia with a population of million people could become the worlds largest producer of cars per capita according to estimates by j d power automotive forecasting until a few years ago foreign companies tended to shun the country volkswagen was an exception amid concerns about its authoritarian premier vladimir meciar an ex boxer he tightly controlled the state media and drove up the deficit with public works projects then a more business friendly government took over cutting corporate taxes and putting the country on track to eu membership in january slovakia bested poland in a contest for a new &lt euro&gt million or &# million peugeot factory employing more than a year later kia decided to build its first european plant in zilina which is miles northeast of bratislava that created more than additional jobs directly and lured more suppliers to the region employers from other industries have followed including samsung electronics co which in march announced plans to build a new factory in trnava "its a totally different market " says mr holecek the vw personnel director "we used to be alone here people only wanted to work for vw " now car makers and suppliers in slovakia are recruiting from farther away even from outside the country peugeot has built dwellings at its factory in trnava to lure more workers from the countrys east volkswagen last year recruited about workers from poland only to see most quit within a few months to take jobs in western europe company officials say "when we advertise theres often no response " says norbert gabriel director of a brose ag factory in bratislava that supplies volkswagen with door systems and window regulators the shortages have benefited workers such as kamille lenart a year old hungarian in after two years at edscha ag a german auto parts supplier in the western slovak city of velky

at vw he says he wants to earn enough money to one day return to slovakia buy his own house and start a family as eastern europes population ages some economists contend labor supply problems may grow five of the eight ex communist countries that joined the eu in had net population drops last year the cost of caring for rapidly aging populations could drive up tax rates and deficits that in turn could make it difficult for countries to embark on public service projects such as building affordable housing to help lure emigrants back home already some large employers in eastern europe are looking farther afield for solutions mr pfister the executive at the wiring harness maker says his company has cut roughly jobs in slovakia over the past year of its local work force and transferred some production to ukraine bulgaria and morocco others are importing labor polands largest residential building firm j w construction imported some laborers from uzbekistan and tajikistan in april to
