videos teach chinas rural doctors prerecorded lectures cover basics of western medicine breath of life for a blue baby mile china xia yonggang cant forget the four year old boy who showed up at his clinic here in southwestern china six years ago from the boys fever and cough dr xia guessed he had an upper respiratory tract infection and gave him an injection of the antibiotic cefradine ten minutes later the boy started breathing rapidly and broke out in a rash "i was scared my heart was beating very fast " says dr xia years old who gave the boy an injection of adrenaline and called an ambulance dr xia says he made a critical mistake that could have killed the boy he never checked to see if the child had an allergy to the medicine china has about one million rural doctors an army of physicians who care for the countrys hundreds of millions of farmers and peasants most of these doctors have no formal medical education and little knowledge of western medicine or how to use it now a company called haoyisheng com inc whose name translates as good doctor is teaching them the basics over the past four years the beijing based company which is incorporated in the cayman islands has set up outlets in remote villages and small cities like mile pronounced meel eh where local doctors attend video classes in essential matters of diagnosis and care so far haoyisheng com has outfitted classrooms in eight provinces with the blessing of the chinese government which has brought in more than doctors to educate the company is expanding the program to several more provinces this year haoyisheng founders mark c engel and gao zhan who own a number of health care businesses in china each hold stakes in haoyisheng while venture capital firm softbank china venture investments ltd owns and staff hold the remaining stake mr engel years old is the companys chairman while mr gao is chief executive though mr engel says they operate as equals "how frustrating must it be for the doctors if half the time they have people coming in and they just dont know what to do " says mr engel an american who moved to china in the early s after which he set up a business that conducted clinical trials on the mainland for multinational pharmaceutical companies "theyve had people die on them " dr xia one of haoyishengs students learned about drug allergies only recently in the course and now knows how to test an antibiotic on the patients skin to see if there is a reaction before giving any injections "in the past it was very difficult " says dr xia who finished school when he was and began practicing medicine in the village with his mother "we would have to take a book and slowly look over the descriptions of the diseases after consulting the book we were maybe or certain the diagnosis was correct because my knowledge was limited my courage was also limited " chinas government has been struggling to improve the quality of the countrys ailing health care system which under mao zedong provided basic but near universal care that system was slowly dismantled as china began privatizing health care in the s and shifted the burden of paying for doctor visits and medicines to individuals today among the systems widespread failings is the erratic medicine practiced in small cities and the countryside a major concern of beijing which is increasingly sensitive to rural protests over the disproportionate prosperity of chinas big cities chinas legions of "barefoot doctors" were recruited under mao in the s and s to care for the often desperately overstrained workers relegated to the countryside during the cultural revolution local officials would appoint farmers as village doctors sending them to local hospitals for basic medical training even that meager education has fallen by the wayside so the government has ordered that all of chinas rural physicians earn a basic medical degree by mao qunan the spokesman for the ministry of health in beijing says the government recently acknowledged that that goal may be too ambitious "their skill level is not high " he says of the rural doctors "but we need them so we must train them " he says he is encouraged by the haoyisheng training programs progress haoyisheng com brings the training to the doctors who attend classes several times a week the curriculum which can result in a degree that satisfies the new government requirement is based on a series of prerecorded video lectures keyed to various situations that might crop up in the clinic the company monitors classroom attendance remotely from its office in beijing where the classes answers and attendance are transmitted by the internet in mile the fee for three years of classes is yuan about &# plus yuan for books haoyisheng receives about yuan per student from the government the company which has training programs in urban areas as well as short term courses on topics such as emergency medicine says it had a profit of &# million last year on revenue of &# million the setup is intentionally simple says mr gao who grew up in shanghai and moved to germany for a ph d in biochemistry from the university of munich mr engel says the focus of the program isnt complex medical education but "how to treat what walks in the front door " good doctor has shown promising results in a government study of students who took the courses compared with who studied in traditional classrooms at hospitals the rural doctors in the distance learning program outperformed their urban peers when asked to make a diagnosis answering correctly out of questions versus in the control group "it solves our problems " says yu huimei the head of rural health care at the bureau of health in mile a county seat in yunnan province that has rural doctors for about people "the most important thing is that its close to the place of work its also practical and cheap " in mile of the rural doctors are taking the course in classrooms in the county pu meilan a haoyisheng student admits that for years she didnt really know how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation adding that she would try pinching the persons cheeks to help the air flow to the lungs the course taught her how to tip the patients head back to help open the airway and let the oxygen come in "before we didnt even know the meaning of opening the airway " she says that lesson recently came in handy at about a m one night in march dr pu was awakened by the husband of a woman who had gone into labor approximately eight months into her pregnancy when the boy was born he wasnt crying and his skin had a bluish tint dr pu recalls she remembers family members in the room saying that the child had no chance to live dr pu tipped the babys head back to help open his airway and performed artificial breathing on the infant "the skin turned red and you could hear the heart beating " she says the boy survived despite the progress significant challenges remain there is no live doctor on hand to take questions and interact with students christiane horwood the deputy director of the centre for rural health in the university of kwazulu natal in durban south africa runs a distance learning program on aids intended mostly for nurses the health workers work with teachers using a videoconference but the distance learning without live interaction has had decidedly mixed results she says not having a teacher in the room is "never the same as sitting in the same room where people can see the students and respond to them" and makes the classes "quite stilted and difficult " dr horwood says "so my experience is it hasnt been very positive but at the end of the day you do get that information across " haoyisheng is hiring doctors to assess the students in person for a few days at the end of the course but mr gao says it is "very expensive " and not everyone is willing to participate in the course fan lijin the year old doctor who heads the health clinic in xisan township says that four of the doctors who serve the towns people are practicing without a license "sooner or later they will be dismissed " he says even licensed doctors balk at the time and money needed to complete the course yang jifeng a year old doctor in shanzhen village began practicing medicine in when she was years old "i think im too old to do that " she said during an interview at her home which doubles as an office and has a pigsty attached to the side "this is something for young people "
