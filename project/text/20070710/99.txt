tax increase on tobacco gains support in congress washington support appears to be growing in congress for increasing the federal tobacco tax as lawmakers look to raise funding for a popular childrens health insurance program in the senate top lawmakers are looking to add about &# billion of spending over five years to the state childrens health insurance program or s chip to do this they are discussing a significant boost in the federal tobacco tax perhaps as high as cents per pack of cigarettes tobacco taxes are seen by many lawmakers as a logical way to fund s chip which provides federal grants to states that provide health insurance to low income children supporters of the tax increase say it would reduce smoking and related health costs there also is a history of bipartisan support for funding health programs in this way utah sen orrin hatch one of the republicans most involved in recent s chip talks noted that tobacco taxes were used to fund the health program when it began a decade ago he has opposed another possible source of funding a cutback to the federal payments to the private health insurers that operate in medicare s chip is up for reauthorization this year and pay as you go budget rules require any new spending to be offset with tax increases or spending cuts it is unclear how broad senate support would be for such a large increase in tobacco taxes the current federal excise tax on cigarettes is cents a pack set in some senators are likely to oppose any increase and the tobacco industry has been lobbying hard against the idea but there also are plenty of supporters a coalition of health industry groups such as those representing hospitals and health insurers last month ran ads supporting such a tax boost if the senate relies only on tobacco taxes to fund s chip it would be a big win for these health industry groups because it would mean at least a temporary reprieve from cutbacks in the payments they receive from government programs such as medicare antitobacco groups also have been advocating a higher tobacco tax which also appears to be getting attention in the house recently the campaign for tobacco free kids presented to house democratic aides a survey it funded that showed substantial support even among smokers for raising tobacco taxes bill phelps a spokesman for altria group inc s philip morris usa called the idea "unfair" and said it would be inadequate to fund the childrens health program in the long run but huge issues remain in the s chip debate which will heat up this month in both the senate and house and will show the deep divisions between republicans and democrats on health care the bipartisan s chip plan being discussed by a small group of senators led by finance committee chairman max baucus a montana democrat and the panels ranking republican charles grassley of iowa appears designed to find a middle ground between the parties it would spend more than many republicans want but less than the &# billion many democrats have backed it would phase out coverage of adults without children who some states have been permitted to cover under s chip many republicans and a few democrats have said the program shouldnt cover these adults pregnant women are expected to remain eligible but senators have been discussing a lower federal match rate for states to cover parents in s chip democrats may win an effort to allow states to continue coverage of children with family income levels higher than the standard of the federal poverty level avoiding cuts to medicare advantage in which the government pays health insurers to cover medicare beneficiaries might win over senators from states where that program is popular however some democrats want to reduce funding to medicare advantage and may balk at giving up a chance to do so as part of the s chip bill house democrats who have a bigger margin of control in their chamber are likely to propose more spending than the senate on s chip as well as cuts to medicare advantage plans
