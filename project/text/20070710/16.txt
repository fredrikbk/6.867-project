business technology talking tech who wants to be millionaire snitch if you are a business you dont ever want a visit from the business software alliance the trade group that enforces software copyrights for its members last year more than companies were busted by the bsa for having illegal software and ended up paying fines averaging &# each last week the bsa announced it was raising to &# million the potential reward it offers to people who report software piracy the previous limit had been &# as jenny blank bsas senior director of enforcement explains q what is a typical case for you a i manage a team of five counsel and we also have two staff attorneys at any given time we probably have end user investigations open we will receive a report from somebody usually a current or former employee we will then do our own investigation of that report to make sure that its credible and then we will reach out to the company and invite them to cooperate with us once the investigation is concluded we have the basis for negotiations about a settlement if there is unlicensed software and then once the settlement is reached that is when the reward would come into play q how do you determine the amount of the fine a they really vary a really small company with a big problem is going to pay more than a big company with a tiny problem we look at the software that is unlicensed and we usually seek a settlement that is usually two or three times the price of the software thats less than what we think a court would award while still being a fair number of course there is a negotiation that takes place q is it true that companies who inadvertently have unlicensed software on their computers will also be fined even though they werent using pirated software on purpose a yes thats correct a company is responsible for whats on its computers and if it has unlicensed software it has to deal with the liability but thats why we have tools on our web site that we encourage companies to download so they can stay ahead of the problem q doesnt it seem cheesy to be encouraging people to rat on their employers a time has shown that you need to enforce copyrights if you are going to stop infringement and one of the ways we do that is when people tell us about unlicensed software used at their current or former employer companies should pay attention to what is on their computers so they never have to worry if someone is going to report them q since the fines you collect are kept by the bsa to fund its operations some say you have every incentive to go after big fines since they pay the rent a the only reasons those companies are paying damages is that they have illegal software the fact that it gets reinvested in bsa seems irrelevant to me q skeptics say youll never come close to giving out a &# million reward a we would look at the amount of the settlement and issue the appropriate reward for the person who originally called us weve given out &# since september in probably half of our settlements the caller either did not choose to receive the reward or we tried to contact them and couldnt the number is artificially low because of those two factors q do companies know who turned them in a its entirely confidential we will accept anonymous reports but there is less we can do with those than when we have contact information
