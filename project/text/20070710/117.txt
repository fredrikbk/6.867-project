what about muslim moderates islamist terrorism has led the american and british governments in the past month to launch separate public diplomacy programs aimed at engaging muslims at home and abroad a quick comparison shows the two initiatives are headed in opposite directions at least the brits have finally got it right the bush administration is building bridges to well funded and self publicized organizations that claim to speak for all muslims even though some of those groups espouse views inimical to american values and interests after years of pursuing similar strategies while seeing home based terrorists proliferate the blair brown government is now more discerning about which muslims it will partner with stating that "lip service for peace" is no longer sufficient the british are identifying and elevating those who are willing to take clear stands against terrorism and its supporting ideology thus in a major address at a two day government conference early last month titled "islam and muslims in the world today" then prime minister tony blair with gordon brown in attendance and hosting a reception vowed to correct an imbalance he stated that in britains muslim community unrepresentative but well funded groups are able to attract disproportionately large amounts of publicity while moderate voices go unheard and unpublished mr blair emphasized that islam is not a "monolithic faith " but one made up of a "rich pattern of diversity " the principal purpose of the conference mr blair stressed was to "let the authentic voices of islam in their various schools and manifestations speak for themselves " he was as good as his word invitations to participate in the assembly were extended to the less publicized moderate groups such as the sufi muslim council the british muslim foundation and minhaj ul quran notably absent from the program was the muslim council of britain a group that claims to represent that nations muslims but is preoccupied with its self described struggle against "islamophobia" a term it tries to use to shut down critical analysis of anything islamic whether legitimate or bigoted also dropped from the speaking roster was the leading european islamist tariq ramadan who while denied a visa by the united states has been a fixture at official conferences on muslims in europe the grandson of the founder of the muslim brotherhood mr ramadan is fuzzy on where he stands on specific acts of terror and he infamously evaded a challenge by nicolas sarkozy to denounce stoning mr blair committed funds to improve the teaching of islamic studies in british universities announced a new effort to develop "minimum standards" for imams in britain and most significantly declared that henceforth the government would be giving "priority in its support and funding decisions to those leadership organizations actively working to tackle violent extremism " routine but vague press releases against terrorism would no longer do a few days later british backbone was demonstrated again with the knighting of novelist salman rushdie since when irans mullahs pronounced one of his works "blasphemous " mr rushdie has lived under the shadow of a death threat the first fatwa with universal jurisdiction against a muslim living in the west with the news that britain would honor him extremist muslims rioted but many western muslim reformers increasingly threatened by death threats and murderous fatwas themselves cheered the brits ayaan hirsi ali a former dutch parliamentarian who was born a muslim in somalia wrote "the queen has honored the freedom of conscience and creativity cherished in the west " on the eve of his departure from office mr blair gave a television interview taking on those he once courted british islamists who have been quick to level charges of islamophobia and oppression against britain and the united states "the reason we are finding it hard to win this battle against terror is that were not actually fighting it properly were not actually standing up to these people and saying its not just your methods that are wrong your ideas are absurd nobody is oppressing you your sense of grievance isnt justified some of what is written on this is loopy loo in its extremism " contrast this with the bush administrations new approach on june president bush delivered his "muslim initiative" address at the washington islamic center in tribute to the th anniversary of that organizations founding by saudi arabia wahhabism is the state religion of saudi arabia and its extremist ideology often flows with the kingdoms money the islamic center is not an exception a few years ago when we were with freedom house concerned muslims brought us saudi educational material they collected from the washington islamic center that instructed muslims fundamentally to segregate themselves from other americans one such text stated "to be dissociated from the infidels is to hate them for their religion to leave them never to rely on them for support not to admire them to be on ones guard against them never to imitate them and to always oppose them in every way according to islamic law " though mr bushs remarks were intended for all american muslims the administration left the invitation list to washington islamic centers authorities predictably they excluded the truly moderate who are not saudi founded or funded the islamic supreme council of america the american islamic congress the american islamic forum for democracy the center for eurasian policy the center for islamic pluralism the islam and democracy project the institute for gulf affairs the center for democracy and human rights in saudi arabia and many others these organizations are frequently shut out of u s government events and appointments on the basis that they are considered insignificant or "controversial" by the petro dollar funded groups the administration makes a terrible mistake by making such wahhabi influenced institutions as the washington islamic center the gate keepers for all american muslims the actual substance of mr bushs mosque speech particularly good on religious freedom was overshadowed by the announcement of its single initiative america is to send an envoy to the organization of islamic conference based in jeddah saudi arabia the oic was created explicitly to promote hostility to israel and its meetings largely consist of ritualistic israel bashing at one last year irans president called for the "elimination of the zionist regime " it has no mechanism for discussing the human rights of its member states and thus has never spoken out against sudans genocide of darfuri muslims it is advancing an effort to universalize islamic blasphemy laws which are applied as often against speech critical of the governments of oic member states as against profanities last month the oic council of foreign ministers termed islamophobia "the worst form of terrorism " currently no western power holds either member or observer status at the oic the bush administration is now actively considering whether its public diplomacy should reach out to muslim brotherhood groups while such groups may pay lip service to peace they do not denounce terror by hamas a brotherhood offshoot it keeps as its motto "allah is our objective the prophet is our leader the koran is our law jihad is our way dying in the way of allah is our highest hope " by choosing those whose definition of terror does not include the murder of jews honor killings and lethal fatwas against muslim dissidents and reformers the u s government makes them look strong particularly in the shame and honor culture of the middle east and strengthens their hand against the real moderates and reformers great britain as we were reminded over the past week has much work ahead in defeating muslim terror as well as in overcoming the misguided form of multiculturalism of its recent past not all of britains measures will be right for america with our first amendment but the british labour party socialists appear to have done one major thing right that this american republican administration has not reach out to muslim leaders who are demonstrably moderate and share our values even though they may not have petrodollar funded publicity machines while we dont have a queen to dub knights americans do have distinct way of honoring our heroes mr president confer the medal of freedom on one of our own outstanding muslim american citizens for a selection of honorees look at who was not invited to your recent speech if islamists charge "islamophobia " repeat after tony "loopy loo loopy loo " mr woolsey co chair of the committee on the present danger was director of central intelligence ms shea is the director of the center for religious freedom of the hudson institute see related letter "letters to the editor fundamentalist muslims who reject all terrorism" wsj july
