health mailbox columnist tara parker pope answers readers questions q thank you for the article on the interpretation of the womens health initiative hormone research could you also please clarify the reporting of the whi calcium issue m m a many investigators from the &# million womens health initiative have been frustrated that the data the study generated about calcium use in postmenopausal women has been wrongly interpreted overall the study found no benefit to bone health in the calcium group compared with a placebo group among women studied this finding was the focus of most media reports on the study but many experts who have studied the whi data believe the findings are just the opposite of what was reported in the media the whi clearly showed that calcium boosts bone health if women take it regularly current guidelines recommend that women take milligrams of daily calcium heres why although the overall group didnt show benefit that has more to do with quirks in the study than whether calcium was really working the results were skewed by the fact that the study included women under who generally arent at risk for fractures many women in the placebo group were also taking calcium supplements on the side and by the end of the study only of the women were consistently taking the study pills all of these problems clouded the data but that makes the trends that emerged in certain groups even more impressive women over age in the calcium group were less likely to suffer a hip fracture than women in the placebo group among women who consistently took their study pills calcium use lowered hip fracture risk by and among all age groups and compliance levels women who werent taking calcium supplements before the study lowered their hip fracture risk by a hip fracture is a serious health concern that almost always requires surgery and can lead to permanent disability and even death the main side effect of calcium shown in the whi was a slightly higher risk for kidney stones
