the daily fix guerrero wins derby as mccovey looks on online edition none of the participants in baseballs annual home run derby yesterday rank among the top active players in career home runs alex rodriguez ken griffey jr and barry bonds all begged off the event yet it still provided some thrills especially in the second round when matt holliday albert pujols alex rios and eventual champ vladimir guerrero combined for home runs or two more than were hit in the opening round and anticlimactic final round combined none of the four semifinalists has more than home runs this season far short of a rods majors leading as was apparent yesterday from the pained expressions on players faces when they realized they were eliminated and from the rare patience at the plate from mr guerrero as he awaited his pitch the contestants really do care how they do "some players a lot of players in fact avoid the derby like its george mitchell with a subpoena and a little plastic cup " john donovan writes on si com "but the ones who compete in the derby actually compete if only because they dont want to embarrass themselves and come off looking like some twig swinging second baseman these guys care they care as much as they dare anyway " before the event espn coms jayson stark suggested five ways the derby could be improved including ideas to help ensure the biggest stars such as bonds dont skip the event among them is one that should be welcome to anyone who stuck around last night for all three hours of slugging shorten the event during those three hours mccovey cove beyond right field in at&amp t park saw just one significant splash a justin morneau homer in the first round that made all the planned media coverage of the ball seeking kayakers fizzle out san jose mercury news columnist mark purdy did better by catching up with the coves namesake former giants slugger willie mccovey "when the giants ballpark was constructed and the cove gained a name in honor of the big man with the big left handed swing it was hard to imagine how wonderfully everything would play out " mr purdy writes "mccovey was beloved in the bay area but nationally he tended to take a back seat to the great mays who is honored by a statue outside the parks main entrance so it made sense to give mccovey his own space happily the cove has become not just a space but a culture " of course as mr purdy acknowledges one unexpected outcome is that these days the cove may be more famous than the man in two cities news that the chicago white sox had re signed starting pitcher mark buehrle was greeted very differently "many of the announced crowd of at the cell listened sunday when public address announcer gene honda delivered the news in baritone that buehrle wasnt going anywhere " chicago tribune columnist rick morrissey writes "the sox had just beaten the twins and buehrle got a chance to tip his cap and soak in the love of the crowd this wasnt the yankees announcing that roger clemens was coming back in the annual rent a roger soap opera this was a year old fan favorite hoping for many more years with the club " but the baltimore suns peter schmuck frets that mr buehrles new four year &# million contract will only inflate the price of free agent pitchers for teams in need such as the hometown orioles "the orioles could spend the next few years rebalancing their minor league system to produce more position prospects only to find themselves strapped for pitching talent right when the whole thing is supposed to come together " mr schmuck writes with kansas city a leading contender to get the nashville predators or an expansion team joe posnanski looks back at the citys dubious nhl history the kansas city star columnist begins by explaining how the team came to be known as the scouts after the first attempt at a name "mo hawks" was mercifully set aside the real horror story begins with the expansion draft when the scouts were given slim pickings from nhl rosters "with the fifth pick the scouts took simon nolet pronounced see mon no lay in large part because they thought his name sounded good " mr posnanski writes "many of the players its obvious in retrospect were taken for their names butch deadmarsh lynn powis norm dube in one hockey history book the kansas city scouts are mentioned once and only once and that is to praise the name of defenseman bart crashley " in another retrospective on sporting futility football outsiders mike tanier reviews the baltimore colts who set the record for most points yielded in a season on their way to a record that should have been "with many dubious defensive records shattered the only thing left for the colts to do in week was sew up the first pick in the draft " mr tanier writes "as bad as they were the patriots were almost equally inept and they entered the final game with a record a colts win would knot their records but the colts owned the tiebreaker after all their only other win was the season opener against the patriots naturally the colts won the one game they probably should have lost a sloppy affair marked by numerous penalties and turnovers " three years later the colts played their home games in indianapolis heres a look at two recently completed sporting championships in europe alinghi beat team new zealand last week in a closely contested americas cup final "that victory was the closest in the year history of an event that has more history than any other major sports competition " christopher clarey writes in the international herald tribune the history rich event also has a quirk that allows the winner to define certain terms for the next go around "if the next event can live up to the excitement of the last it will be doing well " andrew longmore writes in londons sunday times "that is not necessarily what alinghi want the right of the defending team to create the rules of engagement for the next competition has been enshrined in the deed of gift for years and alinghi have no intention of sacrificing the natural advantage bequeathed them the danger for the wider popularity of the event is that the scoreline in the cup match will be and the rest of the world will reach for the off button " if roger federer tenniss world no could set the terms of engagement he might be tempted to declare all matches be played at wimbledon his thrilling victory there over rafael nadal on sunday was still garnering applause in the british dailies today and anticipation for future meetings "federer and nadal a shooting star of a rivalry a meteor burning out even as it passes across the summer sky " james lawton writes in the independent "dont believe it putting roger federer in a corner is the suspicion is strong here just another incitement to even more great deeds " the daily telegraphs sue mott also enjoyed the show "it was an exquisite climax to a wretched fortnight almost made comatose by cumulonimbus nothing happened day after day snatches of matches came on and off court federer went on a five day holiday nadal played a five day match neither moaned they arrived at their final ready champions do not stoop to excuses they played a man won a man lost and a damn fine match it was they were the history boys we were the audience and there was not a loser among us " later in her column ms mott pays tribute to the
