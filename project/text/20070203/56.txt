pursuits books out of europe how a prominent african refugee confronted islam then fled to the u s infidel by ayaan hirsi ali free press pages &# as a somalia born teenager living in nairobi kenya ayaan hirsi ali was puzzled by the inferior status of women in islam her father was a charismatic muslim intellectual with a degree from columbia university a leader of the somali opposition against the marxist dictatorship of siad barre her mother was a proud and pious woman despite her misgivings ayaan remained devout even joining the muslim brotherhood and cocooning herself in a black hijab one day in quran school she asked "what about the men shouldnt they cover " she got laughter in reply in at age ayaan was forced into marriage to a somali who lived in canada but had come to nairobi to find a bride rather than shutting down her nascent rebelliousness she turned it to her advantage she never made it to canada while staying in germany awaiting a visa and dreading the life that awaited her she decided to bolt she boarded a train for holland and freedom ayaan hirsi ali flourished in the netherlands official refugee status dutch classes a translators job citizenship in a degree in political science at leiden university researcher at the dutch labor partys think tank in she was elected to parliament in and wrote a film critical of islam and of violence against muslim women its director theo van gogh was ritually murdered by a dutch born islamist persistent death threats prompted her to move to the u s now ms hirsi ali is a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute in washington "infidel" is her lucid and captivating autobiography anecdotal and somewhat self conscious the book reads like a bildungsroman a coming of age novel except that a muslim girl from mogadishu was never supposed to develop a sense of "self" in the first place "infidel" is less about fulfilling a destiny than about finding an identity two key moments in ms hirsi alis life stand out one is her arrival in the west a moment she considers to be her "real birthday " on the day her husband shows up at the refugee camp in holland to claim his rights ms hirsi ali finds that she can say "no" to a man stronger than she is thanks to the protection of a democratic state a protection made visible in this case by the presence of dutch policemen she thus experienced an imperative that to most of us is a mere abstraction individual freedom needs the rule of law the second pivotal moment in her life ms hirsi ali says was the terrorist attack on the u s she understood what drove mohamed atta and his co hijackers she once shared their values and had known people like them in the muslim brotherhood "every devout muslim who aspired to practice genuine islam " she writes "even if they didnt actively support the attacks they must have at least approved of them " with ms hirsi alis religious doubts erupted into defiance of what she had known while growing up from that day onward ms hirsi ali became a public voice in the dutch post debates eloquently she made bruising sometimes inflammatory arguments islam was backward she said and needed its voltaire she declared that considered by modern standards the prophet was a "pervert" because he had married a year old girl elected an mp for the market oriented vvd party in she became a politician in the grand passionate style breaking with dutch habits of consensus and accommodation a nation of million people with a muslim minority of about one million mostly moroccan and turkish immigrants the netherlands was at the time and is still trapped by its carefully nurtured sense of tolerance and hospitality the trouble was that its newcomers did not necessarily embrace tolerance womens rights free speech and other core dutch values ms hirsi ali knew that she was courting danger by openly addressing such concerns nonetheless she pushed ahead and began working with director theo van gogh on "submission " the film about the mistreatment of muslim women when van gogh was murdered on nov the police found a knife stuck in his body the weapon was holding in place a letter threatening ms hirsi ali van goghs murder sent the dutch into bouts of rage and collective soul searching it was in a way the dutch equivalent of ms hirsi ali herself went into hiding for two months but she gradually re emerged on the national scene then last spring she was the principal figure in a controversy that brought down the government ms hirsi ali had won few friends on the left with her warnings about the self defeating nature of extreme multiculturalism so it was not a surprise last year when a notoriously liberal news program aired a documentary called "holy ayaan" that seemed intent on undermining her she had unjustly obtained refugee status and dutch citizenship the tv account said by providing false information on her citizenship application and exaggerating her childhood suffering in africa in "infidel " ms hirsi ali says that she was perplexed by the uproar that followed the documentary since she had already publicly admitted that fearful of being returned home she had not been entirely truthful on her application she had changed her birthdate and provided the name "hirsi ali " taken from her grandfather rather than "hirsi magan " from her father hoping the ruse would make it harder for her family to track her down "how could this be happening " she writes of the attacks on her "when i had so repeatedly told the truth about my real past " immigration minister rita verdonk in a race for her partys leadership could not afford to appear soft on such a matter after a brief investigation she announced that ms hirsi alis citizenship would be revoked infuriated by ms verdonks move against a sitting parliamentarian the junior coalition party quit the government prompting its fall and a new election ms verdonk soon relented but ms hirsi ali says in "infidel" that even before the turmoil over her citizenship broke out she had decided to resign from parliament and move to the u s perhaps that is why she is able to relate the episode with such equanimity in fact much of "infidel " despite the drama of its narrative has a tone of calm conviction rather than angry defiance still ms hirsi ali has not lost her urgent sense of mission she says that western countries should be proud of their values and stop "elevating cultures full of bigotry and hatred toward women to the stature of respectable alternative ways of life " westerners she adds do not "examine the religions or cultures of minorities too critically for fear of being called racist " as "infidel" makes clear ms hirsi ali plans to keep asking questions that many do not want to hear mr van middelaar a political philosopher worked until recently as parliamentary adviser of the dutch vvd party
