pursuits food &amp drink eating out in miami the bowls are truly super plates too our columnist finds inventive chefs shaping the centurys first great new cuisine miami every ceo worth his or her extravagant options package has landed his gulfstream here for the big game the star chefs from elsewhere whove parachuted into miami this season notably new york tall toque david bouley can count on these fat cats to spend like theres no tomorrow on foie gras and bubbly but the real food story here is that miami has after almost a century of pressure from tourists and immigration evolved its own way of eating its own culinary style and sophisticated new places run by local talent this miami style may be the only new american regional cuisine in our lifetime it combines local ingredients like conch and ethnic flavors from latin america cassava cilantro and the like with cutting edge european technique like all true regional american food styles it grew out of a collision between early settlers and the new conditions they encountered plus in the case of miami the growth after of a flourishing tropical community there is plenty of asia too but the result cant be dumped in the fusion ragbag where the parts so often fail to fuse here the components have been assimilated into a post ethnic urban style that expresses miami today you can taste it on the laid back patio of nemos by ordering grilled local black grouper thats served with shaved hearts of palm salad originally a seminole dish along with avocado blue crab and piquant argentine chimichurri sauce at the bilingual bar at michys michelle bernsteins neighborhood bistro where small plates of italian spanish and french classics pick up the spice and verve of the americas without fanfare or at the world class karu&amp y which opened in october near the new performing arts center its hard to generalize of course about local foodways in a resort area that simultaneously supports a basic seafood cuisine of fresh stone crabs and game fish as well as the heritage dishes of latin american settlers nuevo latino and fusion versions of those hispanic originals thats not to mention the giddier creations in the clubs and lounges of hip south beach but on recent visits to miami we found plenty to like in ambitious homegrown places lets start with casa tua the miami insiders choice for an italian dinner in miami beachs art deco district on a recent evening paul mccarthy the artist famous for creating a lifelike animatronic hog was eating cubanesque suckling pig on the elegant townhouses patio to his right the empress of local art collectors mera rubell was sharing a &# salt baked fish with a visiting new yorker big name chefs have been trying without success to transplant themselves here since the s the latest arrivals are mr bouley christian delouvrier formerly of alain ducasse at the essex house and govind armstrong of table in los angeles for an outsider mr bouley is giving miamians his excellent best his elaborately garnished foie gras may be the best ive tasted all year but i looked in vain for a local fish on the menu at evolution unless he can learn to love his new location and reach out to miamians evolution could go the way of la broche a great madrid restaurant that opened and closed here i will put my money such as it is on locally based purveyors of miami style food despite its marbled halls and venetian glass the real dazzle at karu is on the plate chef alberto cabrera a native miamian of cuban heritage produces elegantly intricate dishes that combine avant garde foams and "new" sashimi with ingredients you wont find at joes stone crab boniatos caribbean white sweet potatoes and mamey the unctuous tropical fruit this is miami cuisine at its most urbane mr cabrera confines his wilder ideas to the right hand side of karus large plates the legendary hawaiian fish opah appears on the left in overlapping square slices mostly pink like tuna but milder and lighter on the right is a little anthology of clever oddments raw opah doused in hot oil tiny sandwiches of pineapple confit and pillows of foamed coconut along with curried boniato and celery juice the main ingredient anchors the plate and the garnishes offer a witty descant if mr cabrera is playing the mighty wurlitzer at karu ms bernstein offers a chamber reduction of similar themes at michys tuna tartare baby conch from the turks and caicos served in the shell escargot style with garlic and butter despite the crowds and the bistroish bustle there is plenty of high ticket food starting with iranian caviar at &# an ounce this is a very popular place full of happy miamians served by an unflappably cheerful and efficient bilingual and bicultural staff you know this miami food style has conquered all levels of local life when you find a cuban sandwich at the outdoor cafe at the fairchild tropical botanic gardens anglified slightly as a "hammy miami " or on your way back to your cessna at the fort lauderdale hollywood airport you slip off the interstate at griffin road to rustic inn crabhouse a no frills mecca for oysters gator frogs legs and other florida seafood this fare isnt nearly as luxe as david bouleys cape cod cod with kumquat and parsley root puree but a doggie bag will help a jet blue flyer gut out a mealless trip home email me at eatingout wsj com
