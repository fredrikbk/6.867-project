pursuits entertainment &amp culture morgenstern on movies why were not dreaming dreamgirls wasnt snubbed memories of better musicals beat it in a year when oscar nominations have gone to an unusually worthy and diverse group of recipients the big surprise involves "dreamgirls " heavily promoted and widely praised the production received eight nominations more than any other in contention for the first time however a nominations leader failed to make the cut for best picture what happened how could such a fate have befallen a seeming shoo in no one knows why academy members vote as they do but ive been watching a couple of new dvds that put the matter in a useful usefully old perspective one of them is an elaborate reissue of "fiddler on the roof " norman jewisons classic some would say peerless screen version of the broadway musical the other is steve klovess long unavailable "the fabulous baker boys " a romantic drama with music about musicians both remind us of whats been lost as well as gained in the razzle dazzle of modern musicals when "fiddlers" hero the volcanic milkman tevye played by the israeli actor topol bursts out in song during the prologue his first three syllables speak volumes of the movie as a whole "tradition " by current standards the film is old fashioned broadway traditions are scrupulously observed even to the point of an intermission and not just an intermission but an entracte the pace is leisurely the story is spun out at great length and otherwise ordinary characters do their tuneful burstings when spoken words cant contain the intensity of their feelings but they arent really ordinary topols tevye may be a bit much for todays audiences hes overbearing self involved and legendarily dictatorial in that dreadful diane keaton comedy that opened friday one of the daughters says "its so fiddler on the roof your parents cant choose for you " like others in his village though tevye is struggling to reconcile his traditions with the changes that are swirling around him and the movie doesnt just peddle feelings its about religious persecution the strengths and constraints of cultural continuity radical politics shtetl life in prerevolutionary russia and the roots of americas immigrant experience "the fabulous baker boys" is more or less contemporary the movie was made in and as modest in scale as "fiddler" is ambitious instead of symphonic folklore think of intimate trio jazz the plot turns on an unconventional musical trio that becomes an equally unconventional dramatic triangle jeff and beau bridges play the musical brothers jack and frank baker and michelle pfeiffer is susie diamond the singer they hire to breathe new life into their two piano lounge act those of us who love the film which has retained a devoted following despite its home video vanishing act may best remember the spectacle of ms pfeiffer in a red dress singing "makin whoopie" as she does a sort of sexual pilates routine atop a nightclub piano how could we forget shes sensational her vocal range is modest but her acting of the song is flawless so too is her work in the earlier scene in which her singer auditions for the job while the set up is traditional its done to perfection susie comes in looking like a train wreck and instantly we know what the brothers cant guess that shell prove a revelation when she opens her mouth to sing the first syllables of a lovely old ballad "more than you know " shes almost inaudible slowly though she pulls us in with a voice that grows in volume as the song goes on but never becomes a big voice only a heartfelt and heart melting one as a case study in showmanship her delivery of that song is the polar opposite of what jennifer hudson does so powerfully well in "dreamgirls " ms hudson who hasnt pretended to be an actress is a child of her time a time when songs in musicals sometimes sound like nervous breakdowns and threaten to wail on forever when movie musicals are mostly about showbiz because that justifies characters bursting out in song when for the better "chicago " "moulin rouge" story and character are refracted into dazzling shards or for the worse "dreamgirls" the narrative fragments feel like a flimsy excuse to get from one big number to another "dreamgirls" has much to recommend it and the appropriate nominations to show for it but a shot at best picture i wonder if significant numbers of academy members came down where i did happy to sing the praises of the gorgeous production and its gifted performers but resistant to being blown away by every overblown song disappointed by the films stick figures and perfunctory plot and recalling with a sense of loss such artistic virtues as tact understatement narrative complexity and thematic substance maybe ive become without realizing it as much of a traditionalist as tevye but i miss movie musicals that explore worlds beyond the footlights and when susie diamond sings those songs in her come hither voice thither is where i want to go morgensterns picks when movies sing now that the golden era of movie musicals has passed nowithstanding the thoroughly modern virtuosity of "chicago" or "dreamgirls" the best sense of the genre is probably provided by the four disks of "thats entertainment " but here are three matchless scenes you wont find in the boxed set swing time when acolytes of movie musicals talk about the best of the best theyre apt to put "swing time" at or near the top of their list in that lustrous vehicle for fred astaire and ginger rogers the charmingly silly complications of the plot are swept away by one stunning number that draws heartache and hope from the music of jerome kern and the lyrics of dorothy fields its when fred who has just been told by ginger that shes going to marry someone else sings "never gonna dance " and then of course dances with her ardently and gloriously cabaret the horror of adolf hitlers rise to power is captured by a single song in bob fosses screen version of the kander and ebb broadway musical the song "tomorrow belongs to me " begins as a tune of sentimental sweetness sung by a bright eyed boy in a pleasant beer garden chorus by chorus however the boy transforms himself into a steely eyed hitler youth stalwart and his outwardly amiable listeners rise to their feet as a hate filled cohort heiling their fuhrer and asserting their dominion over germanys dark future topsy turvy mike leighs perfect musical may be hard to find but youll be rewarded for the effort the film purports to explain among many other delicious details how w s gilbert who is played by jim broadbent and arthur sullivan allan corduner brought "the mikado" into being all of the musical numbers are exquisite and all of the performances are superb my favorite in the large cast is shirley henderson but one scene gets at the essence of the creative process with almost surgical precision its when a sword falls on gilberts head
