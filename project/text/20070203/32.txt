hot topic the current depression the good economic news keeps rolling in yesterdays new jobs estimate for january at was below wall street expectations but it was accompanied by upward revisions of jobs for the prior two months those revisions brought the monthly average up to new jobs or million for the year readers will recall that the current expansion was derided right through as a "jobless recovery " we now know the economy has created million new jobs since mid as revisions by the bureau of labor statistics have added hundreds of thousands to its original monthly estimates thus the hand wringers have had no choice but to move on turning their laments to allegedly "stagnant wages " well thats now vanishing too lets look at the record of this expansion compared with that of the sainted s economist michael darda has been looking at the numbers and yesterday he put out a side by side employment comparison of the first five years of the expansion with the current one that began in the fourth quarter of between and the unemployment rate averaged compared with from to todays jobless rate is now down to as for real inflation adjusted wage growth it averaged annually for non farm workers in the first half of the s compared with a year so far in this decade "this cycle as a whole has witnessed twice the average real wage growth than the first months of the previous expansion " mr darda writes for the last months real wages have risen even faster at a clip anything else to worry about well theres always the "trade deficit " though exports are now booming up last year especially to the countries with which the u s has signed free trade agreements so moving right along this weeks bad news is said to be the u s "savings rate " which according to the official measure was "negative" for a whole calendar year for the first time "since the great depression " as martin crutsinger of the associated press helpfully put it hooverville here we come as a statistic however the official "savings rate" is nearly as useless a guide to prosperity as the trade deficit in the government accounts what is called the savings rate is literally income less consumption but the government defines income too narrowly and consumption broadly for example "income" doesnt measure capital gains whether realized or not the rising value of your home or even increases in your retirement accounts think about how you calculate your own personal "savings rate " do you merely add up what you make in salary in a year minus what you spend or do you sneak a peak at whether your ira increased in value or check the sale price your neighbor got on his home to figure out what you might be able to get for yours by any normal definition "savings" should include your increase in total assets in other words your gains in overall wealth for our part these columns long ago began to watch a far more instructive figure known as "household net worth " that number released by the federal reserve includes all assets tangible and financial held by individuals less their liabilities mortgage and other debt at the end of last years third quarter u s household net worth had climbed to &# trillion that was an increase of more than &# trillion over the previous four quarters rest assured thats a much higher figure than during "the great depression " ap notwithstanding none of this means we should be complacent about economic growth there are two genuine clouds on the horizon namely inflation risk and political risk inflation remains somewhat higher than is comfortable and we still expect the fed will consider further interest rate hikes if todays weak dollar and soaring commodity prices lead to a jump in the official inflation indicators later this year as for politics the democrats now running congress explicitly reject the tax cuts and freer trade that have helped to propel the current prosperity if history is any guide sooner or later this is a recipe for trouble
