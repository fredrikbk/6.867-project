encore a special report talking the talk want to learn a foreign language take a look at these software programs katie dabney a year old semiretired silversmith in solvang calif loves to travel and she has always wanted to speak spanish as a teenager she tried phrase books later she took classes but found the group pace too slow more recently she experimented with language instruction tapes but gave up after four sets of cassettes proved ineffective then last year ms dabney began using language instruction software for the first time less than six months later she was comfortably chatting in spanish with her south american horse riding instructor "this is way easier " ms dabney says of the rosetta stone software shes been using from fairfield language technologies inc "you can hear it read it write it you can learn in so many ways " if learning another language is a sticking point on your list of new years resolutions computer technology is making self instruction more plausible and enjoyable there are a number of software programs that can help you study dozens of languages we decided to see how several of these products stacked up after checking with people in the instructional software market we settled on rosetta stone from fairfield based in harrisonburg va as well as programs from transparent language inc nashua n h and frances auralog sa both of which boast a wide variety of languages and clients after choosing the programs we set out to test each one on three tasks freshening up on a language weve studied before italian in our case learning a language from scratch dutch and learning a language that uses a non roman alphabet we picked russian another refresher language for us with its cyrillic alphabet all three companies have software in italian and dutch russian is not available from auralog of course the tough part of learning a language is setting aside regular time for practice even if study time is brief languages are best learned by studying every day or at least every other day all three of the programs we tested offer instruction in small chunks so its easy to get in and out of lessons in minutes or less auralog if you enjoy being well organized auralogs tell me more software may appeal to you theres a day planner feature for example that sets how many hours you want to devote to study each day and at any point in your studies you can view charts that plot your progress in grammar written or oral comprehension to get started you choose from one of three approaches "free to roam " where you select what to study from a variety of activities such as pronunciation or vocabulary "guided mode " where you set objectives in oral comprehension speaking reading or writing and the software adjusts the levels of difficulty and "dynamic mode " where the software tracks your progress and adjusts exercises to match your performance you can start in a different mode each day or change modes at any time there is a grammar section where you can read up on basics such as verb conjugations but most of the software is made up of short reading writing comprehension and speaking exercises in dialogue exercises for example you listen as narrators pose questions that are also written on the screen you try to choose the correct response from the displayed options in a picture word association exercise you might see a photo of skiers and click on inverno for winter rather than primavera or autunno other exercises such as "key vocabulary " which has one column with english words and a second with the italian translations take more of a phrase book approach to learning one unique feature while all three programs we tested featured audio and speaking exercises auralog is the only company that includes a headset microphone combo with its software for the others you can either buy your own headset mike or use the microphone on your computer if you plan to do the speaking exercises tell me more like transparent and rosetta records your responses to various exercises and then evaluates your pronunciation in graphs that chart variables such as the rise and fall of your voice and emphasis on certain syllables tell me more does have some minor interface oddities for instance it marks some written answers as wrong if you put too many spaces between words this can lead to frustration as we couldnt understand at first why some correct responses had been marked wrong the software also doesnt always advance automatically to the next question after youve answered the current one transparent for each language transparent offers three separate software packages with a range of features theres a lot of material to be sure but its value is inconsistent the most basic of the packages "before you know it " shows you on screen flashcards for hundreds of words and phrases arranged by topics such as "fruit" and "going to the bank" you can use the flashcards in a variety of ways such as viewing them in italian and typing the english translation or the reverse you can add vocabulary words of your choosing which is great and you can download audio versions of the flashcards to a portable music player or the flashcards themselves to a personal digital assistant another nice touch "say it in" and "learn language now" are transparents more full featured programs the welcome screen for "say it in" lists which of the lessons and three quizzes youve completed each time you log on this is one feature meant to offer a more structured approach than the more free form "learn language now " but its easy to feel lost when you actually open a lesson and see transparents patchwork of buttons and boxes on your computer screen the largest box shows the main text of the lesson and then there are boxes for listing grammar notes personal notes phrase meaning word meaning the root word and so on you can collapse and expand the boxes but the visual clutter can result in a feeling of "what do i do next " we were never sure should we play the audio so a narrator reads the lesson or click on the microphone icon to practice speaking or click on the games icon to try a crossword the same look and feel carries into "learn language now " which starts by offering you two main sections reference tools where you can read grammar rules and learn the alphabet and the immersion environment in the latter you choose from five tabs theater which sometimes has video but sometimes only text reading you can read a transcript or have it read to you activities jumbles crosswords and such pronunciation your speaking is charted and scored and conversation you play the part of different people engaged in conversation on the video these two main programs can give you a sense that youre exercising in a maze you may be burning calories by walking but you arent sure where youre going or where youve been that said one big plus for transparent is the softwares approach to teaching the cyrillic alphabet used in russian and other east european and asian languages the "introduction to the russian alphabet " found in the flashcard applications alphabet exploder has text and audio lessons about each letter breaking them down into groups showing for example which ones correspond to roman letters with the same sound which ones look like roman letters but sound different and which are not like any roman letter fairfield the feature that sets fairfields rosetta stone software apart from both transparent and auralog is its visual approach teaching almost exclusively with pictures instead of reading lists of foreign words and their english equivalents you study photographs and their connected foreign phrases studying in this manner is intended to mimic the way children absorb a language picking up words and phrases through daily experiences rather than sitting in a classroom lessons are comfortingly similar each of five activities listening reading listening and reading combined speaking and writing is taught through implied questions based on a quadrant of photos rosetta starts slowly with nouns using photos of a girl a boy a dog and a cat for example at first youre asked to identify them later youll be asked to name and spell them photos of horses jumping and children running teach verb conjugations while photos of a woman in a car and a boy sitting on a table teach prepositions we were frequently pleased at how much we understood and remembered when trying to learn dutch it seemed improbable at first that we would ever learn to spell dutch words properly to the american ear for example the word for airplane sounds like "vleexxtaarr " and yet without any tedious memorization tricks we had no trouble mastering the correct vliegtuig spelling our retention and comprehension levels were impressive especially considering that or perhaps because we never saw or heard english anywhere several tests measured our progress at the end of each lesson level in four of the five activities speaking is the only exception our least favorite part of rosetta was the section that graded us on our speaking skills rosetta records your voice as you say what is represented in each photo in addition to charts that evaluate pitch emphasis and form high and low sounds a meter with red yellow and green zones indicates your overall score but we were never able to budge past the red zone meaning either that we spoke horrible dutch italian and russian or that the meter is hypersensitive were picking hypersensitive given that we have spoken two of the three languages for years and that we tested well for pronunciation in auralog and in transparent a spokeswoman for rosetta when told about our problem replied in an email that the company has received positive feedback from customers about the speaking skills section "it takes considerable ear training to hear all of the new sounds" in a language she wrote but for us rosettas speaking section was pointless also in the writing exercises we didnt like rosettas single option for a standard russian keyboard layout we preferred transparents option to toggle to a transliterated layout in which for example the russian letter that sounds like v but looks different maps to the v key on an american keyboard still rosetta was our favorite software by a wide margin because of its design you always know what to do next what youve already done and how well or not well if you believe the pronunciation meter youve done it we also like how rosetta breaks from traditional language instruction techniques for the best
