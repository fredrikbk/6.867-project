pursuits travel asia the forgotten china struggling in the mainlands shadow taiwan tries carving out a new identity taipei taiwan the waitress brings two big bowls to the table empty except for a dense round flat bread at the bottom of each tear up the bread into tiny pieces she instructs us then the bowls reappear filled with soup one lamb the second beef with cubes of congealed duck blood the bits of bread have puffed up into little pearls that taste like barley these dishes unlike anything ive ever tasted in a chinese restaurant despite two decades of eating in asia for pleasure and for work are from shaanxi province in central china but im in a restaurant a thousand miles away on the island of taiwan taipei taiwans capital of around three million offers a virtual tour of the provincial cuisines of china a reflection of the diversity of the chinese who fled to taiwan in when the communists took control of china taiwan is the other china increasingly lost in the shadow of mainland chinas expanding global influence for years taiwan defined itself as "free china " the democratic counterpoint to its communist neighbor but as china liberalizes and increases economic ties with the west the contrast isnt quite as sharp to carve out its own identity taiwan is increasingly highlighting its aboriginal culture and promoting the islands natural features in addition to its more traditional chinese cultural attractions its also resulting in a more open attitude taiwan is the worlds first chinese society that has turned into a vigorous freewheeling democracy its a source of tremendous pride for taiwanese a pride that translates into a friendliness and helpfulness toward foreigners the hospitality i encountered almost daily in taiwan is something ive almost never seen in hong kong or china unlike china taiwan doesnt suppress religion and taoism buddhism and confucianism have long flourished the result is a richness and depth of chinese culture unmatched on the mainland at a taoist temple i visited in the southern city of tainan for instance students write details of upcoming examinations on pink slips of paper and deposit them on the altar praying to the deities for good grades despite the opening two years ago of taipei the worlds tallest building taiwan isnt on the map for most tourists last year for instance a relative trickle of american tourists visited taiwan thirteen times as many americans more than one million went to hong kong alone "were the best kept secret in asia " a tourism official says ruefully the sparse visitor statistics belie the variety of attractions that taiwan offers the countryside is breathtaking with spectacular mountains gorges and fast flowing rivers a high speed train inaugurated just last month reduces travel time to the second city kaohsiung from four hours to minutes making the entire west coast an easy day trip from taipei at the end of last year the national palace museum also reopened after an extensive interior renovation what is one of the worlds best collections of chinese art can now be viewed in a much more pleasant environment another attraction is the infectious impact of democracy when i walked out of the national palace museum for instance a large group of falun dafa also known as falun gong members a movement that cant be mentioned much less practiced in china were holding a demonstration on the front steps there is one major drawback to taiwan and thats a general lack of proficiency in english while english is spoken in hotels railway stations and other tourist centers and while subway and street signs are in roman as well as chinese lettering youll need a good tourist dictionary to order food and get around outside of taipei its a real problem because despite the fact that the taiwanese are so approachable and so friendly to foreigners you wont be able to engage many people in conversations no translation is needed to revel in the spirit of the worlds first true chinese democracy in the three decades since the death of taiwans dictator chiang kai shek china has become much more of a threat to taiwan pointing missiles at the island and making thinly veiled threats about running out of patience for reunification in turn taiwans governing democratic progressive party has periodically threatened to turn de facto independence into a more formal independence it can be surprising how little some in taiwan talk about china many taiwanese who reject chinas territorial claims still do business with chinese companies or have investments there "we talk about good food not reunification " says tsou min huai a young government official "who can predict the future " mr tsou attributes the absence of discussion to a fatalism bred from years of japanese occupation until just after world war ii followed by years of dictatorship as china becomes more of a focal point for both business and tourism in asia taiwan is responding to this challenge by loosening restrictions instead of tightening them when i first visited taiwan in i had to undergo two hours of interrogation at the airport and even western residents chose their words carefully when talking about politics this time i was whisked through immigration and customs without a question asked and no taiwanese i spoke to hesitated to denounce either the independence leaning government or its opposition the renovations at the national palace museum exemplify this new spirit the bulk of its collection was brought from china by chiang kai sheks forces after world war ii and the formality of the museum symbolically represented the last vestige of the old guard which ruled taiwan with an iron fist now the museum has shifted gears bringing itself into the modern era it has been opened up with a grand staircase and better lighting the opening exhibit is a knockout alone meriting a visit to taiwan on display through march are invaluable rare paintings from the northern sung dynasty which dates from to most of them are so fragile theyre hardly ever shown in addition the museum has put together an exhibition of ju ware from the sung dynasty prized for their brilliant craftsmanship and unique blue green glaze theyre among the most valuable ceramics ever to come out of china of the ju pieces known to exist today the museum owns and theyre on display along with others borrowed from museums around the world taiwan is more than museums and food theres the impressively scenic taroko gorge in the east the historic temples of tainan in the south and the quaint mountain village of jiufen a one hour train and taxi ride from the capital if youre surprised at the friendliness of the people of taipei wait until you see the rest of the island at a tea shop in
