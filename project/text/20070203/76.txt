pursuits style valentines day gifts he shops she shops actions speak louder than baubles instead try helicopter tours or tango lessons say our columnists buying for her by alan murray valentines day gifts are filled with peril any other day of the year an ugly sweater or a cheap looking pair of earrings is just further evidence of your poorly developed shopping skills on valentines day it becomes a "symbol of our relationship " get it wrong and it may be your last "experience" gifts only heighten the risk quality control is difficult a hot air balloon ride may sound like a romantic journey but what if the weather turns bad or if your pilot tells off color jokes those baskets can be really small no wonder so many guys stick to red roses godiva chocolates and tiffany baubles still in the spirit of adventure my colleague laura landro and i have decided this year to abandon the material world and look for the perfect experience the good news is that there are now a number of web sites that can help including xperiencedays com cloudliving com excitations com and signaturedays com before we dive in though a few words of caution remember that you want this to be the perfect experience for her not you renting a ferrari spider for the day may sound like bliss but will she take it the same way same goes for bungee jumping fearing where i might go with this laura sent me a warning email that read "hint nothing that involves anything rustic " so much for bull riding school check it out first buying a diamond on the web is one thing buying the time of your life is something else before i commit myself to a dinner cruise for valentines day i want to see the boat the menu and maybe even check out the crowd heres my hit list for womens gifts this valentines day and lauras responses dance lesson for two even if its not your thing shell love this one xperience days offers this in new york for &# with dance styles ranging from the viennese waltz to the west coast swing to the tango also available in san francisco and philadelphia laura landro responds i love this idea but its a gamble if your loved one is a natural klutz i can get out there and shake it with the best of them in freestyle boogie mode but when ive tried to learn real dance steps i trip over myself and my partner my mother who can do a mean fox trot has tried to teach me at weddings without success my husband who knows all the right moves says i always try to lead im ready for professional intervention helicopter tour ive always wanted to do the tour of manhattan and the rotor noise makes it harder to hear the pilots bad jokes signature days cloud and xperience days all offer this option starting at &# per person in boston you can get a helicopter tour of old lighthouses in san diego you can cruise the coastline and from sedona ariz you can tour the red rock canyons laura when i told alan i didnt want anything rustic i also meant i didnt want anything dangerous the last time i got in a tourist helicopter was a ride eight years ago over active volcanoes on the big island in hawaii as our pilot swooped down to hover over a gaping crater full of red molten lava i swore if i made it out of there alive id never do this again seriously check the record of the tour operator if you dont want to risk your life while helicopter accident rates have declined in recent years they are still higher than overall aviation accident rates spa for her sometimes the best way to show you care is to give her a day away a day at the spa for her is a nice gift with a wide range of options and prices laura i will always accept a spa gift with pleasure as long as alan follows his own advice check it out first nothing is less pleasant than a spa that isnt spic and span and im leery of new age places that scrub you down with grape pips silt or dead sea black mud and no co ed communal steam rooms lobster fest if you are within reach of fedex you can have live lobsters delivered to you year round with clams corn chowder with a big pot to prepare it all all you need to complete the feast is a stove or fire for cooking its a great way to bring back a bit of summer in the middle of winter try lobstertogo com or mainelobsterdirect com laura i have to admit im skeptical are they still alive fresh and kicking after a long flight in a cargo hold come to think of it hold the lobsters i never liked the whole throw them alive into the pot routine anyway and this still means i have to cook and clean up right just take me to a local lobster shanty dinner at home not going out can often be the most romantic experience in washington cloud living will come into your home and prepare a gourmet meal with matched wines the price is stiff &# for three courses but you avoid the uncontrolled distractions of a crowded restaurant and the uncertain result of cooking yourself signature days offers something similar for &# in most major cities or check with your favorite local caterer to see what they can provide laura now youre talking i dont have to cook i dont have to clean up and we dont have to drive home and it wouldnt hurt to end the evening with a little bauble floating at the bottom of a champagne glass buying for him by laura landro for most women a romantic evening with a little bling some bubbly and a bouquet of long stemmed roses is the only valentines day experience we really want our biggest fear is a gift that is really more about an experience hed like to have such as a couple of tickets to the playoffs or a camping trip in the backcountry on the other hand since many experience gifts benefit the giver as well this valentines day my list includes gifts that will teach him a skill i can enjoy such as a cooking class enable me to accompany him somewhere i really want to go that rolling stones concert hed never get the tickets for and provide him with services that will spiff up his grooming golf game or general appearance worst case scenario he rejects some of my gifts after ive already paid for them but i can always use that spa certificate to get myself a facial here are my picks and what my colleague alan murray has to say about them a personal concierge by the time hes thought to make a reservation for the hot new restaurant or club get tickets to a play or buy me that bauble for valentines day its probably too late concierge services offer to take care of it for him quintessentially quintessentially com based in london with offices in new york and elsewhere around the globe offers memberships starting at &# a year and can get last minute reservations at hot spots hard to get tickets and entry to private clubs less pricey services such as yourpersonalbutler com and finiconcierge com that charge by the hour for errands like shopping and picking up your dry cleaning to find one near you try the international concierge and errand association iceaweb org alan murray responds ive never had a concierge or a "personal butler " and fear id make poor use of it i think id rather pick up my own dry cleaning and have a weekend away instead cooking classes he may be a whiz at the grill but how about sharpening his culinary skills and making him feel like the iron chef in the process local groups offer gift certificates try oakland calif s compassionate cooks compassionatecooks com culinary schools typically offer adult classes such as the new york institute of culinary educations four session "techniques of asian cooking" for &# for a real splurge the schools "camp bbq" trips to north carolina texas or tennessee include an old fashioned pig pickin and barbecue tips from famous rib masters &# double occupancy not including airfare alan this is a great idea and i accept id particularly like to know how to make my own north carolina style pulled pork barbecue since thats in short supply in my hometown of greenwich conn the problem with this experiment is someone will have to eat what i cook my daughters generally refuse any food prepared by me flexible concert tickets my husband loves the symphony but we stopped buying season tickets because our hectic schedules made it difficult to commit to concerts months in advance now more concert halls are offering flexpass tickets that can be redeemed for any weekday concert subject to availability the new york philharmonic offers gift certificates redeemable for any of its concerts in avery fisher hall the pittsburgh symphony offers gift certificates in flex coupon books redeemable for eight tickets to any mellon grand classics or pnc pittsburgh symphony pops concert &# for eight coupons and of course he has to take you to dinner afterward alan im with laura season tickets are a scheduling nightmare flexpass is a much more attractive option pampering though men seem to have a general aversion to spa treatments other than a massage the pedicure is the one treatment men are least likely to book for themselves and most in need of more spas are luring men to the pedicure chair with private rooms vibrating seats that massage the back and "sports pedicures" that use bracing scrubs and exfoliating tools to sand down and soften years of calluses and gnarly nails depending on the salon prices can range from &# to &# alan leave my feet alone youll never catch me doing this no matter how much you think i need it golf lessons even the most experienced golfer thinks he can gain an extra edge with a lesson if he hasnt ever picked up the game but needs a new pastime its not a bad sport to take up and its something you can do together you dont have to belong to a golf club or even leave town to learn the basics drive driveclubs com in lower manhattan offers simulated courses in a vast second floor square foot space with a putting green &# to &# for private lessons alan golf lessons are a good idea but dont expect them to make this game any less frustrating a spin in a luxury car ok he wants a ride in a ferrari spider make it happen car clubs that let members share the use of vintage classic cars or new high end autos have sprung up in recent years the classic car club in manhattan asks a &# fee for insurance and other costs
