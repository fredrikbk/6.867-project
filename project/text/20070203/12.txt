cross country arkansas underdog little rock ark once upon a pre clinton time the announcement by the former arkansas governor mike huckabee that hes running for president would have been stop the presses news in these latitudes and while its still front page above the fold stuff arkansas has been there done that and is doing it again these days we seem to grow presidential candidates as bountifully as we do tomatoes and watermelons hillary clintons in the race right officially now we mean shes said to have been a first lady of this state way back when also former nato commander wesley clark now of little rock ark ran for president last time out and far as we know hasnt ruled out a reprise in now theres mike huckabee of hope ark ring a bell hes just the latest to put arkansas on the political map or rather to keep it there back when bill clinton was still largely an unknown can you imagine and arkansas chic still all the rage circa ish vernon jordan pronounced this small wonderful state the political capital of the universe he had no idea so does mike huckabee have a chance he was a republican governor of this largely one party democratic state for a decade so hes used to battling long odds now hes launched a longshot presidential campaign it may not last till spring if his first week on the campaign trail is any indication instead of toughening up for the road ahead our thin skinned former governor peeled off yet another layer of epidermis "the huck" followed up his sunday morning presidential announcement on "meet the press" by meeting the press back here in arkansas after giving a perfectly proper speech at the states republican party headquarters he immediately tore into the local press as is his wont this time he was sore about a series of hotly debated stories in the arkansas democrat gazette about the destruction of a computer hard drive and his depleting an emergency fund during his final days in office he couldnt just criticize them lyin newspapers and be done with it he had to go on to compare a reporter for the democrat gazette to janet cooke and jayson blair goodness lend this man a little perspective he tends to be about two quarts high on hyperbole ms cooke and mr blair are the evil twins of reckless fabricating plagiarizing journalism the worst of the worst thats a pretty serious charge or rather it would be if anybody around here could take it seriously but we werent surprised any more than we would be by a splendid piece of oratory from the same source mike huckabee at times can be the most elevating of speakers we still havent come down from his speech welcoming the little rock nine back to central high on the th anniversary of the crisis there or his steadfast yet gracious performance july that was the long long day when his predecessor jim guy tucker convicted for conspiracy and mail fraud in connection with the whitewater investigation at first refused to be pried out of the governors office but too many other times brother huckabee just likes to wallow in the old invective and the pettier his complaint the longer he wallows the man spent most of a fine administration snubbing the arkansas times a free weekly tabloid that of course just loved all the attention he actually had the little weekly removed from the list of publications that got his public schedule petty to say the least now he launches his presidential campaign by throwing some mud at a reporter for the democrat gazette how does he suppose that kind of thing will play in peoria or poughkeepsie and coming from a dark horse presidential candidate out to charm the national press how would it play along the new york washington media axis if he keeps it up how long before the cable news promos are asking "mike huckabee legit longshot or loose cannon " the hucks tendency to go into vendetta mode violates the first rule of smart politics and public discourse in general never get into a fight with someone whos not as well known as you are it bumps up their status and lowers yours mr huckabee needs to learn to cut down the big trees not mess with the little saplings besides being unworthy of him personally it wastes all his high powered rhetoric if this candidate isnt more careful a nickname like gov petty may stick to him the way slick willie did to another presidential hopeful from arkansas what a pity that would be he has a lot of potential as a presidential candidate and a record of accomplishment here in arkansas from getting health care to kids whose families couldnt afford it to fixing our interstate highways hes been willing to take on the educational establishment in order to improve our schools and early on he finally simplified this states once byzantine requirements for something as basic as renewing your car tags does he stand a chance nationally candidate huckabee said it himself the american people love an underdog its hardly an original thought but hes spot on we the people love the up from nothin kid the outta nowhere man the longshot who catches the favorite at the wire we love the underdog that is right up until the moment he makes a slip and reminds everybody why he was a longshot in the first place one of mike huckabees republican rivals in this campaign mitt romney had a father who ran for president too briefly george romney broke from the gate with a rush in another presidential campaign just getting under way during an increasingly unpopular war then he let it slip that hed been "brainwashed" about vietnam some of us had thought george romney might get a little credit for that kind of humility and candor naturally he didnt the guy was an ex presidential candidate as soon as hed spit out just a couple of syllables brainwashed so long underdog mike huckabees campaign will be history soon too unless he learns to cool it which may not be possible for the huck given his showmans personality and rhetorical impulses the man is a baptist preacher and former radio broadcaster who may secretly yearn to be a stand up comic he cant pass up an opportunity to say something that sounds clever at the time but then comes back to haunt him on tim russerts show our advice be careful out there brother huckabee your presidential campaign is one careless wisecrack from being over mr greenberg is editorial page editor of the arkansas democrat gazette where mr webb is assistant editorial page editor
