lifestyle a fish story for our type a angler a good coach and lots of practice worked miracles i know fishing is supposed to require patience but mine was being sorely tried my wife and i had moved to vero beach fla and settled into a house on a cove off the indian river so at least in part i could try to resurrect my long unused fishing skills i bought an underpowered little shallow water skiff new rods and reels an assortment of lures and even a collection of charts that were supposed to reveal the "hot spots " yet after a year of flailing the waters within a few miles or so of our house all i had to show for the effort was a few tasty sea trout and lots of trash fish finally it dawned on me just as athletes and an increasing number of executives seek outside instruction i needed a coach talking about fishing with friends and neighbors wasnt enough i didnt need someone to tell me what to do i needed someone to show me what to do i needed an expert guide one who was willing to teach me techniques and locations not just take me fishing thats when i signed on for a guided trip with captain joe ward a burly ex fireman who had grown up in the area and had fished the indian river since boyhood he even had his own one minute daily fishing report on a local radio station i told captain ward i was interested in learning where and how to fish within a few miles of my own dock my anemic little skiff was too slow to roam farther afield he said he knew the area well and could show me a dozen spots he even agreed to let me bring my handheld global positioning system to mark some favored locations the upshot since that day of guided fishing with captain ward ive kept the freezer loaded with sea trout snook redfish and flounder the &# for that trip was a better investment in fishing success than all the rods reels and lures ive ever bought to hear the statistics there are millions of americans who enjoy fishing among the plus crowd in particular its now the sixth most popular athletic activity right after golf according to the sporting goods manufacturers association but based on my observations in and around vero beach most people dont do it very well for type b fishermen it may be enough to hang out on the water with a line dangling over the side of the dock or boat for them fishing doesnt have to be catching but for the type a fisherman i count myself among them for better or worse fishing that isnt catching isnt fun its frustrating i know a dozen or so neighbors whose expensive offshore sport fishing boats or fast little flats boats sit forlornly at the dock day in and day out simply because the frustration became too much it doesnt have to be that way just as with athletes a good coach and lots of practice can work miracles gaining skills as a fisherman begins with a simple maxim fisherman know thyself how skilled are you what kind of fishing do you really want to do how much time and effort are you willing to devote to it when i first moved to vero beach i wanted to do it all i wanted to snag the tasty fish that make the river their home as well as the big pelagic predators that swim off the florida coast not only did i have my shallow water skiff but also a foot power boat that i could take miles offshore looking for mackerel grouper and snapper the result i did neither very well after my trip with captain ward i focused more attention on river fishing for two reasons its cheaper and its more convenient fuel for a horsepower outboard costs a few dollars for a trip about the same amount as bait fuel for a horsepower engine costs many multiples of the bait and while i could be on the water fishing in minutes in my skiff the trip offshore and back meant i had to devote most of the day to a fishing expedition i also could fish the river even when the wind was kicking up a dangerous swell offshore when it became evident that i needed to concentrate on one fishing form or the other i sold both the skiff and the offshore boat and bought a foot flats boat with a horsepower engine that was far faster and more comfortable than the little skiff once you know what kind of fishing you want to do finding a guide becomes a much more focused search but it cant be done in the yellow pages it has to be the result of word of mouth you want someone who not only knows what theyre doing but is willing to share that information in a friendly way if youre new to an area as i was when i arrived in vero beach make it a point to spread your bait and tackle shopping around all the shops within reasonable driving range if the owner or counter clerk is a qualified guide with a coast guard captains license youll figure out in a few visits whether this person is friendly and open enough to teach you something about fishing if the store is just a place where guides pick up bait on the way to meet their clients youll have to be there early to cross paths and strike up a conversation fishermen who have been around an area for years may not have used guides they grew up learning the techniques and locations but theyll know the reputations of many of the local guides and they usually are willing to share their candid opinions or gossip theyve heard after youve narrowed down a list of guides to two or three make it a point to meet them at the dock when theyre returning from a charter that gives you a chance to see how successful they were and to scope out their boat and equipment dont be surprised if the boat isnt the snazziest craft at the dock guides know that a boat built to fish and a boat built to impress seldom are the same thing ask if the guide has a few minutes to chat about a charter emphasize that youre more interested in learning how and where to fish for a specific species than in actually catching a lot of fish most guides know reliable spots where clients find some kind of fish usually trash fish on the indian river ladyfish and jack crevalle serve that purpose and no question about it their powerful runs make them fun to catch but they arent great table fare im much more interested in bringing home a tasty sea trout snook redfish or flounder for dinner asking if you can bring along a gps to mark good spots can often make or break a potential relationship with a guide you dont want to fish with someone who implicitly or explicitly accuses you of stealing his locations the fact is good guides know plenty of places that hold fish and letting a client capture four or five doesnt pose any risk to his livelihood a day of fishing with a good guide will reveal immense amounts of information about fishing local waters this includes what kind of structure or bottom different fish prefer as well as the different kinds of bait either natural or artificial in salt water i was told the state of the tide often influences where you fish and what you catch learning how to handle tackle and even something as mundane as the kinds of knots to tie in modern synthetic lines also are all part of the learning experience once youve got the coach the next step is up to you practice practice and more practice improves skills but for many erstwhile fishermen thats hard to do especially if they have full time jobs weekends are the only time they can get on the water and if they dont live next to the water a fishing expedition involves a lot of work first they need to hitch up the boat and trailer and drag them to a boat ramp to launch when the fishing is finished the procedure is reversed it takes more commitment than many are willing to make being retired and living on the water is a whole different matter you can pick your days and times if you decide at the spur of the moment to go fishing its just a matter of going down to the dock and cranking up during the brutal heat of the florida summer i find a two hour session at dawn and another at dusk the perfect fishing schedule but practice doesnt do you much good unless you pay attention many of my fishing friends judge a location by whether or not it "looks fishy " of course theyre judging it by the surface surroundings not whats under the water which is all that matters it doesnt seem to dawn on them that if theyve never caught anything there that spot really isnt very fishy any good guide will tell you that keeping track of when and where you catch the fish you want is the key to keeping the freezer full when i first got serious about it i had only about a half dozen spots that captain ward had shown me but he had told me what to look for and when to fish so it didnt take long before i discovered a few more spots now i have a detailed log of where to fish at various times of the day and year i also have enough locations that i can find a sheltered place to fish even in the gustiest weather at the same time im buying higher quality both more expensive and more durable equipment and i wont buy a rod that doesnt have a lifetime guarantee ive broken three on big fish including a shark that disconcertingly showed up in the river ive even toyed with the idea of getting my captains license and becoming a guide myself i still hire a guide from time to time mostly to teach me about a new area most recently i took a guided trip to learn how to fish fort pierce inlet about six miles from my dock it was interesting and captain gary rhinehart a former banker who would rather fish than make loans was very helpful but the truth is i doubt ill fish there very often i cant stand the idea of speeding past six miles of great fishing spots just to try something different now if youll excuse me i have some fish to fillet for dinner mr sease is a writer in vero beach fla he can be reached at encore wsj com
