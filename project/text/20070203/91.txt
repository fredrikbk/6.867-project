the weekend interview with robert conquest anti sovietchik no palo alto calif those who were born in year one of the russian revolution are now entering their tenth decade of the intellectual class that got its vintage laid down in a class which includes eric hobsbawm conor cruise obrien and precious few others the pre eminent anglo american veteran must be robert conquest he must also be the one who takes the greatest satisfaction in having outlived the soviet "experiment " over the years i have very often knocked respectfully at the door of his modest apartment "book lined" would be the other standard word for it on the outskirts of stanford university where he is a longstanding ornament of the hoover institution evenings at his table marvelously arranged in concert with his wife elizabeth "liddie" have become a part of the social and conversational legend of visitors from several continents i thought i would just check and see how he was doing as dawned when i called he was dividing his time between an exercise bicycle and the latest revision of his classic book "the great terror" the volume that tore the mask away from stalinism before most people had even heard of solzhenitsyn its th anniversary falls next year and the publishers need the third edition in a hurry had it needed much of an update "well its been a bit of a slog i had to read about or books in russian and other languages and about articles in journals and things like that but even so i found i didnt have to change it all that much " one of his lifelong friends the novelist anthony powell once wrote that all classes of englishmen employ the discourse of irony and understatement this would itself be an understatement of mr conquests devastatingly dry and lethal manner expressed in the softest voice that ever brought down an ideological tyranny his diffidence made me inquire what else might be keeping him busy "my publisher wants me to do a book called how not to write about history and i thought yes then im doing an essay on the importance of india and something about the u n and internationalism " i know that he used to serve in the british delegation at the u n but india "my mother was born in bombay and ive always been impressed by how indians have mastered english literature and culture " what about the collection of limericks that hes been promising for a while in his capacity as the last remaining master of the form after the deaths of his other friends kingsley amis and philip larkin "im getting round to that but theres first my latest collection of poems which im calling penultimata didnt i mention it would you like a copy " yes i would and oh what about the memoirs "starting tomorrow when im finished with doing the great terror im going to try dictating them into this new machine liddie whats it called " mrs conquest a scholar of english who first told me that henry james always dictated his novels comes up with the name of the new voice activated software "its called dragons naturally speaking nine " golly "well my handwritings pretty bad and my typing is worse " says mr conquest apologetically thats true enough as i know but i cant help thinking that if "dragons naturally speaking nine" really works and if it had been available in the s then the soviet union would probably have fallen several years before it actually did a history here an anthology of poems there an assortment of limericks a memoir a lineup of contributions to learned journals and i forgot to mention a festschrift of essays in his honor to be edited by the hungarian born scholar paul hollander this seems enough to be going on with meanwhile his other great work on the ukrainian terror famine of the s "harvest of sorrow " is being produced and distributed with no profit going to the author by a ukrainian charity associated with president viktor yushchenko is it sweet to be so vindicated as always i have to crane slightly to hear the whispery answer "there was a magazine in russia called neva which found its circulation went up from to a million when it serialized the great terror and i later found that at the very last plenum of the soviet communist party just before the ussr dissolved a stalinist hack called alexander chakovsky had described me as anti sovietchik no i must say i was rather proud of that " somewhere in the apartment is the presidential medal of freedom awarded to mr conquest in at a ceremony which also featured aretha franklin and muhammad ali i have a picture of him sitting next to the queen of soul smiling demurely having paid his own way to come to washington and it comes back to me that he rang me up on the day of president bushs first inaugural "did you see that line in the speech about the angel that rides the storm any idea where its from im sure i know it " i wasnt able to help but i knew i would get a later call which i duly did identifying the line as coming from john dryden all part of the conquest service like the limericks some of which cannot be reproduced in a family oriented newspaper but many of which are literary and intellectual mnemonic masterpieces an instance his deft compression of the entirety of shakespeares "seven ages of man" speech "first you get puking and mewling then very p ed off with your schooling then f s and then fights then judging chaps rights then sitting in slippers then drooling " just as one can never imagine mr conquest raising his voice or losing his temper so one can never picture him using an obscenity for its own sake a few years ago he said to me that the old distinctions between left and right had become irrelevant to him adding very mildly that fools and knaves of all kinds needed to be opposed and that what was really needed was "a united front against bulls t " for all that his life has been lived among the ideological storms of the th century of which he retains an acute and unique memory he was himself a communist for a couple of years in the late s having been radicalized while studying in france and observing events in spain "i was even a left deviationist my best friend was a trotskyist and when king george v was crowned we decorated the college at oxford with eight chamberpots painted in red white and blue " he left the party after asking what the line would be if chamberlain ever declared war on hitler and receiving the reply "comrade it is impossible that the bourgeois chamberlain would ever declare war on hitler " this he found "oafish " "i didnt like the word impossible " wartime service in bulgaria which made him an eyewitness to stalins takeover of the country at the end was proof positive from then on working as a researcher and later as a diplomat for the british foreign office he strove to propose a social democratic resistance to communism "id always been a labour man and somewhat on the left until the s when i met margaret thatcher and she asked my advice " that advice which translated into the now famous "iron lady" speech was to regard the soviet system as something condemned by history and doomed to fail if that sounds easy now it wasnt then though mr conquest insists that it was george orwell who first saw it coming like many people with a natural gift for politics mr conquest finds that he distrusts those who can talk of nothing else his affiliations are undogmatic and unfanatical he preferred tony blair over margaret thatchers successor john major and he does not bother to turn out at election times "im a dual national whos a citizen of the u s and the u k so that voting in either place seems rather overdoing it " on the events of today he is always very judicious and reserved "i have my own opinions about iraq but i havent said a great deal about the subject because i dont know all that much about it " how often do you hear anyone talking like that if he had done nothing political he would still have had a life and would be remembered as the senior figure of that stellar collection of poets and writers john wain philip larkin kingsley amis who became known in the britain of the s as "the movement " liddie conquest happens to have written rather authoritatively about this group though thats not how they met "i was teaching at the university of texas in el paso and he came to give a poetry reading but it wasnt until i met him later in california that something clicked as people like to say " mrs conquest might be described as a force of nature and also as the wielder of a texan skillet that yields brisket of a rare and strange tenderness anthony powell in his "journals" was again committed to understatement when he wrote of her engagement to "bob" that "she is charming and he a lucky man " "i know you meet different lefties from the ones i know " he says referring obliquely to some recent tussles between your humble servant and the michael moore faction "but ive always been friends with what i call the good left " in the days of the old soviet union he kept up a solid friendship with the radical russian scholar steve cohen author of a study of nikolai bukharin and husband of nation magazine editor katrina vanden heuvel and admired his objectivity "i helped out scoop jackson against kissinger on the soviet jewish question pat moynihan helped me get a job at the wilson center in washington in the s " i remind him that i once introduced him to that other great veteran of the bay area jessica "decca" mitford and that in the course of a tremendous evening she was enchanted to find that this dreaded friend of mrs thatcher was the only other person shed ever met who knew all the words to the old red songbooks including the highly demanding ditty "the cloakmakers union is a no good union " anthem of the old communist garment district at the close of that dinner i challenged him to write her a limerick on the spot and he gallantly and spontaneously produced the following "they dont find theyre having to check a movement of homage to decca its no longer fair to say oaklands not there shes made it a regular mecca " the old girl was quite blown away by this tribute and kept the inscribed napkin as a souvenir an agnostic in religion "did you know that milton friedman was an agnostic too " mr conquest is likewise suspicious of anything too zealous or systematic in human affairs he is also refreshingly empirical in his judgments asked why he the great anatomizer and accuser of stalinism still regards nazism as morally worse than the gulag he replies mildly but somehow irrefutably "i simply feel it to be so " in his most recent books "reflections on a ravaged century" and "the dragons of expectation " he goes beyond the usual admonitions against jacobinism and more recent totalitarian utopias and argues for "the anglosphere " that historic arc of law tradition and individual liberty that extends from scotland to australia and takes in the two largest multicultural democracies on the planet the u s and india there was a time when this might have seemed quixotic or even nostalgic at least to me but when one surveys the wreckage of other concepts and the increasing difficulties of the only rival "model" in the form of the european union of which he was an early skeptic the notion seems to have a future as well as a past one very much feels as one also very much hopes that the same can be said of the grand old man of stanford mr hitchens is a columnist for vanity fair
