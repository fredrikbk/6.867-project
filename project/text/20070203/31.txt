health weighty issues yes we all need cardio exercise but heres why strength training should become a bigger part of your fitness routine everyone knows exercise is important the problem is sticking to a regimen especially as you age but karl knopf says he has a plan that older adults can easily follow for the long haul dr knopf a year old author and professor of adaptive physical education at foothill community college in los altos calif says all it takes for older adults to stay fit and live a more active life is minutes of walking three times a week a bit of stretching and lifting small weights two times a week regular strength training he says which can take the form of water exercises working with exercise bands or even repeatedly lifting a can of beans can mean the difference between spending your last years in a nursing home and spending them traveling enjoying your family and doing recreational pursuits "a little bit of something is better than a lot of nothing " says dr knopf the founder and president of the fitness educators for older adults association a training and accreditation program the energetic dr knopf whose latest book is titled "weights for + building strength staying healthy and enjoying an active lifestyle " seems to be a living example of his "grow strong not old " philosophy we caught up with him at foothill community college to find out more about how older adults can reap the benefits of exercise by making simple changes in lifestyle here are some excerpts from the discussion the wall street journal why is exercise and strength training in particular important for older adults dr knopf most older adults live a zoo like existence they sleep all night and sit all day and the bones start to not have anything pulling on them so they become osteoporotic they also suffer from sarcopenia which is age related skeletal muscle loss that comes from inactivity by the time people think about retiring at or they are too weak to do many independent activities many people have done all the right things financially theyve met with financial counselors and have money put away but they dont factor in what their health status will be so thats what strength training is all about it lets people live independently as long as they live so often we start to see people slowly start to die with type diabetes or heart disease after or wsj can strength training combined with cardiovascular exercise really slow down aging dr knopf yes i think exercise truly is the fountain of youth there is a lot of scientific evidence that the intervention of sound sensible and prudent exercise can slow down and possibly reverse the effects of aging i get really upset when people want to reverse the aging process via a bottle or an injection if you do moderate exercise you can add about years to your life if you do vigorous exercise you can add three years to your life but more important than the number of days you spend on this earth is how you spend those days no one wants to spend their last years in the back ward of a convalescent home wsj on top of improving the quality of your life can exercise also make you look younger dr knopf yes it can for a young person exercise is all about aesthetics when you get to middle age you exercise for health because youre going through the heart attack zone then in your s and s you start to exercise for function for each period of your life you exercise for a different reason but even for older people exercise can improve your looks if you improve your posture and stature you will automatically look younger and strength training can do this you cant do anything about wrinkles but you can improve your carriage wsj you say that by the age of the average person has lost or more of their muscle mass what does that mean physically dr knopf after the age of we lose on average of muscle mass each year up to age after which it declines more rapidly an average year old can expect to lose an additional more of their muscle mass by the time they are it escalates from there it means if you dont do an intervention of strength training older adults begin to say "my house is too big my chair is too low and my steps are too high " and if you trip and we all do and you dont have the leg strength to catch yourself for that nanosecond down you go and because youre frail and your bones are fragile you break a hip and it turns into &# hip surgery wsj a lot of older people would balk at the idea of lifting weights for fear of injury how can people get over the fear of weight lifting dr knopf strength training isnt about lifting weights the proper term is progressive resistive exercise it doesnt matter where you start as long as you increase the load start out lifting a simple tv guide magazine and move up to "war and peace " and progressive resistive exercise can take the form of weights exercise bands machines and water exercise anything that progressively works the muscle wsj what can people do to avoid injuries dr knopf i always like people to get clearance from medical doctors and in an ideal world if they have chronic conditions they should go see a physical therapist and ask for exercise recommendations and contraindications things you should avoid doing because of a chronic injury and then take that information to a well trained personal trainer and have them design a program but make sure that personal trainer is used to working with older adults many trainers are used to working with younger adults and pushing them so they arent sensitive to the fact that older adults may have chronic conditions like arthritis heart disease and diabetes but you dont have to have a trainer you can learn a lot about proper form by reading books and watching videos in your home in fact you know your body better than any trainer or doctor if it doesnt feel right for you it isnt the right exercise for you if it hurts youre doing it wrong for strength training start with the smallest amount of weight you can lift six times then lift that amount until you can lift it easily times then add more weight wsj how often do people need to do strength training for it to be effective dr knopf two times a week is acceptable and even once a week maintains function but three times a week is ideal wsj we hear a lot about cardiovascular exercise is that not as important as weve been led to believe dr knopf in the s it was all about cardio when people ask "whats the most important muscle of the body " everyone is engrained to think the heart but when you are older its the legs if those legs go so does your ability to maintain your independence cardio is one component of an exercise program and its important but strength balance and flexibility are underrated wsj sounds like a lot do you have to do it all dr knopf yes but you can incorporate it into your daily life you only need to lift weights twice a week then do aerobic exercise and by that i mean walking three times a week stretching can just be a portion of that as a young person its about how much how fast and how hard but when youre older it can be lsd long slow distance im a real fan of water exercise its a combination of aerobic and resistance exercise in fact if people would just be more active that might take care of the cardio component as fitness people we have failed miserably there are more gyms than ever before and we have more diet foods but people are getting fatter people just need to get more physically active they can park farther away get rid of their gardener and get rid of the remote control i think just getting rid of the remote control you could lose five to pounds in a year wsj do you have to do strength training in a gym dr knopf absolutely not you can do it in your home lift a rock or a can of beans use an exercise band its about repetition to build strength start with six repetitions and when you can do so without much strain go to repetitions i firmly believe you dont need to spend long arduous hours in a gym to be fit you can get a good workout in about minutes start with minutes of walking do minutes of lifting and stretch for five minutes thats it wsj most people have good intentions with exercise but dont get around to it do you have any tips for sticking to a program dr knopf remember what you do today will determine how you age tomorrow im sure most of your readers will say "thats a wonderful article and ill start tomorrow " but just start now walk to the end of the corner and come back go to a water exercise class and stay five minutes and the activity you choose has to be fun and something you look forward to make sure it matches your personality if youre a structured person classes might be the best bet if you prefer to go solo take a walk or go for a swim and break it up one day play golf and the next day go for a bike ride wsj can doing these routines help someone with diabetes arthritis or high blood pressure dr knopf i know its a big claim but i do think exercise can help ease the symptoms of chronic conditions for example a pound of muscle burns significantly more calories than a pound of fat the thing with walking or cardio is that you burn calories while walking we used to think cardiovascular exercise revved up your metabolism but it really doesnt but if you build more muscle you are burning more calories at rest so that helps people with type diabetes for arthritis if i have an arthritic knee if i can make the muscles around the knee stronger that takes the load off the ligaments and cartilage we were taught years ago that if you have arthritis you dont exercise because it will make it worse arthritis is called the wear and tear disease but its really a misuse disease wsj what do you mean by a misuse disease dr knopf we dont get it but its those little misuses and abuses in our s and s that become chronic diseases in our s s and s we have a lot of surpluses built into the body so you can get away with doing lots of bad things in your s s and s you can overeat a little bit in your s and s and have no problems but then in your s it shows up as type diabetes wsj can you reverse some of that abuse misuse and disuse dr knopf i believe you can reverse some of those things i will share a story with you when i started the first strength training class for older adults years ago you can imagine i was out in the wilderness alone but i had one little old lady come to me and ask if my class could help her she had been on the commode the day before and couldnt get off and was so embarrassed we started her off just getting out of a chair then we got her off her walker onto a cane and she got to the point where she was walking erectly im not kidding you that she looked years old from behind for her that little step into fitness was gentle and great things happened strength training empowers older people to do things they never thought they could do i have women who say they feel better now at than they did at and that is what its all about for me ms essick is a writer in san francisco she can be reached at encore wsj com
