pursuits books gastronomy the oxford companion to food by alan davidson edited by tom jaine oxford pages &# what samuel johnsons th century dictionary was to the english language the late alan davidsons "oxford companion to food" is to present day gastronomy a far reaching erudite amusing and occasionally idiosyncratic guide covering more of its subject than anything published before mr davidson a widely traveled british diplomat spent years compiling the first edition of which he wrote himself this second edition edited by food historian tom jaine preserves the character of the original while adding extensive updates to the more than entries of them new its all here everything from ancient food history to modern national cuisines while not a repository of recipes the "oxford companion" offers detailed discussion of ingredients and techniques that makes it easy with a bit of sleuthing to move from guide entry to cookbook entree the entries on national cuisines are especially informative we discover for instance that the reason a latin american appetizer like ceviche marinated raw fish has a distinctively pleasing flavor in ecuador is the use of juice from seville oranges as well as from limes the "oxford companion" cant cover everything of course the entry on dolmas includes the usual stuffed vegetable with meat or rice varieties but makes no mention of midye dolmas delicious stuffed mussels that are a cornerstone of coastal ottoman turkish cuisine all the more reason to look forward to yet another edition in the decade ahead
