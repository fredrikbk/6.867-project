pursuits sports &amp recreation golf journal golf school confidential why pricey lessons wont make you better at least not anytime soon this is the time of year with the ground frozen hard up north and the first tender green shoots of the pga tour season excuse me the fedex cup season budding on tv when going to a golf school seems most irresistible if youve already booked your golf school bon voyage but one note of caution dont count on getting better at least not anytime soon the fantasy we have about golf schools is that three days of intense instruction will "fix" our swing and help us start off the new season with a bang thats not going to happen any more than the same amount of time at a health spa is going to take pounds off our gut "learning golf is a continuous journey not something you can do in a weekend " says walt chapman a well regarded instructor at the fairways &amp greens golf center in knoxville tenn golf schools can be lots of fun and potentially benefit your game over the long term but they cant do magic the schools are definitely better than they used to be back in a sportswriter friend of mine john garrity of sports illustrated was a nine handicap when he attended a golf school with an all star staff and an unfortunate teaching philosophy it involved strapping students into what mr garrity came to think of as a straitjacket to teach the proper connection between arms and chest during the swing within a month after returning home to kansas he couldnt break and it took him years to fully recover the only traditional golf school ive attended several years ago while at another publication was at the sea island resort in georgia and it was deluxe instruction took place at one of the worlds most inspiring practice facilities directly on the atlantic marshes and the lodge where regular participants but not working journalists stayed had a butler assigned to each room at nearly &# a head it cost much more than typical three day schools in the &# to &# range including lodging and some food but not transportation but the headline instructors were butch harmon tiger woodss former coach and the resident guru jack lumpkin who is davis love iiis teacher sea islands current top of the line three day school without mr harmon costs &# simply being around those two eminences for three days observing how they approached the game getting in sync with their golf rhythms and hearing their stories was invaluable but in the end the thing i was favorably most impressed with was how little advice about the swing itself they doled out to us students after teaching thousands of students over many years they recognized that theres only so much any golfer can usefully absorb in a short amount of time more information is confusing and counterproductive so messrs harmon and lumpkin separately and together watched each of us hit balls for a goodly amount of time and identified the one or two simple little things they deemed we needed to work on next in my case standing farther from the ball and extending my right arm more on the backswing then they had the confidence and wisdom to let it go at that over the next few months i worked on incorporating their advice into my swing which certainly did help my game a bit but unfortunately messrs harmon and lumpkin do not make house calls after that i was on my own which in a nutshell is the limitation of golf schools it is true that almost all schools these days send students home with a video record to study plus bundles of notes and instructional documents phone numbers to call for follow up and often invitations to send videos of their swing back to the school for analysis in the weeks and months that follow but few time pressed students take the time to make that kind of effort not when there is real golf to be played so how should we think about golf school heres a hint quality of instruction isnt the top priority "the first criterion for picking a good golf school is the weather " says bill forrest the pga teacher of the year for and director of instruction at troon country club in scottsdale ariz he knows all about golf schools because he has taught at hundreds of them all over the world second on his list is lodging food and other facilities including an uncrowded golf course to play on third is service the "schmooze factor " he calls it fourth and only fourth is the golf instruction "golf schools are a great way to get away with friends and relax around the game " mr forrest says "but if your no goal is truly to lower your handicap youll be much better off using that same money to schedule a series of one on one lessons with a knowledgeable teaching pro back home " that said even for the casual player there are ways to maximize the golf benefits of a school first emphasize those areas you probably dont usually work on as much but are the most amenable to quick improvement the short game shots inside yards course management and the mental side most schools these days dedicate a lot of time to chipping pitching and putting but not all include on course playing lessons and dedicated sessions on controlling your emotions try to find one that does if you can also have your clubs fitted properly and get a personal fitness assessment at golf school so much the better the opposite side of this equation is to de emphasize ball striking this is the area at which most of us want to improve the most but unfortunately also the area where change is the most difficult golf school teachers can set you on the right path but it will be up to you to make the necessarily slow improvements back home ideally under the watch of a cooperative instructor and dont be surprised if your swing gets worse for a while before it gets better other than that ask lots of questions and file away all the little bits and pieces of golf wisdom you can "ultimately golf cannot be taught so much as it can be learned " mr forrest says "even in a one on one teaching situation improving is all about self discovery " later if not sooner a lot of what you pick up at a golf school will come in useful email me at golfjournal wsj com student handbook considering a golf school stint some tips if you really want to improve your game use the money you would have used for golf school and set up a series of lessons with a good teacher near home if you go to golf school make sure having a good time is your primary goal be sure to pick a school with good weather great food and lodgings and a good uncrowded course relax around the game to get the most bang for your buck improvementwise focus on the short game the mental game and course management instruction rather than on ball striking to maximize what you do learn about ball striking take lots of notes and do all the follow up drills your instructors recommend
