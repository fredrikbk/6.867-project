pursuits books the soul game of a scoring machine pistol by mark kriegel free press pages &# he wore floppy socks yet made precision passes he practiced for hours on end but didnt take care of himself he saw everything when on the court off the court he couldnt see what was coming above all he was a skinny white kid who as one teammate said "played a soul game " pistol pete maravich was also paradox pete blessed with a talent not seen before or since cursed with demons not entirely of his own making in his celebrity he was the elvis of basketball and for one all too brief moment he was the best basketball player on the planet there have been books about him before including the autobiography he wrote before his death from a heart attack in at age but none of them quite did justice to a man who changed the way basketball was played and the way sports fans think now with "pistol " former new york daily news sports columnist mark kriegel has written the sport bio equivalent of maravich on a fast break dazzling and smart and even at pages over before you know it if he occasionally glosses over an epic game or memorable incident thats ok maravich would have admired the quickness "pistol" is as much about press maravich petes hard driving father as it is about him and with good reason press escaped the steel mills outside pittsburgh to become a professional basketball player in the days before the nba he went on to become a storied coach in both high school mike ditka the future chicago bears football star played b ball for him and college ucla coach john wooden used to call him for advice along the way though press became daedalus to petes icarus as one of presss assistants said "he went from being one of the greatest coaches in the game to the coach of the greatest player in the game " press would sometimes make little pete lie prone in the backseat of a moving car and dribble a basketball out the door while press sped the car up or slowed it down testing his sons skills press showed him off like a trained seal to his players and fellow coaches he tied his own career to petes which is how they both ended up at louisiana state university and he compromised his own principles of discipline and teamwork to ensure that pete was the star of the show that part of the plan worked maravich averaged an ncaa record points a game in his three seasons at baton rouge and was the college basketball player of the year in he not only revived the lsu basketball program but also brought in enough revenue to justify a new arena he then ignited a bidding war between the carolina cougars of the aba and the atlanta hawks of the nba the hawks won in part because they too wanted to build a new arena but there were hidden costs maravich had already begun to drink beyond his capacity opponents were out to stop him in any way possible exacting a physical toll and teammates werent inclined to give him the ball stoking dissension and his coaches didnt coddle him as press once had after four disappointing seasons in atlanta maravich was shipped to the expansion new orleans jazz they needed to fill the new superdome and his resume already included two houses that pistol built back in comfortable louisiana surroundings pete quickly improved his numbers he won the nba scoring title in averaging points a game in one meeting with the new york knicks a game that observers swear was the best individual performance ever he scored points but maravich was a little too comfortable on bourbon street and his body began to desert him then a knee injury derailed a jazz playoff push and emptied all those seats the next thing he knew the franchise was moved to salt lake city for the season and he was traded to the boston celtics who used him off the bench sometimes to spell their rookie larry bird not exactly what pete or press had in mind thats when the pistols playing career ended the maravich story went on though and mr kriegel tells it movingly father and son find redemption press by raising a daughter his other son had left behind pete by both finding religion and caring for press in his final days after pete dies felled by a congenital heart defect while playing basketball in a church gym his sons jaeson and josh take up the game with josh daring to try out as a walk on at lsu and succeeding if there is a bad guy in the story its lsu coach john brady who refuses to play josh on senior night in an arena named after his father if youre left wanting more after "pistol " there is another recent book "maravich " written by wayne federman and marshall terrill in collaboration with petes widow jackie maravich naturally its a celebration rather than a critical examination of maravichs life but the book does add to the legend and burnish the extraordinary memories he left behind as bob dylan wrote in his memoir "chronicles " regarding maravichs death "some people seem to fade away but when they are truly gone its like they didnt fade away at all " mr wulf is executive editor of espn the magazine
