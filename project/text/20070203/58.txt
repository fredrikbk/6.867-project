politics &amp economics rifts emerge on iran policy skeptics question extent of role in iraq instability washington the bush administrations war of words with iran is sparking divisions within the government over how heavily tehran actually is involved in fomenting instability in iraq and how aggressive a stance the u s should adopt in response the white house has steadily ratcheted up its public statements about iran with senior officials in both washington and baghdad promising to take steps to curb what they portray as irans continuing transfers of weapons money and military trainers to shiite militants in iraq some u s officials have suggested iran may have played a direct role in a sophisticated attack in the iraqi city of karbala in late january that left five americans dead but u s opinion about iran is far from monolithic and divisions over the countrys intentions and activities in iraq are emerging within the military and the intelligence community the skeptics are challenging key aspects of the bush administrations justifications for its hard line approach toward iran making it more difficult for the white house to rally public support those tensions broke into the open with the release friday of declassified portions of the new national intelligence estimate about iraq which represents the collective findings of the intelligence communitys agencies the report said iran is playing only a minimal role in stoking sectarian violence in iraq an assessment that runs counter to a string of recent public statements by administration officials accusing tehran of contributing significantly to iraqs instability while the report said "iranian lethal support for select groups of iraqi shia militants clearly intensifies the conflict in iraq " it concluded that iraqs raging sectarian war would continue even if iran completely ended its involvement "the involvement of these outside actors is not likely to be a major driver of violence because of the self sustaining character of iraqs internal sectarian dynamics " the report said the release came as the administration delayed for the second time a planned release of military evidence that it says will buttress its claims that iran is funneling weapons to iraqi shiites national security adviser steve hadley acknowledged that the administration was concerned about the quality of the evidence that was to be presented "the truth is quite frankly we thought the briefing overstated and we sent it back to get it narrowed and focused on the facts " he said the intelligence report issued yesterday entitled "prospects for iraqs stability a challenging road ahead " was requested by congress and runs to pages in its classified form it presented a bleak assessment of conditions in iraq arguing that the "term civil war accurately describes key elements of the iraq conflict" even though the overall violence there was part of a conflict even more dangerous and complex than a traditional civil war the reports skeptical assessment of irans overall role in iraq echoes what many current and former u s officials have been saying for months while most agree that largely shiite iran has been working to expand its influence inside iraq and its support for fellow shiites there they discount the idea that tehran is a central player in fueling the unrest "there are two main engines of violence the sunni jihadists and the shiite militias that have been in operation since february neither of these two cycles of violence was incited by the iranians " says wayne white a member of the iraq study group and a former state department intelligence analyst "whatever the iranians are doing has to be like of the total problem " while playing down irans influence on iraqs overall security situation u s intelligence agencies generally agree with the bush administrations contention that tehran is funding and supplying munitions to shiite militias military and intelligence officials say they are particularly concerned by irans alleged supplying of shaped charges a particularly lethal type of roadside bomb capable of penetrating tanks and armored vehicles u s officials say members of shiite militias have used those munitions to kill american and british servicemen even here the evidence remains murky the bush administration has long accused iran of arming iraqs shiite fighters but has never been able to provide clear evidence substantiating the allegations on jan the u s ambassador to baghdad zalmay khalilzad said the government would publicly release evidence buttressing the claims "in the coming days " the briefing was delayed without explanation however then delayed a second time a few days ago mr hadley declined to say when it would ultimately take place
