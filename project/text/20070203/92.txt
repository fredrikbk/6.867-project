things go better with social justice international corporations today face growing pressure for greater accountability and transparency corporate leaders inevitably must address critical choices whether to engage stakeholders or turn a deaf ear whether to complain of unfair treatment or accept accountability as part of the social license to do business but corporate social responsibility need not conflict with the obligation to shareholders to be financially successful in my experience constructive engagement with a broad range of interest groups including harsh critics is the best way to use their pressure to drive profitability coca cola operates in more than countries and our business model relies on local businesses to make distribute and sell our beverages when a company plays a major role in creating jobs tax revenues adjacent businesses and public services the result is sustainable communities and higher living standards this also functions as a powerful self correcting mechanism a business can be only as healthy as the communities in which it operates for it to succeed it must be integrally and functionally part of every community for globalization to succeed it must lead to inclusive development that offers opportunities to the rural poor as well as to the urban elite because we are a local business on a global scale it is inevitable that advocates for a wide range of interests from environmental protection to social justice to economic development will scrutinize us this is logical businesses usually respond to market forces faster than governments furthermore businesses are often better positioned than governments to realize globalizations benefits locally however a small minority of activists will always prefer confrontation with its attendant publicity to the search for mutually beneficial common ground with such groups there is little room for dialogue in these situations a company has no choice but to vigorously confront parties who seek to use its brand to push their own agenda on the other hand i believe we can and should deal with those responsible stakeholders who recognize that we cannot abandon or undermine our fundamental economic purpose the business advantage that comes from such engagement is not merely to reduce criticism effective engagement can be a catalyst for programs that improve local living standards this in turn will lead to new or more satisfied consumers who prefer companies not only on the basis of brands and products but because of the values they hold and how they conduct business for instance because most of our beverages are made locally for sale locally coca colas success depends on the availability of local water resources thus our partnership with communities on water challenges helps align our respective interests in ensuring the health of the watersheds that sustain both our business and the communities where we operate in mali we are joined with the u s agency for international development to install hand and pedaflow pumps for wells throughout the country in bamako malis capital we partnered with womens groups to set up a water fee program to expand and maintain the system and fund a microenterprise job creation program and we are helping extend municipal water taps into outlying communities such programs help reduce waterborne illnesses increase crop yields provide new sources of income and improve local living standards this "virtuous cycle" yields a social license to operate in a global economy it also forms the foundation for long term success as discerning consumers choose businesses that are aligned with their larger social interests and values this is the business rationale behind our recent microenterprise initiatives such as our program to expand the number of pushcarts kiosks and mini tables provided to entrepreneurs as well as sales training we started a pushcart program for disadvantaged women in vietnam in with participants by the end of the number of participants had doubled and the program was embraced by the womens union in ho chi minh city for creating sustainable women owned businesses our microenterprise programs similarly benefited people displaced in thailand and indonesia by the tsunami people with hiv aids in ghana and unemployed young people in egypt we shall continue to seek engagement with accountable and responsible advocates and we have partnered around the globe with many organizations on issues such as environmental impact water stewardship climate protection workplace rights disaster relief and hiv aids successful collaboration is built on finding the common ground where a companys self interest and the needs of communities converge this is hard work but work worth doing the integration of the global economy advanced with respect and concern for local interests and cultures through broad stakeholder engagement remains the most effective means to lift people out of poverty and advance prosperity that creates motivated consumers and that is good business mr isdell is chairman and ceo of the coca cola company
