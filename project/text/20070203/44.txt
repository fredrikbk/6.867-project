money matters striking a balance if most of your savings are tied up in a k or ira you might want to give taxable accounts a fresh look when it comes to tax sheltered savings can there be too much of a good thing conventional wisdom says no the standard advice is first to maximize pretax contributions to a k or other employer sponsored retirement plan then plow as much after tax money as possible into tax deferred accounts but some financial planners say that for many people expecting to retire in five to years who already have most of their savings stashed in individual retirement accounts k s or deferred compensation plans its best to use their remaining working years to bulk up taxable accounts even if it means skimping on contributions to tax sheltered plans "people are retiring with all or most of their savings in tax deferred plans and very little in taxable accounts and theyre getting creamed in taxes when they start taking the money out " says lynn ballou a certified financial planner at ballou plum financial advisors in lafayette calif withdrawals from tax deferred accounts are treated as ordinary income which means theyre taxed at rates as high as taxable accounts on the other hand are subject to capital gains tax rates of for investments held more than one year the big assumption people make when they put all their savings into tax sheltered accounts is that years of tax deferred growth will offset the eventual tax bite on withdrawals and theres certainly a good deal of truth to that depending on your income needs in retirement and your tax bracket in later life but there are some circumstances in which you will come out ahead by diverting money into a taxable account rather than a tax sheltered account especially if you cant use a roth savings vehicle in roth k s and roth iras investment gains are never taxed even upon withdrawal so you can create a pool of tax free money for retirement but the roth k offered through employers is not widely available yet and the roth ira comes with income restrictions to make a full contribution for income cannot exceed &# for singles and &# for couples the exact benefits of a taxable account over a tax sheltered account depend on the type of investments made says stephen kirkland an accountant at kirkland thomas watson &amp dyches llc in columbia s c he offers the following example assume you and your spouse are each or older which qualifies you to put a maximum of &# each into an ira this year lets say you invest a combined &# a year in a nondeductible ira meaning your ira contributions dont qualify for deductions on your tax return after years if the account earns an average of annually the ira would be worth &# when you withdraw the money however you are subject to income tax on the investment gains if youre already in the maximum tax bracket you would be left with &# after taxes now lets invest the same money in a taxable account if the account contains tax efficient investments say a tax managed mutual fund in which the fund manager attempts to limit or eliminate taxable gains for investors after capital gains taxes the value of the account could be about &# the higher your tax bracket the better the tax efficient account looks but even if you are in the bracket the tax deferred account would leave you with less about &# equally important even if your taxable account generates some gains you have the flexibility to sell some losers to offset your gains mr kirkland says you can offset as much as &# each year and carry excess losses into future years regardless of the investment at some point you are going to have to take money out of a tax deferred account whether you need it or not iras and k s require that you take minimum distributions after age deferred compensation plans typically let you choose the period over which your money is paid out in retirement but if you dont need all of your distributions to live on consider stashing any future savings in a tax efficient taxable account ms ballou says "the more you put into your tax sheltered account the bigger your distributions will be and the more youll have to pay in income taxes " ms ballou recently ran the numbers for a year old executive who plans to retire in at age and would like to live on &# a year after taxes she currently has &# million in investments half of which is spread across a k plan an ira and her employers deferred compensation plan the other half is in taxable accounts the executive wants to put away &# a year for the next five years before she retires should she put it into her employers deferred compensation plan or into her taxable investment account she will come out far ahead if she feeds an annual &# into her taxable account ms ballou says by age the total value of her investments assuming a average annual return would be &# million if she invests the &# a year in the deferred compensation program and &# million if she invests it in a taxable account the longer she lives the greater the benefit of the taxable account says ms ballou "by age " she says the executives "assets would be worth &# million if she puts the money into the tax deferred plan and &# million if she invests it in her taxable account " whats more if she put the &# each year into the deferred compensation plan she would be significantly inflating the amount that would be paid out to her and would be subject to income taxes "shell be stuck having to take more money than she needs out of her plans at a very high tax bracket " ms ballou says in contrast if she invests the funds in a taxable account she can leave the money growing intact this example assumes that the executive can afford an upfront tax hit if she were to put the &# in her deferred compensation plan she could do so on a pretax basis to get the equal amount into a taxable account in her tax bracket she will have to earn about &# to produce &# in savings over five years thats &# in taxes ms ballou says when youre weighing the benefits of investing in a pretax account such as a k or a deferred compensation plan versus a taxable account you must assume youre investing the same amount "that means to invest in a taxable account you have to be able to afford the upfront tax hit " she says building savings outside tax sheltered accounts can also pay off from an estate planning perspective says mark cortazzo a financial planner at macro consulting group in parsippany n j not only can your assets remain intact during your lifetime when they are in a taxable account because you dont have to take required distributions but they also get preferential tax treatment upon your death the cost basis of assets in a taxable account gets stepped up to the value on the day of your death mr cortazzo says so your heirs would owe capital gains taxes only on gains incurred after your death in contrast when your beneficiaries inherit assets from a traditional ira they also inherit your cost basis that could translate into a bigger tax bite when your heirs make required withdrawals from the inherited account say you are age and you put &# into a regular nondeductible ira for each of the next five years until you retire at age if you earn an average annual a year on your investments by age your ira would be worth &# according to mr cortazzo then assume that when you start taking required minimum distributions after turning age you first pay income taxes at the income tax rate and then reinvest what is left in a taxable account earning an average annual return by age the combined after tax value of your ira and that taxable account would be about &# if you had invested the same &# each year for five years in a tax efficient taxable account and didnt touch it until age its after tax value would be about &# to spin the example out further if you were to die at age your ira and the taxable account with the reinvested distributions would have a combined after tax value of just over &# to beneficiaries in the tax bracket in contrast assets in the taxable account would be worth almost &# to your heirs because of the step up in cost basis in either case the assets may be subject to estate taxes depending on the size of your estate if you think you may benefit from having savings in a taxable account in retirement first be sure to check the math and then check in with your psyche "you have to be honest with yourself are you the type of person who will be tempted to spend money in your taxable account rather than keeping it invested until you retire " says robert barbetti executive compensation specialist at j p morgan private bank in new york you generally cant tap funds in a tax sheltered account before age without triggering a penalty thats enough to prevent many people from touching their savings prematurely if you need that hindrance to preserve your savings then stick with the tax deferred accounts says ms ballou "the behavioral side of the equation is just as important as the math " ms hube is a writer in westport conn she can be reached at encore wsj com see related letter "letters to the editor tax deferred account best way to
