encore a special report health matters menopause hormones appear to reduce risk of diabetes for years doctors have talked about the health effects of hormones on bones breasts and womens hearts but one of the biggest concerns of aging diabetes hasnt been part of the debate until now last week the north american menopause society updated its recommendations for women considering menopause hormones for the first time the group noted that diabetes risk appears to be lower in women who use hormones the group said there isnt enough evidence to suggest that women start taking hormones to prevent diabetes but the chance of lowering diabetes risk should be reassuring to women who are considering hormones to cope with hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause "weve not addressed diabetes in the past " says wulf utian executive director of the north american menopause society one of the leading medical organizations to advise women on midlife issues "but there now are a number of studies suggesting that estrogens are having a beneficial effect on sugar metabolism this is an area that we feel is extremely important " why diabetes risk has been ignored in the hormone debate isnt clear as a health issue diabetes is clearly as important as cardiovascular disease breast cancer and stroke yet it doesnt resonate as much with the public according to the world health organization more than million deaths each year are attributable to diabetes by comparison about deaths world wide are caused by breast cancer diabetes itself often doesnt kill you but it can lead to other deadly problems the leading cause of death among people with diabetes is heart attack and stroke and about of all heart attacks are caused by diabetes diabetes is also the leading cause of blindness kidney failure impotence and amputations it even shortens life expectancy by five to seven years according to the centers for disease control and prevention seven out of every women will be diagnosed with diabetes and the risk is growing in the incidence of diabetes increased by among people between the ages of and jumping to cases per people from cases in whats surprising is that a number of well regarded studies show that hormone use dramatically lowers diabetes risk but that fact is virtually ignored when experts talk about the risks and benefits of menopause hormones in fact the womens health initiative which was stopped early in because hormone use in older women was linked with a higher risk of heart attack also showed that hormone use dramatically lowered the risk for diabetes according to the whi women who used estrogen and progestin were less likely to develop diabetes and women who used estrogen by itself were less likely to develop the disease that translates to about fewer cases per women each year and the whi isnt the only study to show the benefit a major study called the heart and estrogen progestin replacement study showed that the combination of estrogen and progestin reduced the chance of developing diabetes by "this is an important finding that tends to be overlooked in most reports about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy " says harvard professor joann manson a whi investigator its not clear exactly how hormones influence diabetes risk type diabetes the most common form usually is triggered by a combination of obesity poor diet lack of exercise and genetics in patients with type diabetes the body becomes unable to effectively process insulin and cant make enough of the hormone to maintain normal blood glucose levels insulin is important because it promotes the storage and use of all nutrients including sugar once full blown diabetes occurs glucose is barricaded from cells and instead accumulates in the bloodstream there it may trigger a process similar to rusting the sugar begins to stick to things damaging kidneys blood vessels and nerves menopause hormones may lower the chances of developing diabetes because they lower elevated insulin levels in the blood in the whi using estrogen and progestin produced a small drop in blood sugar and insulin levels after one year in the study and a higher proportion of whi women taking hormones lost weight compared with those taking a placebo so that may also have been a factor despite these findings many doctors agree that lowering diabetes risk isnt reason enough to take hormones they still recommend that menopause hormones should be prescribed only for women suffering from hot flashes sleep problems and other symptoms of menopause however for a woman with a strong family history of diabetes the whi and other data looking at diabetes risk should be factored into her personal hormone decision along with all the other health issues associated with hormones including a slightly higher risk for breast cancer stroke and blood clots as well as a lower risk for colon cancer and uterine cancer some data suggest that younger women who take hormones to treat symptoms may gain some heart protection while starting hormones long past menopause dramatically increases heart risk in older women "the evidence with regard to diabetes is just beginning " says dr utian "we didnt see this as a sole indication for prevention of diabetes but we do see it as a potential benefit of hormones "
