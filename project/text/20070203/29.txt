hagel for president no we dont mean this as an endorsement the journal doesnt endorse candidates and on the big issues of the day we dont much agree with chuck hagel in any case but with the nebraska republican loudly agitating for a rapid withdrawal from iraq we think its time the senator tested his ideas somewhere other than the sunday talk shows if mr hagel thinks his foreign policy vision is superior to president bushs or to senator john mccains he should stop booing from the gallery and get into the fight for the republican presidential nomination the primaries are only a year away and the gop field awaits a genuine antiwar candidate its one thing to win the beltway media primary another to prevail among actual voters as mr bush has done twice wed have thought mr hagel would relish such a contest especially given his remarks last week about his colleagues along with democrat joe biden the senator co sponsored a resolution condemning mr bushs "surge" strategy for baghdad and while debating the resolution last week the nebraskan said that "i think all senators ought to be on the line on this what do you believe what are you willing to support what do you think why were you elected if you wanted a safe job go sell shoes this is a tough business " that "tough" point in particular could use some fleshing out our guess is that only in washington is it considered courageous for a politician to criticize a war that he voted for when it was popular but that public opinion has since turned against and to do so by offering a "resolution" that has no force of law and is thus meaningless except for the message of american irresolution it sends to our enemies somehow it seems far "tougher" to stand by ones original vote for the war even when it becomes unpopular as mr mccain and senator joe lieberman have done or if you are truly antiwar to have the courage of those convictions and attempt to cut off funds as senator russ feingold and congressman dennis kucinich propose the latter would at least mean taking some responsibility for what happens next as far as we can tell from his speeches mr hagels larger vision for the mideast is that the u s was much better off before mr bush introduced all that "democracy" nonsense hed return to the status quo before fighting the war on terror with the arab dictators we have the senator also favors "engaging" syria and iran and he says that "in the middle east the core of instability and conflict is the underlying arab israeli problem " whatever one thinks of these views they are not unique or innovative john kerry campaigned on them in but maybe the country has since changed its mind enough to embrace them in if mr hagel believes what he says hell stop insulting shoe salesmen by comparing them to senators and get into the ring himself
