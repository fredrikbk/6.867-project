the week ahead our take on coming events budget for bush saving tax cuts is a tough balancing act by deborah solomon president bushs budget which he submits to congress on monday will be an early effort to cement his legacy in domestic policy the key question can he convince members of congress that they can extend his cherished tax cuts all of which expire by and still balance the budget mr bush has pledged to show a path to erasing the existing &# billion deficit a couple of years after he leaves office partly so he can claim strong financial stewardship and more importantly so he can convince congress to extend the tax cuts if the projections are derided as fuzzy math or have unrealistic assumptions congress will scoff and ignore them those projections will assume that mr bushs tax cuts which are estimated to cost about &# billion over the next five years are made permanent but the white house is expected to leave out or underestimate other key costs including an expensive fix to the alternative minimum tax and additional funding for the war in iraq beyond it will also include strong revenue growth that some economists may see as unrealistic as the bush budget will show the deficit numbers are notoriously dependent on such assumptions "the numbers dont tell the whole story " says stan collender a budget expert who is managing director of qorvis communications llc depending on how you do the math he says theres "either a big surplus coming or a big deficit coming " projections by the congressional budget office show a &# billion surplus in but that number quickly turns into a deficit when other widely expected costs are factored in including a fix to the amt which is slated to snag million americans this year unless congress acts and more spending on defense and the war on terror "its a little hard to see how there could be a meeting of the minds " sen kent conrad d n d told reporters the other day "when you adjust the cbo forecast for the proposals of the president you can see they just drive us right over the cliff in terms of massive growth of the debt " the budget is expected to propose about a increase for the defense department to &# billion as well as a separate request of &# billion for the broader war on terror including funding for the iraq war mr bush is also expected to ask for another &# billion in war funds for on top of the &# billion congress approved last year other agencies are bracing for a squeeze including the securities and exchange commission which expects flat funding in after several years of post enron increases other agencies have also been told to expect flat or small increases in according to people familiar with the administrations plans there will also be some new initiatives including the presidents proposal to provide a standard tax deduction to individuals who purchase health insurance either through their employer or on the open market that plan which would make employer provided health insurance taxable as income and exclude as much as &# of that income per family is expected to cost the government about &# billion to &# billion a year for the first few years but eventually become "revenue neutral" within a decade the budget will also show plans to slow the current annual growth rate in medicare spending those savings are expected to come from squeezing health providers like doctors and hospitals which will undoubtedly spark a battle on capitol hill as those providers seek to escape the budget scalpel autos hyundai faces bumpy ride after embezzlement trial by evan ramstad and gina chon mondays verdict in the embezzlement trial of hyundai motor co s chairman could throw south koreas largest auto maker in terms of both revenue and units into further turmoil adding to its growing problems at home and in the u s it could also serve as a test of the korean courts resolve in raising the standards of corporate governance for that nations biggest companies south korean prosecutors allege chung mong koo hyundais chairman and one of south koreas most influential business leaders took about &# million from hyundai and affiliated companies to create a political slush fund prosecutors have asked a judge for a six year prison sentence if the year old mr chung is found guilty if a judge sentences any prison time it will be one of the biggest signs of a recent push led by regulators and lawmakers to hold koreas biggest companies to something closer to international standards of governance thats a change from the past when many korean business executives have been arrested and tried for political bribery scandals but then routinely sentenced to small fines and no prison time hyundai motor is a big unit in one of the largest family run conglomerates an entity called a chaebol that have dominated the countrys business landscape for four decades a guilty verdict and prison sentence is also likely to derail hyundai motor which is hitting snags after a decade of remarkable growth that turned it into the worlds no auto maker in volume following mr chungs arrest last april hyundai appeared to lose its bearings postponing plant openings and delaying strategic decisions mr chung told the court at one point during his trial "i am guilty to a certain extent " he also apologized and asked for leniency with a nationalistic appeal "our company is now in big trouble " he said "if you give me a chance i will repay the people by developing hyundai motor into the worlds fifth largest auto maker " in south korea where hyundai and its sister brand kia build of their vehicles sales slipped last year because of a cyclical downturn in the auto industry weaker than expected economic growth and greater competition from resurgent domestic rivals such as gm daewoo auto &amp technology co a general motors corp affiliate meanwhile the rising value of the korean won against other currencies has meant that some hyundai vehicles have become more expensive than japanese competitors in the u s and europe and competitive chinese companies are coming out with an increasing number of low end models in the u s its second biggest market by revenue and units hyundais sales were flat last year as it fell short of its annual goal of vehicles by one problem a brand image that lags behind its achievements in quality rankings and new products while hyundai has been trying to push a premium sedan called azera many american consumers are still unaware of its existence hyundai plans to introduce its first luxury vehicle in new york in april currencies g may cast a wary eye on valuations of the yuan yen by joellen perry when finance ministers from the group of seven leading industrial nations meet in germany next weekend look out for a tussle over two asian currencies u s officials will continue to focus on chinas weak yuan at the talks which take place in the former industrial powerhouse of essen but european policy makers have said they will push for a discussion about japans currency to be included in the talks as well they say the yens low value gives japanese exporters an unfair edge against competitors that have to pay for their costs in euros after losing against the euro in the past year the yen hit record lows in january against the european unions common currency which is used by nations including germany and france japan is expected to fight back and this time will find the u s on its side though japan has often been criticized in the past for manipulating the yens value treasury secretary henry paulson said last week that the yens value now accurately reflects japans economic situation though the yen recently hit four year lows against the dollar and u s car makers have also complained about the currencys weakness u s treasury officials are reluctant to champion any artificial adjustment in the yen at a time when they are pushing for a market valued yuan japans timid recovery is part of the reason its currency is low rock bottom interest rates at have also made the currency a prime player in the global "carry trade " in which investors borrow in low yielding currencies like the yen to invest in more lucrative currencies elsewhere carry trades further weaken the yen as traders sell off the currency with domestic consumption and consumer price data still muted significant interest rate rises from the bank of japan seem unlikely in the short term so the yen will likely stay low that is a particular problem for countries that use the euro exports helped last year to power the euro bloc to its fastest economic growth since policy makers worry a feeble yen on top of the euros recent rise against the dollar will undercut that expansion manufacturing survey data for january show a stronger euro has already begun dampening export growth across the region a flagging yen also underscores the euro zones widening disparities productivity increases and meager wage growth have helped germany gain against reform laggards like france and italy to become the worlds largest exporter in terms of value "we are more sensitive to the exchange rate because we are less good than germany in terms of structural competitiveness " says christian de boissieu chairman of the french prime minsters council of economic analysis more fundamentally as the euro strengthens simultaneously against the dollar and the yen european policy makers worry the currency is unfairly bearing the burden of global imbalances when the dollar slid last year in part on fears of the u s s huge trade deficit asian economies with trade surpluses and currencies pegged to the dollar helped stem the slide by buying dollars at the same time jittery investors world wide switched dollar denominated assets for euro ones pushing up the european currencys value
