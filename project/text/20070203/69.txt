pursuits leisure &amp arts sightings he brought opera to broadway gian carlo menotti r i p new york once upon a time gian carlo menotti was as fashionable as a composer of classical music can be and then some five of his operas for which he wrote both words and music were produced on broadway between and one of them "the consul " ran for performances twice as long as "porgy and bess " four were commissioned by nbc one for radio and three for television his tv debut "amahl and the night visitors " became the most successful childrens opera of all time he even won the pulitzer prize twice such good fortune rarely goes unpunished and in menottis case the punishment was fearful indeed by his music had fallen from critical favor and to this day it has few advocates though "amahl" continues to be performed professional productions of his other stage works have become increasingly rare and his concert music is all but unknown nowadays menotti who died on thursday at the age of is mainly remembered as the founder of the spoleto festivals in italy and south carolina what went wrong part of the problem if not all of it was that menotti wrote in a style for which the critics of the s had no use not only was his music unabashedly tonal but it was never too complex to confuse the audiences he loved to please that was the way most american classical composers wrote in the s and s the years when menotti who immigrated to this country from italy in came of age they took their cue from aaron copland a modernist of genius who came to believe that "it was worth the effort to see if i couldnt say what i had to say in the simplest possible terms " just as copland reached out to ordinary listeners in his folk flavored scores for such ballets as "billy the kid" and "rodeo " so did menotti seek to write operas that made the same kind of sense to the same kind of people "atonal music " he said "is essentially pessimistic it is incapable of expressing joy or humor " he was right too he was in short a middlebrow and in when "the consul" opened on broadway americas middlebrow culture was at its peak those were the days when american audiences still believed passionately in the importance of high culture and american artists were prepared to meet them halfway creating serious yet accessible art that was championed by the mass media time actually went so far as to put "composer menotti" on its cover after "the consul" opened assuring its readers that he "had taken the grand airs out of opera brought to it the realism and immediacy of the th century theater and best of all his operas were in english and the plain playgoer could understand every word " you cant buy that kind of publicity and by then menotti didnt need to try "the consul" had already sold &# worth of tickets on opening night serious money in but by the s his stage savvy brand of musical populism had come to be seen by the postwar avant garde as little short of contemptible and from then on he got no respect critical or otherwise the middlebrow moment in american culture was over and gian carlo menotti was history at the same time though there was more to menottis fall from grace than his refusal to play the modern music game the truth is that the theatrical success of his operas often had more to do with their words than their music to be sure he could write a pretty tune a gift that is by no means to be despised "steal me sweet thief " the soprano aria from "the old maid and the thief " menottis radio opera is as fresh sounding as a midsummer morning and "sebastian " his ballet score is full of equally fetching melodies but while his libretti for "the medium" and "the consul" were brilliantly ingenious pieces of stagecraft their scores too often amounted to effective but ultimately unmemorable background music "you know what id like to do " a very smart american composer once told me "id like to write a menotti opera with real music " thats clever but too harsh "the medium" is still capable of pleasing a crowd and "the consul " a hard nosed cold war melodrama about political persecution in an unnamed police state has lost none of its punch or relevance in our postmodern age of ethnic cleansing one of these days some hot young choreographer will get around to making a new version of "sebastian " while "the unicorn the gorgon and the manticore " menottis charming "madrigal fable " is waiting to be rediscovered by choral conductors as for "amahl and the night visitors " its never gone away and never will since he shrewdly made it simple enough to be performed by talented amateurs i dont want to claim too much for menotti he wasnt a great composer or anything like it but he was a consummate craftsman and a true man of the theater and he never made the mistake of assuming that art has to be complicated in order to be good thats how he succeeded in bringing opera to the great white way an achievement for which he deserves to be remembered with
