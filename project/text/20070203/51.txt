pursuits books among the basques barcelonians and turistas ghosts of spain by giles tremlett walker pages &# arriving at the madrid morgue to attend a friends wake journalist giles tremlett expects to find himself in a solemn place as he relates in "ghosts of spain " mr tremlett instead discovers an atmosphere like that of "a small airport terminal " people are milling about "a tv monitor tells you which corpse is in which cubicle a cash dispenser sits in the middle of the foyer " there is even a busy bar restaurant that stays open late attracting non mourners in search of a nightcap the episode illustrates not only the spanish love of crowds but the defiant exuberance of spanish life never more evident than in the presence of death mr tremlett the madrid correspondent for britains guardian newspaper has lived in spain for years his affectionate yet critical intimacy with the country helps to make this book much more than an ordinary journalistic survey as an "integrated outsider " he can draw on personal experience such as the birth of his son in a madrid maternity ward where the boisterousness of visiting gypsy families offsets the imperious detachment of the doctors extended residency has also allowed mr tremlett to gather off beat stories distinctly revealing of his adopted land like that of the flamenco tournament at the granada jail where musicians doing time at prisons across southern spain are bused in to compete for prize money and a recording contract he visits a bordello south of valencia which features a handicapped accessible bedroom equipped with grab bars and he attends a youth festival for radical basque separatists where black rappers from los angeles mingle with folk dancers clad in sheepskins and conical hats in spain today the ancient often appears alongside the avant garde thus mr tremlett devotes a large part of his narrative to history mixing modern spanish scenes with concise accounts of the nations encounters with islam anarchism and package tourism a fascination with spains past helps explain mr tremletts dismay at certain aspects of the present such as the legions of young hikers laden with "goretex timberland mountain bikes mobile phones and gps navigation devices " who have overrun the camino de santiago pilgrimage route he regrets the neglect of older buildings amid a fashion for spectacular constructions by big name foreign architects think of frank gehrys metallic fantasia at bilbao on the other hand he sometimes loses patience with the pace of change as when he is scandalized to find himself the only man in a roomful of expectant mothers at a prenatal class his interest in history mr tremlett writes was deepened by the recent exhumations of bodies in mass graves dating from the spanish civil war those exhumations have stirred a wrenching debate over the war and the dictatorship under francisco franco subjects that had been largely off limits since francos death in the socialist government under jose luis rodriguez zapatero which came to power in has added to the controversy by proposing to remove the last memorials to the late dictator and to pay reparations to his victims mr tremlett naturally sympathizes with the men and women seeking a decent reburial for ancestors killed by francos nationalists he welcomes an end to the "pact of forgetting" that followed francos demise portraying the pact as the price paid for the transition to democracy but as he acknowledges atrocities occurred on both sides of the war the republicans as george orwell discovered were no pristine band of displaced philosopher kings thus mr zapateros retroactive endorsement of the republican cause has inspired descendants of its victims to voice their own grievances starting a competition that can grow only more bitter yet the battle lines within spanish society have changed since francos day the current governments policies on same sex marriage and the public financing of the catholic church have aggravated longstanding cultural antagonisms between the "two spains" the anticlerical egalitarian one and its traditionalist authoritarian counterpart yet prosperity in what is now the worlds eighth largest economy has eased the sort of class tensions that culminated in civil war if spain is divided today it is mostly along geographical lines over the past two decades spain has transferred power from the national state to the governments of its regions local identities have never been stronger this is especially true in the three "historical communities" catalonia the basque country and galicia whose languages share with castilian the status of official tongues mr tremlett explores all three regions to see if they still fit into a larger nation returning to his favorite spanish city barcelona mr tremlett is taken aback by the growing use of catalan a trend that he suggests might leave this most cosmopolitan corner of spain increasingly isolated from the rest of the world in the basque country he faces but does not solve the mystery of why a prosperous and largely autonomous region with a thriving local culture should continue to host a violent separatist movement at the same time he wonders why the northwestern region of galicia where an even higher percentage of the population speaks the local language than in catalonia or the basque country has shown no serious interest in regional nationalism the difference he concludes is that after more than a millennium as custodians of the shrine of spains patron saint at santiago de compostela the people of galicia have a stake in the culture of spain as a whole it is that sort of insight that vindicates mr tremletts approach to a deeply traditional and fast changing land mr rocca is an
