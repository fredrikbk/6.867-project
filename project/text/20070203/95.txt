total sas next king of crude french under fire for iran iraq deals oil spill riles sailors paris in the giant french oil company total sa ignored u s calls to boycott iran and instead drilled there planting the french flag in one of the worlds largest pools of oil and natural gas the man in charge of the project christophe de margerie today the year old executive known as "big moustache" for his bushy handlebar is set to take the helm of total the worlds fourth largest oil company by market value mr de margerie is scheduled to take over total on feb with several controversies still looming large he expresses a continuing desire to do energy deals with iran even as concern about its nuclear ambitions grows a french judge is investigating whether total paid bribes to obtain past iranian oil deals and mr de margerie is himself under investigation as part of a french probe into the iraq oil for food scandal the ill starred united nations program designed to let iraq under saddam hussein raise money to feed its people both investigations are under way and no charges have been issued total and mr de margerie have denied any wrongdoing in an interview mr de margerie acknowledged that the oil business carries risks beyond engineering challenges including political ones rival companies "were less in a hurry to seek exotic fields but thats where big oil is " he said "weve been bolder " to drive his point home mr de margerie said he is pursuing talks with iran for an offshore natural gas field a notion that past critics of his dealings with the country find troubling "mr de margerie led the effort to water down" sanctions against iran says former u s sen alfonse damato who pushed for penalties on foreign oil companies investing there today "iran is moving closer to nuclear capability " all of this is far removed from his roots in the champagne business his family is a part owner of taittinger bubbly "he could have become king of brut " says his cousin pierre emmanuel taittinger chief executive officer of the champagne house "but hes opted to become king of crude " mr de margeries task is in many ways tougher than that of his peers at other oil titans including exxon mobil corp bp plc and royal dutch shell plc those three all have substantial oil in their home territories of the u s and europes north sea france has little oil of its own so total has placed its bets around the globe hoping that the political financial and technical risks associated with its hefty investments wont materialize everywhere at the same time as a result total must rely on a mix of engineering skill and diplomatic flair to drill everywhere from northern europe and the middle east to africa canada and venezuela in hard to access regions of africa and the middle east total produces more oil and in more countries than its british and u s rivals in total extracted about barrels a day of oil from middle eastern countries on a par with shell but about twice as much as bp about of totals proven and probable reserves lay in the middle east in africa its far flung activities leave total particularly vulnerable to a trend plaguing all the western oil titans "resource nationalism " increasingly oil rich countries are keeping easy to tap fields for themselves or charging foreigners higher fees operating on their turf for total and other nonstate oil companies there is no more easy oil venezuela wants a bigger slice from totals profit in the country russia which just extracted a share in a major project in sakhalin from a shell led venture has threatened to withdraw totals license on a small field in siberia on the grounds that the firm overlooked environmental regulations mr de margerie is taking the reins at total under a plan announced last year under which current ceo thierry desmarest will step down from his post and stay on as chairman total has repeatedly denied speculation that mr de margeries legal troubles might prompt it to reconsider the succession plan last year the executive was kept in french police custody for hours as part of the french probe into the oil for food scandal mr de margerie joined totals finance department in after studying business he worked for the oil trading arm from to in january he became head of the groups core exploration and production division a position once occupied by mr desmarest and regarded as a necessary step to the ceo post despite coming from a prominent family and having strong business and political ties the blue blooded executive isnt a widely known figure in france "he doesnt have an aristocratic life style " said jean pierre jouyet frances financial inspection chief who is married to one of mr de margeries relatives "he likes to play parlor games with his children and enjoys watching star academy " a televised competition for young singers mr de margerie says he enjoys reading gossip magazines but "wouldnt want to see my face in them " when mr de margerie headed totals middle eastern operations in the mid s he sparred with mr damato "totals continuation of the sirri oil project in iran is very distressing and is an insult to the memory of those killed in the recent terrorist attacks in israel " mr damato said in a letter to mr de margerie published by the middle east economic survey in april "we cannot accept the connection you made between recent terrorist attacks in israel and the sirri service contract " he responded in a letter to mr damato asserting that total abided by french european and international laws and indicating that it didnt feel bound by the u s s sanctions against iran "we have never condoned terrorism and never will " more than a decade later mr de margerie describes totals strategy as going where the oil is steering clear of political affairs "we invest in projects that last to years and cant pack our suitcases each time there is a change in government and leave " he says but the executive insists that total knows how to draw the line in the s for example mr de margerie often traveled to baghdad as total was negotiating rights to develop a giant oil field in iraq contract terms were agreed but mr de margerie ended up not sealing the deal because of united nations sanctions against iraq still mr de margerie made friends in the region "if i were part of decision making powers in baghdad i would strongly recommend that iraq work with total " said fadhil chalabi a former deputy oil minister in iraq who manages the london based centre for global energy studies at home mr de margerie faces big legal battles total is a defendant in a pollution trial involving a tanker oil spill off the brittany coast in although total has paid for a large part of the damages the companys initial attempt to deny responsibility pushed it in a prolonged public relations quagmire in total was forced to ditch a sponsorship plan frances sailing league didnt want to stick what it regarded as an unpopular logo on its boats meantime a french investigative judge philippe courroye is examining whether total paid commissions to intermediaries to get preferred access to iraqi oil export quotas a review in of the u n s oil for food program in iraq conducted by a panel headed by former federal reserve chairman paul volcker found that mismanagement and criminality allowed the saddam hussein regime to wring &# billion out of the system through a combination of smuggling and illicit kickbacks mr de margerie was questioned by the french judge late last year in the recent interview mr de margerie said that he paid no intermediaries and broke no laws he said rather that he had simply hired a lebanese lawyer as an independent adviser on the workings of iraqs legal system that is "standard practice " he said "you dont go alone in countries you dont know well " an oil giants global plan total is trying to spread its bets around the world a strategy with challenges for incoming chief christophe de margerie canada it has rights to develop tar sands a gooey type of oil requiring costly elaborate refining but tar sands make no sense if oil prices keep falling venezuela counts for nearly of totals global output but new president hugo chavez wants to renegotiate for more of the profits angola just as total started pumping oil from new field after years of drilling angola joined opec the cartel which could force cuts in output sudan total holds exploration rights on an area as big as greece but has been stymied for years by civil war saudi arabia total possesses a rare foreign company permit to drill here but only for natural gas any oil found is saudi arabias france politicians want a windfall tax on total frances biggest profit machine to help a chronic budget gap russia despite years of expansion efforts total has only a small siberian field but even that seems too much for russian authorities it could be revoked on environmental grounds source wsj research
