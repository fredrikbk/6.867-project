pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece meet it in st louis saarinens gateway arch and the fine art of collaboration anatomy of a classic a story high gleaming stainless steel arch stands on the western bank of the mississippi in st louis built between and it is attributed to its architect eero saarinen and associates who won the commission in in the major open national design competition of the postwar period he defeated older modernists including his famous father eliel saarinen and edward durrell stone who had partnered with the sculptor isamu noguchi as well as many up and coming ones minoru yamasaki who would later design the world trade center louis i kahn harry weese harrison &amp abramowitz skidmore owens &amp merrill charles and ray eames and tac the architects collaborative but it is far more accurate to call it the work of many hands of the architect and his co workers his engineer fred n severud their labor force the competition sponsor a local civic association the actual client the national park service and the ultimate client the public their combined efforts made the arch a masterpiece of modernist public art that is appreciated in a way few such works are william gass the st louis critic philosopher novelist and keen observer of his citys architecture describes the arch as "simple direct and grand enough to wrench a wow from a clod " he attributes its greatness to the occasion memorialized the meaning captured saarinens genius and the presence of pure beauty these elements are mostly invisible to the "average guy " who is "more interested in the how it was built" and the "strange little elevators" to its observation platform at the top i disagree it is the crossing of how it was built with its special ability to induce a wow that makes the arch a masterpiece it is otherwise deficient in each of the areas gass names meaning and memorializing are the most obvious weaknesses the limits of its commemorative function are demonstrated by its names it is better known twice better according to google as the gateway arch than by its primary official federal designation of the jefferson national expansion memorial most visitors learn only when they get to the museum under the arch that it is a national memorial to thomas jefferson as author of the louisiana purchase of and to the ensuing national expansion from the site of colonial st louis where the arch now stands and not to the present city of st louis saarinen would have been the first to contest the individualism of the notion of genius he was by nature a collaborative architect designing in tandem with employees engineers and when occasions like the competition allowed it other artists and architects more generally as he told time in he saw the contemporary architect as a "co creator" who served a "new client society as a whole " saarinens execution of the competition design was the product of exactly that kind of co creation he worked closely with politically astute local civic leaders to steer his design around the bureaucratic legal and financial obstacles that kept it on the drawing boards until he provided them with user friendly descriptions that helped transform initial public hostility to "the giant wicket" into an appreciative embrace the public saarinen might have accepted gasss description of the archs beauty as pure having himself called the arch an "absolutely pure shape" and "a perfect catenary " the private saarinen knew better the archs structural elegance is not absolute its catenary or the form used in construction that takes the shape assumed by a chain when it is suspended is weighted rather than pure it resembles an inverted hanging bicycle chain if the links of that chain had a size graded in the same proportions as the archs whose thickness tapers from feet at the base to feet at its foot high top severud compensated for the weaknesses of the archs form relative to the force of the winds that draw down on it in a way that sacrificed structural functionality to architectural beauty his solution was a composite structure that has no structural skeleton the archs skin is its structure and its structure is its skin or so it appears in fact the equilateral triangle shaped wall sections of stainless steel on the outside and of carbon steel on the inside are filled with concrete up to the foot level of the arch it is this infill and the invisible foot deep reinforced concrete foundations that keep the lower sections of the arch standing above that point the weight is carried by the two walls without the help of any infill below it the concrete infill carried the weight to the massive foundations where it is absorbed the real beauty part is in the "how it was built " the arch can be said to have constructed itself the ability of each leg to act as a free standing cantilever did away with the need for scaffolding up to the foot level where a bridge like truss was inserted between the legs creeper cranes allowed each leg to carry its own weight skyward one foot high ton section of wall at a time the heavy lifting was easier than the fitting together of the sections which demanded exceptional skill from the members of the building trades their labor when added to severuds imaginative combination of standard structural qualities and techniques is the co making that puts the archs engineering in the masterpiece category that leaves the wow experience st louisians have it regularly there are favorite spots to observe the arch and protests when a new building blocks that special view it is not uncommon to hear reports of the archs capacity to render itself invisible or change color with shifts in weather and light to assume when seen on certain axes different shapes and to appear and disappear in the hilly landscape of st louis seemingly at will its grandness and appearance of simplicity have enabled st louisians to have what sociologists of art call a direct aesthetic experience it mattered very little to locals that professional and historical opinion had turned against saarinen before his untimely death in at age and that even his defenders believed that the arch was a little too simple a little too single functioned in short too much of an architectural one liner to count among his major achievements st louisians did not have to wait for the current revival of saarinens reputation among architects critics and historians and the more general enthusiasm for midcentury modernism to know the arch is a masterpiece now that informed opinion has caught up with st louisians point of view is it not time to acknowledge the prescience of these co creators dr lipstadt is a cultural and architectural historian her most recent studies of the gateway arch are published in "eero saarinen shaping the future" and "judging architectural value a harvard design magazine reader " correction the feb leisure &amp arts article "meet it in st louis saarinens gateway arch and the fine art of collaboration" mistakenly referred to residents of st louis as st louisians they are called st louisans in the same article it gave the date of the louisiana purchase as it was wsj feb
