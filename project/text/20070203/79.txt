seeing the light in billboard war digital signs spark a truce clear channel lowers tensions in cleveland mr brancatellis saw cleveland for years clear channel communications inc a giant of the u s billboard business often won the right to put up big signs by dragging cities and community groups into court but in cleveland one of those court fights allowed clear channel to soup up its signs and win over residents at the same time the reason in a settlement clear channel won permission to put up lucrative new digital billboards along highways in return for taking down some old fashioned inner city billboards the new signs flash a sequence of ads from seven different companies multiplying clear channels revenue all over the country billboard companies are racing to transform venerable road signs into these high tech moneymakers as they do they are changing the dynamics of civic battles that date back more than a century "its actually a huge change " says mark mays chief executive of clear channel the no player by revenue it has billboards in the u s "historically weve had an adversarial relationship with them " says mr mays after decades of slow gains outdoor advertising is now the fastest growing ad category after the internet in the age of digital video recorders which allow viewers to skip television ads advertisers are turning back to old fashioned billboards which still have a captive audience outdoor ads brought in an estimated &# billion in the u s last year up over the year before in late clear channel took public a stake in its outdoor unit in part because the units growth rate was far outpacing its parents radio business the parent is currently lobbying shareholders to agree to a plan to take the company private today some of the nations billboards are digital a figure expected to grow by several hundred a year over the next few years according to the outdoor advertising association of america inc the &# cost of installing an electronic billboard is more than outweighed by the ability to sell one space to multiple advertisers at the same time in some communities they are also sparking a new round of criticism because they can distract highway drivers companies and communities have sparred over the size shape and amount of outdoor advertisements in u s cities since at least the early s when municipalities began legislating against them those fights were just the warm up for legal battles in the s when interstate highways began to crisscross the country followed closely by signs for burma shave cigarettes and more while some today remember these vintage placards as quaint bits of americana at the time they irritated many drivers who were fed up with advertisings encroachment on the countryside in the s some local activists took to cutting down boards in the middle of the night eventually lady bird johnson spearheaded a campaign to reduce the number of billboards on u s highways the highway beautification act was signed into law in calling for a reduction in the number of billboards but funds to pay owners to take down rural boards soon ran out the law still exists but is replete with exceptions that have resulted in an estimated billboards lining americas highways according to the anti billboard advocacy group scenic america thats a jump compared with the highway ads that were around in a few years after the highway beautification act went into effect the industry disputes these figures and says the total number of billboards including highways and cities is one recent challenge for anti billboard forces has been the shift in billboard ownership from a hodgepodge of regional players into a handful of media titans including clear channel with deep pockets and teams of lawyers the companies frequently haul communities into court citing first amendment protections of free speech often the municipality backs down one of clevelands longtime billboard foes is community activist tony brancatelli he has worked most of his life to clean up his working class neighborhood of slavic village plagued by boarded up buildings and suburban flight one big goal tearing down the billboards littering broadway a major local artery for years he tried to help property owners find a way to nullify their billboard contracts which sometimes had decades long terms that often meant sparring with executives working for billboard concern eller media the contracts usually held when clear channel acquired eller in mr brancatelli feared the acquisition would only make his adversaries more formidable two years later in february the company took the city of cleveland to court twice first it challenged a city ordinance banning alcohol advertising and then it accused cleveland of unfairly targeting its billboards in a city inspection that cited hundreds of boards for code violations the city lost the first case a settlement in the second case among other things created legislation allowing digital boards like traditional boards each new digital board had to first be approved by city government mr brancatellis worst tussle with clear channel came in he says he and his lawyer repeatedly asked clear channel to take down a billboard that was blocking construction of a boys &amp girls club under the original contract the billboard could be removed if construction was planned on the land where it stood mr brancatelli says company representatives spent months dithering and kept demanding a new location to put up a new board even though the contract made no provision for a replacement clear channel says slavic village misinterpreted the contract fed up mr brancatelli headed to the billboard grabbed a saw and attacked say people familiar with the matter with construction equipment idling just feet away mr brancatelli sawed at the metal pins holding the board in place until it collapsed these people say "i will never admit to taking down a billboard " mr brancatelli now says "i will admit to evicting them off our real estate " clear channel says it has worked with mr brancatelli in the past donating billboard space over the years to slavic village as well as other cleveland groups a few years passed then clear channel wanted to put up a digital board in an area bordering slavic village in contrast to prior encounters clear channel officials approached slavic village leaders eagerly behaving as if the head butting hadnt happened "it was very clear they wanted to deal " mr brancatelli says clear channels president of outdoor ads in cleveland bill platko recalls telling local billboard foes "we have an opportunity where we both can win " in january slavic village and other cleveland neighborhood officials began elaborate discussions with clear channel to put up a digital board clear channel proposed to take two traditional boards down as city law requires the community leaders knew digital billboards are very profitable marlane cq weslian slavic villages development officer reasoned that adding one board represented a vast expansion of advertising in the neighborhood by rotating an ad through every eight seconds clear channel could have over seven advertisers a minute on that board the neighborhood groups asked for traditional boards to come down including boards on busy roads clear channel balked by march a compromise was reached for clear channel to get its digital board five traditional boards would come down on major roads in slavic village and five more in other city areas clear channel cut similar deals in three other parts of cleveland the compromise allows slavic village to claim victory mr brancatelli says the clear channel negotiations were a "tipping point" that has bettered his relationship with the company another city councilman joe cimperman adds that when clear channel approaches the city now they "dont cue up the music to darth vader " the compromise is a win for clear channel too because the advertiser shares the board with others the rates for a digital display run slightly under the &# to &# per month that clear channel would typically charge for a highwayside billboard in cleveland says a spokesman but now the company collects revenue from seven companies instead of one today the company has seven digital billboards up in the cleveland area including three outside city limits they blink through a steady stream of advertisements for clients ranging from a fox tv affiliate to a local ford dealer the pictures come up slide show style with no animation or video and flip over to a new advertiser every eight seconds to further court its critics clear channel recently expanded programs that donate free billboard space for clevelands nonprofits in december it launched a new program that allows city officials to take control of the boards and put up so called amber alerts which alert the public to possible child abductions amber alert "changes the dynamics of the relationship" with cleveland " says clear channels mr mays "its billboards used in a way that meshes with our strategic goals " adds bob brown director of clevelands planning department in october when a kid spray painted a digital board with a gang slogan passersby swiftly reported the incident to clear channel in the past pranksters could run amok with spray paint without a single call to the company "i think the kind of joint and cooperative effort that was undertaken in cleveland is a great prototype " says paul meyer the president and chief operating officer of clear channels outdoor advertising unit there are already signs of an anti digital billboard movement in minnetonka minn a judge tuesday upheld a decision by local authorities to pull the plug on two clear channel digital billboards that the city says violates rules prohibiting flashing or changing signs as it did in cleveland clear channel has started running so called amber alerts on the remaining six digital boards in the twin cities area the company says the move wasnt in response to the ruling and that the amber alerts were long planned
