faced many rejections expenses such as foreign travel costs have siphoned thousands of dollars from her fees in december she even considered calling it quits the global economy is transforming the modeling world supply has soared as aspirants from developing countries stampede into the field at last seasons new yorks fashion week the quintessentially american design house of calvin klein didnt send a single american down its catwalk twelve of the chosen were from russia and eastern europe "theres so many models now it used to be the americans europeans and canadians then we got the influx of brazilians russians eastern europeans " says american designer nicole miller "there are just thousands every year " when she tried out for shows "i felt outnumbered " ms gomez says "i am not trying to say they are taking over the world or anything but they did get a lot of jobs " while growing demand from web sites online advertising and catalogs has helped stabilize wages for the bread and butter work most models rely on to survive pay has plummeted at the highest echelons of fashion the runway shows that feature top designers in paris milan and new york for each runway job which usually takes a couple of hours many new york designers dont pay at all in milan starting fees are about &# models accept the low salaries for the exposure hoping it might lead to better paying gigs

magazine covers fashion magazines prefer celebrities "because people have a sense that they know them " says roberta myers editor in chief of elle magazine which features singer gwen stefani this month elle hasnt had a model on its cover since part of the change in the economics of modeling is attributable to the internet which allows talent scouts to comb through tens of thousands of new faces looking for somebody an agency will sign one such site models com gets subscriptions per month from people in places like bulgaria kazakhstan and mozambique high profile success stories like brazils gisele bundchen and russias natalia vodianova have spawned a network of ambitious scouts in these countries all searching for the next new star the european union has helped make borders

slavic look caucasian in coloring but with vaguely ethnic facial features runway casting directors look for the slimmer shoulders and hips they say russians and eastern europeans often boast many in the fashion industry say these models who often hail from tough economic circumstances work harder than their western counterparts "the brazilians and eastern europeans are hungrier " says mr casablancas who currently lives in rio de janeiro and works as a consultant to modeling agencies there modeling agencies have changed too with volumes up and margins down agencies keep a larger selection of models and turn them over more often that means a models average career span in the high fashion milieu has shrunk to as little as one to two years down from eight to in the past if they dont land a big contract by then models often turn to the more commercial side of the business including less prestigious catalog work ms gomez hails from azusa calif a working class suburb north of

fees to european trips to audition for runway shows trips that can cost thousands of dollars to save money ms gomez takes the subway cooks macaroni and hot dogs for dinner and limits her shopping years ago modeling agencies spent years cultivating young models sending them to famous photographers who devoted hours to building their portfolios says bethann hardison a former runway model who ran a boutique agency through the s if designers took a shine to a model they sent her down their runways year after year some made it to supermodel status in the early s european designers like gianni versace paid more than &# per model to send the likes of christy turlington and linda evangelista down their runways by contrast many designers today prefer anonymous faces that wont overshadow the clothes says desiree gruber executive producer of project runway with so many models vying for jobs designers frequently switch models every season changing the look of their model lineup just as they change their collections her first month in new york ms gomez did auditions in days she won spots in about a dozen shows including emerging designers sari gueron and josh goot earning between &# and &# a show thanks to that exposure one company paid her &# for a catalog shoot an impressive amount for a "new face " "watch out gisele bundchen here i come " she joked after walking in a show for

out for calvin klein which auditioned somewhere between and models for slots a tenfold increase in applicants since the firm twice called back ms gomez for further looks her hopes soared "everyone says i look like i could be a calvin girl " she said the night before calvin kleins spring collection runway show ms gomez waited anxiously for her cell phone to ring it never did francisco costa calvin kleins designer chose primarily eastern european models ekaterina kiseleva a year old siberian beauty won a special deal in which the design house paid her extra to walk exclusively for calvin klein in new york that coup led her to score another exclusive modeling deal in milan from gucci as well as louis vuitton and balenciaga in paris part of ms gomezs problem was that at " and pounds she wasnt quite thin enough for some designers on the runway "the ideal body type for models today has been smaller shoulders small waist small rib cage small hips " says nian fish creative director of kcd worldwide which produces fashion shows for calvin klein and marc jacobs eastern european girls with their distinctive bone structure and narrow bodies often fit the bill because ms gomez didnt get booked with a prominent designer in new york next president faith kates faced a quandary if next sent her to milan where the market is even more competitive she might not find work and lose not only money but confidence but she could catch the eye of a big italian designer "we were on the fence " says ms kates many of milans big names dolce &amp gabbana prada and versace were interested in ms gomez so the agency decided to take the risk on ms gomezs tight budget the trip to milan was a splurge it cost more than &# which she paid herself once she arrived in milan ms gomez indeed found the competition stiffer than in new york while the u s has visa restrictions for models only about models are permitted entrance to the u s on h b visas for visiting workers the european community has no such restrictions as a result the number of models streaming in is huge outside one of milans elegant palazzos ms gomez joined young women in a courtyard many of whom were chatting in russian dialects

"heres the problem shes not anorexic i would rather have them not do well than starve themselves " after ms gomez left milan ms kates sent the young model to sydney australia where the aesthetic leans toward a curvier look ms gomez could get some experience ms kates reasoned and perhaps by the time she returns to new york where there has been controversy over waif thin models "the designers will have changed their perspective on what they think is sexy " ms gomez spent two months doing photo shoots for magazines including australian marie claire she auditioned for three ad campaigns but didnt get any of them one rejected her for being "too thin" for the australian marketplace ms kates says that after paying for her flights and other expenses she should break even on the trip back in los
