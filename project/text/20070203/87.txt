the risks of betting big on etfs investors build entire portfolios with them how to avoid overpaying other pitfalls steve sox is making a big bet on exchange traded funds three years ago the seattle media consultants portfolio contained the usual suspects mutual funds and stocks but he wasnt confident in his stock picking skills and his mutual funds were acting sleepy they "werent doing anything for me " he says so he started flirting with etfs which resemble mutual funds but trade on an exchange today about of his portfolio is in etfs and he says he is easily outperforming broad market indexes as etfs have proliferated it has become easier to build an entire portfolio around them there are now more than of them on the market a doubling in recent years covering everything from big u s indexes to nanotech stocks to malaysian shares this past week alone proshare advisors llc launched new offerings etfs which track indexes are generally cheaper than regular mutual funds and have tax advantages investors are snapping them up last year etf assets jumped to more than &# billion advocates of etf only portfolios are also getting a boost from a recent push to issue more bond etfs where previously there were few many financial advisers now specialize in assembling etf portfolios in recent months td ameritrade holding corp launched a service called "guided amerivest " which offers clients with &# or more access to counselors to help assemble etf only portfolios but just because you can doesnt mean its smart investors who bet the farm on etfs may be taking on substantial risks in addition some new options such as mutual funds investing exclusively in etfs can be much pricier than their underlying investments thanks to the explosion of new offerings many etfs lack a long term track record those that track narrow slices of the market can be more expensive than the average etf and also volatile in certain investment categories investors may see better returns with traditional mutual funds in some cases conventional index tracking mutual funds have lower fees and may track their benchmarks more closely some key investment areas are still underrepresented by etfs including municipal bonds in certain asset classes like bonds or small stocks many advisers believe investors are better off with funds run by active money managers whose job it is to sniff out undervalued stocks and bonds to invest in rather than funds that simply try to track an index many advisers recommend using a combination of etfs and traditional funds one approach use broadly diversified etfs to build core stock holdings and actively managed mutual funds for smaller allocations to other asset classes like bonds or emerging markets where actively managed funds have a better shot at beating the indexes a draw for many investors is the easy access etfs provide to exotic foreign markets and narrow industry groups over the past couple years stan zawrotny a year old retired management consultant in tallahassee fla has gradually committed nearly one third of his portfolio or more than &# to etfs many are focused on single emerging market countries like brazil "i didnt like the returns that mutual funds were getting " mr zawrotny says he does like the recent performance of his etfs his investments focused on singapore mexico and brazil have all posted double digit returns recently "why buy a mutual fund and get or when ive already got in a few months " he asks many advisers worry that bursts of stellar performance from such narrowly focused etfs will blind investors to the risks in many single country etfs for example "a handful of large companies dominate the etf so you incur a fair amount of single company risk " says marvin appel of investment advisory firm appel asset management corp in great neck n y and author of a book on etfs for example just three companies account for more than a third of the assets in ishares msci south korea index fund etfs focused on narrow slices of the stock market are often pricier than more diversified peers while the broad vanguard total stock market etf charges expenses of just for example first trust amex biotechnology index fund charges more than eight times that amount bob porcellino senior vice president for product development at first trust advisors lp says the biotech etf has performed "extremely well" since its launch and "if you think the fund has performed well and its going to continue to you can justify those fees " new products that help build complete portfolios of etfs may steer investors away from loading up on the riskiest funds in a joint effort with xshares advisors llc td ameritrade plans to launch five "life cycle" etfs which gradually shift to a more conservative mix of stocks and bonds as the investors retirement approaches a number of life cycle mutual funds recently launched are investing primarily in etfs among them offerings from seligman advisors inc and federated investors inc some advisers warn investors from some of these "funds of etfs" because they can be far more expensive than buying etfs directly class a shares of seligman targetfund charge total expenses of for the funds underlying etfs seligman president charles kadlec says the funds are worth the extra fees since they automatically rebalance holdings "i personally think theyre a bargain "
