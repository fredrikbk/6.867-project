bay of pigs vets fight to outlast an ailing castro brigadistas hoped to live in a free cuba now they long to be buried there miami last december a group of veterans of the bay of pigs invasion gathered for a board meeting at their small museum in little havana memorializing the event and heard a bombshell announcement the brigadistas as veterans of the failed attempt to topple fidel castro are known had just observed a minute of silence in memory of comrades killed in the failed attack when their president delivered the news they had been waiting to hear for years "fidel castro esta muerto " fidel castro is dead said felix rodriguez mr rodriguez a retired cia officer said his sources had informed him that the cuban dictator had passed away on dec at a m the men were jubilant the report of course was false and the brigadistas elation reverted to the melancholy they have felt for so many years as they have waited for their old nemesis to be gone since july when mr castro who has ruled the island since fell ill and ceded power to his younger brother these unrepentant cold warriors have been in suspense waiting the brigadistas have long lived with the hope of resuming their lives in a free cuba but today many surviving members are just hoping to be buried there the year old mr castros illness has given them a new lease on life jorge marquet who is has been saving a bottle of dewars year old scotch for the occasion of mr castros death when the time comes nilo messer a devout catholic is planning to go to church and pray william muir celorio a brigadista who hasnt smoked in years says he has put aside an expensive "non cuban" cigar to light up at an appropriate moment "jews say next year in jerusalem " we say next year in havana " says mr muir celorio a software developer some say they are planning to be on the first plane to cuba to fight if they have to mr rodriguez says that at about pounds he is out of shape and currently on a diet "we can hold a rifle but we cant run up a hill " mr rodriguez says rodolfo llorente who has scars on his chest from heart surgery is prepared to do what he can to bring about a regime change "i would go to the brigada and say "let us go and help the cuban people " he says the museum which opened in has become a social club a brotherhood a charity and a senior center for the lonely veterans of brigade as the force is known these days it is also a makeshift mausoleum for those too poor to afford a proper burial the original u s trained force that entered cuba in the spring of was about strong according to esteban bovo the brigades historian though many more he says were associated with the battle mr castro was ready for them and waged a fierce fight even as promised u s air cover failed to materialize stranded members of the brigade were taken prisoner and held for months when they returned to the u s many were tormented and remained so some committed suicide others fell into alcoholism or homelessness several joined the armed forces or pursued the american dream by becoming professionals but others took whatever menial jobs they could find waiter busboy porter in a few of the men became watergate burglars the small ranch house that is home to the museum donated by a wealthy brigade member is their hangout they dont get many visitors just a few stray tourists who wander in to look at the photos of the dead and an assortment of articles and artifacts chronicling the invasion on display is the brigade flag members gave to president john f kennedy when he visited them in florida upon their release now in their s s and s some brigadistas are barely scraping by because they were part of a covert army recruited and trained by the cia they were never entitled to the benefits veterans of the armed services enjoy from health care to burial "i never thought i was going to stay in this country for so long i lived day by day " says mr marquet as treasurer of the bay of pigs museum he earns a salary of &# a year his only other income is his social security check over the years the brigadistas have longed for respectability in the form of u s veterans status miami congresswoman ileana ros lehtinen tried years ago to obtain limited federal benefits for brigadistas such as access to veterans administration hospitals but to no avail she says she is getting ready to try again because of their age many now qualify for medicare carlos garrido a brigade member and a doctor set up a practice in miami he welcomed ailing brigadistas treating them at little or no cost to them "most of the brigade is poor " says dr garrido "i tried to help as much as i can " some groups such as filipinos who fought alongside u s forces in the philippines in world war ii have received veterans status but major veterans groups are skeptical "it boils down to are you or arent you a member of the five armed services and they are not " says joe davis a spokesman for the veterans of foreign wars service organization the cia is more friendly "as a general rule retirement benefits are paid only to those individuals with an established status as employees of the central intelligence agency members of brigade dont qualify that is a point of law and is no way a reflection of their courage " a cia spokeswoman said death is always on the brigadistas minds not just mr castros but their own as caretaker of the bay of pigs museum year old juan torres mena answers the phones cleans the toilets and dusts the rows of faded pictures that line the walls of this one room shrine to one of the great fiascos in u s military history and when remains of brigadistas arrive from the local cremation service it is also mr torres menas job to pour the ashes into one of the new wooden "urns" stacked neatly on the floor in an office the containers are kept out of sight from visitors on a desk in the presidents office even as the brigadistas try to raise money to build a real mausoleum "maybe we take them to cuba " mr torres mena adds these days mr rodriguez is part fund raiser part museum administrator part funeral director the brigade owns a parcel of land in a miami cemetery where members are buried two by two one on top of the other but traditional funerals are costly so he has negotiated a price on cremations he says pointing to the prepaid cremation certificates he keeps in his desk "i bought another in advance " he says he doesnt mind having the ashes around he says "they dont make any noise they are friends of ours "
