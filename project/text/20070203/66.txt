pursuits food &amp drink wine notes in the years we have been writing our tastings column which appears on fridays we have received thousands of questions about wine from readers in this column we answer some questions that touch on common themes we have edited the questions for space if you have a question drop us a note at wine wsj com be sure to include your full name city and state postvacation search on a trip to germany i enjoyed wines that dont seem to be available in the u s not in new jersey anyway any idea where id find them jessica schimmel wildwood crest n j "i had a wonderful wine on vacation that i cant find back home what do i do " thats a question we hear all the time from people who have traveled to wine regions all over the world thousands of wineries around the globe dont export any of their wine to the u s which is why its so important when you visit wine regions to try local small production wines that you probably will never see otherwise if you do want to conduct a search when you get home wed start with wine searcher com wineaccess com and winezap com wed also speak to a good wine merchant who might be able to work with a distributor to find the wine finally even many small wineries these days have web sites wed drop a note and ask if there is any way to get some of their wine either through a distributor a store or directly depending on all of the various laws all that said we should warn you the wine will never taste quite as good to you as it did on your trip mixing two wines my wife and i have been riesling fans for a long time i have grown away from the sweet ones more than my wife has the other night she opened a riesling that was too sweet for her and i had a sauvignon blanc that was too dry for her she decided to mix them and came up with something she liked i would not want to do this on a regular basis but what do you think joe f phelps boone n c youd be amazed how often we hear from people who mix wines they dont like and create something more palatable to them personally weve never tried it but gosh if you have two wines you dont like and theyre destined for disposal whats the harm of playing matchmaker wed also urge you before you mix to give each individual wine a chance to show its best change the temperature serve it with food leave it open for a while wines change after theyre opened so you could be surprised you should also consult a good wine merchant who might be able to suggest a single bottle that you would both enjoy
