cocktails by the pool but thats hardly the experience year old jean bruzzone had on a recent trip through the mediterranean aboard the passenger minerva ii "i spent a lot of time in the library by the fireplace and it was like being in an english country home " ms bruzzone says "a quartet played in the evenings and i enjoyed spending time with a marvelous shakespearean actor a few retired ambassadors and the bishop of london " ms bruzzone was on an educational cruise a voyage as much about learning as about relaxing large cruise lines such as cunard and crystal cruises as well as educational travel groups like elderhostel and smithsonian journeys are expanding both the number and types of shipboard classes "we have offered classes on our cruises for many years but now the classes are much more sophisticated and the caliber of instruction is much higher " says mimi weisband a spokeswoman for crystal cruises which offers courses on economics art and architecture among
