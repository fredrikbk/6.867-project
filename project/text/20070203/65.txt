attempt to persuade viewers to pig out on pizza spicy chicken wings and take out burgers harry balzer vice president of market research company npd group says americans will generally be eating what they always do on sundays fare such as chicken vegetables potatoes and salad thats as it should be say messrs trotter and palmer two of the countrys top chefs with two and nine restaurants respectively people may think finger food is the way to go for a super bowl party but making little nibbles for a crowd is a lot of work and requires too much time in the kitchen for a cook who wants

commercial distracts the cook mr palmers pulled pork is "not too sloppy lots of flavor and goes with any type of beverage " he says this weekend hell serve it with pinot noir because it has enough fruit and acid to balance the rich spicy pork which can be rewarmed in a degree oven as often as needed and mr trotter who remembers going to bears games at wrigley field with his father says his ribs
