pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations happy birthday mr reagan next tuesday would have been ronald reagans th birthday which is amazing when you consider he is in a way more with us than ever his memory and meaning summoned in political conversation his name evoked by candidates i remember years ago when there was controversy over the movement to name things for him buildings and airports i was away from home at the time and i realized that to talk to people in washington about it id have to land at jfk take the fdr drive and go through the lincoln tunnel this is america we remember our greats you tell yourself who you are by what you raise a statue to the other day a friend asked what do you think made him so likable to many who disagreed with him and who look back with nostalgia on his white house its funny that people like to talk about this even though they know the answers there was the courage to swim against the tide to show not a burst of bravery but guts in the long haul the good cheer and good nature that amounted to a kind of faith the air of pleasure reagan emanated on meeting others and his egalitarianism he thought everyone from nobel prize winners to doormen equal not that he wasnt aware of status when he stood behind errol flynn for a still photo to promote "santa fe trail " he knew of flynns towering reputation between shots reagan kept quietly pushing little piles of dirt together when he had a mound he stood on it so that he was literally of equal stature he told the story on himself for years because it was funny and he believed in laughter he was a little like art buchwald in this he thought laughter was a value of its own i think he thought that people who shared a laugh had in fact just voted for something together something funny and human just got said or done lesley stahl of " minutes" was cbss white house correspondent during the reagan administration and i asked her what she remembered most she said "we reporters would stake out the driveway to see who was going in to see the president in the first few years there was a stream of people who came to argue against his budget cutting proposals they would march up that driveway in a huff smoke coming out of their nostrils as they rehearsed their angry arguments about why he was destroying the lives of poor people or schoolkids "i remember specifically a group of mayors from big cities livid about cuts to their welfare programs school lunch programs etc they were there to give the president a scolding they were going to tell him and in theyd march two hours later out they came we were all ready with the cameras and the mikes to get their version of the telling off but they were all little lambs subdued he had charmed them the mayors told us reagan agreed with them that they had persuaded him "thirty minutes later larry speakes was in the press room telling us the numbers would not in fact change the mayors had misunderstood the president still ill bet anything if you talked to those mayors today they would tell you reagan was a great guy " she mentioned "his personal touch his gallantry " you knew he was a good man and you knew he meant it so you understood how he could be the biggest supporter of fdr and the new deal in and the most persuasive voice for barry goldwater in hed thought it through and changed not overnight but in time and with effort he could change his mind on abortion in the same way and not because he feared the base reagan was the base last week i was at a gathering of old reagan hands and i asked aloud if something that id heard might be true it was that mikhail gorbachev now lives in california and has a pool the minute i said it a longtime reagan friend laughed he knew where i was going reagan always said what he really wanted to do with a russian premier was get him in a helicopter ride over southern california point down at the million little houses and million little pools and say "mr gorbachev thats how the proletariat lives in america " but it wasnt true mr gorbachev lives in moscow where he has a think tank a former cabinet secretary told me mr gorbachev had given the secretary a tour and proudly noted that he paid for the building by renting out two floors "gorbachev has discovered the free market " the secretary said it was almost as good this led the reagan intimate to remember being on a private plane with him one day they had a steak and fine wine "reagan said to me you know i believe everyone in america can have these things i said you really believe that reagan said yes i do " the intimate said to me "see i dont believe that that anyone here can do it " then he paused "but its good to have a president who does " lately we are hearing of president reagans famous th commandment "speak no ill of a fellow republican " its a good rule for both parties but its good also to remember how he approached it in practice ronald reagan turned his own party upside down enraged its establishment and threatened its immediate future when in he mounted a fierce challenge to an incumbent republican president he ran full and hard against jerry ford and it was bitter the stakes were high the issue freedom at home and abroad reagan lost his challenge doomed ford in the general election and four years later reagan roared back and when he won the nomination he turned around and seriously considered as his running mate jerry ford when he ran against ford it wasnt personal and when he almost picked ford as his vice president that wasnt personal either it was more like this this is america we have been arguing about everything for years its what we do its our glory our politics then were grimmer yet had a lighter touch the soviets could nuke us tomorrow lets have a hellacious brawl it was a serious time but i dont think we were in general so somber so locked in the th commandment meant the fight should never be mean low or unnecessarily injurious to the person or the party but a fight could be waged should be waged over big big things that he knew that is part of why we remember him as great its part of why when you next fly to washington youll land at reagan national airport
