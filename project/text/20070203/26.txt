essay what to wear retirement has its own dress code and the rules are tough when i finally ditched the office flung off my pantyhose and retired to small town america the last thing i figured id be worrying about is what to wear ive since learned a little something about the daunting dress codes of retirement and how the laundry alone can kill you id spent my career in manhattan that hub of high fashion and while i cant pretend that it imbued me with chic or even that i was especially pulled together new york is a place where ordinary office workers sport uniforms that generally take the fuss and bother out of getting dressed the routine was simplicity itself awaken shower and slip into a suit and heels remain in this outfit all day until dropping into bed at night by contrast senior style and i use the term advisedly presents a raft of quandaries none of them simple now like some over age runway model during fashion week im perpetually changing costumes i start the day with a shower don a swimsuit under sweats for the gym reshower after my workout and change back into sweats for the trip home by late morning i may need to switch into something dressier for a lunch date or doctors appointment then its back into jeans for chores and dinner or if were going out i put on something dressy generally preceded by another shower toting it up that amounts to three showers two shampoos four different outfits and a mountain of laundry no wonder then that my friends and i think twice about leaving the house if it calls for another shower full makeup and a change of clothes on those rare days when we dont need to come up with something spiffy to wear say to get a blood test or an mri we can happily go to seed yes we sometimes feel a trifle guilty about lolling around in a bathrobe or faded sweatpants but its a fact that as you age it takes longer to make yourself presentable and the end result is never especially pleasing the physical act of getting dressed has become more taxing too shimmying into pantyhose and holding up the hair dryer can leave me ready for a short nap in palmier days when i actually got a salary most of our soiled clothes went to the dry cleaners now keeping up with the voluminous laundry is virtually a second career i once shared a shortcut with a friend advising her to dump freshly washed underwear into drawers without folding it she blanched at my trick confiding that her fastidious husband has three categories of underwear ranging from everyday to dress up that he carefully rotates in his drawer so that it wears out evenly it wasnt long after we left the new york area that i discovered my to work wardrobe was woefully incorrect those citified suits in grime defying blacks browns and grays look like widows weeds among the sequined sweaters and vibrant hues favored here in the south my wools and gabardines also are too heavy for this steamy climate and too restrictive for the "active adult lifestyle " i have not bowed completely to local custom however so far i have resisted pressure to wear a big flowery hat to the annual garden club luncheon nor do i own an embellished santa sweater i dont remember ever giving my husbands brooks brothers suits much thought over the course of our careers he even owned a custom tuxedo that served him well until our cat clawed up the satin lapels but now sprung from those rigid uniforms he requires close surveillance i have to pick my battles because there is nothing that irritates don more than my second guessing his choice of attire but when were going out and he is wearing a moth eaten sweater i feel i must speak up i also keep a sharp eye out for wrinkled shirts hes plucked straight from the ironing bundle ironing is the bottleneck in our household if a garment needs ironing it rarely gets worn on trips don packs for himself and once we reach our destination there can be ugly surprises on a recent trip to new york he brought one jacket so wrinkled and grimy it was appropriate only for excursions to the bowery alas our actual destination was a reunion at the yale club with his college roommates one of whom has an entire closet in his apartment filled with neatly folded dress shirts the other point of contention is dons army green padded jumpsuit a mainstay of his winter wardrobe i have only myself to blame for this horror i bought it for him at a hunting and fishing store to wear on our boat in brisk weather but he likes to wear it indoors as well over his clothes to ward off drafts it gives him the look of the michelin tire man except that since it shrunk in the wash the pant legs hit him about midcalf its so bulky it takes up an entire drawer to store off season and when it needs washing which is often it constitutes a full load unto itself nonetheless this garment seems to have special allure for men when dons brother saw it he dashed out and bought one for himself and so did his brothers next door neighbor to guard against just such fashion faux pas im told that some of the snazzier retirement communities enforce stringent dress codes the parents of our friend dave moved to a community in charlotte n c where dinner in the dining room was a buttoned up affair men had to wear jackets and ties and women dresses it was a nuisance at first but they eventually came around deciding that the regulations boosted morale and served as a bulwark against creeping sloppiness then a rebel faction petitioned the management to cordon off a small corner of the dining room for casual attire in subsequent visits dave watched as the casual section grew until it overtook the floor space occupied by holdouts who actually like to dress up for dinner all of this suggests a new and burgeoning market for retailers and designers my idea boils down to two words star trek we seniors could banish wardrobe woes if outfitted like crewmembers on the starship enterprise imagine it zippered stretchy packable and washable jumpsuits that resisted stains and wrinkles they could be embellished with sequins if the occasion required but please no santa appliques ms graham is a writer in virginia she can be reached at encore
