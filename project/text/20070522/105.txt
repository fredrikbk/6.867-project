the daily fix after cavs narrow loss to pistons jamess decision to pass is dissected online edition seconds left cleveland cavaliers have the ball they trail the detroit pistons by two in game of their conference finals the cavs lebron james has the ball at the top of the key and passes to donyell marshall whos wide open for a trey and mr marshall misses pistons win and the debate is on did mr james do the right thing "if you have a water cooler in your office go over and grab a drink and ask the guy whos standing there " writes chris sheridan on espn com "go ahead do it doesnt matter where your office is theres a guy over there by the water cooler dying to discuss this very issue hes waiting for you " "kid wise business athlete none of the lebrons managed to find his way to the free throw line on a night of too much sharing and caring on the part of the cavaliers best player " writes bud shaw in the cleveland plain dealer who adds that "the idea of going for the win on the road with the pass to marshall was defensible in theory in reality james never found a rhythm in the game and didnt seem inclined to test himself at the foul line for the first time all night " in the akron beacon journal terry pluto says it should never have come down to marshall or james "the cavs took more shots than the pistons " he writes "they had eight more rebounds they held detroit to points they did all that on the pistons home court how can you not win that game easy you cant score " in the detroit free press mitch albom is not exactly confident after the pistons narrow victory over the likes of zydrunas ilgauskas and anderson varejao "for most of the night the pistons were a step slow a step less aggressive and a few points behind on the scoreboard " mr albom writes "and heres the amazing part the damage was being done not by james the year old powerful whirlwind of superstardom but by a balding aging lithuanian giant and a frenetic jittering brazilian with a garden bush perched atop his head " "what is it with this team " asks drew sharp in the free press "why must they insist on making matters far more difficult than mandatory " mr sharp writes that "the only thing that matters for the pistons this season is winning the nba championship and that demands not needlessly overtaxing themselves because nothing theyll face in this collective waste disguised as the eastern conference comes remotely close in quality to what awaits them on the grandest stage but its a precarious existence flip saunders conceded his team dodged one monday and clearly hes grown tired of answering the same questions about the same sluggishness " if youre not the jazz spurs pistons or cavs todays a day to think about next season but next season will be much discussed tonight when teams representatives gather in secaucus n j for the draft lottery and the chance to draft greg oden or kevin durant next month all teams will be on tenterhooks with fans of the memphis grizzlies chance at the top pick boston celtics chance and the milwaukee bucks chance particularly on edge click here for a boston globe graphic detailing the lottery teams chances and here for carls explanation of how it works on espn com lz granderson discusses greg odens well lets call suburb cred "not only does oden own every cd but he also has all of will smiths movies and has seen every episode of the fresh prince of bel air " he writes "he also watches way too much cbs for a year old to look at greg oden his towering frame dark skin grizzly face he fits the stereotypical image of one not to mess with but to know greg oden how could you not the future lottery pick has this refreshing affinity for some of the corniest things middle america has to offer " mr grandersons biggest hope its that mr oden doesnt change "one of the reasons black men in general and specifically those in the nba have an image problem is because too many of us treat street cred as a precious commodity to obtain as opposed to what it really is the byproduct of unfortunate circumstances " he writes "the rationale is so perverse that otherwise friendly players will scowl in photo shoots and spin tales about the hustle despite growing up attending private schools in the suburbs or in a loving home with two parents listen regardless of what they will tell you every black person older than did not march with dr king and every black nba player did not dodge bullets to get to school " the draft lotterys outcome will breed conspiracy theories the nba is dealey plaza for fans determined to see a hidden hand behind anything and everything but as mike wise writes in the washington post the conspirators seem to have missed their calling in this years playoffs "boy that david stern he sure fixed things " he writes "he conspired so well that lebron james is the last thing resembling a q rating left in the playoffs the one basketball player an on the fence fan might go indoors on a sunday to watch watching the nbas final four at home with the rest of us now are shaquille oneal dwyane wade dirk nowitzki josh howard allen iverson anthony tracy mcgrady yao ming shawn marion jason kidd vince carter and richard jefferson it raises a daunting question for the nba consumer what is it you really want to simply be entertained to watch gilbert arenas detonate for and marion to levitate above the rim or do you want the toughness and togetherness that breeds a champion and pushes the tenets of the game to the highest levels as this star less postseason has shown you cant have both " the new york yankees have won two straight games beating the crosstown mets and the boston red sox but the bronx bombers are still in trouble games behind boston and seven out of a wild card spot yes the fix knows its may and so does tim marchman of the new york sun but he has a question nonetheless if this is the year the yankees finally collapse is that such a bad thing for the team "for the yankees the complex of decisions and opportunities presented by the expiration of so many contracts is more important than the question of whether or not they make the playoffs this year " he writes "after all theyre very very rich and they have young talent falling short this year is not going to doom them to irrelevance it would though allow them the chance to make decisions based on the long term interests of the team even better it would allow them to think about what those long term interests are " howard porter perhaps the greatest player in the history of villanova hoops is in grave condition in a minnesota hospital the victim of a savage beating mr porters id was taken in the assault and he went unidentified until he was reported missing and tv stations showed his picture "do you know this man " muses rich hofmann in the philadelphia daily news "my god in march of everybody knew howard porter time is relentless and the decades are unforgiving and we all know that but this is stunning do you know this man everybody knew howard porter everybody here everybody in the country after that ncaa tournament was over " and that was just the beginning as mr hofmann notes "porters story is like all philadelphia sports stories that is to say it is complicated " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well consider
