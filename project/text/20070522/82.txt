politics &amp economics senate immigration measure to raise liability for employers plan would certify every u s worker increase penalties washington it is called eevs pronounced eves and it could be one of the poison apples in the immigration overhaul bill that the senate begins debating today the employment eligibility verification system would require employers to review the work and identity documents of all million u s workers within three years and then hold ceos responsible for certifying that those workers are legally eligible to hold their jobs "its like throwing a huge net to catch a few minnows " says randel johnson a vice president of the u s chamber of commerce as the immigration bill moved to the senate floor following a vote last night business groups worried that the worker verification requirements of the bill would put a huge new responsibility on employers who have grown reliant on immigrant workers even while national policy allows relatively few of them to live and work here legally in a trade off between democrats and business friendly republicans on the one hand and social conservatives and national security hawks on the other the compromise bill would legalize most of the million illegal immigrants now in the u s and set up a huge temporary worker program but it also would require the government to tighten border controls and employers to purge their work forces of illegal employees the senate measure builds on a law that requires employers to ask new workers to prove who they are and that they have a right to work in the u s by producing any of a number of documents including passports social security cards and drivers licenses currently employers can voluntarily compare those documents against social security and department of homeland security databases using a system called basic pilot the senate measure would expand the basic pilot system to a national clearinghouse called eevs where employers would submit the names of workers and within days learn if they are eligible to hold a job employer groups including the u s chamber of commerce have endorsed the need for a worker verification procedure but say the proposal laid out in the senate bill moves too fast and includes too many workers under the bill employers would have to submit the names of all new employees to eevs within months they would have to review the documents of all workers even those hired decades ago and submit that data within three years for federal contractors and others involved in national security verification procedures would begin as soon as the bill is passed employers contend that will put a huge strain on an employment verification system that is used by only of all employers and is considered unreliable because of holes in the government database the bill also puts new legal responsibilities on companies chief executives will be required to sign off on compliance certificates and could face perjury charges if their companys verification documents arent in order employers who now arent required to verify that a workers documents are genuine would face a slightly tougher test of liability those papers would have to appear genuine to "a reasonable person " the bill proposes penalties for hiring an illegal worker would be increased to &# a worker for a first offense from &# and as much as &# a worker for a third offense civil liberties groups also are wary of the verification requirements because they would require most workers to produce identity cards with fingerprints or other biometric data the bill also requires the social security administration to start issuing fraud resistant cards and study whether it can include a picture or other personal data on the card a requirement that will inflame that debate "the threat this poses to our privacy is extraordinary " said tim sparapani of the american civil liberties union the bill will face its first hurdle today in an amendment sponsored by sen jeff bingaman d n m that would reduce the number of temporary workers permitted to arrive each year from to a similar amendment passed by a wide margin during last years immigration debate and if it did so again would be a big disappointment to the business community dozens of other amendments are expected to be filed with democrats trying to increase the ability of future immigrants to gain citizenship and republicans trying to increase enforcement and security provisions senators who produced the bill last week are likely to oppose any changes they see as endangering the delicate political balance that has brought the proposal to the floor see related letter "letters to the editor into the sunlight plan for worker eligibility" wsj june
