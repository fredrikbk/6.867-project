astrazeneca thinks bigger new chief increases commitment to large molecule biological drugs for years british drug maker astrazeneca plc concentrated on developing what much of the rest of big pharma was toiling over so called small molecule drugs made from chemical compounds now under chief executive david brennan the pharmaceuticals giant is making a big bet on "large molecule" drugs also widely known as biological drugs made from genetically engineered versions of human proteins the drugs active ingredients are hundreds of times larger than compounds found in most chemical pills biological drugs have been some of the most innovative and lucrative drugs to hit the market in recent years in the u s sales have increased to &# billion in from &# billion in according to the biotechnology industry organization a trade group and unlike chemical drugs biological treatments usually dont face generic competition because manufacturing and regulatory hurdles make them difficult to copy a four year drive to boost biological drug research at astrazeneca accelerated under mr brennan who took over as ceo in january and has turned to acquisitions to reach that goal last month mr brennan scooped up a biological drug trailblazer medimmune inc gaithersburg md for &# billion other big pharma companies have taken a similar approach pfizer inc has acquired several biological focused companies in recent years and novartis ag and sanofi aventis sa are aiming to boost the number of biological drugs in their development pipelines mr brennan said he has been impressed with a slew of new biological drugs that smaller biotechnology companies have been churning out in recent years including drugs for cancer and arthritis "some of these products have demonstrated that theyre not just symptomatic treatments but that they actually alter the course of the disease " he said in a recent interview in london astrazeneca badly needs new products several of its top selling drugs are facing generic competition and the company has sustained some setbacks in developing new medicines in recent years astrazenecas sales last year rose to &# billion while profit rose to &# billion but analysts say earnings will come under pressure in coming years unless astrazeneca improves its development of new drugs to go after biological drugs astrazeneca faces some big cultural challenges because large molecule drug research is relatively new it has been dominated by small firms that pounced on the science early many of the best scientists in the field are accustomed to working in entrepreneurial environments to recruit and retain them astrazeneca may need to provide them a similar atmosphere mr brennan will need to meld the entrepreneurial staff of at medimmune into astrazeneca which has employees and research sites around the world astrazeneca is offering medimmune scientists a bonus if they agree to stay with astrazeneca for a year or more medimmunes chief executive david mott will run astrazenecas biologicals unit which will also include cambridge antibody technology another biotech company known as cat that astrazeneca acquired for &# billion last year cat was strong in discovering potential new drugs but lacked the staff and infrastructure to develop all of its discoveries and bring them to market mr brennan said in particular cat lacked manufacturing capacity something the medimmune acquisition will supply medimmunes head of research and development james young has agreed to work for astrazeneca mr brennan said though he added the medimmune executives exact role hasnt yet been determined astrazeneca currently has a head of research and a separate head of development medimmunes largest products are an antibody drug for respiratory infections in children and an intravenous drug that reduces the toxicity of some chemotherapy treatments most of the companys sales of &# billion last year came from the u s many of the experimental drugs the company is testing are still at early stages of development including drugs for lupus asthma and cancer mr brennan said astrazeneca will have a chemicals unit and a biologicals unit but he is still deciding how separately the businesses will be managed he said he wants to give medimmune researchers as much autonomy as possible inside astrazeneca "there are certain areas where well come together and others where its very appropriate to keep the biologicals organization running very separately " he said
