politics &amp economics early voting may clip iowas role advance balloting in big primaries changes calculus the front loading of the election continued yesterday with florida becoming the latest big state to move up its primary but even before the official votes kick off in iowa on jan large numbers of voters around the country already will have cast their ballots as major states encourage voting far in advance of election day floridas primary is now scheduled for jan and about states including california have moved theirs up to feb many of them also allow early voting weeks before their official balloting dates this early voting could dilute the traditional role played by iowa and new hampshire in providing early momentum for candidates or dooming campaigns to failure early votes in large delegate rich states could favor the front runners in both parties that in turn could stem the exodus of early fair weather supporters in the event of an early upset since front runners already could have votes locked up before the damaging news breaks early voting also tends to reward campaigns that can pay for large organizations that can corral supporters and help them navigate the process that could help limit the ability of a dark horse to leverage momentum from an early win as jimmy carter famously did with iowa in in many of the states that allow advance balloting voters have responded with gusto the california secretary of states office says million people have joined a permanent absentee voter program meaning ballots are automatically mailed to them about a month before each election in the primary million california voters or cast mail ballots the early voting trend may scramble the campaigning calculus in particular among republicans where leading candidates rudy giuliani and john mccain seem particularly vulnerable with the social conservatives dominating in iowa new hampshire and south carolina which also has traditionally had an early influential slot in the process "though iowa and new hampshire and south carolina are important we can put less of our chips there " said one giuliani campaign aide this aide said the campaign will use a "return on investment formula" to determine where to push an early voting strategy the giuliani campaign has been concentrating a lot of effort so far on florida texas and california mccain spokesman danny diaz said the arizona senator "is prepared for early voting and has a plan in place " he added that "its not just a matter of securing early votes its a matter of getting those supporters out to gather additional votes " iowas jan caucuses for both parties will be followed by a nevada caucus on jan new hampshire holds the first primary on jan in south carolina democrats will vote jan republicans there havent yet set a date but have said they are committed to being first among southern states including florida that still gives those states their first in the nation status but florida followed by at least six others holding primaries on feb has made it easy for voters to cast ballots weeks ahead of election day unrestricted early voting will begin in early january in california and illinois and in mid january in florida texas and colorado new hampshire and south carolina by contrast discourage early voting though iowa and nevada allow early voting in the general elections their caucus systems used in the nominating process require voters to cast ballots in person on election day acting on calls in recent years to make voting easier in response to low turnout rates many states have relaxed rules for early and absentee voting allowing citizens to cast ballots by mail or at pre set sites in the weeks leading up to an election only states and the district of columbia continue to bar early voting or to make it difficult to cast ballots early most of these holdouts are in new england or the midwest relaxed early voting procedures are relatively new in most states and while both major parties maneuvered to take advantage of the system for the november general election it hasnt been a discernible factor before in the nominating process it remains to be seen what effect the trend will have on the nominations generally speaking the typical early voter is likely to be older and more suburban than those who weigh in on election day says paul gronke a political science professor who heads the nonpartisan early voting information center at reed college in oregon they also tend to be more ideologically driven which may make them more enthusiastic about the candidates they pick and thus more likely to assume activist or volunteer roles those traits make them especially valuable to a campaign and thus more crucial for a candidate to lock in early because many states report ballots mailed and ballots returned as a matter of public record including the voters names early voters can expect to be deluged with information from presidential supplicants "on the day youre mailed an absentee ballot expect to get pieces of mail the next day " says alexander heckler a miami lawyer and democratic fund raiser who has committed to new york sen hillary rodham clintons campaign mr heckler who was broward county co chairman of democratic contender john kerrys campaign in and was familiar with the early voting strategy for south florida says locking up early votes has become standard practice in florida in recent years where about a third of the electorate casts ballots before election day "it would be irresponsible for a campaign not to have an early voting strategy " he said will early voting really change the political landscape mr gronke says it is hard to say with any certainty just because voters get their ballots early doesnt mean they have to cast them early and the early primary and caucus states retain some measure of influence the early ballots wont be counted until jan in florida and feb for california and the states holding primaries on that day actual results will still be available in iowa new hampshire and nevada before anywhere else "the media pays attention to results " mr gronke said
