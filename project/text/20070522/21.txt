business technology talking tech ceiling height versus performance sometimes it can make a difference if you supervise a staff of computer programmers you might be better off putting them in a room with low ceilings joan meyers levy a professor at the university of minnesotas carlson school of management did a series of tests in which students had various tasks to perform on a laptop computer some in a room with high ceilings some not the finding students in rooms with high ceilings consistently did better on tasks where they had to see relationships between things while those under lower ceilings excelled at detail oriented work prof meyers levy explained q what made you think about doing a study of ceiling heights in the first place a i was at the airport waiting for my plane to be called and was thinking about how i was in a reasonably open space but that i would soon have to go into this cramped one with low ceilings it started me thinking about ceiling heights and wondering whether ceiling height could affect the way we think about things q how did you do the study a we were able to find two rooms in the building that we work in that were identical each with foot ceilings we then had an engineer install a false ceiling in one of the rooms which took that one to an eight foot ceiling q how do people think differently with different ceiling heights a with a higher ceiling we see relationships between different pieces of information and focus on the similarities between things as opposed to points of differences the inverse would be true in the case of a lower ceiling height the lower ceiling is making you process in a more detailed fashion with the higher ceiling heights what seems to happen is that people subconsciously get a sense of freedom from the spaciousness of the room and in lower ceilings we are activating thoughts related to a sense of confinement or some kind of limitation and these thoughts shape the kind of processing we do so we process more freely in the case of higher ceilings and we process in a more focused and detailed way in lower ceilings q what is an example of how your tests showed that a in one we gave the students anagram tests in which they had to unscramble letters to make a word some of the anagrams were synonyms for the concept of freedom "liberation" might have been one of them others were synonyms for confinement and others were just irrelevant like "cheese " we measured how fast they were in solving the anagrams with high ceilings we found students were faster in solving the freedom related ones than people were with low ceilings but in low ceilings they were faster in solving the confinement related ones and there was no difference for the irrelevant ones like "cheese " q what should the designers of office buildings do about this a perhaps you want different ceiling heights depending on what kind of work is going to be done if youve got your financial people your accountants people who were working with a lot of detail a lower ceiling height should in fact help them to focus on detail and do their jobs on the other hand if you have people involved in longer term strategy or bigger ideas or coming up with new creative ideas or products or innovative concepts where you are looking at the broader picture and want to see relationship between things then you want a higher ceiling
