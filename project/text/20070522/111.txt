business day sign up for the e mail here if youre looking for a fight in the middle east you are likely to get one which is why extremists along the regions many fault lines have so often succeeded at stoking the flames of war when peace minded locals and outsiders are trying to quench them the battle currently waged between an islamist militant group and lebanese troops at a palestinian refugee camp near tripoli may or may not be part of one of the larger storied conflicts that have defined lebanons modern history but its a pretty good bet that whatever their bigger motive fighters of fatah islam group knew what they would be provoking by attacking government soldiers from a civilian filled camp that has been off limits to officials under a decades long deal and that itself is part of an incendiary humanitarian mess more than half a century old the government continued to attack the nahr el bared camp this morning with artillery and machine guns in a campaign authorized by the countrys shaky cabinet palestinian refugees have been hiding in their homes there since the fighting began and palestinian officials reported nine civilian deaths yesterday as well as shortages of food and medical supplies the associated press reports fatah islam threatened to take their fight across the country the new york times reports but their ability to do so wasnt clear like any islamist militant band the group is thought to have ideological and possibly personnel links with al qaeda one member killed in the early battles on sunday was a fugitive suspect in a failed german train bombing and as the new york times reports fatah islam "has been a growing concern for security authorities" in lebanon and elsewhere in the region with intelligence officials telling the paper the group counts between and fighters in its ranks "leaders of the group have in the past claimed that they aimed to send trained fighters into iraq " the times adds and it cites lebanese television stations reporting that bangladeshis yemenites and other non lebanese arabs were found among the dead militants the fatah islam fighters have employed antiaircraft guns and mortars and even used night vision goggles a piece of sophisticated equipment the lebanese army lacks the times says but what holds the army back most is the prospect of inflicting large scale casualties among civilians who get in the way which could invariably lead to comparisons with sabra and shatila the palestinian refugee camps where a christian lebanese militia allied with israel massacred hundreds or thousands of civilians in such an incident could bring down an already wobbly lebanese government and in a region where motive is the primary component of rampant conspiracy theorizing thats what makes syria a suspect for some walid jumblatt a druze leader and veteran of lebanons civil wars in the governments parliamentary bloc tells the wall street journal the fatah islam fight is a "new syrian counterattack" aimed at destabilizing the country and staving off the united nations prosecution of suspects in the killing of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri syria denies it the fighting near tripoli has caught the regions attention with arab league secretary general amr moussa expressing worry yesterday alongside u n emissary to the region terje roed larsen as le monde reports it is just one example of violent extremists ability to leverage violence for larger geopolitical gain hamas dropping all pretense of a cease fire yesterday pledged to renew its suicide bombing against israel after the israeli leadership said it would target senior hamas politicians including palestinian prime minister ismail haniya as the times of london reports israel continues to hit hamas targets in the gaza strip in retaliation for rockets fired into israel which last night claimed their first israeli fatality since november a politically weakened prime minister ehud olmert is less likely to use restraint in responding and iraq too the axiom of leveraged extremist violence also applies to iraq where a car bomb this morning killed at least people and injured at an outdoor marketplace in baghdad the blast took place in a shiite dominated neighborhood which suggests it could be the work of al qaeda in iraq with such horrible attacks seemingly commonplace in iraq and helping to define the story there u s hopes for change may be harder to maintain president bush said yesterday that he called prime minister nouri al maliki on the anniversary of mr malikis first day in office to offer a show of confidence as the los angeles times reports and mr bush also said "an important moment" in the war will come in september when he receives an assessment of current policy

the new england journal of medicine links a widely used diabetes drug made by glaxosmithkline with an increased risk of heart attack and cardiovascular disease the so called meta analysis of several

authored by cleveland based dr steven nissen who helped make public early safety concerns about the now withdrawn painkiller vioxx the wall street journal points out adding that it underscores how the vioxx outcry has helped to empower critics that challenge blockbuster drugs "dr nissen started his quest to gather data about avandias risks last year after he spotted what he thought were hints of trouble in published studies " the journal says "along the way he set congressional investigations into motion and last month hit pay dirt with a google search that pointed him to a trove of study data brushing aside the arguments of glaxo executives who rushed to cleveland he pushed his concerns into one of the worlds top medical journals in just a few weeks " glaxo said yesterday that it
