if terrorists respect only the fist then why not pound them as usual bernard lewis has it exactly right "was osama right " editorial page may muslim extremists only respect the fist and the willingness to use it unfortunately we may pay a very dear price for the bush administrations ineptitude in iraq eric shinseki said at the beginning that we would need troops on the ground to pacify iraq he was apparently right yet the administration has contented itself with five years of inadequate troop strength allowing our professional army to be chewed up in the maw of terrorist attacks inadequate troop numbers have yielded indifferent results and a call to pull out if the administration really believes we are fighting the war on terror where is the call for a draft where is the call for a war tax to fund what must be done the bush administration cannot have it both ways if this is the war on terror lets fight it like we intend to win if it isnt worth an all out fight then why do it at all rubin guttman cleveland mr lewis argues that weakness on the part of america has provoked radical muslim terrorist attacks against the u s and in contrast the forceful international approach of the soviet union immunized it from such attacks his historical examples do not hold up under scrutiny he states that during the troubles in lebanon in the s and s american installations and individuals were frequently assaulted while there was only one incident involving soviet citizens in which one was killed and some others kidnapped the soviets took action against the kidnappers family resulting in the release of the kidnapped russians and no soviet citizen or installation was subsequently harassed moreover he argues when the soviet union invaded afghanistan in there was no arab or muslim outcry from south yemen algeria syria libya or the plo it must be noted that during this period the u s was a close ally of israel that alliance and the u s being a predominately christian nation were reasons enough for it to be targeted by muslim extremists in addition the soviet union was allied with several arab nations and was a supporter of terrorism muslim reluctance to attack russians more likely reflected a desire not to bite the hand that feeds them rather than fear of retribution finally the stiff resistance of the afghanis under soviet rule demonstrated muslim willingness to take on a superpower no matter how fierce mr lewiss interpretation is too narrowly focused on perceptions of strength and weakness there are many other factors joseph kaufman mission viejo calif i would be a little more reluctant than mr lewis to subscribe to the perception that the u s is "pampered" and "degenerate " its certainly true that there had previously been no u s response like the one that followed however there had also been no islamist attack on american soil the distinction in american reactions is historically consistent the vast body of the american people has always shown itself to be isolationist not uncaring about world affairs but certainly not interventionist unless a direct attack occurs on the country then american opinions change instantaneously a few good examples  in the first decade of the th century we routinely tolerated french harassment of american shipping and later in that same decade when the winds of the napoleonic wars changed we tolerated british harassment that is until british troops crossed the canadian border which led to the war of  we tolerated cajolery of american citizens in mexican provinces especially texas until cajolery turned into armed suppression and the forced imposition of abolition and catholicism then we changed tact annexed texas and seized a third of mexico  perhaps most famously americans deplored but stoutly refused to stop japanese brutality in china despite strong u s ties to that country including the presence of a large number of u s missionaries the same goes for our response to nazi aggression in europe even after september president roosevelt had to twist congressional arms to allow military sales to britain and the price he paid was a renewed neutrality act which still in theory mandated equal treatment of allies and axis the royal navy got in the way of lending anything to the nazis but nonetheless the neutrality act is often missing from our history books this "america first" idea only changed and changed suddenly after the attack on pearl harbor one day later congresss vote to intervene in world war ii was unanimous so where does all that leave us with respect to iraq right where we were i think both before and events in iraq as tragic as they are dont seem to directly affect the interests of the american people isolationism has set in again and hence the shift in "public discourse" mr lewis laments at the end of his article far from a symptom of degeneration mr lewis should instead take comfort that this is all in keeping with american history if osama wants a renewed u s response all he need do is attack the country once more dan kruger williamsburg va see related letters "letters to the editor america the
