medical detective sequel for vioxx critic attack on diabetes pill glaxo shares plunge as dr nissen sees risk to heart from avandia an analysis linking the widely used diabetes drug avandia to higher risk of heart attacks represents a serious blow to glaxosmithkline plc and underscores how outside critics have been empowered to challenge big selling drugs after the outcry over the withdrawn painkiller vioxx glaxo rang up more than &# billion in world wide sales of avandia last year its share price fell more than after the new england journal of medicine released the analysis by prominent cardiologist steven nissen of the cleveland clinic who helped raise early safety concerns about vioxx the analysis suggested that people on avandia have a higher chance of suffering a heart attack glaxo said it "strongly disagrees" with his conclusions which come from a "meta analysis" in which results from many trials are combined glaxo said data sources it considers more reliable suggest that avandia is no riskier for the heart than other diabetes medications dr nissen started his quest to gather data about avandias risks last year after he spotted what he thought were hints of trouble in published studies along the way he set congressional investigations into motion and last month hit pay dirt with a google search that pointed him to a trove of study data brushing aside the arguments of glaxo executives who rushed to cleveland he pushed his concerns into one of the worlds top medical journals in just a few weeks one issue coming under congressional scrutiny is whether the food and drug administration should have acted faster to alert the public about possible risk from avandia glaxo performed its own meta analysis which also showed a potential danger it shared an early version of it with the fda in september and a more complete one in august the findings werent reflected on the u s label which is supposed to give a comprehensive review of the drugs risks robert meyer head of the fda office that oversees diabetes drugs said the agency is still working on its analysis "we have other data that suggests we cant make a definitive conclusion at this point " said dr meyer although he called the meta analyses "a signal of concern " the news sent doctors and patients taking avandia scurrying to re evaluate their options alternatives include a similar drug actos made by takeda pharmaceutical co which didnt show a link to heart attacks or strokes in a trial published in the lancet in diabetes treatments that work in different ways such as merck &amp co s januvia and older drugs like metformin could also gain sales "cardiovascular disease is far and away the leading cause of death in diabetes if you find a diabetes drug increases the risk of heart attacks the consequences are so grave that it warrants urgent action " said dr nissen the year old chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the cleveland clinic in an interview dr nissen has consulted for drug companies including glaxo he is leading a small clinical trial of actos funded by takeda he gives his drug industry payments to charity and said his work for takeda doesnt affect his view of competing drugs cindy roth a diabetes patient in whitewater kan said the news about avandia is a "little bit of a scare " in particular because heart problems run in her family "i thought great just one more thing " she said ms roth said she would follow her doctors advice on whether to stop taking the drug outside specialists are in a more powerful position these days to challenge marketed drugs after the withdrawal of mercks arthritis drug vioxx and other well publicized safety issues the fda is under pressure to respond more aggressively to signals of possible danger prodded by lawmakers and medical journals companies have put large databases of once secret information about clinical trials online the fdas web site also contains significant data on approved drugs dr nissens googling turned up a public database that glaxosmithkline created after it was sued over its antidepressant paxil the company had been accused of burying information about paxil including possible links to suicidal thinking in adolescents dr nissens analysis of avandia combined studies in addition to showing higher heart attack risk it showed a elevated risk of death from cardiovascular causes such as heart attack and stroke although the latter result didnt meet a standard statistical test for significance the absolute risk of heart attacks and death was still low among people in dr nissens analysis who took avandia the rate of heart attack was between and while the cardiovascular death rate was between and about seven million people world wide have taken avandia and about one million americans are currently using it glaxosmithkline said avandia is the london based companys second biggest seller after the asthma medication advair and last year various forms of the drug represented of the u s market for oral diabetes treatments according to the company glaxo has been studying avandia as a possible treatment for people with early signs of diabetes and alzheimers patients democratic rep henry waxman of california said he will hold a hearing in early june and summon fda commissioner andrew von eschenbach glaxo chief executive jean pierre garnier and dr nissen a sharply worded editorial in the new england journal of medicine accompanying dr nissens study said "regulatory action by the food and drug administration is now warranted " the editorial questioned the measure of effectiveness the fda typically uses to approve diabetes drugs the agency mostly examines how well the drugs reduce blood sugar which is supposed to be a surrogate for improving more important outcomes like heart disease the fda said yesterday it has strong evidence to suggest that reducing blood sugar translates into real world benefit for patients diabetes specialists were divided yesterday over whether patients taking avandia should stop "patients and physicians need to take this seriously in the absence of other data " said david nathan a professor at harvard university while calling the nissen analysis "imperfectly done " he said "since heart disease is the major killer of people with diabetes its hard to imagine why you would use a drug that might increase the risk of heart disease " john buse president elect of the american diabetes association and a professor at the university of north carolina said hes "not sure the data are strong enough to encourage wholesale switching" from avandia "i doubt avandia would be associated with a increase in risk when the studies are done " he said dr nissen has long been one of the nations most prominent cardiologists in the past few years he has increasingly focused on drug safety he was co author of a analysis that flagged a possible heart risk with vioxx and a similar painkiller celebrex merck initially dismissed the concerns but pulled vioxx three years later when its own study confirmed the risk in dr nissen published an article in the journal of the american medical association raising concerns about the cardiovascular risks associated with pargluva a diabetes drug that an fda advisory panel had voted in favor of the fda declined to approve the drug and the companies hoping to market it merck and bristol myers squibb co abandoned the effort dr nissen said that after his article about pargluva appeared he received an email from a leading diabetes expert who suggested that avandia raised similar concerns although their mode of action isnt identical both pargluva and avandia work by affecting what are known as peroxisome proliferator activated receptors or ppars these are receptors in a cells nucleus that affect a broad range of human genes because of their wide effect many experimental ppar drugs have been derailed by safety problems including possible hazards to the heart kidney and muscles as well as tumors in animals nonetheless more than ppar drugs are being studied by pharmaceutical companies because the potential benefits are big too according pharmaprojects a unit of informa healthcare ltd in type diabetes patients dont produce enough insulin a hormone needed to convert sugar and other food into energy or their cells ignore the insulin that is being produced avandia and actos another ppar drug increase the sensitivity of cells to insulin lowering blood sugar after their introduction in avandia and actos both soon became multibillion dollar a year sellers the labels on the two drugs have warned that they can cause fluid retention leading to congestive heart failure a chronic condition in which the heart has trouble pumping blood but regulators generally saw that as a manageable side effect signs of heart failure can be spotted early and treated with drugs whereas in a heart attack blood is choked off from the heart and immediate death can result dr nissen said that even before the email he had favored actos he had been nervous about avandia because its label shows it is tied to an increase in ldl or "bad" cholesterol though company salespeople reassured him that hdl or "good" cholesterol also rose dr nissen began following avandia closely and was struck last year by the results of two major trials of the drug published in the new england journal of medicine and the lancet the two studies showed the drug was effective in controlling blood sugar but dr nissen thought they held signs of cardiovascular problems he asked kathy wolski a cleveland clinic statistician to do a rough analysis combining studies published about the drug the numbers when added together hinted at problems but didnt prove anything "i honestly thought we werent going to go any further with it " ms wolski said "he did not let it go he was like a dog with a bone " dr nissen wrote to glaxosmithkline in early january asking for more data the company offered to collaborate with him but said it wanted to crunch the numbers itself dr nissen countered that the cleveland clinic needed full access to all the raw information and the right to publish as it pleased talks over the matter were inconclusive the cardiologist also shared his early results with congressional staffers hoping they would use their authority to get the fda to share trial results filed by the company aides to democratic rep john dingell of michigan and mr waxman called fda officials in on march to discuss their handling of avandia in the end it turned out humble internet searches were all dr nissen needed in mid april he found online the fda document detailing the agencys original review of the drug then in a google search dr nissen found the online database of glaxo study results many of the trial summaries included heart attack data dr nissen made another discovery in scrolling through the web site the company itself had done a meta analysis similar to the one he was attempting and quietly posted the result the analysis which didnt appear to include the two big trials published last year tied the drug to a higher risk of events involving an obstruction of blood flow such as heart attacks the rate for people taking avandia was compared with for other patients glaxos summary said that "no definitive conclusion can be drawn " it noted that a separate study using a large database kept by a health insurer hadnt shown evidence of risk "we are confident about the safety profile of avandia " said ronald krall glaxos chief medical officer yesterday glaxo said ongoing trials havent shown signs of a risk the web site was a "gold mine " dr nissen said on may he and ms wolski sent the new england journal of medicine a manuscript tying avandia to a statistically significant heart risk glaxo learned of the submission and dispatched four executives to cleveland dr krall argued that the data didnt clearly show a risk glaxo said yesterday that the meta analysis technique isnt the most rigorous way to reach conclusions about safety issues because it combines studies that are designed differently and the data collected in the studies may not be comparable dr nissen said the meeting was "very collegial and respectful " but the glaxo team didnt change his mind about the safety concerns the new england journal sharply accelerated its usual review process "we felt it was our responsibility not to take eight nine weeks to get this out " said jeffrey drazen editor in chief with the data now public the battle may shift to capitol hill in a letter to the fda dated april the house democrats plus republican sen charles grassley expressed concern that "tens of thousands of excess heart attacks may have occurred" since the fda began reviewing data from glaxos internal meta analysis yesterday the senate finance committee chairman montana democrat max baucus and sen grassley sent a letter to glaxo mentioning "reports that gsk employees silenced one or more medical professionals who attempted to speak out about the potential for cardiovascular problems with avandia " in a statement the company called the suggestion "absolutely false " jeanne whalen and sarah rubenstein contributed to this article
