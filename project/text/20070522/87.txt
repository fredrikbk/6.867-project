review &amp outlook editorial jack the stripper it isnt every day that videos of the house floor get a link on youtube so give a nod to pennsylvania powerhouse jack murtha whose spending threats against fellow members have earned the house appropriations process some real airtime during negotiations over an intelligence bill last week mr murtha took exception to two colleagues who challenged an earmark for his district so he let them know whos their daddy the episode has backfired however as republicans yesterday introduced a house resolution to reprimand mr murtha for his bullying under an ethics rule passed by democrats this year house members are banned from blocking earmarks based on the way a member votes but what do they do now that one of their own is caught doing a tom delay imitation the altercation went down as mr murtha tried to adorn an intelligence bill with &# million in funding for the national drug intelligence center in the narcotics hotbed of johnstown pennsylvania michigan republican mike rogers questioned the earmark for a project that has been tagged even by the mainstream press as a "boondoggle" and the house government reform committee called an "expensive and duplicative" use of scarce resources but when mr rogers proposed using that &# million for other intelligence work mr murtha blew a gasket "i hope you dont have any earmarks in the defense appropriations bills " mr murtha told him "because they are gone and you will not get any earmarks now and forever " mr murtha administered a similar lashing to republican todd tiahrt for his objection to the same &# million cameras rolled as a crimson mr murtha barreled up to mr tiahrt to express his displeasure on the house floor finger wagging all of this has a certain sandbox quality but then democrats did campaign last year against the same kind of earmark abuses mr murtha is now committing back in november reforming appropriations was a key goal for democrats who rode a wave of anger over republican earmarking scandals one way to do that nancy pelosi said at the time was to require that sponsors be identified were all for transparency but in practice some members may refrain from challenging earmarks from congressional heavies if theyre threatened mr murtha surely considers himself one of these and his reaction to the recent challenges doesnt suggest a sunny atmosphere about earmark sunshine democrats now have a choice which is to go along with the public reprimand for a visible leader or go soft on one of their signature campaign promises ms pelosi took a stab at defending mr murtha on the sunday tv shows saying she had "no idea what actually happened" during the exchange but thinks mr murthas a great guy in general "i do know that republicans caused quite a stir " she said uh huh as for mr murtha his office is responding to the incident by saying only that "the committee and staff give every democrat and republican the same consideration " which is to say no consideration at all if you disagree with his pennsylvania eminence so what about all those democratic promises to "clean up the house"
