andrei lugovoi from russia to face charges in connection with the radioactive poisoning death of the former soviet agent alexander litvinenko the saga carried all the markings of a cold war espionage drama capturing international attention and whipping up anxiety that the isotope that felled mr litvinenko could hurt others withering away in a london hospital bed mr litvinenko claimed that he had been targeted by the kremlin for his criticisms of president vladimir putin and exiled billionaire boris berezovsky said the victim had said from his death bed that he suspected that mr lugovoi a former kgb agent had poisoned him when the two men met at a london hotel late last year the kremlin has denied any role in mr litvinenkos death and mr lugovoi maintained his innocence dismissing the extradition request as politically motivated according to russian media russia made it clear that it had no intention of turning mr lugovoi over to the british saying such a move would contradict its laws relations between the countries were already sour russia accused four british diplomats of spying last year and the kremlin is furious that britain provided refuge to mr berezovsky who hastened

putin is scheduled to leave office next year it seems he will continue to cast a long shadow over his country reuters reported that boris gryzlov leader of the united russia party introduced what he called "the putin plan " ideas culled from putin addresses that would be fashioned into a sort of manifesto for the party in coming parliamentary elections and that mr putin would continue to function
