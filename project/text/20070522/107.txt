the game latest fad in big buyouts blend of public private traits taking companies private is yesterdays news wall streets latest innovation is refashioning them into private ish or public esque hybrids of their former selves prey such as clear channel communications inc are being devoured by deal hungry buyout shops the &# billion acquisition of the radio broadcaster cleared by the san antonio companys board last week wont look like the giant deals of last year it actually will be staying kind of public with restless shareholders given the chance to own as much as of the newly formed company after it is acquired by thomas h lee partners lp and bain capital llc the shares will probably trade in a remote corner of the stock market on the over the counter pink sheets meanwhile investment firm oaktree capital management is raising &# million in a stock sale but only to a select group of institutions in a private placement its shares will trade in a new closed market set up by goldman sachs group inc free of many of the regulatory burdens attached to a stock listing does that make it private public probably a touch of both these changes are a natural result of a deep and at times disorienting blurring of the financial markets in which investment banks do deals like private equity firms hedge funds lend like banks and private equity firms are gunning to become the next fidelity investments on the bright side this reordering points to the unprecedented flexibility in global markets companies in need of cash can choose as if on the waldorf buffet line their options on capital and the regulations governing it for oaktrees top executives that means raising money without having to sign off on the legally binding financial statements required under the still dreadfully named sarbanes oxley act wall street smells opportunity nasdaq stock market inc for instance is introducing a private market for firms selling big and largely unregulated equity stakes to professional investors placing it in competition with goldman nasdaq bills this as the most important development since its founding in more is coming says one morgan stanley banker the market for so called a filings the private stock sales that nasdaq and goldman are marketing last year was &# billion that is more than the &# billion for standard public offerings sellers want liquidity but not the constraints this banker said the convergence reveals a financial system moving with a fierce velocity a roaring stock market and easy credit markets make these hybrid structures easy to put together and sell right now buyers are willing to sop up any new paper that comes their way the threat is that once the credit cycle or economy turns and one day they will companies and investors will discover the dangers of what they did and dont forget about washington which has spent years building investor protections it might be hard for regulators to sit on their hands if these quasipublic structures get more popular investors are making trade offs on two important fronts their shareholder rights and the ease of getting in and out of investments something wonks call liquidity when the cycle cracks this is likely where the pain will be felt in a standard company for instance a shareholder might be able to wage a proxy fight or push for a change in management and strategy consider the upcoming initial public offering of blackstone group people who buy blackstones ipo planned for the coming weeks will have plenty of liquidity the shares will trade on the new york stock exchange but they wont have many rights blackstone says public shareholders will have nearly no say in blackstones management or investment decisions blackstone is essentially telling investors to trust it fully based on its stellar track record it is hard to argue but what if things start to come undone will shareholders be as trusting and docile "were going through a period of acculturation " as the public and private spheres try to reconcile themselves says richard truesdell a securities lawyer at davis polk &amp wardwell ever more exotic deals are able "to get done and people have continually revised their expectations and appetite for risk " mr truesdell warns that this converged landscape "has not been stress tested yet " he wonders "what will happen when it does " clear channel is another example of the ways investors are wrestling with rights and liquidity top investors agitated for a stake in the newly private firm after arguing that the company was being bought on the cheap what they got was something called "stub equity " which makes the companys current shareholders into partners with the buyout group bain capital and thomas h lee partners for as much as of the company the shareholders pressed for and won some crucial provisions the company is agreeing to add two independent members to its board the shareholders also forced bain and lee to stop issuing themselves fees that are commonly paid for executing a deal the market for the "stub" shares isnt expected to be as liquid as an nyse listed company another company harman international industries inc said it expects an over the counter market to develop for its own stub shares which are being issued as part of a &# billion buyout deal from the looks of it harmans stub holders wont have as much protection as clear channels holders one person familiar with the terms said they would act as minority partners of the two private equity firms with minimal voice in the affairs of the company its easy for newspaper columnists to declare this new world a treacherous swamp that isnt necessarily the case it will be only if investors caught in todays hot market dont prepare for a future down market "were in a marketplace where people dont care about rights as shareholders " says frederic m seegal a principal at seegal benson leucadia partners a merchant bank "and they wont care about them until they care about them " email dennis berman wsj com
