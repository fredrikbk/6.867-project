the afternoon report radioactive relations online edition investigators think they have identified the man responsible for the poisoning death of a former russian security official in london last year but bringing the suspect to justice may further chill relations between moscow and the west british officials announced that they would seek extradition of andrei lugovoi from russia to face charges in connection with the radioactive poisoning death of former soviet agent alexander litvinenko the case became a subject of international fascination last year as mr litvinenko wasted away in a london hospital after being exposed to the radioactive isotope polonium mr litvinenko met with mr lugovoi who was once a kgb agent at a london hotel shortly before falling ill with his hair fallen out and his muscles atrophied from the exposure mr litvinenko pointed his finger squarely at russian president vladimir putin and the russian security services mr litvinenko asserted publicly that a series of apartment building bombings in blamed on chechen separatists were in fact the work of russian agents with the intent of stirring support for a renewed offensive against the separatists and helping carry mr putin to power mr litvinenko believed that the kremlin wanted to silence him the kremlin denied involvement mr putin scoffed that the former security agent "didnt know any secrets " implying that he wouldnt have been worth killing and suggested that mr litvinenkos murder was the work of russian exiles the british foreign office has summoned the russian ambassador to seek cooperation in the case but moscow seemed to indicate that it wouldnt soon be shipping mr lugovoi to the united kingdom marina gridneva a spokeswoman for the russian prosecutors office said russian citizens "cannot be turned over to foreign states" and that a russian "committing a crime on the territory of a foreign state can be brought to criminal responsibility but only in russia " formal extradition documents are expected to be handed up this week a spokesman for prime minister tony blair said that britain has an extradition accord with russia "murder is murder this is a very serious case " the official said anonymously "the manner of the murder was also very serious because of the risks to public health " indeed the case caused a widespread uproar over possible further incidents leading to the shutting of several buildings and the grounding of british airways flights as investigators chased radioactive leads the extradition request and moscows chilly reception could add yet another layer of frost to relations between the two nations which have been on the decline recently as an oil rich russia flexes its geopolitical muscles the russian security service accused four british diplomats of spying last year and the kremlin is also furious that britain has provided refuge for exiled oligarch boris berezovsky who hastened to the u k seven years ago in order to escape a money laundering investigation that he believes was politically motivated as it turns out mr berezovsky is at least one axis around which the case turns a friend to mr litvinenko he also once employed mr lugovoi mr lugovoi maintained his innocence today "i consider this decision to be political i did not kill litvinenko i have no relation to his death and i can only express well founded distrust for the so called basis of proof collected by british judicial officials " he reportedly told russian news agencies paulson talks with china treasury secretary henry paulson opened a high level economic summit with chinese leaders in washington by saying that the u s and china need to show that their dialogue will be followed up with action in order to combat growing protectionist feeling and mistrust among citizens in both countries "there is a growing skepticism in each country about the others intentions " he stated mr paulson and chinese vice premier wu yi started the regular series of meetings last
