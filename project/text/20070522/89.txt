developed into the latest proxy battle between pro western factions in the middle east and iran and syria both tehran and damascus have backed the lebanese political party and militia hezbollah in its bid to topple the current lebanese government russian and chinese diplomats at the u n have said in recent days that their governments are still studying the draft resolution on the hariri court

on the principle of protecting national sovereignty the clashes in the past two days have pitted lebanese army troops in the northern city of tripoli against a sunni militia called fatah islam senior lebanese security officials say the militias leadership was based in damascus until late last year and many of its members entered lebanon after fighting u s forces in iraq leaders of fatah islam say they share the same world view as al qaeda leader osama bin laden and fight to contain the spread of american and israeli hegemony about fatah islam militants are based inside the nahr el bared palestinian refugee camp in tripoli they said the current fighting was sparked by a bank robbery allegedly conducted by fatah islam members that grew into an all out battle between lebanese army troops and the militia lebanese tanks and armored personnel carriers shelled nahr el bared yesterday in a bid to flesh out the fatah islam members from the camps population which is estimated at people at least combatants have been killed in the fighting and palestinian leaders said they feared that members of the camps refugee population have been killed they pressed mr sinioras government for restraint the bush administration has publicly voiced support for the lebanese militarys response a state department spokesman said beiruts military was working in a "legitimate manner" against "provocations by violent extremists " lebanese leaders have sought support from the palestinian liberation organization to flush out civilians from nahr el bared so that lebanese troops can crush fatah islam "if not there will be a civil war " mr jumblatt said yesterday a second bomb in as many days exploded in downtown beirut this one struck the upscale sunni neighborhood of verdun lebanese officials pointed their fingers at damascus syrias foreign minister walid al moallem denied that his government had any role in supporting fatah islam or overseeing the bombings and said damascus had sought to arrest its leadership "our forces have been after them even through interpol " mr moallem said in a lecture at damascus university according to reuters "we reject this organization " mr moallem described the hariri tribunal as "one of the tools of the u s to undermine syria and the region this is why we said we will not deal with it " the hariri tribunal has been at the heart of a lebanese political crisis that has stretched on for six months the countrys largely shiite opposition led by hezbollah pulled its support for mr sinioras government in november in part because of its opposition to the terms of the hariri probe beiruts parliamentary speaker nabih berri subsequently has refused to convene a legislative session to ratify the u n s international tribunal because of the lack of shiite ministers in the lebanese government mr siniora wrote u n secretary general ban ki moon this month to request the security council move forward with the international tribunal without beiruts parliamentary approval that has required the u s france and britain to try and pass a resolution through the security council that would empower the u n to act without lebanons legislative support the u s completed a draft form of the resolution thursday according to u s officials
