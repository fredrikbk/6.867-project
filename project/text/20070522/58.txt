iwo jima letters of young japanese are home at last an americans souvenir they had sat on a shelf solving a family mystery kobe japan after the fighting died down in the battle of iwo jima victor voegelin then years old was searching for the wounded when he saw a piece of thread poking out of the ground in a blown out gun emplacement the u s navy petty officer pulled the thread and found it was attached to a pack of letters along with part of a ceramic sake cup and some cigarettes he picked it all up and put everything in his bag over the decades mr voegelin looked at the letters just three or four times he couldnt read the japanese script and he always wanted to send them back to japan as he got older "i started thinking about these letters " says mr voegelin "and thought that people around my age might be around who would want them " finally spurred by the release last year of the movie "letters from iwo jima " he took action he found that the letters had belonged to tadashi matsukawa a japanese sailor who was when he died earlier this year he sent them to tadashis brother masaji the same age as mr voegelin masaji matsukawa had guessed that his brother died on iwo jima because the date given for his death was march when the main fighting ended but he had never been sure and widespread destruction of military records made it impossible to find out "there was this blank where i didnt know what had happened " said the white haired mr matsukawa as he moved a magnifying glass up and down the spidery japanese script "but now i understand " he is one of a number of japanese now receiving world war ii battlefield items including diaries and flags picked up by victorious allied soldiers as souvenirs the items often are returned by the children of veterans when they die masataka shiokawa lost his father in okinawa today he works to return items to japanese families as deputy director of the association that promotes peace and reverence for world war ii casualties "the families dont get the ashes " he says "these things left behind are the next best things the most important thing is to know where they were found " the matsukawa brothers grew up in southern japan they swam together in the ocean but tadashi was physically weak and took a year off from junior high school because of problems with his lungs half a year after entering the prestigious kyoto university to study law he was called up to serve in the imperial japanese navy and trained in its main gunnery school sometime in he was sent to the south pacific where the u s was fighting sea battles in preparation to invade japan tadashi was likely part of a unit charged with defending navy facilities says horyu kitazawa an archivist at the national defense academy as a relatively young conscript says mr kitazawa tadashi was probably involved in backup operations like preparing bullets for machine guns and antiaircraft guns japanese leaders used concrete bunkers and a network of tunnels to defend iwo jima for a month but of about japanese troops died the matsukawa family struggled to deal with tadashis death on jan a government official brought a notification to the family home saying tadashi had been killed in the "southern war zone " masaji who was away studying at the time later learned that his father had turned the government official away "he didnt want to believe my brother had died " mr matsukawa says today "if you accept the notification its like acknowledging death " in the immediate postwar years mr matsukawa was too concerned about getting enough food to eat to dwell on his dead brother rations ranged from rice to sweet potatoes but there were never enough even after the hardship passed though mr matsukawas father a strict old fashioned principal of a girls high school until the wars end avoided mentioning his dead son "he didnt want to talk because he didnt want to remember " mr matsukawa says "so i didnt talk about my brother with my father at all " tadashis name was left off the family gravestone only in april after his father died did the family hold a memorial service for tadashi in a joint temple ceremony around the time of their mothers death in the family gravestone was updated and tadashis name was engraved on it mr voegelin had been working in the engine room of a medium size landing ship headed to iwo jima as his ship drew near the island looked like such a mess that he thought the fighting would be over in just a few days but half a mile from shore he saw a dead sailor in a navy blue shirt and dungarees floating face down "i grew up in about two hours " he says more than americans were killed either in action or later from their wounds out of a total force of perhaps another or so were wounded mr voegelins job was to help load the wounded onto boats so they could get medical treatment the warm march wind blew the smell of decomposing flesh toward the beach he says later it was replaced by the pungent sweet odor of disinfectant sprayed from airplanes after the war mr voegelin returned to upstate new york he kept the letters in a black satchel with his navy discharge papers and ship records after he moved to his current house in he put them on a shelf in his workshop in february he contacted the times herald record an ottaway newspaper thats part of a chain owned by dow jones publisher of the wall street journal after the times herald record wrote about mr voegelin a japanese tv crew followed the story and found that the letters had belonged to tadashi the japanese station located mr matsukawa he received the letters in a hotel near his home here in kobe western japan where he took a call from mr voegelin "there are so many letters " he said through an interpreter "its wonderful that these have been kept all this time " one letter which tadashi had written to a former teacher but had not sent provided a glimpse of the state of mind of a young soldier during japans militaristic era "i heard about the great works of the kamikaze units recently i am not boasting but i have become deeply aware that its me who is going to follow them i will definitely do what is expected of me before i set off i would like to meet masaji again so would like to call him over here " tadashi wrote that surprised mr matsukawa "it was nice of him to think of me in this way " he said "i didnt realize he cared so much " wartime censorship meant that the letters mostly from their father but some also from their mother masaji and others mainly contained words of encouragement and nothing about the increasingly hard times faced by the japanese people at home but the return of the letters cleared up years of uncertainty for mr matsukawa "now " he says reading the letters "the war and postwar have properly ended for me " later he put the letters with the buddhist mortuary tablet at his home where japanese families traditionally place a dead relatives ashes
