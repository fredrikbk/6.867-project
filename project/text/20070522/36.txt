eyes on the road how big a deal is chrysler sale most of us buy only cars not car companies so what does it matter to ordinary car shoppers who owns chrysler that is a question that hasnt gotten attention in the wake of cerberus capital management llcs agreement to buy of chrysler from its german parent the company formerly known as daimlerchrysler ag the first benefit to society we will no longer have to write or read the name daimlerchrysler itll just be daimler for most consumers outside chryslers southeast michigan base "it means zero " says jason vines chief spokesman for chrysler customers care about how they are treated by dealers he says and they want to know that a car maker will be around long term to back up a purchase mr vines says research hes seen and his own experiences tell him that for the vast majority of americans chryslers big deal is no big deal restructuring sick giant companies is difficult work and there are no guarantees of what will come from cerberuss wager on chrysler cerberus clearly is hoping that consumers will reward the company if it decides to spend less money on fire sale marketing and runaway health care costs and instead invest in making vehicles that are more efficient safer longer lasting and probably somewhat more expensive to buy chrysler skidded off the road after a profitable run earlier in this decade in part because management lost touch with consumers it built more hemi powered cars supersized jeeps and big pickup trucks than consumers wanted to buy in the face of rising gas prices the company offered consumers big discounts to take excess inventory off dealers hands the result chrysler had an operating loss of about &# billion last year and gave up market share chrysler executives have said that as they restructure the company closing factories cutting jobs and killing redundant models theyll be less likely to repeat the same mistake if they succeed that could mean upfront discounts wont be as generous on the other hand the chryslers jeeps and dodges that people do buy might be worth more at trade in time thats the way honda motor co and toyota motor corp operate and theyre gaining share david cole a longtime industry consultant who leads the center for automotive research in ann arbor mich says one of most critical challenges facing chryslers new owners is negotiating with the united auto workers for what he calls a "transformational labor contract" that lifts from the company much of the &# billion burden it carries now for retiree health care why should consumers care because restructuring the health care burden would free up capital for research and development leading to better technology and improved quality for future models mr cole says perhaps prices for chrysler cars would go up but the cars would be better in theory if chrysler had another &# to &# to invest in each car about what it spends on health care now it could offer more standard safety equipment without drastically raising the sticker price in fact offering more features while holding prices relatively flat is another strategy toyota has used to boost sales in coming years auto makers face intense pressure to invest in new technology and fuel efficient vehicle designs one of the few things that president bush and the democratic congress appear to agree on is that the auto industry should be compelled to increase significantly the overall fuel efficiency of new cars and trucks mr bushs decision last week to order the federal bureaucracy to begin work on new mileage standards to achieve his goal of cutting gas consumption by means none of detroits auto makers can afford the luxury of pouring money down the drain of a failed business model chrysler leaders know this much consumers dont support the status quo buyers who responded to surveys last year by j d power &amp associates seeking information on the long term reliability of different models gave all three of chryslers brands chrysler dodge and jeep scores below the industry average a separate study of repair frequency by walden consultants ltd shows that chrysler vehicles on average need repairs roughly percentage points more frequently than toyotas walden uses an index in which is average for all vehicles and lower is better chryslers scored toyotas averaged just under bob lutz general motors corp s vice chairman for product development was asked during a taping last week of the national public radio show program "wait wait dont tell me " what advice he had for chryslers new ownership mr lutz a former chrysler executive who was a key player in one of the companys previous comebacks replied "build great cars and trucks " the line got a round of applause this is easier said than done of course but the auto industrys recent history suggests that its almost impossible to do when a companys leadership is distracted by the internal politics of a failing merger or throwing capital into desperate efforts to clear a backlog of last years models joseph b white is the journals detroit bureau chief his column appears every monday on wsj com send comments to joseph white wsj com
