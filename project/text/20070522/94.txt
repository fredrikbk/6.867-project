sinatra sings in vegas and you are there years ago i wrote in "holiday" magazine that tony bennett was the true heir of frank sinatra soon after to my surprise i received a note from frank sinatra "youre right about tony bennett " he said i greatly admire tony bennetts continually self surprising singing and ive gotten to know him impressed by his knowledgeable interest in national and international affairs but there is no heir to frank sinatra any more than there is an heir to fred astaire or billie holiday one afternoon at the home of lester young the "president" of the jazz tenor saxophone my host told me that he never played a ballad until he had learned the lyrics "how do you do that " i asked he pointed to a stack of sinatra recordings on a table near his chair long after jeremy pelt the rising young trumpet player told me he used the same method of getting inside a song and the same source for the lyrics but sinatra not only made ballads move into listeners own lives and memories he was also in both romantic reveries and jubilantly swinging performances an authentic jazzman in whatever he sang he was in the groove with the other musicians in the band and he was often improvising sinatra attracted exceptional arrangers notably nelson riddle but especially in "live" performances those scores became fluid flowing with the play of his emotions and the vibrations from the audience although his studio recordings will be played as long as this civilization and its music survive sinatra is most rivetingly heard on "live" recordings and now there is a historic boxed set of previously unreleased onstage sinatra shows in las vegas where he felt more at home than in any other venue "frank sinatra vegas" contains tracks on four cds and one dvd reprise available at sinatrasongs com and amazon com its to at the sands which sinatra partially owned caesars palace and the golden nugget and "you are there " as a long ago cbs docudrama series used to promise the numbers are classics from the american songbook imperishable except on commercial radio these days many are what sinatra called "saloon songs" "the second time around " "ive got a crush on you " "the lady is a tramp " "i have a great reverence toward saloon songs " sinatra says during a break "ive been singing in saloons longer than any other singer i know they include torch songs and ive had torches so high ive burned down buildings " on an especially tender regretful two in the morning homage to cole porters "just one of those things " sinatra is accompanied solely by his peerlessly attentive longtime pianist bill miller the "hot jazz" sinatra joins the count basie orchestra conducted by a young quincy jones mindful of the counts insistence on letting the music breathe in such swinging celebrations as "my kind of town" and "come fly with me " in one of the conversational asides in the omnibus set sinatra says of working with count basie "it was probably the most exciting engagement ive ever done in my life that band comes at you like a juggernaut you become part of it or you get lost we did things that were really jumping " the most revealing of the sinatra comments begins "when i found out that ella and all the black performers and composers were living on the other side of this town and that those i was working with couldnt stay in the same hotel as i did i didnt understand it "somebody said to me well thats the life here in this state i began to make noise and i made a few threats about how theyd better get another boy to work here but it changed i had made some demands on some people if theyre on the other side of town you dont need me i think a few other entertainers picked up on that too but i was the biggest mouth in town i loathe bigotry of any kind " the single dvd a recording of part of a may cbs tv special "cinderella at the caesars palace " has a beginning backstage palaver and an aimless comic that should have been edited out but the rest is worth the wait seeing as well as hearing sinatras spontaneous mastery of dynamics in his rhythms and phrasing in direct contact with the audience one can also see in his very movements the inherent drama of his storytelling now i know why he became so multidimensional a nonsinging actor in films on the dvd you see what whitney balliett described in "goodbyes and other messages a journal of jazz " oxford "the searchlight blue eyes that give the impression they are looking into every pair of eyes in the hall the ineffable cool and skill that make his singing appear effortless the flashing smiles that dispel the emotion of the last song and prepare the way for the next one " also on the dvd you seem to see in his eyes what the lyrics mean to him in the past and the immediate present throughout all the performances a boon not only to us but to future historians of a time when a frank sinatra could become a central part of american popular culture the sound quality brings you right into those las vegas nightclubs you just have to pour your own drinks great credit is due engineer and mixer larry walsh in the sets handsome page book another legend film director billy wilder says "when sinatra is in las vegas there is a certain electricity permeating in the air " until this set i hadnt fully realized sinatras electric energy in live performance the resilient strength as well as the subtleties of his voice and the personality from which it came three years before sinatra died in at age frank mcconnell wrote of him in commonweal magazine "as surely as twains or hemingways or basies his is the american voice " toward the end of a set in the dvd that closes "frank sinatra vegas " the performer lifts a glass toasting the audience "may you live to be years old and the last voice you hear is mine " were still listening frank mr hentoff writes about jazz for the journal
