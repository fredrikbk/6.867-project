total taps africas oil reserves in bid to outdo rivals growth social political unrest may complicate effort success found offshore paris total sa is betting africas oil reserves will save it from decline and help it top rivals production growth but the french company will have to rely on longtime relationships with the regions major players to overcome political risks in a continent torn by internal conflicts totals push in africa which represents about a third of its output and upstream investments is yet another sign of how oil companies have to explore new frontiers to secure key reserves and renew depleting fields after recording a drop in oil and natural gas output last year total hopes to post the biggest increase among its largest competitors in and beyond mostly thanks to african start ups the company is targeting annual growth in through on average a trend that should propel total production to three million barrels of oil equivalent a day africa is expected to generate about two thirds of this growth and will soon replace a declining europe as totals top production zone said jean privey president of the companys exploration and production in africa still total isnt immune from political risks surging costs and increased competition from the u s and china which could curb its ambitions in africa and erode profits analysts warned yesterday unrest in nigeria drove up oil prices on futures markets and such political uncertainty is contributing to higher prices for fuels like gasoline and diesel total is africas second largest foreign oil producer after exxon mobil corp pumping barrels of oil equivalent a day but the black gold doesnt come easily violence and other problems plague oil production in africa particularly nigeria where persistent militant attacks on foreign oil companies facilities have led to disruptions and reduced onshore production in sudan civil war has prevented the company from exploring the ground for two decades total also has grappled with a dark history of corruption in some of frances former african colonies where its elf aquitaine unit had privileged access to oil resources following a probe some executives were convicted many in the industry think mounting political and social problems will make oil production in africa more difficult totals strengths in the continent are mainly its geographically diversified assets analysts said and its relatively large exposure to africa as production sharing agreements prove efficient buffers to current industrywide cost overruns "total has been a forerunner in africa pioneering deep offshore and securing large reserves a long time ago the companys early positioning remains a competitive advantage as terms negotiated have proved and will continue to prove very attractive " kepler equities analyst bertrand hodee said the key to the continents massive reserves is drilling ever deeper in the oceans mr privey said "africa has always been a series of technical challenges " he said total bolstered its presence in africa with the acquisition in of elf aquitaine which started searching for oil in the s in frances former colonies with gabon used as a hub angola and nigeria totals main growth contributors and two countries where the company took bold risks earlier than rivals have turned into oil el dorados thanks to deep offshore prospects angola just joined the organization of petroleum exporting countries onshore drilling was disappointing at first as seismic technologies wouldnt enable the company to detect oil fields beneath large salt layers spreading through the west african ground recalled mr privey a former elf employee this "pushed us to the sea " he said a few fields feet deep off the gabon coast kick started the groups african offshore operations in the s but the real boost came with the companys decision two decades later to step into angolas offshore concessions in the midst of civil war elf acquired angolas block and discovered reserves totaling one billion barrels of oil equivalent a decade later the country in need of money as war continued to rage awarded deep offshore concessions "we tested positive wells in a row but we didnt even know how to develop those fields beneath meters of water " mr privey recalled the billion euro &# billion development of the giant girassol field in the block marked a major technological success for the company "with girassol total pioneered deep offshore production in africa this early win has secured solid positions in the minds of african governments " natexis analyst eric meniger said this year total is heading for growth thanks to girassols sister field in block dalia which came on stream in december and is already pumping barrels of oil a day the same block is home to the pazflor field an expected barrels a day and the "clov" fields an additional barrels a day which should be developed after nigeria too where total is the third largest foreign oil producer will massively fuel growth said mr privey thanks to the apko field which is expected to pump about barrels a day by total recently made discoveries in congo brazzaville where the company has operated since it ranks as the top foreign oil producer in gabon second in cameroon and holds concessions in northern african countries such as libya and algeria surging services costs also could be a threat "a drilling rig used to cost &# per day to rent a few years back it costs &# per day currently " mr privey said but african countries typical oil and gas concessions have allowed total to limit profit erosion keplers mr hodee said production sharing agreements "mean the oil company gets its investment totally reimbursed with oil barrels this covers cost rises and thats largely why total is our best pick " mr hodee said
