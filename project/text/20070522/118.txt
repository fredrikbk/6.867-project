the middle seat how to get money back when airfares drop many airlines give refunds if price falls after you buy new web site flags changes have you ever bought an airline ticket only to see the price fall and your anger rise now there is something you can do about it few customers realize it but many airlines will give refunds if they cut the price after you have bought a ticket alaska jetblue southwest united and us airways all offer vouchers for the full price difference if the price drops &# you can get a &# coupon towards a future trip others offer vouchers or cash after deducting change fees which can run up to &# in industry jargon it is called a "rollover " and in most cases it only works if you bought the ticket directly from the airline it generally wont work if you bought them via a web site such as expedia com or orbitz com unless the price drops in the first hours the rollover policies have been in place for decades but until recently it has been tough for consumers to figure out when their flights price has changed the catch is you have to call while the lower price is in effect to get your rollover that is where a new web site yapta com has come up with a clever way to take some of the anxiety out of buying airline tickets yapta a company run by a former alaska air group inc pricing vice president is being launched today it tracks fares on specific flights you select before or after you buy a ticket that is an improvement over web sites that just track markets but dont allow you to specify which flights you really want you can use yapta before you buy to alert you by email to pricing changes on a particular trip or let you know if the price drops after youve bought a ticket and youre eligible for a refund in order to obtain the voucher you need to phone the airline directly you usually cant snare one online ellen siminoff who signed up with yapta to test the site before its launch paid &# each for four tickets from san francisco to kona hawaii a few days later she got notification from yapta that the price had dropped to about &# per ticket she called ual corp s united and got tickets reissued at the lower price plus four &# vouchers "theres no way i would have been checking sites to see if the price went down " she said fares yo yo based on ticket sales and airline expectations of demand and the uncertainty and disparity frustrates fliers prices sometimes change several times during the day several web sites are trying to blunt some of that unpredictability farecast com tries to predict whether prices will rise or fall in a market it gives you a "buy" or "wait" recommendation another site farecompare com offers historical information that can be useful in trying to decide if a fare may drop in the future if you are hoping for a round trip between washington d c and houston for &# farecompare can tell you that in the past months continental airlines inc only offered that briefly in august last year several web sites offer alerts on price changes for specific markets expedia inc s "fare alert" is a tool you can download and it sits in the toolbar of your pc and pops up when a lower fare comes along on a route youre interested in travelocity a unit of sabre holdings corp has a "fare watcher" that lets you pick city pairs and get alerts when the price changes by &# or more orbitz worldwide inc s "deal detector" lets you select only nonstop flights or preferred airlines yapta raises the bar by allowing you to pinpoint prices on specific flights alerts from other sites may be triggered by a m departures or redeye trips for example that may not be acceptable to you to use yapta you have to download it on your pc and then it will automatically integrate itself into your flight searches so far the tagger works with expedia travelocity orbitz and most u s airline web sites but not with sites that search multiple vendors like kayak com when you search yapta places a button on the screen for you to click if you want to "tag" one of the flights offered tagging doesnt take you away from the web site youre on it just sends the information to yapta once you tag a flight yapta will email you when the price changes if you buy the ticket and record the information with yapta it will alert you to refund possibilities taking into account the policies of that airline with people using yapta as beta testers the average voucher was about &# united and alaska had the most generous refund policies offering a choice of free vouchers or cash back after change fees says yapta chief executive tom romary american and continental are generally the stingiest any price drop has to be greater than the &# change fee the airline deducts before a voucher will be issued most airlines and travel vendors have more liberal hour or same day price guarantees offering to rebook you at a lower price and refund the difference if the price drops in the first hours without change fees expedia and travelocity go a step further offering their own hour guarantee if prices drop more than &# within hours they will reissue tickets at the lower price refund the difference and give you their own &# voucher toward future purchases of course many tickets never go down in price so yaptas primary use is as a bit of price protection for travelers "if the price goes down theres something to cover me " said mr romary several airlines said they are pondering whether they think yapta is a good thing for them or not if it spurs sales at higher price levels and vouchers build customer loyalty carriers will support it on the other hand a flood of refund requests could force changes in rollover policies i have used yapta which stands for your amazing personal travel assistant for the past

to &# one afternoon a tumble a dallas washington round trip for june that i had followed for some time for a family trip typically priced around &# but early one morning yapta fired notice that the
