mass destruction mass distribution the atomic bazaar by william langewiesche farrar straus giroux pages &# on the siberian side of the ural mountains two time zones east of moscow and in deep forest there is a city of people recently some of its occupants have been building large lavishly appointed homes there is no obvious explanation of where the money is coming from the housing boom is of some interest because the city in question ozersk is one of the closed nuclear cities in russia many tons of weapons grade uranium and plutonium are stored there and the security surrounding it is not very impressive this is one of the many disturbing things that william langewiesche tells us in "the atomic bazaar " a short taut and striking account of the current and prospective state of the deadly nuclear game the first half of the book discusses the prospect of terrorists acquiring and using a nuclear weapon the second discusses the prospect of proliferating state ownership of such weapons while there is serious cause for concern on both accounts mr langewiesche is more pessimistic about state ownership than terrorist use for terrorists or for criminals interested in a deal with terrorists russia is the most promising source of the highly enriched uranium needed to make a bomb and the most likely way of getting russian uranium without alarm bells ringing is by cutting a deal with someone with legitimate access to the stuff whether the recent housing construction in ozersk means that such deals have already been cut is not known then there is the problem of getting the uranium about pounds of it to where it can be used or sold say istanbul mr langewiesche after spending time on the ground in georgia and on the mountainous iran turkish border concludes that such a journey would not be too difficult georgia is one of the most corrupt countries in the world while kurdish opium traffickers in the mountains of east turkey might easily serve as guides and helpers if the price is right current american efforts to interdict such traffic mr langewiesche claims are ineffective they rely too much on electronic gadgetry and on the cooperation of corrupt governments they neglect in the meantime informal power structures and the goings on in the backcountry in the end though mr langewiesche believes that the odds are stacked against the terrorists the cumulative risks associated with acquiring and moving nuclear material finding a secure location to make a bomb actually making it and then selecting a target delivering and exploding it and maintaining a high level of secrecy throughout would require an exceptional combination of efficiency and luck to achieve success so much for the goodish news on the subject of the proliferation of weapons among states mr langewiesche is uniformly downbeat he uses the story of the rise and fall of a q khan the scientist who made the pakistani bomb and created a secret international market in nuclear advice and material to good effect khan was a vain and boastful man but he was also a formidable operator for many years he was given his head he was dismissed from his high level position in pakistans government only in because those in power feared a nuclear india and wanted the prestige of belonging to the nuclear club khans task was made easier as mr langewiesche shows because of the greed of european supplier companies that were prepared to bend or ignore the rules in the case of a customer willing to pay double or triple the going rate for sensitive proscribed equipment and for crucial periods khan was free from the anti proliferation constraints normally imposed by the u s washington needed the support of pakistan first against the russians and then against al qaeda and adjusted its priorities accordingly there are no disinterested actors in the politics of nuclear weapons khans activity was driven not just by vainglory but by a sense of mission it derived from the belief widely held among the worlds have nots that the nuclear non proliferation treaty possesses no moral authority and is simply an instrument to perpetuate the advantage of the rich and powerful thus khan found many customers clients and admirers in what we used to call the third world and when the bush doctrine announced americas intention to intervene in the internal affairs of other countries in the cause of promoting its values some of those countries were given a powerful additional incentive to acquire nuclear weapons khan has now fallen from grace but mr langewiesche maintains that the network he discovered developed and exploited something more like the internet than a rigid structure survives and cannot be dismantled nuclear proliferation has thereby reached the point of no return the desire for self sufficiency will drive it forward in fits and starts and sometimes with backward slips certainly but incrementally forward for given the strength of motivation and the availability of know how "no amount of maneuvering will keep determined nations from developing nuclear arsenals " some of those nations will have "poor command and control systems and fragile overly bellicose governments " which means mr langewiesche concludes that the next couple of decades will be unlike the past six in that some of the weapons will almost certainly be used in anger this will not necessarily mean a global nuclear holocaust as it would have during the cold war just limited local or regional devastation how convincing is this analysis pretty compelling for someone of a realist disposition especially given the level of incompetence and disarray recently displayed by the leading nuclear states the main actors with an interest in proving it false if you have any anxiety left over after worrying about global warming you might want to read this book the odds are that this catastrophe will happen in your lifetime mr harries is a visiting fellow of the lowy institute for
