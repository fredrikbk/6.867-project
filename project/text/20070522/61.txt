justices to hear muni bond case kentucky tax fight over exemptions affects many states the supreme court agreed yesterday to tackle a high stakes question that has attracted widespread interest among municipal bond investors at issue is a challenge by a kentucky couple to a kentucky state law that exempts interest on bonds issued within kentucky while taxing interest on most non kentucky municipal bonds most states that have a state income tax such as new york and california have similar laws that is a powerful incentive for investors to buy bonds issued within their home state or shares of mutual funds that invest only in bonds and other fixed income securities from a single state this issue is especially important for people who live in high tax areas such as new york city california or new jersey under current law for example a new york city resident who buys new york bonds typically doesnt owe any federal state or local tax on the interest if that same new york city resident buys bonds issued by some other state such as connecticut the interest would be taxable in both new york state and new york city "this is an issue of great national importance that involves many investors in state and local bonds " said peter faber a new york city lawyer at mcdermott will &amp emery in new york nearly million investors reported tax exempt interest income for according to the latest internal revenue service data state and local government leaders also are monitoring the case closely because of its potential impact on the &# trillion municipal bond market a vast fund raising tool not only for states but for local governments school districts and many other jurisdictions john farris kentuckys finance and administration cabinet secretary said yesterday that "we are thrilled" the supreme court has agreed to hear the case and that the outcome "has broad implications for the municipal bond market at large far beyond kentuckys borders " a spokeswoman for the securities industry and financial market association estimates there are about municipal bond issuers throughout the nation the kentuckians who brought the case are george and catherine davis in september kentuckys supreme court declined to review an appellate court ruling saying it is unconstitutional for kentucky to tax only out of state bonds late last year kentucky officials appealed to the u s supreme court which agreed yesterday to hear the case if kentucky loses state officials will face a tough choice "if we lose this case the kentucky general assembly will need to decide whether to exempt all out of state municipal bonds or to tax all kentucky municipal bonds " said jill midkiff a spokeswoman for kentuckys revenue department the u s supreme court probably will hear the case in the fall of this year and issue a decision "in the winter or early spring" of next year said len weiser varon a boston lawyer at mintz levin cohn ferris glovsky and popeo p c in a report issued yesterday mr weiser varon said the case revolves around a "judicial interpretation" of the so called "dormant commerce clause" of the u s constitution barring states from "competing against each other in a way that burdens interstate commerce " before yesterdays announcement some lawyers speculated that if the supreme court agreed to review the case that would be a sign that the justices probably would side with kentucky and effectively endorse the current system in most states but others cautioned yesterday that its too close to call and that trying to predict which way the supreme court will go is a hazardous game "i dont think you can read anything into the supreme courts decision to hear the case other than its a very important issue " mr faber said many lawyers had expected the court to agree to review the case there was "no discernible impact" in municipal bond market trading yesterday said benjamin thompson a principal at samson capital advisors in new york city if the supreme court decides kentuckys law is unconstitutional high tax states with large populations that regularly issue bonds are likely to be among those most affected said judy wesalo temel a principal at samson capital which manages about &# billion so what is an investor to do for the typical buy and hold municipal bond investor "little has changed at this point " said mr weiser varon of mintz levin some lawyers and accountants have been urging investors who own significant amounts of out of state municipal bonds or national municipal bond funds to consider filing "protective refund claims" with their home state the idea is to preserve the taxpayers right to claim refunds for certain previous years prior to the expiration of the states time limit for filing such a claim richard dauman a senior vice president at bessemer trust in new york said his firm has prepared protective claims based on the davis case for "several" clients in cases where the statute of limitations was set to expire the procedure for filing such a claim depends on the state where you live mr dauman said most states impose their own state income tax among those that dont have a state income tax are florida texas south dakota nevada and washington people saving money for college also may be affected by the davis case "other state tax preferences for in state financing programs such as state sponsored section college savings programs may be indirectly impacted" by the courts decision mr weiser varon said a taxing case the u s supreme court will review a major case involving municipal bonds the issue whether kentucky can tax interest on out of state bonds while exempting interest on its own bonds most other states have similar laws that is why many investors prefer to buy in state bonds nearly million investors own municipal bonds
