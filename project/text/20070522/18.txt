business technology big business takes another chance on tech start ups when standard insurance co decided to install new gear to speed up email and software programs transmitted to its branch offices it didnt choose one of the usual large technology providers like cisco systems inc and juniper networks inc instead it selected a san francisco start up named riverbed technologies inc it was a difficult decision standard insurance portland ore had been burned by a tech start up before during the late s dot com boom the insurance firm had signed on to get internet access through networking start up psinet inc then a high flier but in as the tech sector melted down and psinet filed for bankruptcy standard insurance had to scramble to replace its internet service "we certainly kicked the tires to be sure riverbed would be around " says brian moore standard insurances network architect the firms &# contract with riverbed last year was one of the first times since that the insurance company had purchased technology from a start up he notes big businesses and institutions have always been somewhat hesitant to buy substantial amounts of tech gear from small companies but they grew even more averse after the dot com implosion many enterprises got left in the lurch after they purchased from small equipment makers such as caspian networks inc and procket networks inc onetime successes that went bust in the downturn as a result many businesses began shying away from tech start ups and instead turned to stable suppliers such as cisco and alcatel lucent now corporate tech managers are once again starting to buy equipment from small networking businesses with little known names such as riverbed aruba networks inc isilon systems inc and bigband networks inc many of these small firms make products that solve new corporate technology problems such as how to most efficiently store new corporate data like video or how to best improve the transmission of information across networks that have been weighed down by multimedia applications while some of the big tech firms also offer similar technology to deal with such issues tech managers are finding that the start ups often have more cutting edge products that are cheaper than the big suppliers offerings "the old guard equipment guys are having to think about more than just equipment and theyre having to think about software and video " says joe skorupa a research analyst with gartner inc "they arent used to thinking in those terms " the upshot a surge in business for many small tech companies which is contributing to an overall boom in the tech networking industry riverbed which makes products to speed up corporate networks saw its revenue more than triple to &# million from a year earlier bigband networks a redwood city calif firm that increases corporate network bandwidth nearly doubled its revenue last year to &# million many of these start ups have recently staged successful initial public offerings with riverbeds stock jumping more than on its first day of trading in september while isilons rose on its debut in december some companies are now ripping out gear from the larger networking firms in favor of the equipment from the start ups even if it costs more to do so architecture inc an architecture firm in kansas city mo installed &# of cisco gear in march to help architects in its san francisco and columbus mo offices to remotely collaborate on designs but delays in the cisco system began to occur a week later causing instances where files couldnt be accessed after six months of working with cisco to fix the issues including a &# upgrade to the system architecture ditched the cisco gear instead the company installed &# of riverbed equipment to test out and ended up sticking with it "we know cisco is the market leader but they arent perfect " says jeff hamer technology director for architecture "sometimes they simply dont get it right " a spokeswoman for cisco san jose calif said many of the networking start ups offer equipment in niche categories making some of their customer wins negligible when compared to the global reach of cisco "this industry has experienced many waves of competition in the past and cisco has thrived through each " said elizabeth mcnichols a cisco spokeswoman for some companies buying tech gear from a start up is a first geophysical mapping firm arcis corp for one has always purchased its technology from big tech firms but last year it chose start up isilon a seattle based network storage company to help improve how it stores and processes two dimensional and three dimensional images arcis in calgary canada captures and analyzes images below the earths surface for oil and gas exploration over the years the amount and size of data the company analyzed grew until it became difficult to maintain arcis initially examined gear from large companies such as sun microsystems inc and network appliance inc which both visited and conducted hour long presentations about their equipment but the products would have required arcis to hire more information technology personnel for maintenance in contrast isilons system was newer and didnt require much maintenance "their isilons technology was more innovative than all the other things we had seen so we took a leap of faith " says rob howey who oversees data processing for arcis businesses and institutions arent over all their start up fears however many are putting their new small suppliers through a far more rigorous inspection process than in the past before deciding whether to buy from them among other things they are consulting industry research firms to vet the start ups financials and are talking with other customers to see how the start up responds to problems when ohio state university decided to install wireless systems across its acre columbus campus last year it examined equipment from nortel networks corp cisco and start up aruba but since the universitys telecom unit hadnt bought gear from a start up since it mounted a particularly strong vetting process to check out aruba a sunnyvale calif provider of mobile networks "we were absolutely concerned when it looked like aruba was our best option " says bob corbin ohio states director of telecommunications "they were private not the leading provider and we were concerned about their staying power " the university ended up creating a seven member panel to conduct a background check on aruba including a financial analysis of the company and checking with experts in the wireless industry the panel took six months to review aruba something it doesnt do with big tech firms ultimately aruba made the cut last august ohio state university awarded its &# million contract to build a wireless network to the start up the wireless network went live last november so far "weve been very pleased " says mr corbin "we made the right decision "
