industry giant scotts miracle gro co small companies live in dread of such lawsuits which even if they win can often be their undoing because of legal costs and distraction for management so instead of just relying on legal counsel terracycle is also trying to harness the power of the internet to elicit public support boost sales and raise legal funds its core weapon a blog called www suedbyscotts com "the internet is the one place that if we can possibly win this it will be there " says tom szaky terracycles year old co founder and chief executive he hopes to get enough public opinion on his side that scotts will drop the suit but if that doesnt happen and terracycle loses everything in the lawsuit mr szaky says "we are out of business " among other things scotts claims that terracycles packaging with its yellow and green color scheme brand name in the center and photos of flowers and vegetables at the bottom infringes on the trade dress of scottss miracle gro brand scotts also accuses terracycle of falsely advertising that its products are superior to others including scottss in addition to requesting that terracycle destroy existing labels and signage at issue in the suit scotts asks that all gains profits and benefits generated from the alleged infractions be awarded to scotts a move that might wipe out terracycle last year the four year old terracycle had revenue of &# million its not yet profitable while year old scotts had &# billion the battle comes at a time when terracycle is making significant inroads into mainstream stores landing space in wal mart home depot shoprite target and cvs among others as interest in natural gardening products surges despite overall slowing sales in the u s lawn and garden market the organic niche has risen at rates in the range of to over the last five years hitting an estimated &# million last year according to marketresearch com in many cases terracycles fertilizers made from worm feces known as vermiculture compost sit right next to scotts miracle gro brands miracle gros organic choice line is booming too consumer purchases were up in scottss first two fiscal quarters of versus the same year earlier period on its blog terracycle disputes scottss claims and paints itself as an underdog a comparison chart titled "david vs goliath" includes pictures of each firms headquarters terracycles

terracycle posts photos of other gardening products that use green and yellow packaging terracycle asks for online donations to defray its legal costs and has links to where visitors can buy products while terracycles bid for internet donations hasnt yielded much fruit about &# so far overall company sales for the four weeks since the online campaign launched surged from the immediately previous four weeks last year the companys sales increased in the same period meantime terracycles main web site which averages about visitors a day has spiked to as high as according to the company and to of the visitors to suedbyscotts com click the "purchase online" or "store locator" links for its part scotts says these efforts are part of terracycles "tactics" and maintains that none of the counterclaims have merit "weve spent a lot of time building up brands that consumers trust and we are going to protect those brands " says su lok a scotts spokeswoman she notes that scotts founded in and miracle gro founded in were once start ups too they merged in "when people are referring to the david and goliath aspect of this lawsuit people lose sight of that fact " she says scotts primarily wants terracycle to stop making certain product claims in its marketing which scotts says are false and misleading ms lok adds those include "unlike synthetic chemical fertilizers that can lead to problems such as plant burn terracycle plant food will not burn your plants" and statements that terracycle "outperformed the leading synthetic plant food in many aspects of plant growth" during tests on its suedbyscotts com site terracycle lists some other intellectual property lawsuits filed by scotts in the past decade says scottss ms lok "scotts is a leading brand and like any other consumer brand we have to protect our trade dress and brand and products that is part of smart business " small businesses have long used guerilla tactics as an inexpensive way to wage battle against established deep pocketed rivals in the s the founders of still fledgling ben &amp jerrys ice cream launched a campaign against pillsbury co s haagen dazs subsidiary now owned by general mills inc when haagen dazs allegedly told some distributors that they couldnt carry both brands in addition to suing pillsbury jerry greenfield one of the ben &amp jerrys founders picketed pillsburys headquarters with a placard reading "whats the doughboy afraid of " today the internet has lowered the cost barrier and drastically sped up the means of such communications hundreds of bloggers have written about the terracycle lawsuit as have some mainstream media outlets meantime terracycles internet parry has helped morale on the packaging floor where mr szaky says workers were afraid theyd lose their jobs after reading about the litigation "theyve been very smart " says mike mcgrath host of "you bet your garden " a nationally syndicated radio show "somebody threw eggs at their house and theyve got to respond " terracycles web strategy isnt without risks says andrew sherman an attorney who contributes to eventuring com an entrepreneurial web site sponsored by the ewing marion kauffman foundation "what if you are wrong about the court of public opinion and you open yourself up to other claims of defamation " he says small businesses have other options such as pooling resources with other entrepreneurs being sued by the same company or finding a venture capitalist to help foot the costs some insurance policies might cover certain legal costs too he adds another strategy asking the larger plaintiff if theyd be willing to help fund changes in packaging or if theres the possibility of a joint venture "ive seen combatants end up being pretty good friends " mr sherman says changing packaging drastically now would hurt terracycles sales momentum says the companys general counsel richard ober jr "theres the loss of customer recognition " he says adding that the company still has a large number of the "all purpose plant food" labels specifically mentioned in the scotts lawsuit and "wants to use them " still no amount of public appeal can help terracycle escape the realities of litigation as part of the discovery process scotts has asked for extensive documentation from terracycle including everything relating to any new products in development contracts with retailers strategic business plans as well as details about "composition of the materials consumed by worms " to handle the requests terracycle has hired outside counsel and mr ober estimates legal costs which so far have been less than &# could run upward of &# million "its taking time from our scientists and that will start taking its toll " mr szaky says
