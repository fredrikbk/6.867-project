business divided as debate opens on immigration bill pleases employers of unskilled laborers but high tech objects as the senate begins debate on a landmark immigration bill meant to address the future need for workers in the u s a divide over the measure among the nations employers could undermine its chances of becoming law from the moment the white house and key lawmakers struck a tentative deal on immigration last week it was clear that not all employers were on board the deal the most significant potential change in immigration law since an amnesty program for illegal immigrants in was designed to provide for the labor needs of industries ranging from high technology to agriculture as well as to resolve the status of the estimated million people now living in the u s illegally employers like farmers restaurateurs and construction contractors who rely heavily on unskilled workers generally support the deal but high tech industries that need skilled workers complain that it doesnt give them the flexibility to recruit workers with the specific mix of skills they need for employers of the unskilled the tentative deal offers a welcome path to legitimacy for their work forces which typically include a high proportion of illegal immigrants under the deal illegal residents who can prove they entered the u s before jan would get a temporary resident permit the plan would essentially erase their illegal status and let them work while awaiting a so called z visa that would entitle them to live legally in the u s the bill also eventually would allow temporary workers to come to the u s on a "y visa" each year to fill mainly low skilled jobs "overall we feel very positive about" the bill said tom nassif president of western growers which represents farmers who grow more than half of the countrys produce "theres a program for legalizing our existing work force " for agriculture it is a deal worth protecting mr nassif voiced concern that some of his industrys victories could be eroded as the bill moves through the legislative process high tech companies however say the deal doesnt provide enough visas for software engineers computer programmers and other workers whose skills are in short supply in the u s in addition they say a new merit system envisioned in the deal which is designed to ease the way to legal entry for educated immigrants wouldnt necessarily ensure the specific skills high tech employers need "as the bill stands the bill is a disaster for high tech employers " said stuart anderson executive director of the national foundation for american policy a nonpartisan research organization and a former staff director of the senate immigration subcommittee what follows is an industry by industry snapshot of employer reaction to the deal food processors the meat packing industry has grown increasingly reliant on immigrant labor and in recent months has been the target of raids by the department of homeland security that rounded up hundreds of undocumented workers as a result the industry is largely relieved by the deal which could make much of its work force legal "we are pleased that the white house and key members of the senate have found common ground on the issue of comprehensive immigration reform " said sean mchugh vice president of investor relations public relations and communications at swift &amp co the nations third largest processor of both fresh beef and pork the company which has annual sales of more than &# billion employs about people in the u s and has seen hundreds of its workers arrested in raids "we hope these reform provisions remain intact through the balance of the legislative process and ultimately become law " said mr mchugh at tyson foods inc one of the nations largest poultry processors immigrants account for as much as of the workers at some plants archie schaffer a company spokesman said tyson supports the basic concept of the draft bill however he expressed concern that a requirement for workers to return home in order to apply for permanent legal residency known as a "touch back" provision could be disruptive "we dont want to lose any continuity " said mr schaffer noting that the company invests as much as one year and thousands of dollars in training for each employee to become proficient at his or her job restaurants the national restaurant association the industrys main lobbying group lauded the measure for allowing undocumented immigrants already in the country to stay "i think that finally were going to get something done " said craig miller who was the associations chairman until last year and remains a board member mr miller who is also chief executive of ruths chris steak house inc a national chain of restaurants praised the bill for decriminalizing immigrant workers "because theyre here and working hard " technology high tech companies which often need to import skilled workers from overseas have quickly voiced a variety of concerns about the proposed immigration overhaul jenifer verdery director of work force development at intel corp said the santa clara calif chip giant which employs about workers world wide is less than thrilled with the proposed plan thats because she said the proposed number of visas for skilled workers remains too low she cited in particular the so called h b visas employers use to bring workers with specific skills into the country "there arent enough new visas period " she said the new bill proposes raising the cap on h b visas from to or up to if demand is high but ms verdery said that this year employers filed more than petitions for h b visas on the first day of application alone "the proposed new numbers wouldnt even be enough to meet the first days demand " she said there are also big concerns about the "merit system" for obtaining work permits or green cards which is skewed toward allowing educated foreigners into the u s but not necessarily the people high tech employers want currently high tech companies submit requests to the government for specific job candidates the proposed compromise for green cards would create a job pool of educated workers rather than give companies the flexibility to recruit the specific individuals they want betsy mullins vice president of government and political affairs at technet a bipartisan group representing technology ceos said her group "has a lot of concerns regarding highly skilled workers" in the bill in particular technet says the new merit based system is deficient because it isnt employer driven under the proposed system the government would award points based on education work experience and english proficiency that could bring more professionals and people with advanced degrees into the u s but it wouldnt give high tech companies the license they would like to recruit the specific foreign workers best suited to their needs since tech companies undergo change quickly and often that means the system could quickly be out of date with a tech employers needs ms mullins said "we need a market driven system in an innovation economy " she said "to throw the current system out for something that hasnt even been tested yet will give people pause " agriculture few industries have come as close to admitting they cant survive without the labor of illegal immigrants as agriculture at least half of the million crop workers in the u s are undocumented according to the department of labor they sustain an industry valued at &# billion annually and the industry has been quick to applaud the prospect of legitimacy for its workers if anything the industry is worried about concessions in the weeks ahead as the bill moves through congress farmers have some concern about the details in the agreement however mr nassif a former u s ambassador who has openly acknowledged that u s agriculture couldnt exist without foreign workers said that the industry wondered whether field workers could afford to pay a &# fine as mandated by the tentative deal in order to get on the path to u s citizenship "im not sure that it matters to them " whether they become u s citizens he said service workers about immigrants are believed to sneak into the u s illegally each year eliseo medina executive vice president of the service employees international union which represents janitors nursing home workers and other blue collar workers deemed the new bill "on the whole as very positive " however he expressed concern that a requirement for those now in the u s illegally to return home in order to apply for legal permanent u s residency could be problematic for both employees and employers "if youre a mexican you can make a run to tijuana " he said "if youre chinese or irish its a really long haul " janet adamy and julie jargon contributed to this article see related letter "letters to the editor immigration reform bill threatens small business" wsj may
