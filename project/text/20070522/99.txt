second act paulson finds deal making is tougher in washington former goldman chief tries coaxing chinese pressure from congress washington when henry paulson stepped down as goldman sachs groups chief executive to become president bushs third treasury secretary he hoped to use his deal making skills to try to fix social security finish the doha round of global trade talks and persuade china to change its economic policies nearly a year later "hurricane hank " as hes known for his impatient forceful style admits to some frustration discussions with congressional democrats about retooling costly benefit programs like social security and medicare are at a standstill the doha talks to ease global trade barriers are stalled and protectionist sentiments are rising here and abroad and while china has agreed to let its currency rise slowly and has opened its doors a crack to foreign financial firms its critics in congress want far more change at goldman mr paulson commanded an army of bankers who could make things happen fast in washington where he has chosen to tackle important but historically intractable issues he is discovering that progress can be difficult he has notched some successes but has also encountered political resistance on some big issues "its frustrating to see issues where the policy solution is pretty easy but there are big political obstacles " he says in an interview on china which he counts as a top priority he complains that politicians expectations for quick results are unrealistic although he was accustomed to focusing on short term results on wall street he says "i didnt know what short term was until i got here " today top chinese officials will arrive in washington for two days of talks with mr paulson other cabinet officials and members of congress the talks part of the strategic economic dialogue that he initiated last year are expected to touch on several issues considered vital to u s chinese relations chinas environmental record u s policy on exports to china and chinas unwillingness to allow its currency to rise freely against the dollar which would make chinese goods pricier and less threatening to u s competitors with less than two years left in the bush administration for him to make his mark mr paulson years old has no time to waste a commanding foot former offensive lineman at dartmouth college he is possessed by what colleagues refer to as nearly boundless energy he still operates like a take charge wall street executive sometimes taking the spotlight from other cabinet officers and treating his treasury staff as if they were goldman partners always on call current and former colleagues say he talks about balancing work and family but he phones his staff at all hours and convenes sunday meetings at his washington mansion on lengthy flights to vietnam and china he allowed staffers to nap only after he was done chewing over policy issues and planned public statements some of them say mr paulson arrived in washington at the tail end of an administration that had lost much of its clout here and abroad months after he took the job republicans lost control of congress inside the administration he reasserted treasurys influence which had been marginalized during the tenures of paul oneill and john snow both of whom failed to gain the confidence of wall street or washington he built relationships with some congressional democrats in part by refusing to campaign for republican candidates in the last election democrats say that helped him get the backing of house ways and means chairman charles rangel on free trade pacts with panama and peru at a time when trade is politically divisive that trade deal shows how seriously mr paulson has taken the presidents promise to give him wide latitude on economic policy mr paulson says he has interpreted that pledge to extend beyond taxes budgets and exchange rates to energy environment and trade even if it means bumping up against other bush cabinet officials in his zeal to cut a trade deal with mr rangel he told the new york democrat he thought it would be possible to include language pressuring other nations to improve labor conditions even though the administration had not yet agreed to such a move administration officials say mr bush eventually went along but mr paulson admitted in a conference call with other administration officials that he had gotten out in front of the administration in his talks with mr rangel these officials say "he was so instrumental that the president had to remind me that mr paulson was not the u s trade representative " says mr rangel allan hubbard chairman of the white house national economic council describes mr paulson as "very aggressive and very determined and it works because he does it for the right reasons its never to promote himself " his style doesnt always go over well at a meeting of cabinet secretaries and other top officials in the west wing of the white house in late february mr paulson burst in a few moments after mr hubbard the presidents top economic adviser asked susan schwab the u s trade representative to brief the group on global trade talks according to two people who were there after apologizing for being late mr paulson interrupted ms schwab to say he had been talking to mr bush about a sudden plunge in stock prices these people say then he sat down next to her and took over the meeting explaining the market drop they say after returning last september from his first trip to china mr paulson briefed cabinet officials and others at the white house about the creation of the strategic economic dialogue the forum that resumes today energy secretary samuel bodman a former deputy treasury secretary spoke up "please explain to me what you think in my dialogue with the chinese is not being addressed that youre going to fix " he said according to two attendees at the meeting tensions flared further when mr paulson told fellow cabinet secretaries to "clear your calendars" to accompany him to china last december these people say treasury officials say they spent several weeks working out scheduling with cabinet members and that many including mr bodman attended the event in china mr paulson acknowledges that hes aggressive but insists hes collegial and never pretends to have all the answers "what has allowed me to be successful is i know how to listen and i know what my weaknesses are " he says he jokes that "hurricane hank" is better than his goldman nickname "the hammer " over his years at goldman mr paulson rose from investment banker to chairman and chief executive and oversaw the firms initial public offering in a hands on ceo he left an average of voice mail messages a day for goldman staffers when his co ceo current new jersey gov jon corzine clashed with top executives and agreed to resign in mr paulson took over mr paulson now lives in the washington mansion that mr corzine owned when he served as a senator in washington mr paulson has worked closely with secretary of state condoleezza rice on efforts to get north korea and iran to rein in their nuclear programs by cutting off capital to those countries "ill call him from time to time and say im about to get this done youre in touch with this finance minister would you mind raising this issue " says ms rice the social security issue has given him a lesson in harsh political reality within weeks of taking the job mr paulson was approaching members of congress economists and others with a request tell me what it takes to get a deal done eager to work with congress to craft a plan to put the giant retirement program on a financially sustainable path he told democrats privately and in public that everything was on the table which is washington code for talking about raising taxes as part of a compromise then vice president dick cheney told fox news "we dont believe a tax increase is necessary " that chilled discussions on capitol hill "nothing is happening on social security " says new hampshire sen judd gregg top republican on the senate budget committee "unfortunately the vice presidents comments imply hes putting a precondition on the discussions and i think that was used as an excuse by some of my colleagues not to move forward " mr paulson says its "frustrating to be in an environment where well meaning people on both sides of the aisle see theres a problem" but dont have the political will to act "ive been asking people to come to the table saying all options are on the table and im getting a little tired of playing solitaire " he says he knew the odds of a social security deal were long when he arrived "if i dont get a deal done when im here hopefully we will make it easier for whoevers sitting in this seat after me to get a deal done and hopefully we can de politicize this issue " he says improving relations with china and pressing for changes to chinese economic policy are high on mr paulsons to do list because chinas currency the yuan does not trade freely against the dollar its goods remain relatively cheap on global markets that in turn has contributed to a distressingly large trade deficit for the u s china has acknowledged it needs to let its currency be more flexible but it wants to move at its own pace some members of congress favor slapping tariffs on chinese goods among other things to force beijing to move more quickly mr paulson favors a longer term dialogue although he knows he has to pry some quick concessions out of china to keep congress at bay as goldman ceo mr paulson traveled to china more than times developing strong ties to key chinese leaders the u s already had a dozen or so ongoing forums for discussions with the chinese he created another one the strategic economic dialogue to focus on long term economic issues such as the environment and financial markets his intention is to use the talks to coax china to make changes while forestalling what he calls protectionist urges in congress "i knew it was going to be very difficult to swim against the tide and so the strategic economic dialogue was designed to help us manage a relationship on a long term basis " he says mr paulson had hoped that his interlocutor would be chinese premier wen jiabao the nations no leader according to a person familiar with the matter instead he got vice premier wu yi one notch down from mr wen the first talks held in beijings great hall got off to an awkward start lower ranking chinese officials had microphones lower ranking u s officials didnt after listening to the chinese read one prepared statement after another mr paulson scrawled a note "ask a question" and passed it to those americans sitting near him according to two people in the room mr paulson says hes pleased with the progress this week the u s and china are expected to announce agreements for more commercial air routes between the two countries and for u s export of clean coal technology u s officials also hope to gain greater access for u s financial firms to the chinese market last week china said it is widening the band in which the yuan can move against the dollar but some key members of congress remain impatient "mr paulsons view was that maybe by just talking to the chinese he could get things done and a number of us told him thats not going to happen based on our experience " says sen charles schumer d n y who is crafting legislation that aims to prod china more forcefully on its currency "i think hank now realizes that talking isnt enough to produce results " under pressure to take a tougher stance the administration has unilaterally imposed sanctions on china for alleged improper pricing of exports and in a world trade organization complaint has accused china of lax enforcement of copyright violations mr paulson didnt oppose the moves although he knew it would be an obstacle to discussions treasury officials say the chinese reacted angrily and mr paulson spent about four hours on the phone with ms wu to smooth over tensions people familiar with the conversation say mr paulson says that in the near term "there may be nothing realistic that can be done that is going to totally satisfy the american people and congress " he defines success as "making progress at a time when we have nationalistic sentiment in both countries " on another front he has pushed to overhaul the legal and regulatory environment for u s businesses he has lent support to a committee led by harvard university law professor hal scott which has recommended better protections from lawsuits for auditors company employees and outside directors last week mr paulson announced an advisory committee to recommend adjustments to how the u s accounting industry operates including looking for ways to limit accountants liability his efforts have drawn fire from some investor advocates "ive always had a philosophy that its important that you run towards the most difficult problems not away from them " he says "i did go in saying i was going to judge my success by the ability to make a difference even if i was swimming against a strong tide "
