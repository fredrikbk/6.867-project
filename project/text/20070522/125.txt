will weakness in dollar bust some couples currency divorces loom as nations may move to head off inflation the weakening dollar may prompt some nations to reconsider tying their economic fortunes to the u s currency on sunday kuwait said it would decouple its currency the dinar from the dollar in order to fight inflation its move resonates not just in the middle east but as far away as china and ecuador other countries that also tie their economies to moves in the dollar last week in response to concerns about an overheating economy china said it would let its currency the yuan fluctuate slightly more than it did in the past a small but symbolic step away from past practices yesterday the dollar strengthened against both the euro and the japanese yen late in new york one euro bought &# however over the past several years the dollar has weakened significantly against a swath of currencies the two main exceptions to that trend china and the oil rich countries of the persian gulf all of which continued to tie their currencies closely to the dollar "theres now some evidence of a move toward greater flexibility from those two blocs " says jens nordvig a currency strategist at goldman sachs so far there is no indication that other persian gulf states with dollar pegs particularly saudi arabia the regions largest economy intend to follow in kuwaits footsteps the central banks of saudi arabia qatar oman and bahrain all rejected a change in their exchange rate policies the united arab emirates has said in the past that it wont alter its policy unless accompanied by other gulf countries if these countries were eventually to follow suit and abandon their links to the dollar it could have important long term implications for the u s one is positive when foreign currencies rise against the dollar it helps close the gaping u s trade deficit by making american exports less costly abroad and therefore more attractive indeed the bush administration has strongly urged china and other countries that have controlled exchange rates as well as mounting stockpiles of u s dollars in their national reserves to let their currencies appreciate the danger is that a falling dollar might also make the oil producers china and other nations with big u s dollar reserves more reluctant to invest in treasury bonds and other dollar assets if that happened the dollar might weaken precipitously and u s interest rates might climb choking off economic growth in the u s in general countries fall into one of several categories when it comes to exchange rates some countries adhere to a regime of fixed exchange rates either against one currency or a basket of currencies and allow fluctuations only within a very narrow band china falls into this category others such as india adopt a policy of managed exchange rates where their governments intervene to prevent them from appreciating or depreciating a third group lets its currencies float more or less freely a final category of countries including ecuador uses the u s dollar as its official currency in many respects kuwait and other gulf nations are dealing with the side effects of their own prosperity economists say that the flood of oil money flowing into the gulf region is likely to make pegs to the dollar increasingly costly to maintain as oil prices have risen in recent years those countries have received an unprecedented flow of dollars into their coffers annual revenues from oil and gas more than tripled from to according to mckinsey &amp co now they are slowly increasing government spending and inflation has picked up in most gulf states as more than &# trillion in construction and development projects in the region get underway one way that countries minimize inflationary pressure is by raising interest rates but nations that tie their currencies closely to the dollar are limited in the degree to which they can raise rates another way for a nation to counteract inflationary pressure let the currency strengthen if youre an oil exporter "youll want a strong currency to prevent overheating" of the economy says barry eichengreen an economist at the university of california at berkeley "pegging to a declining dollar has the opposite effect " kuwaits inflation rate was in december but climbed to at the end of march qatar and uae inflation rates touched or above last year kuwait tied its dinar to the u s dollar in as part of a six nation gulf cooperation council plan to introduce a common regional currency in kuwaits decision to strike out on its own by pegging the dinar to a basket of currencies is likely to delay the implementation of that plan the plan for monetary union which included a peg to the dollar was hatched when "the dollar was strong and oil at &# a barrel " says brad setser senior economist at rge monitor an economics web site since then of course not only has the dollar weakened but oil prices have soared a complete reversal of the original circumstances overall exchange rates pegged to the dollar have fallen out of favor around the world even in latin america where leaders in volatile economies viewed a fixed exchange rate as a life rope to stability the view of the dollar has soured in recent years that was one of the painful lessons of the global financial crisis that rippled through asia and latin america in the late s one by one countries that pegged their exchange rates to the dollar found themselves forced to drain their foreign reserves to keep their currencies from falling and one by one the countries discovered that they were unable to beat back market forces and finally had to abandon the pegs for more flexible systems john lyons contributed to this article dollar gains on rivals amid u s stock
