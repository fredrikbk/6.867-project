chinas bubble is defying beijing stocks push higher despite measures to cool investors enthusiasm shanghai the headstrong bullishness of chinas stock market investors is raising the stakes for beijing as it taps the brakes so far unsuccessfully on a month rally that is giving foreign analysts a case of the jitters yesterday chinas stock exchanges ignored an interest rate increase and a package of other measures that represented beijings most direct attempt to cool investor enthusiasm the benchmark shanghai composite index spent less than an hour in negative territory before roaring to finish with a gain at a record high the rise puts the index up this year a quadrupling of the shanghai index in less than two years has pushed the markets total capitalization up by five times to &# trillion exceeding the sum of household bank savings nationwide analysts say the chinese government is wary of sparking a crash as it recognizes much of the investment is from a middle class that is widely depended upon to spur car purchases home sales and otherwise propel the economy now analysts are wondering how beijing might buttress its fastest back to back interest rate increases in at least years and respond to a market that even investors are quick to label a bubble jerry lou morgan stanleys china strategist in hong kong says beijing could slap a tax on trading or introduce other steps but he says the countrys leaders will be increasingly unlikely to act forcefully if investors push stocks to even loftier levels "the longer the chinese government waits the more passive they will become because the cost of cooling it down will be higher " mr lou says in most markets interest rate increases are enough to send investors to the sidelines on worries of an economic slowdown a rate increase usually hurts stocks because it raises costs both for listed companies that have borrowings to repay and for investors whose buying power is crimped by higher credit costs like mortgage payments however chinas rate increases havent cooled investor ardor yesterdays stock market performance marked the fourth time in a row that chinese share prices rose on the first trading day after an interest rate increase chinas poorly developed financial system limits the effectiveness of lending rate changes on the economy instead the power of chinas interest rate boost over the weekend was aimed at taking the sheen off stocks by making bank deposits look more appealing the payout for deposits was raised by a margin greater than the rise in loan charges now a one year deposit will earn after an increase of percentage point but that interest is taxable leaving bank deposits unattractive in an economy where inflation is running at the one year lending rate was boosted only percentage point to ordinary people continue to pour money into stocks apparently sensing the indecision at the highest levels in beijing about taking action "the government is afraid that the market rose too quickly and also worried it could collapse " said yi xianrong a researcher at the chinese academy of social sciences in beijing publicly the government is "ambivalent " he says while ordinary people "want to be rich overnight " despite increasing signs of concern from some quarters in beijing investors talk of a one way bet on the market until at least next years olympics while some say they recognize risks are increasing they remain in the market qi yiqin a year old says he figures the bottom could fall out of stocks by june or july and has pared his portfolio significantly his strategy now is to enter and exit from the market quickly adding that he is confident "i can run when the market starts to drop dramatically " but with almost million stock accounts now open including opened just this past friday any panic selling might test the limits of the system so far sellers havent reported any problems and the only jostling this year has been for places in line to open brokerage
