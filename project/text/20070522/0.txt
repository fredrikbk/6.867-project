worst in history jimmy carter made a remarkable statement late last week in telling the arkansas democrat gazette that "i think as far as the adverse impact on the nation around the world the bush administration has been the worst in history " it was an unprecedented comment from an ex president someone who isnt a disinterested observer mr carter may be trying to spare his own administration the "worst in history" label which it fully deserves as president mr carter managed to alienate nearly every major country in the world and did so without asserting american power in ways that might justify that alienation no other president has crammed as many foreign policy debacles into a four year period the sandinista takeover of nicaragua and the iranian revolution and hostage crisis are but two examples of many near the end of his term it should be remembered mr carters approval rating fell to the lowest in the history of polling of course the reason mr carter and others rank president bush at the bottom is the iraq war mr carter himself did not get the country into a war during his presidency likely because he lacked the fortitude if we want a useful comparison with presidents who did get us into a difficult war we need look no further than the two men who put the united states into its last protracted conflict john f kennedy and lyndon b johnson kennedy commands much admiration among the literati in part because his vietnam decisions have been misunderstood four and a half decades after kennedy dramatically deepened americas commitment to south vietnam we are just now learning critical facts about his actions this alone might cause us to beware of sweeping pronouncements about a president and his place in history while he is still in office new evidence shows that kennedy reluctantly allowed ambassador henry cabot lodge to instigate the disastrous coup against south vietnamese president ngo dinh diem in november the event that did the most to draw the u s into the war lodge a liberal republican favored a coup because diem was not handling south vietnamese dissidents the way an american politician would during october in violation of presidential orders lodge secretly encouraged a group of south vietnamese generals to revolt igniting the conspiracy that produced the coup three weeks later lodge did not notify washington of his actions but one week before the coup top administration officials caught wind of it although kennedy was incensed he did not stop lodge in the summer of kennedy had appointed lodge a prominent republican with presidential aspirations to be ambassador to vietnam to shield himself from republican criticism if the situation in southeast asia worsened but this maneuver shackled kennedy the president couldnt fire or rein in lodge for fear that in a presidential candidate lodge would accuse him of mismanaging the crisis like too many democrats today kennedy put a higher priority on undermining republicans than on advancing americas interests abroad the coup went ahead and the south vietnamese went from winning the war to losing it because of the ineptitude of the new rulers historians have always heaped blame on lyndon johnson for vietnam but not always for the right reasons like kennedy johnson assigned a higher priority to his re election than the good of the country in the late summer and fall of fearing that warlike behavior and words could erode his lead over barry goldwater in the polls johnson rejected the militarys recommendations for powerful retaliatory air strikes against north vietnam portraying himself as the candidate of peace he said that he would not send american boys to do what asian boys could do for themselves we now know thanks to new sources from the communist side that johnsons conduct in the summer and fall of convinced hanoi that the americans would not intervene if north vietnam invaded south vietnam this deduction combined with the deterioration of the south vietnamese government led the north vietnamese to invade the south at the end of the invasion in turn compelled the united states to begin sending hundreds of thousands of combat troops to southeast asia president bush obviously made decisions on iraq that have had unforeseen and unfortunate consequences we know he received some inaccurate intelligence and that some of his subordinates provided faulty advice on how to deal with post invasion iraq but we are far from knowing all of the information that was available to him or the full content of his discussions with his advisers at this point it appears that the iraq war resulted from decisions that the president sincerely believed would benefit the u s and the peoples of the middle east if that is what history concludes president bush wont be considered the "worst" american president he will certainly deserve more respect than war presidents who undermined the american cause by putting re election before the national interest mr moyar is the author of "triumph forsaken the vietnam war " cambridge university press
