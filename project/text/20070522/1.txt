a cultural conversation with bruce cole this neh chairman is our official history scold washington was it artful or accidental its hard to say with a man like bruce cole the clever but low key chairman of the national endowment for the humanities there on the coffee table of the sitting area in his office one recent day were a few posters that just happen to unite mr coles longstanding personal interests and his more recent professional ones the posters display grant woods fanciful painting "the midnight ride of paul revere " this time galloping to announce the nehs "picturing america" campaign as part of that pilot program the neh will distribute laminated posters depicting artworks that teachers can use to teach american history besides the grant wood theres norman rockwells "freedom of speech " joseph stellas "brooklyn bridge" and dorothea langes iconic photograph "migrant mother " among others it would be hard to find a program more indicative of mr cole an art historian who came to the neh years ago and has since spread the alarm about americans ignorance of american history and why thats so distressing if mr cole is known at all neh chairmen rarely make headlines its for statements like "history is a safeguard for our democracy" and "its part of our national security " in speeches he frequently cites appalling statistics half the students in elite universities cannot date the civil war to the correct half century for example and more people can name the three stooges than can list the three government branches noting that americans are united not by race or religion but by ideas and ideals he says that the "waves of people arriving on our shores" make knowledge of our history all the more important "democracy is not inborn " he explains "it has to be learned " mr cole also says things others might find old fashioned and perhaps even politically incorrect "we have to look at the valleys and the peaks but i do believe in american exceptionalism " he said by way of explaining his zeal "this is the greatest country that has ever existed " for these sentiments mr cole has elicited some praise but also smirks and snickers last year washington post critic philip kennicott wrote that his "dogmatic public statements on art and literature are increasingly embarrassing " mr cole himself acknowledges some raised eyebrows in his audiences when he speaks of the homeland security connection but adds "i dont remember anyone laughing " in any case his remedy for the national affliction is a program called "we the people " which since its inception in has spent more than &# million on teacher institutes and workshops museum exhibits research fellowships digitization of historic newspapers public programming at historic sites and similar projects the grants are to quote one description on the neh web site geared toward projects that "explore significant events and themes in our nations history and culture and that advance knowledge of the principles that define america " that approach departs dramatically from the "my history is americas history" program it supplanted a pc thing started in by mr coles predecessor william r ferris still when asked to explain the difference mr cole demurs pressed he says that "were not interested just in personal history and the history of your family history is fashioned by people who really make a difference " finally on the third question he is critical "we did go off track with the emphasis on individual history " at first glance mr cole seems an odd choice for the job of americas official history scold hes a button downed guy though not so staid that he wouldnt wear a bright purple tie which matched his purple pin striped shirt with his dark suit hes spent his life as a scholar of renaissance art mainly at indiana university traveling to italy about times as you may have guessed he deplores some trends in museology which is not insignificant considering that the neh makes grants to museums that amounted to almost &# million in the fiscal year that ended sept he does not for example favor some things museums do to push for broader audiences "im against museum exhibitions that are simply mounted to bring people in " he says "how many more exhibitions do we need of monet and gauguin now i have no objections if they create new knowledge and that can be done " in a similar vein and without raising his voice he berates other recent examples of questionable art museum shows "exhibitions on hip hop guitars and star wars are appropriate for a rock n roll museum " he says "but i dont think guitars and star wars are necessarily art " he gives a pass to the infamous "art of the motorcycle" show at the solomon r guggenheim museum in because he owns and rides a motorcycle while he concedes that a decade of museum expansions has probably caused a structural problem that necessitates attempts to draw huge crowds philosophically he has a different view "i dont think we have to bring more people in though we want them to come in " he explains "im not so interested in whether youre a doctor or whatever that you know when masaccio was born but i want you to know that art is important i would like to give as many people as possible the opportunity to understand that art can improve the quality of life it should be available " if mr cole the art historian finds art to be optional however he is also quick to get back to his main message about history "i dont necessarily know that its a bad thing if people dont know about art or classical music but i think we should offer it as an opportunity that doesnt mean you dont like country &amp western music or watch tv " he says "i dont feel that way about american history " its essential here he tells the story of ronald reagans parting words as president "he said this country comes from well informed patriotism its that love of country that love of place thats necessary for any countrys survival you can call them myths if you want but unless we have them we dont have anything " so for history he does want crowds in fact realizing how expensive museum shows are nowadays the neh has announced it will give two "special chairmans awards" of &# million to large scale important traveling humanities exhibitions that "have exceptional potential for attracting large numbers of visitors " the neh has the wherewithal to make such large grants because its budget has grown under mr cole from &# million in fiscal to &# million in the administrations fiscal request which at just a bit more than last years allocation is likely to pass congress as is or even supplemented the national humanities alliance has received support from dozens of lawmakers for its petition to add another &# million "the administrations support of the endowment has not gotten the publicity it deserves " he says adding "weve done a lot of significant things but like the administrations support for cultural agencies we havent been able to get our story out " citing new neh funded programs in state humanities councils the nearly high school and college teachers who attended neh seminars and institutes last summer the who have attended "we the people" seminars at american historical landmarks and other "achievements " mr cole believes hes making progress on his main goal but he cant prove it "this is a problem that is years in the making and weve only done this for five years " he says besides the neh cant do the whole job "itll require vast improvements in the way history is taught k " "picturing america" may just help there proudly mr cole states that the neh received an "unprecedented number of applications" some for this years awards winners will receive the set of sturdy posters plus a course book and other teaching materials and who can say about next year "im in this job because im interested in democratizing the humanities " mr cole says at one point "my job is to use taxpayers money to reach as many people as possible " ms dobrzynski writes for the journal about arts and culture
