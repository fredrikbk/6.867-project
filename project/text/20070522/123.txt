yuan worries fact china runs a large and growing trade surplus with the united states in the goods trade surplus exceeded &# billion this was an increase from of &# billion an amount larger than the entire deficit just years ago fact china focuses its monetary policy on fixing the exchange value of its currency the yuan relative to the u s dollar many policymakers and pundits connect these two facts by asserting that an unfairly low value of the dollar yuan peg is causing the massive bilateral trade imbalance the th congress introduced pieces of anti china trade legislation the current congress already has over a dozen such bills many aiming to force an overhaul of chinas exchange rate regime and late last week dozens of house members were poised to file a section petition asking the u s trade representative to investigate undervaluation of the chinese yuan these misgivings about the dollar yuan peg are misplaced economic theory and data are very clear here on two critical points controlling a nominal exchange rate is a form of sovereign monetary policy and monetary policy in turn has no long run effect on real economic outcomes such as output and trade flows like all other central banks the peoples bank of china uses its monopoly power over minting its money to control one nominal price since the pboc has chosen to closely target the dollar yuan price in recent times maintaining this target has required the pboc to print yuan to buy dollars and thereby accumulate dollar denominated assets on its balance sheet many central banks today use their sovereign power to fix a nominal short term interest rate rather than a nominal exchange rate the u s federal reserve targets the federal funds rate the european central bank targets the main refinancing operations rate and the bank of japan targets the overnight call rate but exchange rate targets are by no means uncommon indeed in of the worlds countries fixed their exchange rates and many countries have switched their targets over time from to for example the federal reserve targeted the value of the dollar at &# per ounce of gold to select a policy target each central bank must evaluate how alternatives might or might not influence its monetary policy goals chinese capital markets today lack many of the microeconomic institutions that transmit changes in short term interest rates into the broader economy e g a primary dealer market in government debt securities and more generally a deep network of investment and commercial banks allocating credit guided by risk adjusted returns this may well be one reason the pboc maintains its exchange rate target an interest rate target might weaken its linkages to the real economy and just like other central banks the pboc has been adjusting its target nominal price gradually without dramatic changes that can have adverse short run impacts but hasnt the nominal dollar yuan peg unfairly driven the long run rise in trade imbalances no the exchange rate that matters for trade flows is the real exchange rate the nominal exchange rate adjusted for local currency output prices in both countries supply and demand pressures in international markets can and do alter not just nominal exchange rates but also nominal prices for goods and services and these pressures driving the real exchange rate in turn reflect the deep forces of comparative advantage such as cross country differences in technology tastes and endowments of labor and capital to demonstrate this critical point look to europe the yuan floats against european currencies such as the euro and the pound if nominal exchange rates were driving trade flows as commonly alleged then chinese exports to the u s should have been growing faster than to europe the data show something completely different however in monthly chinese exports to both destinations averaged about &# billion by monthly chinese exports to both destinations were still the same at about &# billion plotted together over that entire decade these two series look nearly identical this is because the same real economic forces e g chinas relative abundance of less skilled labor have been driving both sets of trade flows put it this way in a counter factual world where over the past decade china allowed the yuan to float against the dollar the u s would still have run a large and growing trade deficit with china the real economic forces of comparative advantage that drive trade flows operate regardless of which nominal prices central banks choose to fix this week the u s government hosts chinese officials for the second round of the strategic economic dialogue treasury secretary henry paulson and chinese vice premier wu yi have framed the sed as a forum to address complex policy issues associated with the links between our two countries in china further capital market reform is needed to support economic growth via better risk management and capital allocation throughout all sectors of the economy here at home the large aggregate gains the u s has realized from freer trade and investment with china have also generated hardship too many american workers firms and communities have been hurt not helped by chinese competition issues like these are legitimate and real but focusing on the dollar yuan peg is a misplaced and counterproductive way to address them instead let china continue to conduct its sovereign monetary policy and let the sed continue to engage the real challenges stop fixating on the fix mr slaughter a professor at the tuck school of
