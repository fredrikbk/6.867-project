a reporters fate dozens of hostages were released in gaza over the weekend in the wake of a truce called between the warring factions of hamas and fatah the bbcs alan johnston now in his th week of captivity was not among them i last saw mr johnston in january the day before mahmoud abbas was elected to succeed yasser arafat as president of the palestinian authority mr johnston was by then the only western correspondent living and working full time in gaza although the strip was still considered a safe destination for day tripping foreign journalists he kindly lent me his office to interview sami abu zuhri a hamas spokesman and asked whether i was still editing the jerusalem post he seemed genuinely oblivious to the notion that my by then former association with an israeli newspaper was not the sort of information i wanted broadcast to a roomful of palestinian stringers january was also the last time one could feel remotely optimistic about an independent palestinian future mr abbas had campaigned for office promising "clean legal institutions so we can be considered a civilized society " he won by an overwhelming margin in an election hamas refused to contest there had been a sharp decline in israeli palestinian violence thanks mainly to israeli counterterrorism measures and the security fence a benetton outlet had opened in ramallah signaling better times ahead in gaza things were different however and mr johnston was prescient in reporting on the potential for internecine strife "this internal conflict between police and the militants cannot happen " one of his stories quotes a palestinian police chief as saying "it is forbidden we are a single nation " yet in more palestinians were killed by other palestinians than by israelis it got worse in following israels withdrawal from the gaza strip and hamass victory in parliamentary elections "the occupation was not as bad as the lawlessness and corruption that we are facing now " palestinian editor hafiz barghouti admitted to mr johnston in a widely cited remark when mr johnston was kidnapped by persons unknown on march apparently dragged at gunpoint from his car while on his way home he became at least the rd western journalist to have been held hostage in gaza in most cases the kidnappings rarely lasted more than a day yet in august foxnewss steve centanni and cameraman olaf wiig were held for two weeks physically abused and forced to convert to islam plainly matters were getting progressively worse for foreigners so why did the bbc keep mr johnston in place one answer is journalistic fidelity mr johnston had been the bbcs man in kabul during the taliban era he was used to hard places his dispatches about the travails of ordinary gazans brimmed with humane sympathy and any news organization would prefer to have its own reporter on the scene than to rely on stringers yet the bbc also seemed to operate in the palestinian authority with a sense of political impunity palestinian information minister mustafa barghouti described mr johnston as someone who "has done a lot for our cause" not the sort of endorsement one imagines the bbc welcoming from an equivalent figure on the israeli side other bbc correspondents were notorious for making their politics known to their viewers barbara plett confessed to breaking into tears when arafat was airlifted to a parisian hospital in october orla guerin treated israels capture of a living wired teenage suicide bomber that march as nothing more than a pr stunt "a picture that israel wants the world to see " though doubtlessly sincere these views also conferred institutional advantages for the bbc in terms of access and protection one reason why the broadcaster might have felt relatively comfortable posting mr johnston in a place no other news agency dared to go by contrast reporters who displeased palestinian authorities could be made to pay a price in one notorious case in october italian reporter riccardo cristiano of rai published a letter in a palestinian newspaper insisting he had not been the one who had broadcast images of two israeli soldiers being lynched in ramallah "we respect the journalistic regulations of the palestinian authority " he wrote blaming rival mediaset for the transgression i had a similar experience when i quoted a palestinian journalist describing as "riff raff" those of his neighbors celebrating the attacks of sept within a day the journalist was chided and threatened by palestinian officials for having spoken to me they were keeping close tabs still whatever the benefits of staying on the right side of the palestinian powers that be they have begun to wane for years the bbc had invariably covered palestinian affairs within the context of israels occupation the core truth from which all manifestations of conflict supposedly derived developments within gaza following israels withdrawal showed the hollowness of that analysis domestic palestinian politics it turned out were shot through with their own discontents contradictions and divisions not just between hamas and fatah but between scores of clans gangs factions and personalities opposition to israel helped in some ways to mute this reality but it could not suppress it this is the situation not a new one but one the foreign media had for years mostly ignored in which the drama of mr johnstons captivity is playing out initial reports suggested he had been kidnapped by the so called popular resistance committee later an al qaeda affiliate called the army of islam claimed to have killed him more recently evidence has come to light suggesting hes alive and being held by a criminal gang based in the southern town of rafah the british government is reportedly in talks with a radical islamist cleric in their custody abu qatada whose release the army of islam has demanded for mr johnstons freedom what the british will do and what effect that might have remains to be seen for now one can only pray for mr johnstons safe release later the bbc might ask itself whether its own failures of prudence and judgment put its reporters life in jeopardy the bbcs paul adams has said of his colleague that it was "his job to bring us day after day reports of the palestinian predicament " for that act of solidarity one hopes a terrible price will not be paid
