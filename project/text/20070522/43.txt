freddie guts frank barney frank has received kudos for his "statesmanship" in ushering a compromise on oversight of fannie mae and freddie mac through his financial services committee but all that diplomacy was blown away late last week by the mortgage giants allies in the house their amendment to mr franks bill which passed by voice vote thursday night guts the one provision that made it worth the effort whats left is a regulator who would lack the authority to limit the risk that fannie and freddies &# trillion mortgage backed securities portfolios pose to the financial system plus a &# million a year boondoggle that goes by the euphemism "affordable housing fund " mr frank says he stands by his handshake with treasury secretary hank paulson and will work to get the portfolio limitation power restored via house senate negotiations but thursdays floor ambush by democrat melissa bean and republican randy neugebauer calls into question whether mr frank has the votes to make good on that promise with fannie and especially freddie back to their arm twisting ways on the hill the answer would appear to be "no " that leaves the white house and treasury with some decisions administration officials were cautious about the bean neugebauer amendment when first proposed but fannie and freddies friends are betting the administration wants a deal enough to accept even a bad one however a "reform" that does nothing to reduce the problem of putting so much housing risk into two companies and which also includes an annual &# million donation to "housing" activists such as acorn is worse than the status quo last year when reform negotiations faltered treasury started grumbling about its power to approve fannie and freddies applications to issue new debt that threat never went anywhere but its still out there and could be used to rein in fan and fred without any change to existing law restricting their borrowing to debt that actually furthers their original housing "mission" might just bring the companies around to either substantive reform or better full privatization the alternative is to hope that mr franks word will prove better down the road than it did on the house floor last week this assumes he and other democratic leaders are sincere as opposed to pretending to favor reform while letting fannie and freddie have their way and pleading "nolo contendere " given congresss history of placating these companies and their lobbying clout you dont have to be a cynic to suspect the worst
