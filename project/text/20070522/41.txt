food banks go hungry as manufacturers retailers reduce waste overstocks charitable pantries suffer three years ago the food bank for monterey county would receive a truckload filled with as much as pounds of dented soup cans mislabeled cereal boxes and other salvage products every three weeks says leslie sunny the banks executive director now the bank receives one truckload every three to four months "if were lucky " she says nationwide food banks clearinghouses that distribute food donations to local charitable pantries and emergency shelters report receiving fewer donations in the form of imperfectly packaged canned and boxed edibles it is the down side of a drive in recent years by manufacturers and retailers for greater supply chain efficiency toward that end many food manufacturers began producing food in quantities more closely tailored to individual retail customers needs that in turn has reduced the amount of food that gets sold to retailers and ultimately returned to the manufacturers at the same time new technology has helped eliminate production errors such as processing canned food without labels or producing an entire order of cereal boxes using upside down text to make up for the product loss food banks are seeking ways to raise money to buy more food they are also looking for new types of food including perishables some food banks are hiring trucks to pick up food directly from farms the food bank shortages are nationwide the community food banks of south dakota in sioux falls s d received fewer donations from grocery stores last year the greater chicago food depository the nations fourth largest food bank in terms of the amount of food distributed has fewer donations this year than last "for years food just landed in our lap " says kate maehr executive director of the chicago depository now she says "we have to work twice as hard to get half the amount of food " many food banks have made up for the loss of salvage products by buying food through donation drives but others are giving out less food overall faye gilliam years old volunteers at the monterey food bank in exchange for a "thank you box" filled with food like canned tuna bread fresh vegetables and canned soup ms gilliam is disabled and relies on the box to help put food on the table for herself and her husband she says that the boxs contents have grown leaner over the

chicagos inner city pantry coordinator cathy moore works amid a bustle of volunteers handing out brown paper bags of food to the needy the bags are filled with an eclectic mix uncooked red beans kraft pasta salad "gourmet favorites " skippy peanut butter campbells tomato soup manischewitz matzos a chocolate easter bunny some swiss miss hot cocoa like most pantries st james relies on food banks to sell them groceries at deeply discounted rates this year ms moore says the menu of food choices from the greater chicago food depository is smaller "they dont offer as much as they used to " she says but she says "weve been blessed" because the pantry received a &# grant from kraft foods inc last year which has enabled it to buy more food directly from the local grocery store that means the

bank is seeing about fewer donations over the past year says executive director terry shannon st marys which bills itself as the worlds first food bank was established in by the late john van hengel after talking with a poor woman who scavenged for dented canned food in grocery store dumpsters a creative character who dabbled in everything from advertising to driving beer trucks he came up with the idea of having a central location for food industry waste the concept is workable as long as the waste proliferates but retailers are finding new avenues to sell damaged goods some grocery stores are putting dented cans in discount bins rather than sending them to the local food bank others are selling product into the so called gray market where brokers sell unsalable groceries to discount stores flea markets or "banana box" grocery stores shops that sell salvage food packaged in old banana boxes grocery stores are also increasingly using sophisticated technology that allows them to closely monitor their inventory thereby stocking only the products that are selling "we understand exactly what were ordering whats being scanned out " says jeff norkiewicz a board member of the northern illinois food bank and vice president at dominicks finer foods a chicago based grocery store owned by safeway inc the pleasanton calif supermarket chain today an estimated of the total goods

chain supervalu inc of eden prairie minn says that contributions to food banks "have remained steady or continued to increase in many areas of the country " food manufacturers point out that they are

says kellogg donated more than &# million of food last year to americas second harvest a national network of food banks up from the food banks themselves are innovating as spare cans of beans and boxes of pasta become less plentiful some are acquiring more perishable products like bruised bananas and meat just past its sell by date although often more nutritious than canned goods perishables can be difficult and expensive to handle and carry a measure of risk but food banks say the sell by date is usually much earlier than the true expiration date and that they take pains to ensure nothing is spoiled some food banks like the one in salinas are buying refrigerators and refrigerated trucks dennis smith executive director of the northern illinois food bank in st charles ill says the bank has actually increased its donations by ramping up its recovery of perishable products directly from retailers at the food bank of contra costa and solano in california nonperishable food
