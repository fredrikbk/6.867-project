for the device it also has a big lead here over its new rival research in motion inc s blackberry while blackberrys have been increasing in popularity in the u s europe and parts of asia for many years they were only introduced in indonesia in late industry analysts say nokias ability to sell more smart phones like the communicator is crucial to maintaining profit margins which are being squeezed by manufacturers such as motorola inc and samsung co ltd in the fierce competition to sell simpler low cost handsets in fast growing emerging markets nokia the worlds largest cellphone

&# billion nokia based in espoo finland has a head start in emerging markets like indonesia operators such as rim were slower to roll out their services because they "dont have the global scale and power of brand that nokia has " says eva bakowicz a telecommunications analyst with global insight a market data company based in boston rim which like nokia doesnt break out individual country sales is happy with its indonesia business and is focusing on attracting high value clients such as multinational companies says spokeswoman katie lee "our target is a niche market " she says still loyalty to nokia has made indonesia a tough market to crack shanti poesposoetjipto a prominent local businesswoman has tried other smart phones for short spells most recently the dopod powered by microsoft corp s windows and made by taiwan based high tech computer corp but they all lacked one key ingredient nobody else seemed to be using them "its in to have a communicator " she says some users take pride in the smallest differences in their devices abdoel djalal a year old former lecturer who wears his phone in a pouch on his belt loop is proud that his communicator was assembled in finland it is no different from a china manufactured model in terms of quality but its considered a status symbol nevertheless "im incredibly loyal to this brand " he says one factor fueling the rise of the communicator it has become a popular gift for indonesians that want to win influence in the countrys parliament or with a business partners its price tag makes it a substantial enough gift but not a wildly expensive one "its considered to be so prestigious you give it to your most important business partner " says antti vasara a finland based senior vice president in nokias enterprise solutions group which develops the communicator some folks carry two models just because they can "other politicians have two so i have to have two " says zulkieflimansyah a member of parliament who alternates between his phones to answer calls and send messages nokia was initially surprised by the success of the communicator in such an unlikely market "wow why is it selling there " was a common response from nokia executives in finland says mr vasara the buzz around the communicator is a great marketing tool in indonesia which has one of the lowest cellphone penetration rates in asia less than of indonesias million citizens currently use cellphones a much lower proportion than in malaysia at and the philippines penetration rates have been low in indonesia because of poverty and a slow introduction of cellphone services many people couldnt afford phones until recently now that the economy is growing again analysts say the rate should pick up quickly but in jakarta some die hard communicator fans dont like attempts to modernize a tried and tested model one problem the es g network wont have the capability to send faxes although faxes arent as popular as they once were in the developed world they are important for doing business in many parts of asia others complain that the trend to slim down the communicator means a smaller keyboard and more difficulty typing "i preferred the older models " declares mr djalal
