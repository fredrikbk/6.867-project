what diabetes patients need to know analysis of drug heart attack link raises questions doctors and diabetes patients were scrambling yesterday to learn more about a new analysis in the new england journal of medicine that links avandia a drug for type diabetes to an increased risk of heart attacks the analysis was conducted by steven nissen a cleveland clinic cardiologist who was an early critic of vioxx a painkiller that was withdrawn from the market but while diabetes groups said the news about avandia was cause for concern they stopped short of recommending that patients stop taking the drug the issue needs "further analysis before we would really make definitive statements one way or another " says sue kirkman vice president of clinical affairs for the american diabetes association here are some questions and answers for patients q what is avandia a like many other drugs for type diabetes glaxosmithklines avandia is meant to help patients lower the amount of sugar in their blood avandia and a rival drug takeda pharmaceutical co s actos are the two drugs in a class called tzds or thiazolidinediones that are known in particular for helping patients who are resistant to the hormone insulin which reduces blood sugar levels q what is the concern about avandia a the new england journal of medicine released an analysis by dr nissen linking avandia to an increased risk of heart attacks the analysis was based on data gathered from public sources and combined studies a form of research called a meta analysis the analysis showed a higher risk of heart attacks among patients taking avandia compared with what avandia was being compared against in clinical trials the analysis showed a elevated rate of cardiovascular death though this didnt meet a standard statistical test for significance among people in dr nissens analysis who took avandia the rate of heart attack was between and while the cardiovascular death rate was between and the results of a meta analysis arent considered as strong as those from a single large clinical trial however dr nissen calls the analysis "very concerning " an editorial that accompanied the analysis in the medical journal said that "regulatory action by the food and drug administration is now warranted " and "the rationale for prescribing avandia at this time is unclear " glaxosmithkline plc which makes avandia said in a statement that it "strongly disagrees" with the findings which the company said were based on "incomplete evidence and a methodology that the author admits has significant limitations " q should patients stop taking avandia a in a statement the food and drug administration said that it is "aware of a potential safety issue" related to avandia but the fda added that other published and unpublished data provide "contradictory evidence" about the drugs risks and that the fda is analyzing of all available data last year the fda required a labeling change for avandia to include a new warning about a potential increase in heart attacks and heart related chest pain in some individuals based on a trial in patients with existing congestive heart failure in a joint statement the american heart association american college of cardiology and american diabetes association said the study "deserves serious thought and follow up" though the overall level of risk associated with the drug "appears to be small " the groups said patients should not stop taking any prescribed drugs without talking with their health care providers dr kirkman of the american diabetes association noted that diabetics are at a high risk for cardiovascular problems however she said "we dont feel that this is an emergency or a panic situation and we certainly dont advise that people go off medication without talking to their health care provider about alternatives " she says richard hellman president of the american association of clinical endocrinologists said dr nissens study raises the possibility that certain patients such as those who have heart disease may be at especially high risk he said the association isnt recommending that doctors stop prescribing avandia altogether q what other drugs are available for patients with type diabetes a there are several types of drugs for the disease and patients often take more than one of these drugs at a time aside from insulin there is a group of drugs called sulfonylureas which are older and sold generically as glyburide glimepiride and glipizide another widely prescribed generic drug is metformin among newer drugs for the disease are merck &amp co s pill januvia which is in a new class called dpp inhibitors and eli lilly &amp co and amylin pharmaceuticals inc s byetta which is injected the oldest drug for diabetes is insulin which is typically injected though pfizer inc s exubera form is inhaled m angelyn bethel at endocrinologist at duke university medical center in durham n c says "i have been very cautious about this drug class the class that avandia is in peroxisome proliferator activated receptors in general just because of the risks we knew about already the exacerbation of heart failure events in the past the classic treatment has been considered to be metformin particularly for patients who are overweight " diabetes is a "progressive" disease meaning that patients tend to need more drugs over time says dr kirkman different classes of drugs work in the body in different ways and have different effects for instance metformin is associated with some weight loss or at least is weight neutral dr kirkman says while the sulfonylureas and insulin can cause weight gain the tzds have also been associated with weight gain and fluid retention byetta has been associated with weight loss while januvia is weight neutral however there are also side effects and other issues for patients to consider for instance byetta can cause nausea and vomiting and while some doctors are enthusiastic about januvia others say they arent impressed by its ability to reduce patients blood sugar levels jeanne whalen and anna wilde mathews contributed to this article
