style films and multiplex theaters is next this promising new movie market illustrates how vietnams prowess as an exporter of bicycles shoes and shrimp has created a burgeoning consumer economy now that the country has joined the world trade organization western and asian companies are piling in to get a piece of the market they include american movie industry investors who previously saw the country mainly as a setting for vietnam war films most of which were actually shot in the philippines or thailand competition is fierce however in the past few years a range of businesses have emerged to part upwardly mobile vietnamese from their cash new magazines on business and fashion are hitting the streets and not all of them are published by the government internet use while heavily regulated by communist web watchers in the capital hanoi has now reached of vietnams citizens many of whom go online in neighborhood internet cafes the countrys white hot stock market is also soaking

&# million plan to build a chain of multiplexes one an eight screen seat theater in hanoi is already open and doing roaring business many vietnamese have only a passing familiarity with american pop culture and sometimes they dont get things quite right a sidewalk of stars outside the diamond plaza theater in ho chi minh city for example features angelina jolie eddie murphy queen latifah and bridget jones presenting the latter as an actress rather than the film character played by renee zellweger no matter moviegoers are turning out in droves forgoing cheap pirate dvds to get a taste of what they believe is the real thing "the reason i come here is because i can feel the film not just see it " says nguyen kim ta who was catching steve martins remake of "the pink panther" with his girlfriend on a recent night seeing the same new films along with the rest of the world has only recently become an option in vietnam a couple of decades ago a youthful mr hoang worked for a government enterprise distributing state funded films to the countrys movie theaters "there wasnt much other entertainment then so the cinemas were always full " he says his face crinkling as he smiles some of the films were terrible many were propaganda pieces produced by the vietnamese government while similar films were imported from russia bulgaria or romania and dubbed into the local language "the bulgarian comedies were particularly bad " mr hoang recalls with a shudder mr hoang is now trying to instill a craving among film fans for the full surround sound popcorn munching experience there are some tricky hurdles to negotiate however finding the right location is one where possible mr hoang says he likes to build cinemas in shopping malls so he can capture a slice of

potential risks for foreign investors betting heavily on vietnam time warner inc unit warner bros in november said it would pull out of the cinema business in neighboring china to which vietnam is often compared the company originally entered china in under laws that allowed foreigners to hold up to of cinema businesses in seven chinese cities two years later china banned foreign control of

deforges megastars multiplex manager in hanoi "we know what works and what doesnt and we dont try to push it wedding crashers for instance had too much sexual content so we didnt use that " that leaves big budget action films gritty local dramas with titles like "gangster girls" or off the wall comedies especially sophomoric films starring comic actor rob schneider vietnamese audiences are particularly vocal about what they are seeing on screen mr deforges says the typical vietnamese moviegoer "reacts easily to films and speaks a lot" while watching a movie mr deforges says "during the hot chick they laughed at every little bit " he says "i didnt expect that it would work so well "
