the daily fix ncaa tournament snubs lament their missed chance online edition theres plenty of time to consider whos in the ncaa mens basketball field of unveiled last night the tournament doesnt begin until thursday right now wonderful thursday is a long way away morose monday is the time for the snubbed schools to air their gripes st louis post dispatch columnist bernie miklasz points out that schools in that middle tier of college hoops power rankings i e the mid majors didnt get much credit for their strong out of conference showing last fall "of the at large bids available sunday went to the power conferences " mr miklasz writes "it was a wonderful day for jay bilas dick vitale digger phelps billy packer and other basketball elitists who were angrily gnawing on their brackets last year when the committee dared to give some love to the mid majors " drexel is tops on most lists of the unfairly omitted philadelphia inquirer columnist bob ford was there when a would be festive gathering to watch the selection show turned funereal "when the last of the slots had been assigned the dragons got up slowly from their chairs and shuffled silently from the room a handful of boosters and athletic department personnel offered a smattering of applause as the team made its exit but the sound went hollowly off the walls and even the fire breathing creatures on the banners seemed momentarily extinguished " among the big conferences the best team left out was by consensus carls favorite syracuse new york post columnist mike vaccaro argues that the big east has hurt itself by growing too big there are now teams in the mega conference "syracuse is the shocking omission because syracuse represents the old school big east because the oranges coach jim boeheim has more institutional memory than anyone currently employed in the league " mr vaccaro writes syracuse at least got a no seed in that other tournament the nit composed of teams that didnt make the cut for the ncaa tourney big east rival uconn is done for the season missing a postseason tournament for the first time in two decades "the solace must come for jim calhoun in the prospects of next season " jeff jacobs writes in the hartford courant "the solace must come in the head coaches his hall of fame career has spawned for in the end the legacy will continue on in those men " four of these men in mr calhouns coaching tree earned tournament berths uconns omission was no injustice but the akron beacon journals terry pluto cant fathom how akron was left out of the nit likewise seattle post intelligencer columnist art thiel wonders how washington didnt make the cut " i am completely stunned said coach lorenzo romar a man not readily given to conveying surprise " mr thiel writes "having been around the college game long enough to have seen most things on the far end of the absurdity scale romar was speechless flabbergasted and appalled other than that he was ok " every single new jersey school was shut out of both tournament fields "but new jersey players as they always do dot the rosters of tournament teams from connecticut to new mexico from big programs like louisville to small ones such as niagara " steve politi laments in the newark star ledger mr politi constructs his all jersey college hoops dream team and wonders what it would take to get players of this caliber to stay in state now that the tournament has expanded to a field of with two teams this year florida a&amp m and niagara chosen to play against each other before the main event begins the philadelphia inquirers phil sheridan wonders why there cant be three more teams added to the mix to accommodate more of those who feel snubbed thats three teams not seven as an earlier version of mr sheridans column mistakenly said "the goal should be to give as many deserving teams as possible control of their own fate without diminishing the overall quality of the tournament " mr sheridan writes "the cleanest easiest fairest way to do that is to add three teams to the play in field " how did the sec get five teams into the tournament including arkansas which finished in the conferences puny west division birmingham news columnist kevin scarbinsky says it couldnt have hurt to have conference commissioner mike slive in the room of the selection committee "by rule slive had to leave the indianapolis hotel room where the selection committee convened every time an sec team was discussed " mr scarbinsky writes "but in this case out of sight is not out of mind the committee members spent most of their waking hours together wednesday through sunday they ate meals together they watched conference tournament games together they challenged each others assumptions and confirmed each others suspicions " taking measure of the teams who did make it in columnists focus on the red hot defending champs and the nations best player florida which rolled to the sec championship by a combined victory margin of points in three days appears to be back in national title form after a bewildering late season collapse yet those three losses in four games suggest the gators might be vulnerable to overestimating their abilities sam borden writes in the florida times union "the gators toughest foe along the way might be their own brains swiping a title from out of nowhere as they did last season often is easier than holding on to a trophy already in hand and floridas veteran roster already has shown that it isnt immune to getting in its own way " on the opposite side of the bracket looms the texas longhorns and freshman kevin durant the favorite for every major national player of the year award texas is just a seed texas a&amp m is a but the longhorns are dangerous of their nine losses seven came to fellow tournament teams and the other two to conference foes who qualified for the nit and five of the losses were by fewer than five points yesterdays big final loss to kansas qualified on both counts but there was a troubling sign yet again mr durant didnt get the ball as much as he should have "the inability to locate durant has been a regular complaint about the longhorns " kevin sherrington writes in the dallas morning news "he tends to float through stretches for reasons still unclear maybe its because rick barnes doesnt call his number enough maybe durants teammates would like to shoot too or maybe durant asked to do so much on defense because of the lack of any other significant presence inside needs a break now and again good news texas wont be playing three games in three days like it did last week when its bench totaled points " san antonio express news columnist buck harvey compares mr durant to former texas quarterback vince young who led the longhorns to a rose bowl victory last year with a remarkable individual performance "their edge is both rare and intimidating " mr harvey writes "other teams can scout durant but they wont know the full force until they play him thats why hes the hoop version of vince and durants line sunday looked like something straight from the rose bowl points rebounds of from the free throw line and six blocks " if texas can get through a bracket that includes north carolina and georgetown mr durant might face his presumed rival for no pick in this summers nba draft ohio state freshman greg oden mr oden makes his buckeyes winners of straight and the no ranked team in the country the favorite to meet florida in the title game sound familiar the first round matchup between oregon and miami of ohio pits perhaps the two luckiest teams in the tournament against each other the oregonians john canzano explains why found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj
