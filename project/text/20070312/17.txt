econoblog is democracy the best setting for strong economic growth online edition hoping to counterbalance the economic populism of venezuela president hugo chavez president bush is on a weeklong tour of latin america bearing a message of optimism about democracy trade and economic prosperity but what exactly do we know about the relationship between democracy and economic growth economies of less than democratic nations such as china have surged in recent years does a countrys brightening economic picture boost the chance democracy may eventually blossom or is it the other way around are democratic institutions a key component of long term economic growth and whats the role of education wsj com asked economists daron acemoglu of the massachusetts institute of technology and ed glaeser of harvard university to discuss the delicate relationship between economic growth and broader political freedoms what do you think share your comments on our discussion board ed glaeser writes rich countries are stable democracies poor countries tend to be political basket cases careening between brutal dictatorships and unstable semi republics the relationship between democracy and wealth might suggest democracy naturally leads to prosperity this view is comforting and also gives us another reason to enthusiastically try to export democracy globally while i yield to no one in my passion for liberty the view that democracy is a critical ingredient for economic growth is untenable there is no robust statistical relationship to back it up and robert barro actually found democracy reduces growth once he statistically controls for the rule of law it is however true that growth rates vary much more under dictatorships than under democracies anti development autocrats such as mobutu sese seko or kim jong il are about the worst thing for economic growth other than civil war but many of the best growth experiences have been in less than democratic regimes that invest in physical and human capital such as lee kwan yews singapore or post mao china some dictators are even better than democrats at restraining the growth killing practice of expropriating private wealth i think the relationship between democracy and wealth reflects the power of human capital education to make countries both rich and democratic if you put enough smart people together theyll figure out how to govern themselves and gravitate towards democracy daron acemoglu writes i agree with ed on many points in the postwar era its true that democracies havent grown faster than autocratic regimes plus there are clear examples of fast growth under dictatorships see south korea under gen park chung hee so why havent democracies been more successful i believe the answer lies in recognizing two things first there are different kinds of democracies and second its important to consider that economic growth and democracy have a very different relationship over the long term that is for periods as long as years than over the short or medium term many societies counted as "democratic" using standard measures are really "dysfunctional democracies" where traditional elites dominate politics through control of the party system political influence vote buying intimidation and even assassination colombia which has had regular democratic elections for the past years is a typical example in others democratic institutions survive but there is significant in fighting between ethnic groups religious groups or social classes the situation in iraq would be the most extreme but not a unique example finally many democracies suffer economically from populist and irresponsible macroeconomic policies which are often adopted after transitions from repressive dictatorships and during periods when politics are turbulent and conflicts over wealth distribution are strong on the second point its true that autocratic regimes can generate growth for certain periods of time by providing secure property rights and good business conditions to firms aligned with political powers but modern capitalist growth requires not only secure property rights but also creative destruction that is the entry of new firms with new ideas and technologies that replace the successful firms of the past creative destruction requires a level playing field which democracies are better at providing because they have more equal distributions of political power than autocracies or monarchies so if we look beyond the past years we see that it was the u s with its democratic institutions that created the environment for new businesses to enter flourish and spur the industrial growth of the th century there were many rich autocracies and repressive regimes in the th century including places like cuba haiti and jamaica but it was the u s that grew rapidly over the next two centuries while these autocratic regimes stagnated the relationship between human capital and democracy that ed raises is fascinating but i will return to that in a little in the context of the causes of democracy ed glaeser writes i strongly agree with the view that unfettered dictatorship doesnt guarantee long run stability but how much more stable is democracy america worked well the weimar republic didnt over the past years democracies have regularly fallen to military coups communist overthrow and aggressive elected executives like hitler who expanded the reach of their power to the point where democracy disappeared even relatively stable democracies like post war india have often failed to provide a safe environment for investment innovation and entrepreneurship since democracy is always vulnerable i think the key question is why it survived for centuries in some countries like the u s the united kingdom and the netherlands and died quickly in other places such as post colonial africa one answer is that human capital education is the bedrock for lasting democracy empirically initial education strongly predicts the survival of democracy education and the survival of democracy in our research we found of the democracies that ranked as "well educated" in stayed democracies for the next years by contrast of s "less well educated" became dictatorships within a decade the survival of democracy hinges upon capable people who have the incentives and ability to protect their rights against would be dictators education produces social capital that makes it possible for people to organize and makes them think that democracy is worth fighting to protect daron acemoglu writes ed argues that education is key to the democratic success im a big believer in the value of human capital better educated people are more productive better citizens but democracy is about collective choices in conflict ridden situations and education is not a panacea for solving these problems weimar germany is an interesting example in the interwar years germany was one of the most culturally advanced educated and sophisticated societies in the world was the education of the german people sufficient to prevent the nazi nightmare no looking at the data there is no strong evidence that either education or economic growth is a major factors in creating or strengthening democracy in fact countries that have grown fast over the past years or over the past havent shown in much greater tendency to become democratic consider the recent experience of russia and saudi arabia if suddenly the price of oil increases and they become much richer do we expect them to become more democratic the same applies to education countries that have boosted education levels havent been more likely to consolidate democracy or transition from autocracy to democracy after all former socialist republics had very high levels of education during the cold war but did not show a strong tendency to become democratic so what does strengthen democracy recent research by benjamin jones and benjamin olken finds that enlightened leadership matters but it only in autocracies in societies with strong institutions and established democracies leader quality seems to have little effect on economic performance this again makes me think that established democracies by introducing checks and balances create a good environment for collective decisions and resolution of conflicts this type of environment for collective decision making is the best guarantor of long run economic development ed glaeser writes the link between education and growth in democracy is pretty robust both because more educated democracies are more likely to stay democratic and because schooling strongly predicts which dictatorial regimes will transition into democracy consider the states of the former warsaw pact educated countries such as poland and the czech republic have become reasonably well functioning democracies less educated spots such as uzbekistan and borats homeland kazakhstan are far less democratic the education of russia lies somewhere in the middle and so does its level of democracy the link between education and democracy works through at least three important channels historically educated people have been a mainstay of political uprisings because of their interest in ideas and the ability to organize nowhere is this clearer than in the remarkable propensity of students to riot indeed some of the most important of revolutions from to the deposition of the shah had their roots in student led upheavals education is also associated with the crafting of complex constitutions which require education to write and education to use its no surprise that the american constitution was the product of extremely well educated men james madison learned the best ideas of the scottish enlightenment from his princeton mentor john witherspoon finally educated people have shown a remarkable ability to fight to protect democracy the english american and dutch democracies have regularly been defended by people steeped in legal and political learning daron is of course right to emphasize the failure of germanys educated to stop nazism i would respond by saying that first germany wasnt all that well educated in and second that while education predicts transitions to democracy it hardly guarantees them daron acemoglu writes yes more educated countries are more democratic richer more tolerant and more innovative no disagreement there but this does not mean that education is the key factor for democracy or for growth the disagreement is over whether societies that become more educated over time are also more likely to become democratic here there is no correlation between changes in education and changes in democracy ed also argues that "educated people have been a mainstay of political uprisings " i agree with this and i believe that the educated have an important role in defending democracy but they can also turn against democracy educated people have also been big supporters of anti democratic movements including the bolshevik revolution in russia and many revolutionary movements in latin america so if education is not a panacea for democracy and democracy is not a panacea for growth how do we make sense of the big questions of long run development why are democratic societies more educated and richer the right perspective on these questions is provided by thinking of distinct development paths that is clusters of political and economic institutions and economic activities prosperity and poverty are partly rooted in a societys history and development path in one type of development path democracy growth investment and human capital go hand in hand potentially reinforcing each other another path involves autocratic regimes repression low growth and low human capital if growth suddenly increases under such a repressive system or if a dictator suddenly starts a big education program this wont automatically lead to democracy societies that achieve sustained economic growth enforce property rights respect the rule of law and create a level playing field for new firms and for their population at large they develop institutions for collective decision making that prevent power from being usurped by strongmen or narrow cliques fortunately while history and historical development paths matter change is possible countries can reform their political and economic institutions and start investing in new businesses technology and human capital paving the way for sustainable economic growth under stable democratic regimes botswana and south korea for example have made this transition despite having started with very adverse conditions ed glaeser writes i have tried to articulate two views first democracy doesnt strongly predict economic growth second education is an important factor that supports democracy i want to turn now to the development policy implications of those views i like promoting education both because it leads to good political outcomes and because as daron writes there are so many other good by products associated with learning of course id rather that education to be more than dictatorial propaganda but even those russians educated under the old regime fought for democracy in i also like promoting democracy even if rule by the people doesnt lead automatically to economic growth there are plenty of other reasons to wish for everyone to get the chance to govern themselves the heart of economic policy advice is the desire to give people more choices and political liberty like wealth makes people "free to choose " however i do think that we need to have a little bit of realism about where democracy has a fighting chance to succeed the president has said that "it is the practice of democracy that makes a nation ready for democracy and every nation can start on this path " im not so sure there arent a lot of countries with the education level of afghanistan that have ever been stable democracies iraqs level of human capital gives it a better shot but the current difficulties were quite predictable we need to recognize that exporting democracy is extremely hard in low human capital countries and to make sensible judgments about how we can move freedom forward despite facing enormous difficulties daron acemoglu writes there is a lot ed and i agree on democracy doesnt strongly predict economic growth at least not in the short run education is wonderful for many reasons and democracy is not perfect as a political system but it is the best we have as winston churchill is supposed to have said democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others forms that have been tried from time to time there are indeed barriers to democracys ability to flourish in many societies and finally exporting democracy is probably neither easy nor always feasible and we should be careful in such attempts in fact we should be careful and very cautious in all kinds of social engineering dreams that we have however there are still some areas where there is healthy disagreement between us the main barrier to democracy is not low education but deep social and economic divides that create intense conflict democracy has failed in highly educated countries such as germany before world war ii or post war argentina it has also been extremely successful in very low education countries botswana provides a perfect example it is the most successful democracy and the fastest growing economy in sub saharan africa when the british granted independence to this colony in there were only botswanans who had graduated from university and from secondary school but botswana was fortunate to have avoided the most adverse effects of colonialism and thus did not suffer from deep social divides or distributional conflicts because the british essentially had no interest in the colony and left it alone botswana used the revenues from its diamonds both equitably and wisely botswanas democracy has not only endured and flourished but has not even been challenged by a coup or tarnished by major electoral fraud during the past years i would also like to emphasize and conclude with this point sustained economic growth requires secure property rights and a level playing field for generating new technologies and entry by new firms democracy is the best guarantor for such sustained economic growth economic growth generates various vested interests ranging from landed elites to businessmen in declining industries to privileged workers these vested interests will try to block the introduction of new technologies and stop the entry of new firms democracy is not perfect but with its more egalitarian distribution of political power it will have greater resistance against vested interests than autocracy what do you think share your comments on our discussion board write to matt phillips at matt phillips wsj com
