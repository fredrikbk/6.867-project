railroad crews unions fight work curbs washington the new democratic congress and the bush administration often at odds agree on this a year old law that governs train crews schedules is contributing to fatigue related accidents as freight transport surges and it needs an overhaul that has led to a strange bedfellows alliance between the often warring camps of railroad companies and labor unions after failing for years to agree on a unified position the two sides are now united in their opposition to any government involvement in the issue they are seeking to pre empt legislation that could curb the number of consecutive hours a train crew can work by stepping up efforts to reach their own solution that would balance the needs of the railroads which want flexibility with those of the workers who want to preserve their pay rep james oberstar a minnesota democrat who is the new chairman of the transportation and infrastructure committee is considering legislation that train crews work no more than hours at a stretch down from the current hours the national transportation safety board says the number of serious fatigue related accidents has remained steady in recent years even as the overall accident rate has fallen meanwhile the federal railroad administration which issues rules regulations and penalties on safety and security wants the authority to set rules for crew schedules it recently proposed legislation that would allow it to issue hours of service rules for railroads the house and senate have recently picked up the debate with legislation possible before year end unlike airline crews and commercial truck drivers rail crews working hours are set by statute not by a regulator under the current year old law rail crews are allowed to work as many as hours a month longer than pilots hours truck drivers hours or shipboard personnel a main reason for the discrepancy is that unlike with the other sectors congress must approve any changes to rail crew schedules making change more difficult the subject of protracted working hours long has been an issue for train crews the federal railroad administration recently reported that human error caused one out of every four accidents in the latest year for which data were available of those were attributable to fatigue the debate over train crew hours comes as rail companies have enjoyed increased business and profits in recent years thanks in part to a healthy economy but surging demand for rail transport has led to rising congestion on the rails and increased pressure on the companies to get cars loaded quickly and moving to their destinations big rail companies have sold off shorter lines to concentrate on more profitable long haul routes at the same time they have steadily reduced the size of their crews and lengthened working hours usually only two crew members are aboard trains that can haul more than tons and stretch more than a mile in length the engineer operates the train from the locomotive and the conductor is responsible for ensuring the trains cars are operating properly one of the worst fatigue related accidents occurred on june near san antonio when a union pacific freight train struck a burlington northern santa fe freight train sending plumes of poisonous chlorine gas into the air three people were killed by the gas and dozens more were injured the ntsb concluded that the union pacific crew had likely fallen asleep current rules which apply largely to all members of the train union including engineers and conductors generally require that crews may work as many as hours straight but then must have hours of rest time in practice though some crews end up getting much less rest because of loopholes and the murky definition of "rest " for example sometimes train crews shifts end before they reach home base so off duty workers are left to wait for hours on idled trains until replacement crews arrive and for transportation to lodging until the next assignment the hours spent waiting called limbo time sometimes counts as "rest " according to both the unions and the railroad companies interpretation of existing rules even though the crew isnt necessarily sleeping or resting some work schedules have resulted in a level of fatigue that was "equivalent to being awake hours following an eight hour sleep period the previous night " according to a december report on rail safety by the federal railroad administration "at this level train accidents consistent with fatigue such as failing to stop for red signals are more likely to occur " labor unions while acknowledging that fatigue is a safety issue arent pushing for a government mandated reduction in hours largely because it could hit members wallets train crews generally get paid by the hour or the mile or trip and average about &# annually in base pay with overtime and liberal interpretation of "rest time " some workers can earn as much as &# annually and in a few cases can pull in as much as &# said don hahs president of the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen a railway union mr hahs said that while some of his members support a cutback in hours others dont want to give up the extra pay "we do have brothers on our right and brothers on our left " edward wytkind president of the afl cios transportation trades department said his union is advocating changing some rules on hours of service but not explicitly calling for a reduction in the number of hours a crew can work
