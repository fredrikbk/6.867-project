her income in december ms hillery received notice that new century intended to foreclose on the property then earlier this month after a formal demand by the lawyer new century agreed to refund all its fees and cancel the loan once ms hillery gets refinancing elsewhere the lawyer alan ramos says the loan never should have been made "you have a loan application where the income section is blank " mr ramos says "how does it even get past the first person who looks at it " new century an year old company that billed itself as "a new shade of blue chip " has become a symbol of excess in lending to subprime borrowers people with weak credit records or high debt in relation to their income the company has imploded over the past few months as defaults surged and accounting misdeeds surfaced new centurys share price last week dropped to &# as some traders bet a bankruptcy court filing is near new centurys swift rise and fall illuminates how wall street investment banks such as morgan stanley and hedge funds awash in cash helped fuel a binge in subprime lending that prolonged the housing boom the lenders made themselves vulnerable by relying heavily on outside mortgage brokers and gunning for growth even as the boom faded the wall street banks supplied the money to keep them on a roll readily gobbling up loans and turning them into securities that global investors were avid to put into their portfolios with a work hard party hard culture new century took its employees on a boozy cruise to the bahamas and threw one bash in a train station in barcelona spain former employees say within a few years the company whose head offices are in a black glass tower in irvine calif became one of the nations top subprime lenders jostling with older rivals like hsbc holdings plc and countrywide financial corp last week new century announced that it had stopped making loans because too many creditors had cut off funding the company expects to report a loss for but cant yet quantify it it is facing a federal criminal investigation of its accounting and trading in its stock before a negative announcement in february a new century spokeswoman declined to comment on ms hillerys case or any other aspects of the companys business while companies like new century are free to lend through branch offices web sites or call centers their main way of reaching customers has been via independent mortgage brokerage firms generally tiny local outfits mortgage brokers find customers advise them on which types of loans are available and collect fees for handling the initial processing there are more than mortgage brokerage firms and they are involved in of all home loans up from a decade ago says tom lamalfa managing director of wholesale access a mortgage research firm in columbia md new century and its rivals competed fiercely for business from brokers who often favor lenders able to make loans quickly john waite a mortgage broker in appleton wis says he liked working with new century because it was "very easy " until recently he says new century rarely demanded reviews of the appraisals on which loans are based thanks to the brokers new century ramped up its business quickly without having to hire a lot of employees or find office space brokers "work out of homes and cars and little offices " mr lamalfa says and theyre often willing to go to customers homes in the evening or on the weekend but by outsourcing much of its direct contact with consumers new century and other lenders also lost some control over the screening of borrowers and the presenting of loan choices some lenders and industry consultants say subprime lenders dependence on brokers partly explains the industrywide surge in mortgage fraud in a typical fraud lenders are duped into making loans based on inflated home appraisals or income data some schemes involve organized rings that take the money and run without ever making a loan payment fraud appears to be one reason for a recent rash of defaults occurring within the first few months of subprime loans one hint that fraud might be a problem at new century came in the companys disclosure last week that in december borrowers failed to make even the first payment on of new centurys loans normally people who borrow in good faith manage to make at least the first few payments lenders loosened standards considerably in the first half of this decade home prices were climbing so fast that borrowers who couldnt keep up on payments could almost always sell their homes for a profit or refinance into a loan with easier terms that emboldened lenders to offer loans with little or no down payment sometimes they let borrowers skip burdensome paperwork such as digging out tax forms to prove how much money they made subprime lenders took cues from wall street investment banks and hedge funds were ravenous for the riskiest types of loans whose higher yields made them vital ingredients in investment

as other wall street banks said no morgan stanley declined to comment wall street firms such as morgan stanley and bear stearns also compete with subprime lenders by offering their own mortgage loans via brokers on an online forum for mortgage brokers last week christopher logan an account executive for morgan stanleys recently acquired saxon mortgage subprime lending arm said his company is still eager to lend as others bow out "with morgan stanley as our parent we have the stability &amp strength which is what it takes to survive in todays subprime " mr logan wrote the shakeout in the

when russian loan defaults caused investors to flee risky businesses and some subprime lenders went out of business u s bancorp of minneapolis helped out by acquiring &# million in new century preferred stock at the height of the housing boom in and new century executives grumbled that the stock market was undervaluing their company they and several other subprime lenders responded by turning their companies into reits hoping to attract investors interested in high dividends the move didnt have much of an effect as investors continued to worry that earnings and dividends in the mortgage industry couldnt be sustained at boom levels the reit structure also made it harder for new century to put aside earnings for a rainy day despite disappointment over the share price former new century employees say the company was a fun and rewarding place to work one former executive says the company made a priority of promoting from within a former secretary to mr cole took charge of investor relations partying and heavy drinking were common on company outings former employees say david pace a former new century account executive who dealt with loans in southeast michigan says the

company were clouding in november the center for financial research and analysis an accounting research firm in rockville md flagged concerns about new centurys third quarter earnings release cfra analyst zach gast noted that the company for the first time had lumped together two categories of reserves one for losses on defaulted loans and a second for losses on real estate that had been acquired through foreclosure combining those two categories allowed the company to show a small increase in reserves from a quarter earlier he wrote but that masked a decline of in the reserve for losses on soured loans to &# million he calculated mr gast found it curious that new century was lowering reserves at a time when defaults on subprime loans generally were surging had new century maintained reserves at levels comparable with the second quarter he estimated earnings per share would have been at least lower than the &# reported at an investor conference on nov new centurys co founder and chief executive mr morrice said that despite the subprime areas problems new century was "well positioned to compete and continue to profitably grow market share " patti dodge an executive
