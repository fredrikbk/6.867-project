bridging the gap between here and there executives walk a tightrope in foreign companies to serve distant bosses local interests when ray oconnor was hired as marketing director for the u s unit of japans topcon corp in his friends predicted disaster japanese companies were notoriously slow to trust local managers and reluctant to adopt their ideas topcon a maker of surveying and medical equipment affiliated with japans toshiba corp was so traditional that u s workers warned mr oconnor not to go home without saying goodnight to the boss fourteen years later mr oconnor is still at topcon he now runs topcons biggest u s unit which accounts for roughly one quarter of topcons global revenue and half of its profit last year topcon put him in charge of much of its european and australian businesses as well the secret to his success perseverance and working with the home culture mr oconnor wooed managers and engineers in japan he spent nine months re engineering an acquisition after his japanese boss initially balked he didnt lobby for promotions working for two years under a manager sent from tokyo then another six years as co president of the u s business before getting the full title "it was a step by step process " says the year old mr oconnor "some people dont have the patience for that " mr oconnors story shows how local managers for foreign companies often must adapt to succeed they need to win the trust of distant bosses who may be out of touch with local markets and they must strike a balance between effective local leadership and sensitivity to corporate custom that can be especially challenging for companies based in countries such as japan or south korea with strong unspoken business traditions says bruce mckern a professor in international business at stanford graduate school of business "if the local manager isnt connected to the network of the company it can be crippling " says mr mckern consider howard stringer the american welsh sony corp executive won points with his japanese bosses while running operations in the u s with deference for tokyo customs and an easy going attitude on pay and promotions when he took over the ceo job in he moved carefully in japan waiting until late last year to gently reshuffle top management mr mckern says local managers in foreign multinationals can help close the gap between themselves and headquarters by learning the language of the home country or spending time there any overseas experience can help managers understand how to navigate different cultures he says mr oconnor an irish civil engineer joined topcon after nine years at a u s maker of laser guidance tools used on construction sites at the time topcons u s operation merely sold products made in tokyo and all of topcons overseas units were run by japanese but the company wanted to expand its optical surveying tools into lasers and construction and hired mr oconnor to help mr oconnor quickly realized that hed need support from japanese managers and shuttled back and forth almost every month to pitch his ideas and explain the american market he wooed product developers in tokyo letting them take credit for tweaks hed suggested he earned points early on when he refused to criticize japanese engineers who couldnt make a prototype laser work for an important u s trade show "i was really moved by that " says satoshi "steve" hirano the manager in charge of the laser now a deputy division chief "i went back to japan and told everyone that ray could be trusted " mr oconnors tactics paid off in mr hirano and another manager norio uchida backed mr oconnors plan to buy a california company that made software to automate control of construction equipment and invest heavily in developing new products yukinari "bob" iguchi the japanese executive running topcons u s operations was skeptical topcon had never done an acquisition that wasnt proposed by headquarters and its engineers knew little about software mr iguchi balked and mr oconnor spent months convincing him to put the deal back together when it was done mr uchida was assigned to run the acquired company mr iguchi says japanese corporate custom didnt permit him to put a newcomer like mr oconnor in charge of a unit mr oconnor says he was happy to work under mr uchida and was more concerned about getting the new business started the new company lost money for four straight years messrs hirano and uchida defended the business in tokyo mr uchida says he was comforted because mr oconnor always made his sales targets and didnt complain about pay or push for a promotion even when mr hirano was later sent from tokyo to run the u s company as co president the unit began making money in in messrs hirano and uchida backed mr oconnor in another bid a big risky investment in a company that used satellites to determine an objects position mr oconnor wanted to use the technology to guide topcons surveying equipment as well as construction machinery like bulldozers but the &# million price tag was more than topcon had ever spent on an acquisition and topcon itself was losing money again mr iguchi got cold feet calling mr oconnor to postpone negotiations the night before mr oconnor was to leave for tokyo mr iguchi says he wanted more time to convince other board members to support the deal mr oconnor persuaded mr iguchi to move ahead then the deal was nearly derailed by a breach of japanese etiquette mr oconnor had given the ceo of the company topcon was acquiring a &# box of cigars mr iguchi says he had intended to present the cigars himself but that the incident "wasnt so serious " in the end the investment deal remained so controversial internally that topcons then ceo refused to sign the papers even when it went through these days topcons japanese executives are themselves adapting as mr oconnors unit and overseas markets grow in importance in the fiscal year ended mar of topcons roughly &# million in revenue came from outside of japan up from five years earlier topcon positioning systems the u s unit that mr oconnor was named to run in accounted for about half of topcons roughly &# million in annual net income last year mr oconnor was put in charge of world wide sales and marketing for the positioning division topcon ceo takashi yokokura says that topcons medical equipment division is considering copying the positioning units techniques such as a more aggressive acquisition strategy and global technology and marketing meetings managers in the medical division are saying "we want ray oconnor " mr yokokura says mr uchida now a topcon director says that topcon positioning systems latest acquisition in september of an australian maker of equipment control software was approved by topcons board in record time one hour
