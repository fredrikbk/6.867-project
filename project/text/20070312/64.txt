politics &amp economics u s raid in iraq may have hit wrong town disappointing search for insurgents illustrates pitfalls of relying on local informants al salaam iraq it was just after a m and the american military interrogators had to make a decision about the blindfolded iraqi man shivering against the wall the soldiers from the nd airborne division had swept into this tiny village by helicopter to search for islamic militants the paratroopers blindfolded and handcuffed all the men they found but after questioning each of them individually the soldiers were left with just one potential insurgent a middle aged man named tariq sgt joshua cullen carrozza who had been interrogating tariq for nearly an hour told a small group of other soldiers about what he had found tariq didnt possess any weapons and the iraqis story that he was a livestock merchant from fallujah visiting relatives in the area had remained consistent sgt cullen carrozza said on the other hand sgt cullen carrozza noted that certain aspects of the iraqis account raised questions if tariq had made the trip to al salaam to purchase animals why had he come by taxi rather than driving his car why did he seem so uncertain of the exact date he had arrived in the village and what were soldiers to make of the fact that tariq was from fallujah a well known insurgent stronghold "we dont have anything on him and my vote would be to let him go " sgt cullen carrozza said to the soldiers huddled around him "but thats a call for the higher ups " a few minutes later senior officers relayed their decision over the soldiers radios tariq was to be detained and brought to a nearby american military base for further questioning many of the soldiers said it was an unsatisfying end to a mission that had begun with great promise two weeks earlier when an iraqi informant said four senior al qaeda militants were using al salaam as a base after nearly nine hours in al salaam tariq was the closest thing to a militant that they had found the story of what went wrong on the raid highlights one of the biggest challenges facing the american forces hunting sunni and shiite insurgents across iraq the difficulty of working with iraqi informants even with some of the most advanced electronic surveillance and eavesdropping systems in the world u s commanders depend heavily on tips from the iraqis who call u s run hotlines or approach american patrols with information about possible insurgent activity in their areas most iraqi informants speak little to no english however and critical details often are lost in the interpretation from the informants native arabic many informants have a hard time providing exact directions to where they believe the insurgents are hiding especially in rural areas that lack discernible landmarks or street names in the case of al salaam u s commanders concluded the informant had meant to direct them toward a different village less than a mile from the site of the raid by the time u s forces made their way to the new location any militants who might have been hiding there were long gone planning for the raid began late last month shortly after the informant contacted u s forces with word that al qaeda militants were hiding in walled compounds in the windswept village the military began to amass satellite imagery and high definition aerial photographs of the site and organized a strike force of three helicopters and more than a dozen armored humvees late tuesday night lt col barry di ruzza the soft spoken officer who led the raid summoned his senior officers to a small wooden trailer at contingency operating base speicher a sprawling american military base on the outskirts of tikrit for a final briefing on the raid he told them that the strike codenamed operation phoenix was meant to capture or kill four midlevel al qaeda militants suspected of using kidnappings and black market oil sales to finance a wave of assassinations and roadside bombings "we got some good human intelligence and were going to try and exploit it to keep the element of surprise " he told the officers "were going after one of their safe havens " at about a m blackhawk helicopters carrying some two dozen heavily armed soldiers took off for al salaam humvees raced into the village as soon as they got word that the airborne troops had broken into the houses and subdued the men they found inside in the targeted houses the iraqis had been separated by age and gender the women and children were moved into a room where they huddled together in silence the men had been forced down onto their knees wherever they were apprehended their hands secured behind their backs with plastic handcuffs and their eyes covered by makeshift blindfolds apart from a single ak rifle which is legal for civilians to possess in iraq no weapons were found in any of the houses sgt cullen carrozza made his way to each of the iraqi men trailed by his translator zee a female contractor with a strong british accent and the informant himself who was wearing u s army fatigues a black ski mask and black goggles zee lifted the blindfolds so the informant could see the face of each detainee and then questioned them in arabic about their names families and jobs after seeing each man the informant slowly shook his head the soldiers took photographs of each man and placed the detainees personal effects in a plastic bag attached to a cord around his neck lt daniel blankenhorn took a black marker and wrote a number in small digits on the foreheads of the men to make it easier for the military to process them by a m sgt cullen carrozza had concluded that five of the six men had no connection to the islamic militants the only one he wasnt sure about was tariq zee his translator was more unequivocal "theres nothing on him and hes going to be taken all the way to the base and left to walk home alone " she said "its just pointless totally pointless " u s commanders said they were troubled by apparent flaws in tariqs account with insurgents active in the area they said that there were too many discrepancies to simply let him go "to me his story doesnt make sense it doesnt jive " lt col di ruzza said "so we want to thoroughly interrogate him if hes innocent hell be let go "the sun was up when tariq was lifted to his feet by two american soldiers and led to a u s military vehicle along the way he stopped to ask for a cigarette american officers say he will be held at contingency operating base speicher for about two weeks while they decide what to do with him they are continuing to work with the informant though they are looking for better ways of getting accurate information from him next time lt col di ruzza says they will give the informant a hand held gps device
