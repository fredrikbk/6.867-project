protectionists never learn im thinking of a country americas trade deficit with this country just reached an all time high this country holds more u s treasuries than any other foreign country its one of the worlds largest economies and the name of that country is japan japan yes remember when japan was a big threat to the american economy you have to go back to the late s back then every politician in the mood for pandering to economic ignorance could scare a bunch of folks with worries about how the japanese were stealing our jobs how our trade deficit with japan was going to destroy the american economy how the japanese economy was soon going to pass americas how the japanese auto industry was part of a sinister strategy to destroy our core competencies youd think japan would still make good political fodder the story of the baseball off season is the red sox spending &# million to bring daisuke matsuzaka from japan to the united states dice k as hes known is the ultimate import he takes away a job from an american pitcher and the japanese baseball teams discriminate against american players with strict quotas but even though americas trade deficit with japan just hit that all time high no one uses dice k as a symbol of unfair japanese trade policy why not instead its china all the time were told that china cheats on its currency stealing americas manufacturing capacity and destroying american jobs chinas holdings of u s treasuries threaten our sovereignty according to hillary clinton even though japanese holdings are almost twice as big why isnt japan just as scary as china one answer is that matsuzaka smiles too much hes only scary if youre feet inches away from him trying to hit his famous gyroball with a wooden stick in your hand and unlike other imports its easy to see how he doesnt just help his relatives in japan with all that money hes getting from the red sox he helps the red sox trade makes both parties to the trade better off but still why isnt japan scary one answer is that the doom and gloomers already tried but nothing happened they told us that japan was going to destroy our economy they told us we needed a plan to cope with brilliant japanese economic strategies but then the japanese economy hiccupped and played rip van winkle for a decade while america kept growing the real reason japan isnt scary is because it wasnt and isnt a threat to our standard of living trade makes both parties better off remember but when japan slumps and the u s surges its too hard to fool people with bad economics so when the sky didnt fall a new candidate had to be found mexico and nafta fit the bill not canada even though canada was part of nafta evidently politicians and some voters find mexicans more scary than canadians so it was mexico when that great "sucking sound" was never heard a new sinister foreign nation had to be found and so its the turn of the chinese yes china holds a lot of our bonds but japan holds more yes we run a big trade deficit with china but that lets us buy lots of inexpensive stuff instead of having to make it for ourselves yes there are more than a billion chinese i guess that means they can take all of our jobs four times but our economy keeps growing we have more jobs than ever before and contrary to popular belief the american standard of living and the american middle class are thriving we were told that at a minimum china and india with its own billion strong population would take all our high tech jobs but the high tech sector bounced back from its downturn a downturn that had nothing to do with outsourcing and is growing again partly because we can get some of the simplest database and programming tasks done so cheaply by indians and chinese so why can politicians still make china scary why didnt americans learn from the previous sky is falling episodes the simple answer is that if you dont understand economics you might be convinced by a politician who says that trade with china is bad for america the next time you find yourself losing sleep over china remember that you were worried about japan and mexico and everything turned out ok then ask yourself if america would be a richer country if china cut itself off from the rest of the world mr roberts is professor of economics at george mason university and a research fellow at stanfords hoover institution see related letters "letters to the editor you say middle class is thriving but we dont see it" wsj march
