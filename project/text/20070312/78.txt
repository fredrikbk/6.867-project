subprime fallout may not infect broader market new york as more financially stretched homeowners renege on their debts and mortgage lenders go under by the dozen economists are surprisingly sanguine about the broader economys ability to weather the storm but they add a big caveat much depends on how investors react to an increasing wave of worrying news and how much some homeowners difficulties aggravate the nations deep housing slump by all accounts the market for "subprime" mortgages home loans made to people with poor or sketchy credit histories has unraveled with impressive speed and intensity in some parts of california the proportion of seriously delinquent subprime loans has quadrupled in the past year to about one in eight according to data provider first american loanperformance in the past month subprime lenders have run into serious trouble or shut their doors at a rate of about two a week the stock prices of wall street investment banks have gyrated amid concerns some big financial firms could find themselves exposed fallout that could further spook investors and trigger a new bout of selling in stock and bond markets so far though many economists including federal reserve chairman ben bernanke havent changed their forecasts as a result of the subprime troubles some see the sharp rise in defaults among riskier borrowers as a natural albeit acute symptom of the housing slump that began in late rather than a separate ailment in itself with house prices falling consumers who got no money down mortgages with the help of loose lending standards have little to lose by walking away from their homes and debts "no doubt some of the worst practices of the housing boom are going to yield some payback " says steve wieting senior u s economist at citigroup in new york "but its not large enough to derail an otherwise healthy economy " he expects inflation adjusted gross domestic product a broad measure of the nations economic activity to expand this year slower than normal but well short of a recession the main reason for economists equanimity those who took out subprime loans tend to be less affluent consumers who make up a relatively small share of consumer spending the most important driver of the u s economy labor department data show that the fifth of u s households with the lowest incomes account for about of all consumer outlays while the most affluent fifth accounts for nearly of spending meanwhile the unemployment rate remains relatively low and incomes have been rising suggesting poorer people have some resources to spend even if they cant afford their homes and cant borrow money that said the subprime mess has added some risks the possibility economists fret about most is that investors and lenders will react to rising defaults by pulling back from all kinds of borrowers good and bad the sort of "credit crunch" that has triggered recessions in the past "one of the things to worry about is how much markets are worrying " says andrew tilton senior u s economist at goldman sachs in new york "a contagion in the credit markets based on fear is a possibility though we dont think thats the most likely scenario " in the past few weeks investors have become more wary of lending to risky borrowers the annual cost of default insurance on &# million in riskier bonds backed by commercial real estate loans stands at about &# up from less than &# before the stock market plunge of feb bonds issued by companies with shakier finances known as "junk" bonds yield nearly percentage points more than comparable treasury bonds that gap stood at percentage points feb most consumers and businesses though still have access to money u s companies have issued billions of dollars in junk bonds in the past few weeks despite higher borrowing rates the subprime problems havent had a major effect on auto lenders "its hard to make the argument that weakness in the subprime mortgage market will have an effect on auto subprime loans " says hylton heard director of asset backed securities for autos at fitch ratings a credit rating firm "theyre two different assets " for one thing it is quicker and easier to repossess a car than to foreclose a mortgage that suggests people would be more likely to keep up their car payments so they can get to jobs that help them pay their other bills still the pullback in credit for subprime mortgage borrowers could have a meaningful effect on its own as some potential home buyers find it harder to get money and more bad loans beget more foreclosures the decreased demand and increased supply of homes could depress prices deepening the housing slump ethan harris chief u s economist at lehman brothersin new york estimates foreclosures in the subprime market could bring an additional to homes on to the u s market every month starting next year the pain could be particularly acute in frothy markets such as california and florida and in depressed places such as parts of ohio and the auto producing areas of michigan in some areas in and around detroit cleveland and atlanta subprime loans make up more than half of all mortgage loans outstanding according to first american loanperformance "in some of these regions you could have a pretty tough environment in which a bad local economy tightening credit and weakening home prices all kind of reinforce each other " says mr harris
