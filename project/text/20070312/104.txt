your money matters a special report unhealthy strategy health savings accounts are increasingly being used to stash retirement money that may not be the smartest approach for some people health savings accounts are becoming less about paying for health care now and more about saving for expenses in retirement hsas created by the federal government in chiefly as a way for employers to save on rising health care costs put the onus on individuals to pay for medical expenses and negotiate the best prices for procedures the accounts allow individuals with high deductible health insurance plans to use pretax money to cover their medical costs they can invest the money tax free until they need it and pay no taxes on the investment growth and withdrawals as long as the money is used for qualified medical expenses hsas also come with a perk thats fast becoming their most enticing feature the ability to roll over unused money year to year allowing people to potentially build up savings that they can use to pay for medical costs in retirement the nonprofit employee benefit research institute estimates that medical expenses could reach as much as &# for todays year old retiree who lives another years in fact many individuals who open an hsa seem to value it more it as a retirement savings vehicle than as a health care plan says joann laing mills author of the consumer guide to hsas and president of information strategies inc in fort lee n j a research firm that tracks hsas "this is a trend that were seeing " she says "people are putting in as much as possible and not touching it they are not paying current medical bills with it theyre maximizing the contributions because of retirement " but individuals should consider their overall physical and financial health before deciding to hoard away money in their hsas as a savings vehicle hsas really only work best for people who can afford to pay current medical costs with other money so that the hsa money can accumulate and financial experts stress that since theres no guarantee that individuals wont need to tap the money sooner rather than later to pay for unforeseen medical costs hsas should be used in tandem with k s iras and other forms of saving not replace them currently an individual can contribute up to &# a year to an hsa and families &# those who are and older can contribute an additional &# each year the amounts are adjusted annually chris bateson opened a family hsa to cover himself his wife and young child when his employer switched to hsas in from a traditional blue cross plan mr bateson a finance director at printingforless com in livingston mont says he will use pretax dollars from the hsa to help pay for medical costs if he and his wife have a second child but other than that he says hell pay most incidental medical expenses such as routine doctors visits or prescription drugs out of pocket "i really do intend to preserve this for later in order to protect my retirement funds " he says of the hsa "i learned a long time ago if given the choice between spending money now and putting it away for retirement im the type to put it away " mr bateson who has maximized his yearly contributions to his k believes the hsa is a better retirement savings vehicle at retirement money that comes out of his k will be taxed while money that comes out of his hsa for medical expenses wont be "there arent many ways to permanently protect your income from taxes and this is a big one " he says using an hsa as a retirement savings vehicle is not for everyone however critics say the accounts only provide a retirement benefit to those who are young healthy and financially secure enough to pay for medical expenses on their own keep in mind an individual who opens an hsa must use its high deductible plan as his or her principal health insurance typically those plans only cover catastrophic events such as hospital stays and surgery "i wouldnt recommend that someone who has diabetes jump into hsas" both from a health and retirement standpoint unless you have plenty of discretionary income says tom schneider an independent financial adviser in farmington conn frequent doctor visits and health care expenses could easily eat up the money in the account leaving little if anything to roll over from year to year "you really should be healthy to take advantage of it " he says even healthy people who are thinking about switching to an hsa should tally expected medical costs and then see how much of that can be covered with discretionary income says jerry ripperger director of consumer health for principal financial group an hsa provider in des moines iowa "math matters at the end of the day " he says and you never know when you might need the money as serious and costly health problems can arise unexpectedly so advisers say hsas should be viewed as investments that can be easily liquidated mr ripperger recommends that people investing hsa money keep a portion of the balance that equals the deductible amount in a conservative money market account which is easy to access under the law the deductible must be at least &# for an individual or &# for families often people opt for an even higher deductible as much as &# for an individual and &# for a family to save on premiums he says he says the balance can be invested in more aggressive stock funds and for individuals who can easily cover deductibles or other medical expenses with out of pocket money "it may be a totally appropriate strategy for them" to place all hsa contributions in mutual funds he says but some people looking to maximize their potential investment growth for retirement are putting money into less liquid and riskier places hugh bromma chief executive of entrust group a retirement plan administrator in reno nev says a handful of clients are choosing investments that combine money from their hsa ira and k to buy real estate some are even looking to alternative investments like funding the projects of oil drilling companies its a gamble for higher returns he says and "its not for the unwary or the people who are risk averse " most advisers recommend investing hsas much like a k or an ira typically in mutual funds and dont get too caught up in the notion of using an hsa to build a big nest egg a common sales pitch by hsa providers the government and employers who switch to them "the biggest selling point is for the employer to lower their medical costs and then for the employee to control how you spend your medical" expenses says david schwartz president of first capital equities a wealth management firm in great neck n y "i think they were really designed to do that not add extra money to your retirement " don rotanz a self employed real estate investor in chalfont pa is trying to strike a balance mr rotanz who opened an hsa to cover his familys medical expenses when he left his corporate job two years ago says he uses his pretax contributions to simultaneously pay for his childrens braces and build an extra nest egg for retirement but he views the account as his health plan first and part of his overall retirement strategy second he also has a roth ira a k from his previous employer and investments in several rental properties all of which will provide a stream of income in retirement "so this is just one more thing " he says "its a piece but its a small piece " ms debaise is an associate editor at smartmoney com in new york she can be reached at cdebaise smartmoney com
