your money matters a special report kids &amp money is your school up to speed how do you know if your public school is any good the chemistry lab seems up to date and the teachers seem sharp but how do you know that the students are learning or that a school on the other side of town isnt doing a better job thanks to the no child left behind law states now assemble and report a huge amount of data about their schools and that information is now making its way to the internet not all of it is up to date or easy to find the amount of data varies by state and its not yet possible to compare schools across state lines still one of the goals of no child left behind was to enable parents to become better consumers of education and in that respect the law is a success in an hour on the internet you can learn your schools state test scores and how they stack up against other schools in your state you can plow through school finances compare household incomes and education levels and come face to face with some glaring inequalities its not a full picture but its a good start the first place to look is schoolmatters com which is run by standard &amp poors a unit of mcgraw hill cos and funded by the gates and broad foundations no child left behind requires states to test their youngsters in third fifth and eighth grades in reading and math and to report those scores separately by the childrens grade gender race or ethnicity and whether theyre poor or are learning english to make sense of the data take a look at the trend line of those scores are they going up or down compare math and reading scores if one is significantly higher than the other ask the school why compare the scores of white and minority students and of boys and girls if theres a gap between the two is it closing or does the school seem to be putting all its resources into its easiest to teach children whose scores are rising the site supplements those state provided test results with scores from federal education department tests college entrance exam scores and scores on the psat which is taken by th and th graders u s census bureau data add information on household income and education unemployment the size and average age of the community and the percentage of single parent households all predictors of a communitys support for its schools and their success the site reports for example that in montgomery county md of families earn &# or more the district spends &# a year per student and of them are proficient readers in neighboring baltimore city where of households are headed by a single parent and school spending is &# per student just half pass their reading tests the site also allows users to compare school districts within a state on measures as arcane as return on spending which calculates how many points the district scores in reading and math for every &# per student it spends on instruction by that measure frederick county gets more bang for its buck than nearby kent county states also maintain sites that are worth checking out go to the web site of your states board or department of education and look for a link that says "report card" or something similar the amount of data varies widely from state to state for instance utahs web site has a bare minimum pages on indian hills school in salt lake city maryland offers a small directory in six languages on each of its schools illinois reports that third graders at park view elementary school in morton grove spend minutes a day on math and social studies on science and on language arts maryland reports mobility rates the percentage of kids who enroll in and leave a school during the year a measure of how stable a school is if you toggle among marylands report cards you also find this glaring admission no classes at predominantly white bethesda elementary near washington are taught by teachers that the state considers "not highly qualified " while of classes at predominantly black langston hughes elementary in baltimore have "not highly qualified" teachers a federal education department site http nces ed gov nationsreportcard also is worth a look although information here is on states not schools or districts the weakness of all the sites is that they depend on the states for much of their data but the states are slow to produce it and to standardize only five state reports on the schoolmatters site have school year data the rest are based on two year old information each state also writes its own tests and sets it own passing grades under no child left behind that means theres no way to compare say the results at a new york high school with those at a school in new jersey although the data say a lot about a school they arent the full picture they dont say anything about extracurricular activities the engineering team or marching band that may excite a career interest in your child they dont tell you whether kids learn science from a book or in a lab they dont tell you if the library has new books the halls are clean the principal is inspiring to learn that about your school you still need to visit ms kronholz is a staff reporter in the wall
