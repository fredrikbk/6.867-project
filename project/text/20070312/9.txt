breezy talk the texas wind powers a big energy gamble shell others pile in despite regulatory risk poke arnolds rib eye silverton texas deep in the heart of texas multinational giants are gambling on a new supply of energy the prize isnt oil its wind in this pancake flat country where the wind blows so relentlessly that the sagebrush and mesquite are permanently bent royal dutch shell group bp plc and a wind development company owned by goldman sachs group inc are racing to lease vast expanses of ranchland in a bet on wind powers long term viability theyre planning to erect what would be some of the biggest wind farms in the world with thousands of wind turbines costing some &# million apiece but generating power from wind isnt profitable without government tax breaks which in the past have been offered and taken away the big proposed projects in texas like those elsewhere in the country are dependent on regulators approving transmission lines to connect remote and windy regions to major power markets if the new lines arent built the projects are doomed such uncertainty has dashed hopes for fossil fuel alternatives before creating a boom and bust cycle not unlike the one that typifies the oil industry itself energy companies investing in wind power are expecting governments to toughen rules relating to traditional energy sources part of long term efforts to reduce global warming emissions and reliance on middle east oil as a result theyre hoping renewable energy will become a profitable niche not merely one that allows them to burnish their green credentials few places exemplify the gamble as vividly as briscoe county a square mile patch of ranchland in the texas panhandle with more cows than people its one of the windiest spots in texas which already cranks out more wind power than any other state texas regulators wont decide for months whether to authorize a new line to connect this isolated county to texass network of high voltage power lines but in austin the state capital energy companies are lobbying hard and on the ground theyre scrambling to lock up acreage what happens here is being watched closely in other states trying to promote wind development such as california colorado kansas and new mexico its "a land rush " says mark wilby a petroleum engineer who once developed natural gas power plants for enron corp and now develops wind projects for shell in shells storefront office in the largely abandoned courthouse square of silverton the county seat mr wilby pulls out a color map showing how the texas wind blows the windiest areas are in red and briscoe county is bloody shell hopes to build an approximately square mile wind farm here which would be several times larger than any in the world today local landowners who grew up cursing the wind cant believe their new luck the countys windiest stretch is a curving ridgeline where the flat terrain of the texas high plains ends and suddenly drops as much as feet into the rocky rugged tule canyon and onto the lower plains the topography causes the wind to accelerate as it approaches the edge the land at that edge was once good only for grazing cows but now residents liken the ridgeline to a good steak calling it "the rib eye " poke arnolds land includes a piece of it and the rancher has hired a lawyer to negotiate with energy companies "they started getting in a dog fight " he says "and the leases started going up tremendously " wind power accounted for of global electricity production in the most recent data available according to the international energy agency although that contribution is expected to grow fast in coming years by wind is projected to account for only of the total if governments adopted more aggressive policies to promote renewable energy the iea predicts winds share of total energy in could rise to the wind doesnt always blow and when it does the amount of land required to catch meaningful amounts of it is vast shells planned wind farm here would cover an area about five times the size of manhattan yet it would crank out on average only about as much electricity as a single coal fired power plant even with subsidies the return from wind projects tends to be lower than that from oil and gas but the risks are lower too putting up antennae to measure wind speed is vastly cheaper than drilling a well to look for oil turbine manufacturers often will essentially guarantee that their machines will produce a certain amount of power moreover unlike most other green energy options wind power doesnt require any technological breakthroughs the soaring pinwheel turbines that turn wind into electricity are manufactured by a growing cadre of mainstream companies including general electric co and mitsubishi heavy industries ltd and are getting more reliable and efficient so far wind power has taken off in states with favorable regulatory environments in particular those with rules requiring utilities to generate a certain percentage of their electricity from renewable sources capital spending on new wind projects in the u s rose to &# billion last year up from &# billion in and just &# million in according to a study being prepared for the department of energy by its lawrence berkeley national laboratory steve westwell head of the alternative energy unit at bp expects governments to toughen rules governing energy production especially those relating to emissions of carbon dioxide a gas linked to global warming that will boost viability of alternative sources such as wind "in the future there will probably be a very different discussion of the economics of these technologies " he says bp has announced plans to start building five wind farms in the u s this year exxon mobil corp the biggest publicly traded oil company in the world remains unconvinced exxon is bankrolling research on clean energy technologies but says renewable energy isnt yet viable on a large enough scale in addition the company says it doesnt want to get into a business that depends on subsidies "people are still going to need a hell of a lot of oil and gas" in the future "and thats what were good at " says rex tillerson exxons chairman and chief executive "i prefer to stay with what we know " texas the heart of the oil patch shows how far wind energy has come and how far it has to go one of the states first big wind energy projects began producing electricity in three years after a federal tax break came into effect under that provision the company that owns a wind project can reduce its tax bill by cents for every kilowatt hour of electricity that the project produces during its first years of operation thats often the bump that makes a project viable congress has authorized the credit only for short bursts wind development tends to screech to a halt when the credit is about to expire and ramp up when its renewed the early texas wind project has a generating capacity of megawatts a tiny fraction of a coal fired power plant because of the winds unpredictability the texas project produces on average only about one third of its capacity a typical rate it produces enough power for about households even with the federal tax credit wind development didnt really pick up until after when texas passed a requirement that utilities buy a certain amount of renewable power and even then it took off only in a part of the state served by a grid fueled mostly with natural gas where power prices are relatively high surrounding the tiny town of fluvanna on the western edge of the grid is the brazos wind project which sprawls across square miles brazos is the second biggest working wind farm in shells portfolio it sells its power to txu corp the dallas based utility thats under pressure to curb emissions from coal plants last month a private equity group agreed to buy txu for &# billion and promised to more than double the utilitys wind investments to get environmentalists backing for the buyout on a recent afternoon a computer in brazoss office showed that the projects towering white turbines were generating just megawatts a fraction of their megawatt capacity tom schroeder the sites supervisor said a weather front was approaching calming the air the wind had been "screaming" that morning " said mr schroeder whose last job was on an oil rig off nigeria and "its going to be probably screaming tonight " in texas some of the strongest wind is in the panhandle which lies to the north of brazos but the panhandle has few high voltage lines and it sits in a multistate power grid that commands relatively low power prices because it gets much of its power from coal a cheap fuel state officials are talking seriously about building new power lines to expand wind production if one were built to briscoe county this massive wind resource would be unlocked eddie rhoderick a rancher and farmer in briscoe county used to hate the wind when it whips in after a heavy rain it "sandblasts the cotton plants " he says but a few months ago he leased acres to shell he wont divulge the terms of the deal "shell bought me a root canal " he said one recent morning as he headed to the dentist shell rolled into briscoe last summer as the talk of new transmission lines heated up in austin so did horizon wind energy a houston company that goldman sachs bought in and has now put up for sale wind developers in the u s have typically offered landowners one time signing payments of about &# an acre and annual royalties totaling of revenue within months in briscoe energy companies were offering signing payments of between &# and &# an acre and royalty payments of about annually according to mr arnold and several other local landowners if the briscoe project is built a local rancher could expect to collect some &# a year for each "section" of land a parcel equal to acres laquetta schott the local manager of a title company has leased about acres to shell though ms schott wont discuss the terms of her contract she says wind deals are offering signing bonuses that "could be more profitable than oil and gas " in december bp bought a wind development company that had been scouting in briscoe but skyrocketing prices persuaded bp to retreat to a county farther south "with shell and horizon bidding up the properties to what we think may be unsustainable levels we have stepped away " says robert lukefahr head of bps north american alternative energy business horizon hopes to build a wind project in briscoe county with a capacity of about megawatts says michael skelly horizons chief development officer that would make the horizon project one of the biggest in the world it would still be less than one third the size of the megawatt project that shells mr wilby says his company hopes to build more than a dozen companies that want power lines in various parts of the state have submitted proposals to the texas public utility commission the state agency that oversees electricity issues shells proposal calls for a mile line to briscoe that it estimates would cost &# million ultimately that cost would likely be paid by texas customers the state is scheduled to signal its intentions in july the companies wont disclose how much theyve spent so far on preparatory work such as land leases their spending is a tiny fraction of what they would ultimately invest if the power lines were approved meanwhile mr arnold the briscoe county rancher is relishing the battle for his land he hasnt signed a lease with any of his suitors "they think theres big bucks in this or they wouldnt be playing " mr arnold says "them folks dont play for cheese and crackers "
