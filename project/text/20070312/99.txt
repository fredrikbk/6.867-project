there a mutual fund that hedges oil price risk by that i mean its leveraged to the upside increase of an upward oil price shock but it might be protected from sudden decreases in the price of oil m h

for protection worried about the impact of another possible plunge in oil prices unfortunately most oil focused mutual funds dont hedge or protect against their downside risk as a result when oil prices drop their returns usually do as well one way for investors to deal with that risk focus on mutual funds that concentrate on energy investments but have the leeway to move elsewhere if things look expensive or the market turns rocky one such fund that wins kudos from lawrence jones an analyst at fund tracker morningstar inc is the t rowe price new era fund prnex which focuses on natural
