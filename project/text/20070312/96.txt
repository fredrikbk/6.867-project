your money matters a special report essay i think i can i think i can successful entrepreneurs believe they can make a lot of money even when they dont but can that confidence be taught long ago i thumbed through t boone pickenss autobiography "boone " its an erratic book but one trenchant passage sticks in my memory in it mr pickens talks about how people with inherited money invest fearfully afraid that a few missteps could doom them to a lifetime of financial ruin not mr pickens at that point in the book he had already written about how he had stormed through dozens of high stakes energy deals frequently risking everything en route to a bigger fortune winning was nice he wrote but even if he had stumbled horribly it wouldnt have been the end "i would get a stake and get started again " he wrote "you cant make money consistently if youre uptight " i love that self confidence it is deep unshakeable and frequently self fulfilling yes it can turn into hubris if people arent careful but as ive learned over the years a fundamental belief in ones ability to earn hefty amounts even if it means starting over again a couple times is at the heart of almost every great entrepreneurs success story it is way too late to turn me into the next boone pickens besides the frenzied life of a deal guy has a dark side that probably isnt worth it for me notice how famous takeover artists always get interrupted on vacation but as a parent id like to see our children pick up some of that financial self confidence whether they end up trading bond futures in new york or selling knickknacks in hawaii id like to see them approach each new job with boldness and optimism but can those sorts of virtues be taught sometimes i suspect that the best known business legends are simply born with an entrepreneurial gene they charge out of their playpens knowing how to conjure up business plans much as young wolfgang amadeus mozart knew how to write sonatas theres nothing for us old timers to do except get out of the way and marvel we had one of those prodigies in our high school andy was clever funny and constantly in trouble with the principal his grades were mediocre but he made a lot of money and provided jobs for the rest of us by running a snack bar on site that sold hundreds of candy bars a week within a decade of graduation andy was making more than &# million a year as a commodity trader in chicago ever since he has been a major player in the capital markets creating firms and darting into new trading areas meanwhile classmates with much better grades have opted for the safe obscurity of a windowed office inside a major law firm but i can think of other cases where friendly intercession at an early stage made a world of difference my four cousins are a scrappy competitive bunch and there was a time when it looked like the second youngest was having trouble keeping up his mother knew that schoolwork was hard for him so she went out of her way to celebrate his successes in sports and community events years later she quipped "i wanted to build up johns self confidence maybe i did too good a job " he has turned into the highflier of the family becoming ceo of an internet start up and then a senior officer of one of the worlds largest companies on a more formal basis many of us have been urging children for decades to sell girl scout cookies magazine subscriptions and the like its hokey but its wonderful too parents quietly line up the best sales prospects ahead of time and then send youngsters to call on those friends and neighbors in search of orders kids who are energetic and personable come out of the experience believing they are really good at sales it wont always be that easy in the adult world but the best salespeople generally do believe that the next call will go well the sooner that faith forms the easier it is to keep knocking on doors i got to know some leading investment bankers years ago and silly as it sounds they could still remember their childhood triumphs selling magazines its way too early for my wife and me to know whether our children ages and have that sort of entrepreneurial spirit our parenting these days concentrates mostly on helping them master spelling words hit a baseball or play the piano in those areas were a lot more confident that we genuinely do have something to offer last summer though we accidentally created a version of an entrepreneurial boot camp that rivaled anything boone pickens could offer it happened on an especially hot day when our boys decided it would be fun to sell lemonade i started out with a small minded plan that involved charging them &# for each can of concentrate the boys were then supposed to keep track of how much revenue each pitcher delivered call it presumptuous but i thought this would teach them about gross margin and cost of goods sold so the boys and a friend pitched their stand on a busy street corner directly across from an expensive new home that was being shown as an open house the neighborhood was swarming with adults who would drive up walk through the house and then prepare to leave in the intense heat everyone was sweating our boys were selling lemonade as fast as they could pour it pitcher after pitcher disappeared the cash box rapidly filled up with quarters and dollar bills then the best moment came at the end of the open house when the developer stepped out to say hi to the kids he tipped them each &# and implored them to come back next week it made perfect sense in a glutted market the developer didnt want to be just another guy hawking square feet of hardwood floors viking ranges and sub zero refrigerators he wanted to be selling ambience and old fashioned neighborhood charm he urgently needed to add that into his story for the house to have any chance of selling at full list price three neighborhood boys selling lemonade fit into the picture perfectly our kids gleefully accepted and i stood there slack jawed i had been so eager to pester them about budgeting that i nearly missed the real joy of the experience for the first time in their lives our kids had done something largely on their own that wasnt totally scripted by their parents and had raked in a nice pile of money in the process this winter i asked my younger son if he still remembered the lemonade stand experience id been telling the story to colleagues as a lesson about winning in the service economy peddle nothing more than a simple task and youre at the bottom of the status and income pyramids transform what you do into a sweeping solution to your customers problem and suddenly youre raking in big dollars from grateful clients my son cut me off before i could annoy him with any of that blather "yes dad " he said with a smile "i remember it we made a lot of money that day " mr anders is a wall street journal news editor based in palo alto calif he can be reached at george anders wsj com
