aer lingus charts solo course carriers chief seeks to prove value with european hub jetblue link dublin after successfully overseeing the privatization of formerly state owned carrier aer lingus group plc last fall chief executive dermot mannion faces a new test convincing investors that the irish carrier is strong enough to fly solo aer lingus which came back from near bankruptcy in the wake of the sept terrorist attacks in the u s saw its shares debut on the dublin and london stock exchanges sept at a price of euros &# eight days later low cost carrier ryanair holdings plc launched a hostile bid at euros a share ryanair withdrew the offer in december amid thin acceptance and intense regulatory scrutiny but it holds a stake in aer lingus second to the irish governments stake and has said it "remains committed to acquiring aer lingus " ryanair has said it is confident of winning european union regulatory approval when the current review ends probably june a ryanair spokesman declined to comment mr mannion says his "single biggest target" remains demonstrating aer linguss value as a stand alone company "i have to be able to prove we can grow share value better" than ryanair would be able to mr mannion years old said in an interview at aer lingus headquarters at dublin airport tomorrow mr mannion who has been in the job for months will have the chance to do just that when aer lingus presents its annual results for the first time as a publicly traded company mr mannion has been able to stay slightly ahead of ryanairs offering price aer linguss shares are trading at about euros above what ryanair offered in october to maintain his edge mr mannion plans moves including establishing a european hub outside ireland and linking aer lingus with u s budget carrier jetblue airways inc prospects for aer linguss future could also brighten if the u s and the eu conclude a proposed agreement to significantly deregulate trans atlantic aviation ireland has some of the most restrictive airline links with the u s of any eu country those would loosen under the deal potentially expanding the rich irish u s market eu transport ministers will vote on the pact march one side of mr mannions effort is to continue the cost cutting begun in by previous ceo willie walsh who is now the ceo of british airways plc mr walsh slashed expenses and streamlined the state carrier by offering low fares with reduced frills while maintaining some trappings of traditional network airlines such as assigned seats and connecting flights mr mannions continuing efforts to pare costs nearly sparked a strike in early march by employees upset about changes in work rules court ordered arbitration averted the walkout at the last minute but labor relations at aer lingus remain tense michael halpenny the national industrial secretary of the services industrial professional and technical union in ireland said the threat of a strike "remains in the background" while talks continue finding areas to cut costs is becoming difficult so mr mannion is looking to increase revenue one way is by expanding in europe where mr mannion expects to announce a new base this summer and begin operations within one year in an effort to tap higher margin intercontinental markets mr mannion last year launched aer linguss first long haul service in years to a destination outside the u s the irish carrier began serving dubai where mr mannion worked for years as a top executive at emirates airline until moving to aer lingus in august the route is performing well mr mannion says but he wants to focus more on the u s where millions of people boast ethnic links to ireland restricted by the current u s irish aviation treaty from expanding directly across the atlantic mr mannion has found an alternative teaming with jetblue of new york the two carriers announced feb that they will jointly sell connecting tickets allowing passengers on either airline to book a continuing flight on the other with baggage checked through linking two airlines systems is a potentially complex interaction that no frills carriers normally shun but the companies think they have a new approach because the link depends mainly on aligning inexpensive internet ticket sales "complexity is the enemy of the low cost model and we cannot allow complexity to creep into our business " mr mannion said he added that the tie up slated to begin this summer "can provide a very seamless product " a jetblue spokeswoman said the carrier "benefits by gaining access to a vibrant new stream of customers " both carriers share a terminal at new yorks john f kennedy international airport simplifying passenger and baggage transfers aer lingus has an advantage at home because ireland is the only country in europe where u s bound passengers can clear u s customs before boarding their planes they arrive at jfk as if they were on a domestic flight the special status further simplifies linking with jetblue jetblue gets greater international reach from the deal while aer lingus gets access to jetblues customer base of nearly million passengers annually "were bringing ireland to a much bigger audience " mr mannion said the agreement comes as jetblue tries to recover from a recent blow to its public image the airline last month kept passengers cooped up for hours on flights during an ice storm resulting in long delays and numerous complaints the company has said it has adjusted its practices and recently added a former federal aviation administration chief operating officer to its executive ranks corrections &amp amplifications passengers boarding u s bound flights in ireland clear immigration before departing a corporate focus article march about aer lingus group plc incorrectly said such passengers clear u s customs which occurs on arrival in addition jetblue airways inc and aer lingus operate out of nearby terminals at new yorks john f kennedy international airport the article incorrectly said both carriers share a terminal wsj march
