super duper tuesday the presidential primary system as we have known it for years is dead history books will record that the era that began with the democratic national committees post reforms ended aug at the hands of the very same dnc on that date the democrats moved one party caucus nevadas to the week between the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary at the same time it moved one primary south carolinas to the week following new hampshires poll while decreeing that no other state that held a primary before feb would have its delegates seated big deal right as it turns out it was in seven states with a combined population of some million people picked delegates on the first tuesday in february in perhaps states representing over million americans will pick candidates on that day more states are jumping on the feb bandwagon so that number could still grow what does this mean for our polity no one really knows but consider how we came to the old primary system in the first place in eugene mccarthys insurgent candidacy was quashed at a tumultuous democratic party convention in favor of the establishment candidate vice president hubert humphrey in response the dnc set out to create an orderly and more or less binding primary system in which state by state votes were spread out over a period of months the republicans followed suit this way each state would have its moment in the sun and so primary voters would get a chance to get acquainted with the candidates and cast an informed vote under this system there has been only one "brokered" convention the republican contest in this was the plan after all parties would choose their candidates in primaries and caucuses long before the delegates who were mostly reduced to a ceremonial role ever showed up for the convention but the other result was that most of the past nine primary seasons were effectively over long before late voting states like new jersey ever got to the polls and so from the beginning states that held late primaries felt that their voice was getting short shrift candidates who built momentum early tended to keep it as others ran out of money or dropped out altogether some states hoping to raise their profile banded together in regional blocs thus in super tuesday on which nine southern states voted on the first tuesday in march was born but the slow jostling to the front of the line became a stampede last year the prevailing attitude among those moving their primaries to the first allowable date on the calendar seemed to be "if national prominence and early voting are good for iowa nevada new hampshire and south carolina why should we get left behind " it is impossible for anyone to campaign effectively before million people in the one week available between the south carolina primary and super duper tuesday so candidates will rely heavily on media buys and campaigning by local proxies all but the most well funded campaigns will have to decide whether to play to their strengths by campaigning where their chances are best or to try to pull off an upset by leaving their base unguarded and campaigning in the states they need the biggest boost either way the result will be something like the opposite of the small town style politics that characterize iowa and new hampshire hustings in their rush to emulate new hampshire and steal a piece of its supposedly outsize influence the states lining up to be "early" are simply stealing each others oxygen its possible that feb will become a winner take all affair but given the huge number of voters and delegates in play on that one day its equally likely that no decisive result emerges if that proves true two possibilities arise on the one hand the states that resisted the rush could find themselves as kingmakers and being late might seem fashionable again alternatively a fragmented result on feb could well ensure a brokered convention in the summer this would have the uncomfortable consequence for the candidates of forcing them to continue to court their base long after they would have hoped to start reaching out to the broader electorate aside from a tradition of political skepticism and manageable size one of the chief virtues of new hampshires first in the nation primary was that it was not only first but it was also alone this gave all the candidates a single destination on which to descend a state primary involving of the country cant come close to replicating that its possible that one or two of the states that are elbowing their way into the first tuesday in february will prove decisive in shaping the election but having so many in play on a single day reduces the odds that your state will "matter" on feb with so many states having decided that they want to be near the front of the line well probably never return to what in hindsight will be remembered as a leisurely primary schedule but dont be surprised if some of the fab feb fivers decide in that being stuck in a crowded field is no more fun than being by yourself in march or april mr carney is a member of the wall street journal editorial board
