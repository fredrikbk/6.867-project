casinos asian cold streak u s gambling firms hit a run of bad luck but outlook stays hot the fortunes of u s casino companies with exposure in asia have hit a run of bad luck not unlike the kind their customers sometimes experience at the gambling tables despite booming business in macau the main asian gambling destination companies operating in the region have been pounded in recent weeks the hardest hit have been rivals las vegas sands corp and wynn resorts ltd whose share prices often move in tandem they are the only u s companies that have casinos in macau and both las vegas firms stocks hit record highs earlier this year mgm mirage which is planning two properties on the island has suffered in recent weeks as well stock in sands controlled by billionaire sheldon adelson skidded as much as from mid january until march when it closed at &# on the new york stock exchange though the shares have gained a bit of ground since then closing friday at &# the price is down from a record &# set jan since that high the company has lost about &# billion in market value which is currently about &# billion as of dec the year old mr adelson owned of the shares outstanding so his personal holdings have lost billions of dollars in value too the share price of wynn resorts whose majority shareholders are casino icon steve wynn and his japanese business partner kazuo okada was down as far as off its intraday high of &# reached early last month on the nasdaq stock market it closed friday at &# up six cents sands shares trade at about times estimated per share earnings for considerably richer than wynn resorts price earnings ratio of about the rapid descent suggests that investors are nervous about the long term prospects of the asian market especially after the companies big gains during the past year it is easy to forget too that a year ago sands was trading in the low &# range and wynn which has a current market value of almost &# billion was down to about &# a share yet despite the cold streak it might not be time for investors to walk away from the table "whats going to happen in macau in the next years hasnt changed in the past days " says robert lafleur casino analyst at susquehanna financial group referring to the booming chinese gambling enclave macau is seeing more visitors flocking to spend their gambling dollars in a handful of new casinos and profits were flush in las vegas last year mr lafleur who has a "buy" rating on sands but doesnt cover wynn doesnt own shares in either company his firm doesnt have a banking relationship with either sands or wynn the casino sector which had largely been outperforming the standard &amp poors stock index in recent months has had its collective gaze trained on asia for the past few years gambling operators are in various stages of design and construction of lavish and expensive asian casino resorts the sector had been dragged down precipitously in recent weeks industry observers and analysts say some of the drop is profit taking after strong industry earnings in macau and las vegas last year the recent shakiness in the asian stock markets translated into u s investor unease "there is a lot of nervousness out there in terms of what happened in the asian markets they sneezed and we sort of caught cold " concedes william weidner sands president and chief operating officer in a march research note robin farley casino analyst at ubs securities llc in new york said that "more than of the companys stock price is due to sands macau operations and real estate development" on a nearby chinese island she added that only one of eight planned properties is open she and other analysts also have questioned how well macaus infrastructure will absorb the megaresorts scheduled to open yet ms farley has a &# price target on the stock ubs has had an investment banking relationship with sands ms farley doesnt own shares of the company she rates both sands and wynn as "neutral" and has a "buy" recommendation on mgm mirage mr weidner says analysts are looking at earnings as far ahead as and when the firms venetian macao property will have been open for more than two years and working backward since opening the first u s owned casino in macau in sands had little new competition on the island until last fall when mr wynn opened his wynn macau last month stanley ho who controlled the islands gambling trade until the chinese government ended his monopoly in opened his story flagship grand lisboa casino down the street from mr wynns property the increased clutter served to soften sands macao results in the fourth quarter and spooked some investors sands is hoping for a "game changing" event when it opens the venetian macao targeted for this summer company officials expect the regions first las vegas style resort complete with shopping malls and convention spaces will be a lure for the roughly three billion people that the company says live within a five hour flight of the island other large hotel casinos developed by sands are slated to follow in an area of reclaimed land dubbed the "cotai strip " wynn resorts also is planning to develop additional properties in the same area the success of wynn resorts and las vegas sands is largely predicated on this future expansion which is why observers say these market jitters are just that "people were looking for an excuse to sell the macau names " mr lafleur says "they had been so strong recently and then there was some nervousness about the near term of macau but it isnt about the near term "
