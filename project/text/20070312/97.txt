continually increasing cost of college in its proposed budget for fiscal the bush administration wants to give a boost to several financial aid programs from expanding the maximum that needy students can receive from the federal pell grant program to increasing the limits on what students can borrow it even proposes sheltering all college savings plan assets from being counted in determining federal student financial aid those proposals as with nearly everything in the fiscal budget depend on congressional passage that said one of the priorities of newly empowered democrats in congress is college affordability in some cases democratic proposals vary somewhat from what the president offered in his budget last month in recently introduced bills in both the house and senate democratic leaders moved to cut interest rates on certain student loans the president on the other hand wants to boost the limits on what students can borrow but both sides of the aisle want to see an increase in the federal pell grant program which distributes to needy students money that doesnt have to be repaid as lawmakers debate on capitol hill the cost of college continues to increase faster than the

questions email us at reports wsj com and well give it our best shot what are the penalty and tax implications of withdrawing money for college from an ira bob von halle chicago a withdrawal from an ira before the account holder reaches age would normally be subject to a penalty equal to of assets in addition to income tax but when the withdrawal is used for "qualified higher education expenses" including tuition fees room and board and supplies there is no penalty although the distribution would still be subject to income tax premature withdrawals from a roth ira when used for college are also exempt from the penalty but work slightly differently when it comes to taxes the part of the distribution that comes straight from your contributions would be tax free but any earnings on those contributions would be subject to income tax if the parent is over at the time of the distribution for college it is not subject to the penalty or taxes unless it is from a roth that has been held for less than five years im and have about five years left on a short term mortgage with a high monthly payment to make these payments i made some sizable withdrawals from my ira in and as a result my adjusted gross income required on the federal aid application is quite a bit higher than my actual salary in applying for financial aid for my two sons can this be adjusted g d bloomfield hills mich adjusted gross income which includes income from various sources including retirement accounts is very specifically required by the federal aid application you should either try to find a way to squeak through the next couple of years on the mortgage without having to dig into your retirement money or refinance suggests k c dempster director of program development at college money in marlton n j while refinancing would mean paying off your house in smaller bites for a few years the benefits of better aid packages for your sons will likely make it worthwhile if you want to stick to your

into annuities believing that annuities would be sheltered from the aid calculation since they are considered retirement assets is this correct jack warnock berwyn pa yes but its not necessarily advisable the reason while parent owned plans for dependent students are counted the rate at which theyre counted against aid in the federal calculus is small up to at the same time the money grows tax free and distributions for college expenses are also tax free on the other hand while money in annuities is sheltered from being counted against you for federal aid purposes thats because they are considered retirement assets if you withdraw funds before reaching age you will pay a penalty not to mention other potential fees from the insurance company and of course distributions for college would be taxed taxes and penalties alone will likely negate any benefits from sheltering the funds from the financial aid assessment another reason you should stick with a plan pennsylvania residents get a generous state income tax deduction for contributions to any states in addition to the federal tax benefits i give my three grown children gifts of &# annually to help save for their childrens college educations we have no special accounts but quite a bit of savings accumulated is there a better way to help save for my grandchildrens future tuitions sol gittleman winchester mass consider opening plans for your grandchildren the money grows tax free and distributions for college are tax free added bonus the federal formula for assessing how much a family can pay for college is strictly focused on the finances of parent and child so plans opened by grandparents go uncounted in the federal calculus my wife and i are raising her granddaughter from a previous marriage the girls parents are both disabled due to severe mental illness and are divorced my wife has sole custody of the girl whom we have not adopted she is now and is thinking about college whose finances would be assessed in her application for student aid name withheld fresno calif when the time comes this is a case where it would be appropriate to ask the colleges financial aid office for a "dependency override" in
