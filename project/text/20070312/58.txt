new york times hears key holders complaints in a sign that the new york times co may be trying to appease investors who have criticized it the newspaper publisher invited morgan stanley money manager hassan elmasry and another large shareholder t rowe price group inc to make presentations to its board of directors late last month the board extended the invitation even though the company and its controlling ochs sulzberger family have repeatedly rebuffed mr elmasry who controls of the companys class a shares class a shares have less voting power than the family controlled class b shares he has called for the company to dismantle its dual class share structure which gives the family control and split the role of its chairman and publisher both positions are held by arthur sulzberger jr the family recently agreed to pull its personal assets from morgan stanley catherine mathis a times spokeswoman confirmed the presentations and said in a statement "while we do not comment on what takes place within our boardroom we believe in open discussion and dialogue and felt it important for all our board members to have a chance to hear outside views and thoughts " last year at least two other large institutional shareholders t rowe price and private capital management joined morgan stanley in withholding votes for directors at the timess annual meeting according to people familiar with the matter although they didnt identify themselves at the time private capital owns of the timess class a shares and t rowe price owns according to the latest regulatory filings a spokesman for private capital declined to comment on the vote brian c rogers chairman of t rowe price declined to comment on last years vote after mr elmasrys proposals were excluded from the companys proxy statement to be released wednesday mr elmasry wrote a letter to the companys four class a directors dated jan expressing his disappointment "by excluding the proposals from the proxy the company has left the class a shareholders with limited avenues for expressing their dissatisfaction with the poor performance of the managers of their business " he said in the letter he closed the letter with a veiled threat to withhold his votes at the companys coming annual meeting soon after the times extended the invitations to present to the board mr elmasry and dennis shea chief investment officer of morgan stanley investment management made their presentation in the times companys boardroom feb later that day representatives from t rowe price made a presentation by speakerphone "when a board or a committee of a board is interested in investor opinions it is usually a sign of a particularly controversial situation " said mr rogers the t rowe price chairman who was on the call "most boards dont hold a formal session with large investors " in his presentation to the board mr elmasry discussed the possibility of withholding votes for directors at this years annual meeting next month and cited other examples such as home depot inc pfizer inc and walt disney co in which the boards of those companies were forced to take action after a significant withhold campaign from shareholders mr elmasrys presentation to the board repeated many of the concerns he has already raised with the companys management according to a person who saw his presentation he showed a number of slides comparing the shareholder return of the times company to other media concerns such as dow jones &amp co the publisher of this newspaper washington post co gannett co and tribune co and showed that the timess returns were the worst of the group over the past five years times companys stock has lost almost half its value dow joness stock has fallen by almost over the same period tribunes stock is down by a third gannett is down nearly washington posts stock is up he told the board he was concerned about the timess declining circulation in the new york area he said he disapproved of the companys capital allocation including what he felt was a poorly timed buyback excessive spending on the companys new headquarters and "overpaying" for about com he also cited the companys deteriorating credit rating and questioned whether the dual share structure was actually succeeding in preserving journalistic integrity as the company contends t rowes mr rogers appeared to be focused less on the dual class structure than on the companys capital allocation while he "appreciates what morgan stanley is trying to do with the dual class structure " he wasnt hopeful that the company would abandon it "lets put it this way if there were a proposal on the proxy to do away with a dual class structure we would vote for that " he said "but you have to be a little realistic " a dual share structure isnt uncommon for newspaper companies washington post is controlled by the graham family and dow jones is controlled by the bancroft family at the new york times so far the family has shown no inclination to change the share structure but a person familiar with the familys thinking said that the family doesnt feel as strongly about other issues such as capital allocation at the times company ms mathis a times spokeswoman said the family had made its feelings about the dual class structure clear and that capital allocation was a management issue the ochs sulzberger family trust owns of the times companys class a shares which have limited voting rights shares held by the family outside the trust bring the familys total class a stake to approximately the familys control of the company stems however from its ownership of class b shares which have most of the votes the dual class structure cant be changed without the approval of six of the eight family members in the trust mr rogers said he wanted the company to use the proceeds from the sale of its tv stations wisely that sale for &# million to oak hill capital partners is expected to close before the end of the second quarter "one of the concerns an investor would have is dont spend it all in one place " he said the times has indicated that it plans to use that money at least in the short term to pay down debt people familiar with the matter say that members of the times companys executive team are girding for another potential "withhold" vote from major shareholders mr elmasry declined to comment but people familiar with his thinking say he is almost sure to withhold his votes how aggressive he will be with a campaign to persuade other shareholders to do so depends in part on how the times company reacts to his proposals these people said "their antennae have been raised to investor concerns and issues of company performance " mr rogers added referring to the companys board "if i were the board and i were trying to signal that im listening i would make some type of gesture to simply show the meetings were not a waste of everybodys time "
