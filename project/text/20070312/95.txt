big storylines tomorrow check back for a pick by pick breakdown of the entire field and perhaps my emotional breakdown as i try to make sense of it all for brackets get a viewable one here and a printable one here and when youre finished today join me and other readers in the online journals discussion forum  the top storyline will florida repeat as champs a year ago a sophomore heavy gators team seeded no in their region blitzed through the field en route to a national title the three players in floridas star front court joakim noah al horford and corey brewer were locks to be high nba draft picks but shocked experts and fans alike by spurning nba millions to return to defend their title the entire starting lineup from that title team is back along with two key reserves in ncaa history no title winning starting five has ever come back intact and won a second consecutive title since uclas legendary dynasty which ended in the mid s only one team has even repeated as ncaa champs duke in and arizona in was the last title team to return all of its starters despite a lofty seeding the wildcats were blown out in the "elite eight" round this seasons gators lost five games and stumbled at the end of the regular season losing their final three road games but they bounced back in their conference tournament seemingly regaining their championship form on neutral courts on the strength of their conference tournament title their regular season conference title and undoubtedly their status as defending champs with that same starting five the ncaa tournament selection committee gave the gators not just a seed but the "top" seed what does that mean if florida can return to the final four they wont meet the committees second or third ranked seeds north carolina or ohio state until the national championship game but thats a long way away and absolutely no guarantee for anyone seed or otherwise  the top seeds whos no fans need only look to last march to see the pre tournament value of earning a regional top seed not one seed made it to the final four the lesson seeding matters way less than individual game match ups along the way however the essential benefit of being a top seed is favorable geographic placement with first round games as close to home as possible florida the seed of the "midwest" region will play its first two rounds in new orleans its region is layered with unpredictable wild cards like oregon maryland butler arizona and georgia tech north carolina the second ranked seed was placed in the "east" region generally considered to be the toughest of the four regions before the tar heels can even think about the final four they will potentially have to go through young and energetic texas in the sweet round ohio state the third ranked seed was placed in the "south" region the good news for a team anchored by a freshman center greg oden and point guard mike conley this is perceived as the weakest of the three regions kansas the final seed was placed in the "west" region with first round flame outs in each of the last two years the jayhawks are under enormous pressure to simply escape the first weekend let alone win the region  this years george mason is last years cinderella run to the final four by george mason a school from a so called mid major conference and one of the last teams to make the tournament field ruined it for everyone else who ever stood to fill that role it will be hard for any smaller team to replicate let alone top the impact of the patriots magical run which instantly became one of the great stories in the sports history novelty has its advantages undoubtedly a mid major teams run to the final four this year would simply be labeled "this years george mason " the hot pick to make such a run tiny winthrop which like george mason is listed as an seed like any would be cinderella the eagles have a tough route they start with underestimated notre dame then likely face oregon winner of the pac tournament even if winthrop made it all the way to the regional final theres a chance they would have to defeat none other than the reigning defending champs the gators looking for other small name schools with big time potential west seed vcu is trendy if they can get by a first round date with duke south seed creighton has long fancied itself fit for cinderellas high tops and even though it is listed as a seed southern illinois in the west maintains enough "directional school" anonymity to be considered cindy worthy in the event of a deep tournament run  player to watch the presumptive national player of the year freshman kevin durant of texas seeded no in the east the longhorns superstar led all big conference scorers with more than points per game and chipped in more than rebounds per game plus almost steals and blocks per game too he isnt just the best and most exciting player in college basketball if he chooses to leave school after this season he is a virtual lock as one of the top two picks of the nba draft in the best player in the country was also a freshman carmelo anthony led syracuse to an ncaa title now theres great anticipation over whether mr durant can pull off the same feat looking ahead a sweet match up with region top seed north carolina could be the marquee pairing of the entire tournament other impact players to watch south acie law iv texas a&amp m ppg apg rpg midwest alando tucker wisconsin ppg rpg apg west darren collison ucla ppg apg spg  "geography" winners and losers the selection committee tries to keep top seeded teams as close to home as possible in the early rounds this can create intriguing geographic advantages or disadvantages worth noting winners louisville in lexington ky miles from home north carolina in winston salem n c miles xavier in lexington ky miles wisconsin in chicago miles oregon in spokane wash miles losers texas in spokane wash longest trip of any top seed indiana in sacramento calif only non westerner in four team group notre dame in spokane wash would face oregon in round vanderbilt in sacramento calif would face washington state in round unlv in chicago would face wisconsin in round  regional bracket analysis midwest its floridas to lose seed wisconsin is weakened with key cog brian butch out with injury seed oregon must escape spokane first early round intrigue seed butler a traditional cinderella finds itself in the rare role of goliath versus seed old dominion team to watch seed georgia tech loaded with young talent and appropriately inconsistent the jackets could flame out in round or find themselves in the elite eight if i really had guts id take georgia tech but as im gutless ill take florida east the most brutal region unc may be the top seed but georgetown is hotter than any team in the country right now washington state plays precisely the kind of slow down offense that triggers tournament runs and you might have already heard about this kid durant early round intrigue earlier this season texas techs bob knight set the all time record for career victories earlier this season boston college looked like an elite eight team they meet in the first round team to watch seed georgetown a year ago georgetown fell a last second basket away from derailing florida the hoyas returned this season both on a mission and having already taken the champs to their limits without fear of any team if i really had guts id take texas but as im gutless ill take georgetown south greg oden is the next patrick ewing with a near lock on the no spot in this junes nba draft the ohio state centers freshman year has resembled the great mr ewings but mr ewing made it all the way to the title game as a freshman can mr oden replicate the feat early round intrigue seed nevada behind their all american forward nick fazekas had trouble getting intimidated big time teams to put them on their schedule seed creighton is just that type of mid major giant killer the experts have warned you about something has to give team to watch seed texas a&amp m just as florida has evolved over the past decade this is a traditional football institution that has turned into a hoops powerhouse they spent their entire season in the top flirted with a top seed and feature mr law the best player youve never heard of but should have if i really had guts id take creighton but as im gutless ill take texas a&amp m west a lot of people are talking about kansas as this years florida because this group of young jayhawks was embarrassed in the tournament a year ago but have evolved to become a clutch motivated team ku even beat florida back in november note that theyre still coached by bill self pick them deep at your own risk early round intrigue how strange is it to see the blue bloods of duke listed as a seed contrast heir unimpressive first round flame out in the acc tournament with seed vcus own spirited conference tournament title run could duke actually get bounced on the first day team to watch seed gonzaga act one of the zags story unexpected late s tournament cinderella act two fizzling early s tournament dud act three well see the zags return to their roots of low expectations and perhaps dangerous overachievement if i really had guts id take vcu but as im gutless ill take ucla  upset specials the conventional wisdom has become that the seed always gives the seed a hard time lets take a quick look at this years games midwest butler old dominion upset potential definitely east usc arkansas upset potential perhaps south tennessee long beach state upset potential have you seen lbs play west virginia tech illinois upset potential sure too tough to call here are a few other first round upset specials to watch midwest winthrop over notre dame georgia tech over unlv east george washington over vanderbilt texas tech over boston college south albany over virginia creighton over nevada west vcu over duke gonzaga over indiana oh and just as a reminder over doesnt count as an upset at least for any self respecting bracket picker for the record over barely qualifies  "bracket porn " this is my personal shorthand for prematurely looking ahead in the bracket at those tantalizing matchups that seem too good to be true here are a sample that will have fans salivating midwest florida vs arizona zona last title team to return all five starters florida vs maryland terps talented enough to hang with gators wisconsin vs oregon badgers stout d vs ducks "jackin it" style east texas vs usc where are vince and reggie rose bowl rematch georgetown vs bc ancient big east rivals clash one more time unc vs georgetown classic ncaa title game years later south memphis vs louisville calipari vs pitino slick x texas a&amp m vs nevada law and fazekas battle of all americans ohio state vs anyone last chance to see collegian greg oden west ucla vs pitt bruins coach howland used to coach panthers southern illinois vs illinois ultimate bragging rights kansas vs kentucky two of the biggest "name" programs ever  bubble snubs among the final teams that eked their way into the field two teams from traditional "power" conferences arkansas and illinois were considered banal at best if not outright wrong given last years success of cinderella mid major george mason there was popular sentiment that drexel a trendy mid major with a handful of marquee wins against "name" teams was the biggest snub among big conference teams syracuse was presumed to have played itself off the bubble and into the tournament field both will end up in the afterthought nit but its hard to muster much sympathy for either or any team left out of the field all had their chances throughout the season and can point to "bad" losses with different results they would have all had stronger claims  so wholl win it all florida but hey there are a lot of people who can simply pick the champ particularly those of us uninspired enough to pick the on paper favorite the real fun of the ncaa tournament is picking the other results between now and the title game coming tomorrow the five stages of bracket picking yes with picks dan shanoff blogs daily about sports at danshanoff
