inflation data likely to guide stock recovery pair of price reports return markets focus to domestic pressures after being roiled by such abstractions as stocks in shanghai and loans based in japanese yen the u s stock market will return focus this week to a matter much closer to the hearts of everyday investors and consumers inflation if the benign readings that most wall street professionals expect come true stocks likely will extend the comeback they enjoyed last week setting a positive tone for markets in asia and europe the blue chip dow jones industrial average has now rallied from its recent low set last monday but it still would have to rise more than to reach its feb closing record the market will digest two important measures of u s inflation from the labor department analysts expect the producer price index a measure of wholesale price inflation due out thursday to rise for february excluding volatile food and energy prices more important is that the consumer price index the governments key retail inflation measure due out friday is also expected to rise excluding food and energy according to the average forecast of analysts surveyed by dow jones newswires wall street also will keep a close eye on the annual change in consumer prices which were up in january from a year earlier compared with a annual increase the previous month at the time that was the highest rate of increase since the market watches these numbers because of the impact on corporate profits of the higher costs of raw materials and higher wages investors also look for hints about when the federal reserve will make its next interest rate move and what it might be runaway inflation can lead the fed to raise interest rates to put the brakes on the economy although thats not the expectation now the fed has held its benchmark short term rate target at since last june as recently as last month many were expecting the fed to cut rates in late spring to spur economic growth last week after employment data hinted that the u s economy is still growing at a modest pace futures traders at the chicago board of trade placed the chances of a cut by the fed in may at less than and less than a chance of a june rate cut lower interest rates tend to help stocks because they reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers but with recent inflation readings well above the level that fed chairman ben bernanke defines as the top of the feds "comfort zone" for inflation some forecasters have predicted that the fed will hold its rate targets steady for a prolonged period perhaps through all of waiting to see an annual inflation reading at or below merrill lynch economist david rosenberg however says the central bank could cut rates before then counting on several months of lag time before the full effect of lower borrowing costs becomes evident in economic readings as long as the annual inflation rate moves lower the fed would be able to take comfort in a reading slightly above as the right time to cut rates mr rosenberg said "any purist will tell you that is a goal you want to obtain over the course of a business cycle not in a particular month " mr rosenberg said "i dont know why weve become so fixated on it " comforting inflation data are far from a sure thing this week considering other measures of the economys health in recent public comments mr bernanke and other central bank officials have been careful to warn that high inflation readings are still a possibility "when we set up our portfolios at the beginning of the year we were expecting real softening in the inflation data which hasnt been the case " said strategist jack caffrey of j p morgan private bank "inflation has stubbornly remained above the feds comfort zone " mr caffrey said he and his colleagues recently have been steering clients away from the riskiest stocks and bonds because of investors hopes for a rate cut meanwhile analysts say the stock market has been treating some developments that would usually be considered gloomy as good news last weeks employment data showed weak job growth for february in line with analysts expectations more worrisome wage growth was stronger than expected and oil prices have jumped nearly to &# a barrel from their january lows but because those trends were accompanied by a round of buying in markets around the world last week major u s stock indicators rose the dow rallied points or for the week to off on the year the broad standard &amp poors stock index gained or points to end at off on the year the tech stock focused nasdaq composite index rose or points to off on the year "this is just confirming that the market underwent a pretty standard correction" in late february said jim bianco president of bianco research "there may yet be some more selling but in general this is just something the market has to get out of the way so it can eventually go higher " u s stocks fell more than on feb following a nearly plunge in the shanghai composite index an increase in interest rates in japan also sparked concerns about an investment strategy known as the carry trade in which investors borrow in countries with low interest rates such as japan to buy assets in countries with higher rates such as the u s strategist james paulsen of wells capital management said the u s economy remains stronger than many investors realize with most of its weakness confined to the housing market and auto industry which he estimates comprise about of the overall economy combined "weve got about of the economy that is far from recession and if anything may be in danger of overheating " said mr paulsen who believes the fed could eventually have to raise rates "that helps explain why people keep going to the mall even though home prices are way down "
