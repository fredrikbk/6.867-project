television takeover fighting to create a secular democracy in iraq parliamentarian mithal al alusi had come to rely on at least one tv network to help further freedom u s taxpayer financed al hurra now however hes concerned the broadcaster he had seen as a stalwart ally has done an about face "until now we were so happy with al hurra it was taking stands against corruption for human rights and for peace but not anymore " stories that he believes cry out for further investigation such as recent arrests of those accused of supporting the terrorists in iraq are instead getting mere news ticker mentions at the bottom of the screen and arab voices for freedom which used to have a home on al hurra are noticeably absent "theyre driving out the liberals " he complains mr alusi is not the only one concerned about the recent changes at al hurra ken tomlinson the chairman of the broadcasting board of governors the congressionally created panel charged with overseeing al hurra among other government funded broadcasters is currently demanding answers about the networks decision last december to broadcast most of a speech by hezbollah leader sheikh hasan nasrallah sitting up straight and raising his index finger he states emphatically "its the single worst decision ive witnessed in all my years in international broadcasting " the airing of the nasrallah speech is a sign of the networks new direction since it was taken over by a longtime cnn producer larry register last november launched in february al hurra broadcasts three separate feeds to europe arab nations and one for iraq the network is supposed to be a key component of our public diplomacy to the arab world its mission statement calls for it to showcase the american political process and just as important report on things that get little attention on other arabic networks such as human rights abuses and government corruption within weeks of becoming news director mr register put his own stamp on the network producers and on air talent quickly understood that change was underway investigations into arab government wrongdoing or oppression were no longer in vogue and the ban on turning the airwaves over to terrorists was lifted for those who had chafed under mr registers predecessor who curbed the desire of many on staff to make al hurra more like al jazeera the new era was welcomed warmly "everybody feels emboldened register changed the atmosphere around here " notes one staffer "register is trying to pander to arab sympathies " says another the cultural shift inside the newsroom is evident in the on air product in the past several months al hurra has aired live speeches from mr nasrallah and hamas leader ismail haniya and it broadcast an interview with an alleged al qaeda operative who expressed joy that rubbed "americas nose in the dust " while a handful of unfortunate decisions could be isolated these actions appear to be part of mr registers news vision former news director mouafac harb a lebanese born american citizen was not shy about his disdain for terrorists and had a firm policy against giving them a platform but mr register didnt wait long to allow hamas officials on the air to discuss palestinian politics at a staff meeting announcing the reversal of the ban on terrorists as guests mr register "bragged" about his personal relationship with palestinian foreign minister mahmoud al zahar a top hamas official according to someone who was present contacted on his cell phone last week for comment mr register declined indicating that he couldnt spare even two minutes anytime in the coming days perhaps it is because mr register is so casual in his attitude to terrorists that interviewers now toss softball questions to fiery anti western guests while also taking digs at one of americas closest middle eastern allies israel the new al hurra was on full display feb when riots broke out following israels implementation of security measures that limited access to the al aqsa mosque in jerusalem in roughly two hours of breathless live "breaking news" coverage which outdistanced al jazeera by minutes al hurras muslim guests vilified israel and one spun conspiracy theories about the jewish states "plans" to destroy the al aqsa mosque no doubt the islamic talking heads were egged on by the al hurra anchors asking questions such as "do you think that the timing of these actions is as innocent as israel pretends " translations were provided by a fluent arabic speaking u s government official this powder keg of a panel included ikrima sabri imam of the al aqsa mosque who is best known for his tenure as yasser arafats hand picked mufti of jerusalem during the broadcast mr sabri accused israel of firing guns and throwing bombs into the mosque then refusing to allow medical care for the wounded mr sabris propaganda should not have come as a surprise just weeks before mr sabri delivered a passionate friday sermon broadcast nationally on official palestinian authority radio he prayed for the destruction of israel britain and the united states if anyone should be savvy about people like mr sabri it ought to be mr register with two decades of experience at cnn including three years running the jerusalem bureau he should know that live tv is the wrong venue for firebrands or guests prone to outrageous commentary complicating matters is that once someone is on al hurra live mr register lacks the basic requirement to stay on top of unfolding coverage he doesnt speak arabic had mr register been able to understand mr nasrallahs dec speech perhaps he would have rushed to cut away early on before the five minute mark mr nasrallah told the audience to stop their celebratory gun firing explaining "the only place where bullets should be is the chest of the enemies of lebanon the israeli enemy " former broadcasting board of governors member norman pattiz understands the perils of turning over the airwaves to the likes of mr nasrallah though he wouldnt comment on anything relating to recent months he left the board last year before mr registers arrival mr pattiz said bluntly "simply handing a microphone over to a terrorist and letting them spew is not what i would call good journalism " though mr pattiz is a well known democrat who feuded constantly with mr tomlinson a republican the two men had one area of agreement mr harb al hurras original news director sounding remarkably similar to mr tomlinson mr pattiz said "the direction al hurra launched in is the direction in which it should continue to go because it was very successful " mr alusi the iraqi parliamentarian agrees "al hurra should have the role of transporting democracy and to help iraqis understand freedom " he says "if you have a good product you must sell it in a good way the united states is a very good product " mr mowbray is working on a book about the struggle for the heart of islam in america see related letters "letters to the editor
