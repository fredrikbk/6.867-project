entrepreneur and former aide to israeli peace negotiators evelina tshabalala a fellow south african runs marathons lives in a squatters camp and is infected with the aids virus their goal to make ms tshabalala a national hero and celebrity pitchwoman noticing the dearth of black women in mountaineering mr stern handpicked year old ms tshabalala and persuaded her to attempt to climb the highest mountain on each continent in late february ms tshabalala got one step closer by knocking off argentinas mount aconcagua which at feet is the highest peak outside asia that week deep snow treacherous ice and heavy winds had forced many climbing teams to turn around an english climber died on the mountain while ms tshabalala was preparing for her final push to the top ms tshabalala not realizing she had already reached the summit kept going until a guide told her she was already at the peak with aconcagua and kilimanjaro under her belt ms tshabalalas team is planning to complete the fabled "seven summits " culminating in mount everest if she and her two climbing partners who also hail from the same squatters camp reach the top of everest they will be the first black african women to do so in the u s and europe tales of extreme mountain climbing have grown almost commonplace the top of mount everest has already been claimed by numerous others including the first blind person and the first one armed person nowadays its "nearly impossible" to land a sponsorship to summit everest says gordon janow a director of the seattle based mountain guiding company alpine ascents international inc but thats not the case in south africa "everest still has a lot of mileage " says john black senior merchandise buyer at south african outdoor gear purveyor cape union mart which now employs ms tshabalala in one of its warehouses and is backing her teams quest the first south african ascended everest only a decade or so ago so people "know enough to be interested but not enough to be bored " he said cape union marts commitment covers less than of the approximately &# that mr stern estimates will be needed over the next two years hes trying to raise the balance from a wide range of south african corporations mr stern says hes sunk about &# of his own money into the venture so far after hes paid back on his investment and sponsors have picked up the rest of the teams costs the climbers would split just over of profits with that percentage rising over time mr stern left south africa in after being arrested for distributing antiapartheid literature in israel until he says he worked as an aide to interior minister josef burg where he participated in peace negotiations and met jimmy carter and ronald reagan in with his widowed mother ailing in south africa mr stern returned to his home country despite heavy violence apartheid was wobbling and mr stern founded a company eden africa cc which helps south african corporations diversify their work forces today mr stern lives comfortably in a spacious house at the foot of table mountain he makes his own wine and keeps what he claims is the largest collection of single malt whiskey in south africa a few years ago mr stern saw another opportunity to merge his commitment to racial equality with business a lifelong mountaineer he realized that a black african woman had never conquered a major peak in mr stern began asking about in running circles and heard of a woman named evelina lithe with a huge smile ms tshabalala grew up in a rural community where she ran about miles to school the first time she competed in a race was in when she was it was kilometers or about miles she ran barefoot and won that afternoon she ran a second kilometer race and won that one too in she became the first black woman to break into the top three in south africas national marathon "shes very stubborn " says her running coach of years dave spence "i would give her a lecture and her eyes would flicker and she wouldnt talk to me for a week but most things she sets out to achieve she does " with apartheid in place he said ms tshabalala had almost no chance to compete at the collegiate or professional level in a car crash cut a gash in ms tshabalalas leg causing her to run for years with a limp about that same time she tested hiv positive at first the virus didnt seem to affect her health but in her year old son drowned and the grief she says sent her immune system plummeting ms tshabalala now is on antiretroviral drugs paid for by the medical insurance she gets through her job with cape union mart her total pay package is the equivalent of &# a month ms tshabalala lives in a squalid shantytown just outside hout bay one of the capes most picturesque seaside towns the communal toilets cost about cents for adults so many people use a bucket instead when it rains the human waste flows under ms tshabalalas dwelling to mitigate the stench and improve hygiene she dug a drainage trench beneath her shack and covered the cracks in her floor with sheets of particle board although ms tshabalalas stomach muscles were initially weak for a climber mr stern admired her mental toughness he began buying groceries to supplement her diet and hired a trainer for her three weeks before climbing aconcagua ms tshabalala ran a marathon one day and the very next went on a six hour training hike and climbed table mountain elevation feet twice now back from aconcagua shes planning to run cape towns mile two oceans "ultramarathon" on april "ok i finish aconcagua " she says with a laugh "now i focus on two oceans "
