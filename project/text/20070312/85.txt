glamorize them a little bit " says terri heredia senior vice president of talent at denver based aimco "were trying to present a realistic day in the life of" with the new descriptions aimco or apartment investment &amp management co is among a small but growing number of employers revamping job descriptions the strong labor market has stiffened competition for workers but internet ads are

building superintendents maintenance workers and sales staffers aimco is testing the revised ads in its gulf region from florida to texas one reason for the turnover aimco believed was that hires

increasing the net operating income of the community " it specified that applicants should have a bachelors degree and two to four years of experience the new ad for the same position is clearer and less formal "community managers run the show so to speak " it outlines duties in plain english such as training staff and handling many phone calls and it mentions challenges such as collecting rent from delinquent tenants working "evenings and weekends is par for the course " the ad says it doesnt set firm academic and experience requirements ms heredia of aimco says the new job descriptions have helped cut turnover where used only of employees hired for customer facing jobs through the new ads left within days she says that compares with of those hired for the same jobs through the old ads and other means the new ads can also help recruit a broader pool of promising candidates because they dont set strict education and work experience requirements healtheast care system a minnesota
