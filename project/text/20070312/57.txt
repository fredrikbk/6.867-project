panel urges steps to boost allure of u s markets restructuring of sec end to profit guidance are among proposals washington responding to a chorus of complaints that the u s is losing its edge to foreign markets a panel set up by the nations biggest business lobby recommends steps including structural changes at the securities and exchange commission the end of quarterly earnings guidance and a boost in the nations retirement savings the panel commissioned by the u s chamber of commerce is scheduled to release its report here today kicking off a week of debate about u s competitiveness tomorrow treasury secretary henry paulson plans to host a roundtable discussion including former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan former treasury secretary robert rubin investor warren buffett and jeffrey immelt the chief executive of general electric co on wednesday the chambers panel is slated to host a conference featuring two prominent democratic lawmakers and sec chairman christopher cox wall street and its allies have been sounding alarms for several months that u s rules and enforcement practices some adopted in the wake of corporate scandals threaten the primacy of u s capital markets amid stiff competition from rivals in europe and asia mr paulson a former goldman sachs group inc ceo has made the issue one of his priorities but some of the recent analysis has been criticized for confusing the interests of wall street firms with the overall economy and some of its political force has been diluted by the continuing scandal over options backdating moreover if adopted some of the recent recommendations including some proposed by the chambers panel could reduce protections for investors and scrutiny of financial firms wall street has blamed onerous regulations in the u s for driving many initial public offerings of stock to overseas markets but others say these markets have simply become more competitive in recent years the chamber backed report produced by a bipartisan panel that began work in is an effort to identify politically palatable ways to boost competitiveness as such its proposals may stand a better chance of adoption than previous and more sweeping calls for change some public companies such as berkshire hathaway inc and washington post co already decline to issue quarterly earnings guidance and the sec under mr cox is already studying the more flexible regulatory approach of its counterpart in britain the latest report urges policy makers to heed some recommendations of two previous studies one from a blue ribbon committee led by harvard university law professor hal scott and another commissioned by new york sen charles schumer and new york city mayor michael bloomberg but unlike some of the earlier studies the commissions report makes six fairly narrow recommendations that it says could be implemented within a year some of the recommendations would require congressional action but others could be acted on by regulators or corporate executives the six recommendations are changing the secs structure and approach to regulation giving the agency more authority to exempt certain companies from adhering to the sarbanes oxley corporate reform law promoting international discussion to prevent the type of litigation that led to the collapse of arthur andersen one of the nations biggest auditing firms eliminating quarterly earnings estimates making retirement savings accounts more easily available to workers and making those accounts more portable when workers change jobs "those six are relatively new important and doable " said robert pozen chairman of mfs investment management and a member of the commission the panel urged ceos to stop giving quarterly earnings guidance a move it says will divert attention from short term results and provide more room for long term thinking the panel cited a study that showed more than half of the ceos polled said they would delay starting a new project to meet a profit target in part to boost the flow of funds to u s markets the panel also recommended requiring all but the smallest companies that dont offer their workers retirement plans to arrange for their workers to invest through payroll deductions with a designated financial institution it also proposed consolidating various types of defined contribution retirement plans such as k s into one program to make them cheaper to process and easier for workers to take with them if they changed jobs the panel also called for reorganizing the sec so that it more closely "mirrors" the nations capital markets the sec currently has a division of market regulation that oversees broker dealers and exchanges the agencys investment management division oversees investment companies and advisers so there is some overlap between the two divisions the report also proposes creating three new divisions one to oversee market professionals another for markets exchanges and self regulatory organizations and a third for securities products such as derivatives and mutual funds in addition the chambers panel recommends shuttering the secs inspections division which examines brokerage firms and conducts broad market investigations and melding its function into the other divisions it says the advantage of such a structure would be more efficient and consistent guidance to the markets the report says that could be further enhanced by more frequent and informal communication between the sec staff and the securities industry the panel also recommended the secs office of international affairs be upgraded to a division allowing it to expand its staff and raise its profile it isnt clear how mr cox a republican and the four other sec commissioners will react to all of the recommendations they have each acknowledged the global picture has changed but agreeing on how to adapt might be more difficult though mr cox meets regularly with british regulators to study their rules and enforcement regime he has promised he wont allow the u s to forgo high standards which he says are the best means of attracting investors to the u s democrats and republicans have already conceded that at least one aspect of the sarbanes oxley law is too burdensome a rule that requires companies to review their own systems for ensuring accurate financial reports and then to have them tested by outside auditors while many groups have called for scaling back that requirement which the sec is doing the chambers panel urges congress to make the sarbanes oxley law part of the securities exchange act of that would give the sec the ability to exempt some constituents such as foreign firms or small business from the rule the commission also recommends that congress create the option of a federal charter for a limited number of large auditing firms and allow those firms to raise money from outside investors including private equity the commission says that might increase the capital available for the audit firms which could lead to the emergence of a fifth national accounting firm since arthur andersen collapsed in after being indicted in the enron scandal u s companies have been left with just four major auditing firms though some argue that cautious auditing is a good thing many businesses complain that sarbanes oxley andersens indictment and the risks of private lawsuits have made auditors too conservative to address the litigation risk the panel recommends the group of eight industrial nations sponsor backup insurance for the auditing profession and limit the ability to sue auditors in some circumstances if certain actions were performed in good faith see related letter "letters to the editor u s capital markets need regulatory relief" wsj march
