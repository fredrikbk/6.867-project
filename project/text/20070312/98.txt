your money matters a special report personal property heir pressure keeping a property in the family from generation to generation isnt easy here are some ways to make the numbers work homes can become family treasures passed down from generation to generation but the boon of inheriting such a property can quickly become a burden in the form of higher taxes and insurance costs cash poor heirs who must struggle to keep up with the extra expense often find themselves torn between preserving their family heritage and meeting other sometimes more pressing financial obligations "it isnt entirely a financial decision but whenever the financial part isnt working you cant have good memories there " says david hehman chief executive of escapehomes com a web site for people interested in second homes families can make the numbers work in a variety of ways from agreeing not to make further developments on the land to contesting the tax assessment but before examining such options it helps to step back and make an honest evaluation of the familys costs goals and future needs new york based elder care consultant marion somers says she too often sees clients struggling to keep a family property only to pass it down to children who would have been happier with cash "is it worth your energy to scrimp and save and do without to give a house to your kids " ms somers asks a home doesnt split easily when children are divvying up the assets and if no one lives near the property using it as a vacation home or rental may not be practical other people justify the costs by labeling the house as an "investment " without holding it to the same standards used to judge other investments daniel prebish vice president of estate planning and business services at financial services company a g edwards &amp sons inc st louis says the home should work with a persons risk tolerance cash flow needs and time horizon for instance if retirement is fast approaching a home that eats up precious disposable income may not work no matter how valuable it will be in the future families dont want to be forced to sell during a market trough because their forecasts werent realistic mr prebish says he suggests people ask themselves "if it werent for the fact that i inherited this place would i be spending x dollars to take care of it " an equally important question says new york based financial and tax adviser joel isaacson is how people would spend the money if it werent tied up in equity consider a &# million home that was purchased for &# and was worth &# when it was inherited two things happen to inherited property the cost basis for tax purposes jumps up to fair market value at the time of inheritance and the property immediately qualifies for the long term capital gains rate regardless of how long the beneficiary has owned it in this example someone in the highest tax bracket would pay only on a &# gain for a capital gains tax of &# on the &# million sale if the purchase price were used as the basis and the gain was &# the tax would be &# mr isaacson suggests determining whether theres a more attractive way to invest or spend the money often he says investors can do better with a different asset such as stocks "sometimes with home equity theres an opportunity cost " mr isaacson says if families crunch the numbers first theyll have more confidence when they act whether its to sell or look for creative ways to hold on perhaps the simplest way to reduce the cost of ownership is to contest the tax assessment between and of homes are overassessed says the national taxpayers union in washington d c in communities across the u s meanwhile property owners who file appeals seeking to lower their property taxes succeed to of the time according to data cited by the american homeowners association in stamford conn another way to lower an assessed value if the property includes at least several acres of land is a conservation easement a conservation easement usually obtained through a deal with a local land trust or government agency basically involves a donation or sale of the propertys development rights the property owner retains ownership of the land and its use while the trust or agency acts as an enforcer to ensure that the land will not be developed by its current or future owners for this to work the land needs to have some conservation value says jim wyerman communications director with the land trust alliance the washington d c based national association of land trusts landowners can qualify for an easement if the land is being preserved for public recreation or entertainment to protect wildlife or plants or to preserve open space for the publics scenic enjoyment mr wyerman says the land trust alliance will help interested property owners locate trusts in their area easements tend to lower assessments because the development rights are frequently what drive up a propertys value especially in a scenic or popular location but owners who want to preserve the option of selling their property should keep in mind that granting such easements can significantly lower resale value too before going ahead with an easement a key decision is whether to donate or sell the development rights in either case an easements value is determined by a professional land appraiser donations offer the possibility of significant income tax deductions in addition to lowering your assessment selling the rights meanwhile can yield a large amount of cash while earning a tax deduction as well this is known in the business as a bargain sale for example louis escobar a dairy farmer in portsmouth r i inherited the family farm after his mother died in the property had served as the escobar family home since and was worth about &# million when mr escobars mother passed away but it came saddled with property taxes and a &# million estate tax bill that mr escobar couldnt afford to pay unwilling to see his family land go to developers he put a conservation easement on acres of the acre property through a bargain sale an appraiser valued the development rights to the property at &# per acre mr escobar sold the rights to a land trust for &# an acre the strategy gave him a &# million check to cover his bills and a &# income tax deduction on the donation in the meantime mr escobar can continue to use all of the property for farming building corn mazes and holding agriculture classes current deductions for donating easements are set to expire at the end of but for now a landowner who makes a donation this year can take an income tax deduction for the gift of up to of adjusted gross income with a year carryforward for any unused deduction says boston based attorney stephen small author of the "preserving family lands" series the deduction for qualified farmers and ranchers can be as much as of adjusted gross income legislation has been proposed to make these benefits permanent if the legislation isnt passed however the deduction in for landowners and farmers will be reduced to with a five year carryforward as under the prior law if the homeowners prefer to meet their costs by eking out income from the home rather than lowering its appraised value they can try renting some properties in places such as marthas vineyard or cape cod in massachusetts can make enough during the summer to cover the carrying costs for the entire year and if the property is rented for two weeks or less the income doesnt have to be reported of course deductions cant be counted either renting isnt without risks guests could break family valuables or there may not be enough demand for the property often the homeowner will need to hire a professional real estate manager with the help of an attorney people can also try creative ownership agreements costs can be shared with another relative for example in exchange for partial ownership earl lee president of prudential real estate and relocation services a unit of newark n j based prudential financial inc says he reminds his clients that keeping a family property often comes with a personal price of either time or money "if you dont want to sacrifice " he says "sell the property " ms badal is a staff reporter for the wall street journal in south brunswick n j she can be reached at jaclyne badal wsj com corrections &amp amplifications land can qualify for a conservation easement if it is being preserved for public education among other things according to jim wyerman communications director with the land trust alliance in a march article in your money matters report mr wyerman incorrectly said entertainment rather than education wsj march
