style &amp substance taking the runway on the road fashion week goes on tour tickets sell for &# and up houston when supermodel naomi campbell strutted down the runway thursday night in a body hugging black zac posen cocktail dress the crowd went wild a year old fashion student seated in the front row snapped photos on her pink motorola razr phone and shrieked "oh my god i am dying " new york fashion week ended more than a month ago but you wouldnt have known it in houston where people turned out for the first of a series of events called fashionweeklive held in a giant tent outside philip johnsons landmark "water wall " the event featured the greatest hits from about designers new york shows in the audience were local customers and celebrities many of whom paid &# to &# to get in rather than manhattans invitation only events aimed at media and retail buyers organizer img is attempting to turn the fashion shows into a rock concert for mainstream fashion fans that marks a new business strategy for img the sports and talent management company that is already running industry focused fashion weeks in nine cities around the world and is launching two more in berlin and hong kong this year "we see consumers as the most important part of the fashion food chain because they are the ones who are ultimately buying the product " says fern mallis vice president of img fashion because only a limited number of cities in the world boast thriving fashion industries she adds "there are only so many fashion weeks you can do " img says it plans to operate fashionweeklive in at least cities around the world by if the event is a hit it could be a big win for img which was acquired by private investment firm forstmann little &amp co in the company which runs a large modeling agency also views fashionweeklive as a way to promote its talent only img models were featured on the runway but it remains to be seen whether fashionweeklive will translate as a consumer event img planned to hit four cities this time around but abruptly pulled the plug on chicago and dallas early this month citing problems such as a conflicting fashion event in dallas delays in getting clothes from designers and the demands of planning los angeles fashion week which begins march img says the dallas and chicago events have been postponed until next fall but neither has been definitively rescheduled "we may have underestimated how many people and how many hours it would take " ms mallis said img may also have overestimated how much money consumers are willing to pay to see an elaborate rehash of the new york shows it is charging a minimum of &# for a "gold" ticket and up to &# for a "diamond" ticket which includes front row seats and access to a vip lounge after the show in houston the house was full but only to of those in attendance paid for their tickets the rest of the tickets were distributed to sponsors and celebrities the price point determined via focus groups may be adjusted next season "its on our monday morning quarterback list " ms mallis says still img is optimistic the privately held company generates most of its revenue estimated by analysts at &# billion from producing televised sports programming managing athletes like tiger woods and licensing and consulting chuck bennett senior corporate vice president says fashionweeklive is analogous to imgs successful "stars on ice" tour which features olympic figure skaters performing for the public the event has grown to cities around the world since it began in the early s "weve done this before " mr bennett says the move to take fashion week on tour for the masses comes as the public has developed an appetite for behind the scenes information about the industry hit tv shows like "project runway " celebrity magazines like instyle and us weekly and blogs about fashion have all helped spur the publics interest mr bennett says he is trying to devise a way for fashionweeklive attendees to preorder looks from the runway featured designers view the event as a free marketing opportunity "its no different than having our outfits featured in a magazine " says bill blass chief executive michael groveman who agreed without hesitation to lend img a few looks from the fall show unlike in new york where bill blass paid img &# to use the main tent at bryant park plus additional fees for top models and production costs the label didnt pay anything to be included in the fashionweeklive event sponsors who helped img foot the bill also say the events hold promise "the whole idea of it was that this will reach consumers " says david suliteanu chief executive of sephora the beauty products retailer paid a significant sum to have its name plastered on the tents walls on invitations and in a beauty pavilion where the company gave free makeovers to attendees he declined to say how much sephora paid the company also donated beauty products for gift bags sent a celebrity makeup artist and had a blogger following some models around the tent "people are interested in real time news " he says moet &amp chandons participation was part of a yearlong deal with new york fashion week says erica kwei business director for the company moet provided champagne for a preshow cocktail party where uniformed waiters passed around chicken satay and shrimp with pico de gallo "img rolled it all into one proposal they are good negotiators " she says declining to discuss the deals value the houston runway presentation was designed to mimic a real new york production instead of hosting the event in a building img sought to hold the show in a huge tent so that it would feel like bryant park the event started half an hour late just like new york shows and img hired the well known producer kevin krier &amp associates which has staged shows for gucci yves saint laurent and tommy hilfiger but there were notable differences even beyond the high price of admission compared with new york where free tickets are distributed by designers who invite the press retail buyers and a sprinkling of celebrities the show itself lasted about minutes three times as long as the typical industry show the presentation was divided into consumer friendly vignettes like "day" and "evening " a mix of imgs star models jessica stam sasha pivovarova and gemma ward and some lesser known ones emerged to present about a dozen looks for each theme while the names of the designers appeared on a giant screen in the background at one point a donna karan evening gown blew open revealingly prompting laughter from the audience the runway itself which is feet long in new york was extended to feet "its true that everythings bigger in texas " says peter som the only designer who made an appearance on the runway in san francisco on thursday the featured designer will be calvin kleins francisco costa and unlike in new york where jaded fashion editors rush out of the tent at the end of a presentation the audience gave mr som and ms campbell a standing ovation "this is more fun" than a typical show says ms campbell in the front row were houston philanthropist becca cason thrash "project runway" winner chloe dao who owns a houston boutique and dikembe mutombo the foot center for the houston rockets "whenever theres something going on in town they like me to represent " says mr mutombo who received two free tickets to the event including one for his wife who he says loves fashion "i cannot wait to buy the clothes " says rachel brown a mother of five who bought two &# vip tickets and attended the show with her husband she was wearing an elaborate white taffeta dress by the new york design duo marchesa and after the show she said the event was well worth the money
