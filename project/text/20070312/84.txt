business day sign up for the e mail here halliburton is relocating its headquarters from houston to the persian gulf a move bound to be mocked by late night comics for the oil and defense companys political liabilities but one that seems much more a reflection of geographic shifts in the petroleum industry halliburtons plans announced by chairman and chief executive david lesar during a speech in the mideast financial hub of dubai caught the energy world the city of houston and members of congress by surprise the houston chronicle reports mr lesar who will be based in dubai a member of the united arab emirates said the new location will bolster the companys ability to compete in the middle east the far east and africa "the eastern hemisphere is a market that is more heavily weighted toward oil exploration and production opportunities and growing our business here will bring more balance to halliburtons overall portfolio " he said halliburton the no oil services company in the world said more than of its &# billion oil field services revenue in came from the east where of its employees are based halliburtons new chapter in the evolution of dubai as a greater center for trade regional investment and oil industry deals even as houston stays a western oil industry hub is yet another sign of what the wall street journal calls shifting alignments in the global oil order dubai puts the companys leadership closer to the regions national oil firms which more and more prefer dealing directly with oil services contractors rather than going through the multinational petro giants the times of london notes dubai has prospered by making itself a place where business executives from any part of the world can work comfortably and halliburton by focusing on dubai is expressing a need "to make up ground lost in recent years to western rivals and increasingly ambitious chinese oil field service companies " the journal says halliburton currently gets of its oil field service operating income from the mature fields of north america at a time when industry growth is mostly occurring elsewhere and fourth quarter decline in halliburtons profit amplified concerns about a drilling slowdown the journal notes halliburton will keep its legal registration and even its chief operating officer and finance chief in the u s meaning its legal and regulatory obligations arent changing much but the companys prominence during the current bush presidency as the biggest government contractor in iraq and the corporate home of vice president dick cheney between bush administrations is likely to increase scrutiny of the headquarters transition rep henry waxman a longtime democratic critic of halliburton and now chairman of the house committee on oversight and government reform called for hearings on the move and said he wants "to understand the ramifications for u s taxpayers and national security " as the los angeles times reports halliburton has taken

war related waste and overcharging halliburton is also under investigation by the justice department and securities and exchange commission for deals with kuwait and nigeria the company asked by the new york times declined to elaborate on what the move would mean for its military contracts or for the legal questions it faces more regulatory alarm from corporate america halliburtons move may be interpreted by some as a blow to the u s petroleum industry but the fear of overseas defections is much more rampant on wall street charles prince chief executive of citigroup recently bemoaned the
