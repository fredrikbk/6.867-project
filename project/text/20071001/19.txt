dollar lifts exporters blunting housing bust foreign clients buoy hotels manufacturers splurging at tiffanys pitcairn pa gary bence sees the impact of a weaker u s dollar every time he wheels his truck into the sprawling rail terminal in this gritty pittsburgh suburb as a driver for agx intermodal which hauls containers for local companies here the year old has seen a surge in recent months of boxes filled with locally made products headed to customers overseas of about loads he handles each week are for export he estimates including a shipment of mineral oil bound for bolivia that he dispatched earlier in the day "i was in the scrap business for years and we exported nothing and now we in the region export a lot " he says just before he climbs into the cab of a mack truck pulling a gray foot container and kicks up a cloud of dust on his way out mr bence is one of the people benefiting from one of the few bright spots in a slowing u s economy while a weaker dollar hurts consumers by raising the price of imported goods it also is helping the economy stave off a deeper slowdown by making u s exports more competitive and influencing more foreigners to visit disney world or the statue of liberty yet currency rates are so intertwined with other crosscurrents in the economy that the impact varies from one individual or company to another even within the same business someone who works for a company that relies heavily on foreign trade or a hotel catering to european visitors might get a plump raise or avoid a layoff because of the weaker greenback an employee of a hotel getting less foreign business or one whose company has lots of foreign hotels catering to american tourists may fare worse if the dollar falls too far and too fast it could spur a run up in interest rates and shake the stock market which would be bad for the economy a rapidly falling dollar would raise the price of imports stoking inflation and in an extreme case could prompt foreign investors to dump u s bonds pushing their yields higher but as long as the dollars decline is gradual most economists see it as a modest plus overall joshua feinman chief economist at deutsche asset management wrote in a recent note to investors that the export upswing is one of the factors "poised to help cushion the impact of the housing correction " real exports have grown faster than real imports for nearly two years notes mr feinman and he expects this trend to continue u s exports rose to a record &# billion in july according to the commerce department mr feinman estimates stronger exports have contributed a half percentage point of added growth to gross domestic product since how this all plays out at u s companies depends greatly on where they have their operations at a time when many have been moving them out of the u s to lower costs though the general shift of production to low cost countries is unlikely to halt some companies are giving more consideration to the u s for instance at joplin mo based eaglepicher technologies llc the dollars slide has raised questions about the future of the companys big canadian plant where it produces batteries for military radios when eaglepicher bought the facility in the canadian dollar was worth u s cents "i was part of the transition team that bought that plant " says the companys president steven westfall "i never thought the u s and canadian dollars would come close to par especially not in just seven years " the company will decide in the next several weeks whether to move the production to the u s he says in the meantime eaglepichers business in europe is booming with requests for bids up nearly since the beginning of this summer stihl inc the u s subsidiary of german chain saw maker andreas stihl ag &amp co kg recently opened a small addition to its huge factory complex in virginia beach va partly for currency reasons "its a classic good news bad news scenario " says president fred whyte the price stihl pays to import materials and components has gone up but exports of its u s made finished goods have surged and stihl now exports half its u s production to other countries up from five years ago "so what you lose on the apples you kind of make up on the oranges " says mr whyte many companies that produce for u s domestic consumption rather than export note that the weaker dollar has given them an edge against foreign competitors too particularly those based in europe one such company is romweber co a maker of high end wooden furniture in batesville ind not long ago the u s furniture manufacturing sector was in a free fall as domestic manufacturers shuttered factories and shifted work outside the u s especially to china business also migrated to canada which has abundant wood supplies and a thriving furniture sector but over the past two months romweber has seen a surge of business from distributors looking for alternatives to factories in canada and other countries that have seen their currencies appreciate against the dollar "right now were seeing retailers trying to source product that has been coming out of italy and europe and canada because of the cost of it " says bruce rippe president of the company he wont disclose sales at his family owned business but he notes that sales have virtually recovered all of the falloff the business had seen since when there was a clear acceleration in business moving out of the u s the furniture business is a good example of why its difficult to separate the influence of a weaker dollar from other forces at work in global industries many u s retailers wary of the slowdown in domestic consumer spending have cut inventories that already has prompted many of them to reconsider the long supply lines involved in ordering from overseas which require them to hold larger stocks thus increasing their appetite for domestic supply even if the dollar wasnt cheap at the same time the remaining domestic furniture producers have revamped their operations to make themselves better able to respond more quickly to orders making them more attractive to retailers than in the past visits by foreign tourists to u s theme parks and other attractions are up which means more bookings for hotels restaurants and rental cars the convention bureau in orlando fla forecasts a increase in foreign visitors this year compared with tiffany &amp co recently cited free spending foreign tourists as a factor in the jump in sales at its flagship new york store in the second quarter the head of the worlds largest public auction for thoroughbred horses keeneland association inc in lexington ky says european participation surged this year for the same reason "there were more europeans here and they spent more " says nick nicholson keenelands president "i kept hearing from them i feel like im getting a discount because theyre constantly translating everything they spend back into euros " the same dynamic is encouraging foreigners to snap up u s real estate and other assets one example the recent bid by the stock exchange in dubai for a sizable stake in the nasdaq stock market in new york nariman behravesh chief economist at global insight an economic forecasting and consulting firm in lexington mass says "were going to see a continuing wave of foreign money flowing in to buy u s factories and companies because u s assets are viewed as a bargain " to be sure there are big downsides to a weaker dollar it makes foreign travel pricier for americans and drives up the cost of german beer and canadian lumber it also pushes up the price of commodities many of which are denominated in dollars as the producers of those materials raise prices to offset their loss of buying power that in turn could trigger more inflation many multinationals have built factories all over the world at least in part to help insulate themselves from the ebb and flow of currencies their goal is to make most things in the region where they will be sold allowing them to calculate production costs and their sales prices in the local currency but that doesnt work for every company instead many try to cut costs by concentrating production of certain items in one or two locations then ship to the rest of the world from those places thats what terex corp does as one of the worlds largest producers of construction equipment it has a big factory in europe that specializes in mini excavators which has been badly hurt by the slide of the dollar meanwhile the companys factory in the u s making aerial work platforms has had to double its employment to people in part to meet surging overseas demand for its products particularly from europe "thats why for us the dollar is not a particularly good thing " says ronald defeo chief executive of the westport conn based company "if youre a global manufacturer what you hate is currency volatility " because it makes long term planning harder and can suddenly turn a profitable factory into an albatross david dalquist represents the other extreme as chief executive of family run northland aluminum products inc which produces all its nordic ware line of bakeware at one factory in minneapolis he loves whats happening he expects his companys exports will be up this year and the surge of new foreign business is helping smooth some of the peaks and valleys in his production in the u s baking is a seasonal activity he notes with most occurring between halloween and christmas "exports are making it possible for me to keep more people working year round " he says because foreign demand is more consistent and takes up slack during the periods when u s demand drops off the low point of his headcount this year he notes was about workers about higher than in the past at its peak the company employs the weaker dollar may also be helping to make him more competitive against the chinese he says although that element is difficult to measure a weaker dollar tends to drive up the global cost of raw materials such as copper and steel which hurts manufacturers on both sides of the pacific but compared with a chinese producer a far smaller portion of northlands total costs are the raw materials because labor costs are higher in the u s so the same increase in raw materials has a relatively bigger impact on the chinese he says "though theyre still ferociously competitive " one question now is whether the dollars slide will remain gradual a j p morgan index comparing the dollar with a basket of currencies weighted by their importance to u s trade is near a year low canadas dollar recently hit parity with its u s counterpart for the first time since which is why disney recently ran ads north of the border urging canadians to "enjoy the magic" of a strong currency by traveling to florida how this plays out also depends on what happens in the rest of the world at the moment strong foreign economies are soaking up u s made goods but if key economies such as europe or china stumble the weaker dollar wont make much difference meanwhile foreign producers may hold down their u s prices despite the weaker dollar giving up some profits to keep up their market share especially in consumer goods that may lessen the pain for consumers but also reduce the advantage for u s manufacturers germanys bmw ag for instance has reported declining profit margins in large part because of the weaker dollar the car maker hasnt hiked prices but recently announced a series of moves to blunt the impact including an increase in its output of vehicles in the u s dan ariens president of ariens co a brillion wis based maker of lawn mowers and snow blowers says he isnt benefiting much from the dollars weakness versus the euro instead his european distributors are ariens sells to them at prices fixed in dollars so they are the ones who see their margins growing mr ariens says he doesnt mind since many distributors use that fatter profit to do promotions that expand sales the situation is different in canada he notes where arienss wholesale prices are fixed to the canadian dollar people like james mallon are seeing yet another dimension to the falling dollar the year old native of ottawa who now lives in ann arbor mich says hes gotten a flurry of phone calls in the past few weeks from friends in canada who want to stay with him for weekend shopping excursions several asked him to accept mail order shipments including a surfboard cookware and bicycle parts that theyll pick up in the future "i feel richer for my friends " he says "but poorer " mr mallon an engineering consultant who specializes in ergonomics has his student loans in canadian dollars that now cost more to pay back and a loan of c&# that he took from his parents to buy his house in has suddenly grown far more onerous "when i took out that loan it was the equivalent of &# u s but now i owe them &# " kris maher contributed to
