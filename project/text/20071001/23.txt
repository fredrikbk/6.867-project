family business to sell or not to sell it is a question that can tear families apart but if done right it doesnt have to the toughest moment for the owners of a family business may be deciding whether to kiss it goodbye the decision often means weighing concerns about the livelihoods of family members a departed parents legacy and the emotional baggage that entails or the familys very identity and sense of purpose some family members may want to invest and work hard to develop the business while others may want to liquidate and relax older family members may want to defend their legacy or perhaps let go and retire younger members may want to try their hand at running the show or to cash out and invest the money elsewhere the competing agendas can create significant strife especially if many people and multiple generations are involved yet experts say if a family is well prepared is realistic about its options and gets the timing right the process can produce a solution that works for everyone and ultimately may even enhance family harmony "for the owner of a family business its not just a financial asset its a heritage its a culture its status in the community " says francois m de visscher founder and president of family business financial services specialist de visscher &amp co greenwich conn "the decision to sell is always a very difficult decision and that decision needs to be reached on the basis of a sound evaluation of the alternatives and has to be based on trust among the family members and information and communication " while the impetus for a sale often comes from within the family a growing number of families are likely to have this decision thrust on them globalization is driving companies to get bigger and more efficient to compete fueling strategic buying sprees and industry consolidation meanwhile the private equity industry is showing increased interest in family concerns which often have the kind of untapped potential these firms look for and tend to have low debt profiles that make for particularly attractive investments in todays tough credit environment one crucial consideration for families thinking about selling is timing experts on family businesses say would they get a better price if they spent some time sprucing up the business or is now the time to sell problems or not because a changing competitive landscape

unity the yanco family was tested by a surprise offer from hess corp in for the four gas stations they owned as part of their peabody mass business glenn yanco had approached hess to ask about gasoline prices thinking he might switch suppliers when the overture came he asked the advice of his father then in semiretirement who had started the business in "he didnt want to break up a business that the family was in for so many years " mr yanco says but his father ultimately agreed that the business environment made a sale the right choice the gas stations profit margins were getting

for the familys surviving business stadium oil heat inc which delivers heating oil and other products in a few dozen towns north of boston but in a bigger company with more family members involved being unprepared for an offer can have a more lasting impact mr de visscher the adviser recommends that larger family businesses set up governance structures to help manage the process of considering any offers that structure might be a family council with representatives from each branch or a family run office with a staff that oversees all family investments whatever the structure he says it should be separate from the companys board whose goals may not be the same as those of the family "its separating the business of the family from the family business " he says of course a sober look at a companys operations including its strengths and weaknesses opportunities and obstacles is vital to making a wise decision on whether to sell a business to keep that assessment objective an outside adviser may be helpful at fostoria plumbing heating &amp electrical supply co in fostoria ohio disagreements over how to run the business had escalated into bitter arguments among six siblings who own the company in an effort to end the discord one of the siblings michael reinhardt head of operations brought in a consulting firm strategic business partners llc of arlington heights ill last year to study the company and make recommendations on how to proceed including the possibility of selling the business the idea was "lets see what someone else thinks of the business " says elizabeth cook mr reinhardts sister and the companys financial chief "do we even have something worth selling " the consultants found the company was on the right track but in need of a slew of changes including upgraded computer and accounting systems and more advantageous purchasing agreements mr reinhardt ms cook and another sister wanted to hold on to the company and implement strategic business partners suggestions ms cook says three other sisters chose to sell their stakes to the company that buyout is still being negotiated in this case though achieving a decision on the companys fate wasnt enough to keep the family together now focused on the same goal "mike and marge and i are getting along great" and the business is getting stronger says ms cook but "our sisters who have left the business wont talk to us " one of the three sisters who are selling their stakes declined to comment the other two couldnt be reached there are still other options for families that want to step back from the business without getting out entirely such as finding a buyer perhaps in private equity that would keep family members on and agree to some continued family ownership ms cook says thats a route she and her siblings might go when they get older and want to slow down and if a family wants to make an exit but isnt comfortable with an initial suitor it can enlist investment bankers or business brokers to try to drum up a buyer it can live with "at the end of the day its their company and its their decision who to sell to " says ross m posner associate director of allstate
