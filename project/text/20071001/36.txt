internet tax revolt it turns out there may be an exception to congresss otherwise unbridled passion for higher taxes a rebellion late last week in the senate means that a permanent ban on internet taxes could still make it to president bushs desk this year the ban on internet access taxes and other web only taxes is due to expire november so congress needs to act fast moratorium foes had tried to enact a watered down version of the ban that might have opened the door to new taxes a four year extension authored by democrat tom carper of delaware and republican lamar alexander of tennessee was scheduled for markup last week the duo want a bill that would allow states and localities to tax the component parts of internet access service even while claiming that the assembled product was tax free moments before this consumer unfriendly bill was to be considered last thursday however chairman daniel inouye abruptly cancelled the markup pro internet lawmakers led by oregon democrat ron wyden and new hampshire republican john sununu had assembled the votes to replace mr carpers pseudo moratorium with their strong permanent tax ban if mr inouye keeps trying to push the phony moratorium mr wyden tells us that he now believes he can move the real deal through the finance committee which also enjoys jurisdiction the wyden sununu permanent ban would give investors a strong incentive to fund broadband investment that will empower consumers with a faster internet even the most backward people on the planet recognize the power that the internet gives to individuals burmas dictators quickly cut off consumer internet access during their violent crackdown america now has million internet users and letting state and local politicians impose multiple taxes will only slow its growth the antitax forces deserve support from senate leaders as well as from the white house see related letter "letters to the editor internet bill wont open the door to new taxes" wsj oct
