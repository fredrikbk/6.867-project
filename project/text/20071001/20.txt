energy agencies spar over jurisdiction limits washington the two u s government agencies responsible for oversight of energy markets are at odds over the limits of their jurisdiction according to federal court filings posted friday in question is whether the federal energy regulatory commission which normally oversees physical markets has jurisdiction over futures markets when manipulation there affects physical contract prices or if that is the exclusive domain of the commodity futures trading commission lawmakers fear the judge in the case may curtail oversight by the ferc and may weaken surveillance of the physical and futures energy markets the cftc defended its right to exclusive jurisdiction in futures markets while ferc said the energy policy act of had granted it new powers to penalize market manipulations the cftc in july filed a case against amaranth advisors llc in connection with alleged manipulation of futures markets ferc filed a similar suit against the mutual fund firm saying amaranths alleged manipulation of futures markets affected the physical market in the cftc case amaranth filed for an injunction against fercs case proceeding arguing that the cftc has exclusive jurisdiction over futures markets both the cftc and ferc are in agreement that the federal court judge in the cftc case should let the ferc case go ahead and shouldnt rule on fercs jurisdiction "amaranths motion is not proper because this request is merely a thinly veiled attempt to forum shop for a favorable ruling on the jurisdictional issue " the cftc said in its filing it argued the judge cant grant an injunction against a party in another case outside his courts jurisdiction ferc the cftc said "should be permitted to determine the scope of its new antimanipulation authority in light of the pre existing statutory grant of exclusive jurisdiction over futures trading to the cftc in the commodity exchange act " but because the federal judge said the exclusive jurisdiction issue "should be addressed " the cftc used much of its briefing to argue its congressionally mandated authority to have exclusive jurisdiction over the futures markets "the plain language of the law vests the cftc with sole power and authority among federal regulatory agencies to adjudicate the lawfulness of futures trading on designated contract markets such as the nymex " the cftc said ferc in its filing said the cftc doesnt have "exclusive" jurisdiction over manipulation of physical sales of natural gas involving natural gas futures it said that because manipulation of the natural gas futures contract settlement price has a "direct and substantial effect on the prices used for huge quantities of physical natural gas " it also can file enforcement cases
