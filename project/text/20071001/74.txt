of the americas financing group at goldman sachs group inc investors qualms about the credit quality of buyout deals and the balance sheets of financial institutions also created openings for other corporate issuers among the quarters largest bond sales according to dealogic which tracks new issues were &# billion for astrazeneca plc for an acquisition &# billion for general electric co s
