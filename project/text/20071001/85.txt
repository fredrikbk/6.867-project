small business a special report rules of engagement why employers should and increasingly do care about creating a great workplace when i first started writing a column on workplace issues for this newspaper years ago the company executives who spent much time thinking about workplace quality could have met in a phone booth who cares that was the private response of many managers at companies big and small to the idea of engaging workers hearts and minds most saw little relationship between employee attitudes and the bottom line now that viewpoint is almost as out of date as the phone booth executives vie for positions on best workplace lists as was apparent in the number of nominations this paper received for its top small workplace awards they lure new recruits by pledging their devotion to work family balance and they boast to wall street investors and analysts about their "employee engagement" the buzz phrase for a level of worker commitment so strong that employees voluntarily invest extra effort on the job whats more a growing body of research is finally proving what advocates of workplace quality have known for decades that the human beings who execute the goals of business are more than just cogs in a wheel truly engaging them can have an almost magical effect on the bottom line ive seen this time and time again in my coverage of work life issues when i started the work &amp family column in the chinese wall between work and personal life loomed large in most workplaces workers were expected to leave their personal lives family issues and feelings at home the concept of making workers motivated and satisfied seemed almost quaint but the few pioneering employers that bucked this pattern quickly saw that paying attention to workers well being bore business benefits by the mid s xerox corp was already trying to engage workers in some units through flexible scheduling in a radical move an executive in xeroxs dallas operations announced all of his employees would be allowed to set their own hours freed to better balance their lives employees delivered improved customer service and a one third reduction in costly absences its no accident that anne mulcahy who led many workplace quality initiatives as xeroxs former chief staff officer was elevated to ceo at xerox in and subsequently oversaw one of the most remarkable corporate turnarounds in recent history "my priorities " she said in an interview last year "were always customer and employee priorities " the mechanism at work is simple the rigid controlling workplaces of the past left employees no flexibility to manage family or personal problems or the day to day demands of running a household over time those unmet personal needs erode concentration commitment and creativity on the job good workplace policies on the other hand enable employees to manage their larger lives freeing them to apply more brainpower to complex information age jobs satisfied employees treat customers better creating loyal customers beyond that good policies also foster the kind of on the job relationships with bosses and co workers that inspire employees to soar this isnt just touchy feely feel good fluff over the years ive seen it happen repeatedly real change in the workplace leads to real satisfaction among employees leads to real money for the company swimming against the tide in for instance first horizon national corp formerly first tennessee national saw this dynamic at work when it offered some employees who produce bank statements an occasional day off for doctors appointments and other needs in return the company asked them to work longer days during the busiest times of the month employees responded by halving the total time needed to produce the statements to four days from eight and customer satisfaction "went through the roof " a first tennessee executive said ralph horn the companys ceo at the time called such work life initiatives a "driving force" behind the companys quality improvement efforts employees who feel respected tend to enrich the lives of all those around them acuity an employee property casualty insurer in sheboygan wis set about overhauling its rigid factory like workplace policies in in a conscious effort to "build an environment that was just a wonderful place to work " a new ceo ben salzmann added flextime and a fitness facility and improved training benefits and merit raises executives stepped up face time with the rank and file meeting workers at the door quarterly to hand out free breakfast and holding town hall meetings and small group lunches acuity also began publicly rewarding performance standouts and e mailing periodic audio files by mr salzmann sharing industry gossip and insights that wholehearted management support for employees was one reason tom mcdermott a brookfield wis claims representative returned to acuity in after quitting the company years earlier to work for a competitor its also one reason he went the extra mile last year when he encountered two clients an elderly couple and their two grandchildren "sitting on a curb with cents in their pocket" one saturday morning after their house with all their possessions burned down he says instead of making them wait for processing of their claim the next week mr mcdermott walked to a nearby atm and took &# out of his personal savings account "to get you through" the weekend he told the couple the gesture drew grateful mail from the clients that became bulletin board fodder at acuitys headquarters wheres the real money in all this acuitys voluntary turnover plunged and sales per employee soared after the company abandoned its rigid factory like workplace amid mounting anecdotal evidence of the bottom line benefits of employee well being researchers undertook systematic attempts to show a linkage between employee engagement and above average customer service sales and profit after all critics said correlation isnt the same as causality employees at more profitable companies would naturally be happier and more engaged so in hewitt associates lincolnshire ill tracked about companies over five years and found that increases in employee engagement clearly preceded improvements in financial performance even among companies with below average profit an upturn in employee attitudes tended to precede a profit turnaround separately a three year study of employers by towers perrin isr a unit of towers perrin stamford conn found companies that worked consistently on engaging their employees posted a increase in operating profit over a three year period while companies with poorly engaged employees saw a decline says patrick kulesa towers perrin isrs global research director the results show "the remarkable ability of an engaged work force to impact a companys bottom line " wrapping up these and other studies the conference board new york a nonprofit business research group said in a study last year that theres "clear and mounting evidence that employee engagement is strongly correlated to" productivity profit and revenue growth the hewitt study in particular the conference board said "gives credence to the assumption that employee engagement actually causes an increase in a companys overall financial performance " of course anne mulcahy ralph horn ben salzmann and other ceos like them didnt need a study to see that the evidence was all around them ms shellenbarger is the wall street journals work &amp family columnist she can be reached at sue
