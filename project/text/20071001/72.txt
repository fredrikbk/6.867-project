public discourse lacking in reason and civility in reaction to your sept editorial "demon rummy" the orwellian spectacle surrounding the speech of mahmoud ahmadinejad at columbia and the invective directed toward donald rumsfeld at stanford are hardly surprising to those of us who have watched in utter disbelief the steady erosion of reason perspective logic and civility in public discourse for columbia to cloak itself as a defender of free speech and for stanford faculty member philip zimbardo to describe members of the hoover institute as fascists is so over the top that it defies any kind of reasonable response even a cursory examination of contemporary media curricula and pedagogies in schools and universities and the deliberations in both public and private sectors shows how deeply entrenched a problem we have how corroded the pillars that hold us up as a civilized society have become and how desperate the need is for courageous and transformational leadership at all levels of our society it is a problem that would have turned ronald reagan into a pessimist kumar chittipeddi seminole fla i applaud the protests at stanford greeting the potential appointment of donald rumsfeld to a fellowship at the hoover institution and condoleezza rice for that matter if for nothing else than the debate it allows to equate the columbia invitation to mahmoud ahmadinejad with its attendant protest and appropriate challenges on the dais with a longer term academic appointment for mr rumsfeld is in my mind misguided greg stern san francisco see related letter "letters to the editor its absurd to compare rumsfeld ahmadinejad" wsj october
