boss talk how chief beer taster blended molson coors with wine liquor and small batch "craft" beers snatching u s market share from mainstream brewers leo kiely is in a tough spot yet the chief executive of molson coors brewing co has managed to increase sales and profit by deploying simple marketing strategies and slashing costs molson coors the third largest u s brewer by sales positions its flagship brand coors light as "the worlds most refreshing beer " and touts the "smooth" taste of keystone light its main discount brand it also boasts a fast growing craft style beer of its own blue moon now the company is creating a new subsidiary ac golden brewing co to develop other upscale beers but at a deliberate pace so it can minimize risk every move counts because with only about of the u s beer market molson coors has fewer dollars to spend pitching its brands than larger rivals anheuser busch cos and miller brewing co mr kiely years old has boosted molson coorss share price by since the company was created by the merger of colorados adolph coors co and canadas molson inc in contrast shares of anheuser busch which controls nearly half the u s beer market are up over the period mr kiely is on pace to wring about &# million in cost savings from the merger still molson coors faces challenges it primarily operates in three mature beer markets the u s canada and the united kingdom mr kiely who rides harley davidson motorcycles through the rocky mountains on weekends joined coors in after stints at pepsico inc s frito lay and procter &amp gamble co in an interview at molson coorss u s headquarters in denver he discussed topics ranging from how drinkers have changed to how he went about blending molson with coors excerpts wsj how have american beer tastes been changing mr kiely whats probably changed the most in a generation is the variety seeking nature of todays beer drinker i sort of grew up as a beer drinker in the late s early s and my brand set was an import heineken and a domestic brand schlitz today i watch a beer drinker in his late s and hell have an import brand maybe two he enjoys hell have a craft brew brand and the bulk of his beer drinking will still be a light lager wsj someone mentioned that you felt the craft beer craze has been good for the beer business overall is that right mr kiely it goes back to consumers if consumers are interested in beer well find our way to get our fair share i think the craft brews bring a really important interest among beer drinkers in how beers made why beers special i am astounded with how curious consumers are about beer the process of beer and lots of guys like to try to make their own beer wsj what beers do you like these days mr kiely i have one of the great enviable positions chief beer taster in my fridge i have coors light killians blue moon and molson canadian all molson coors products and i probably got a coors banquet in there too wsj what were your favorites before you joined the company mr kiely when i lived in dallas in the s coors light became my favorite brand it was the most popular beer in town prior to that in chicago i was an old style drinker it was the thing to do in chicago wsj your first job was mowing grass in a cemetery during high school what did you learn from that mr kiely i worked with a bunch of career guys who did that for their whole life and relating to them became an important thing to me i enjoyed it i liked them i learned that you really need to value all kinds of people wsj whats your management style mr kiely it really crystallizes in "people make it happen " the job of a leader is to set the horizon set a big hairy audacious goal and then staff the company with leadership that will align against that turn the team loose and let them play its all about talent somebody said "people are your most important asset " i would say your best people are your most important asset but youre constantly looking to upgrade that talent pool wsj you came from outside the beer industry whats been the best place for you to find talent mr kiely by and large even with all the people weve brought in from the outside the best way to bring talent is through your own organization one reason im real proud of my leadership team is that theyve been big proponents of what we call a general management development program picking out a cadre of our best young leaders every year and really investing aggressively at helping them broaden their capabilities wsj molson and coors are two old companies with strong cultures how did you approach folding them together mr kiely no is get people to work beers a local business investing in those local teams with the responsibility for their markets and having them focus on the business while we did the transition stuff was really important the functions that make and sell and ship beer were largely untouched in the merger because our businesses by market didnt have that much overlap no was celebrating what we had in common these are companies with great family heritage and theyre companies that really have a lot of passion for beer wsj how are you positioning the company to succeed in the new environment mr kiely i think to be a successful global brewer today you have to be really good at portfolio selling having a strong portfolio of local brands augmented by a big potential global brand like coors light is really the formula to success looking forward we have a great brand in coors light were on the verge of being a truly global brand its grown virtually in every market weve got it in right now we aspire long term to be one of the premier global beer companies wsj can beer start to take back market share from wine and spirits in the u s mr kiely i think beer is very viable when you head into the future you look at it as the alcoholic beverage of moderation beer is growing like crazy in russia right now because theyre looking to be able to be more in control i think these things go in very long cycles wsj why does the company need a new subsidiary to develop high end brews mr kiely we see enormous potential in beer especially for strong brands historically national brand launches in the u s have cost the major brewers millions of dollars and more than of them fail pete coors kept saying there had to be a better way to do this and so he came up with the concept for ac golden brewing this gives us added flexibility and agility and another way to get innovative ideas to market without redirecting critical resources from our core brands we feel this gives us a real competitive advantage as a brand builder in the beer business ac golden will focus on patiently introducing a new brand and allowing it to grow over time look we introduced blue moon years ago and today it is one of the fastest growing craft style beers we like to call it our year overnight success story wsj would you consider an acquisition to get bigger globally mr kiely sure we expect the beer business to continue to consolidate and one of the stated purposes of the merger was to be able to participate in that in the long haul people say "well whats next " whats next is to be ready when the next opportunity comes up and to be running your core businesses well and have a global brand that builds your reputation people look at coors light today and theyre very interested in having an american style beer in their portfolio and they know coors light is a very strong brand we have a dialogue with many many of the worlds brewers wsj theres been a lot of speculation that molson coors might eventually be acquired by sabmiller plc whose u s arm has about twice your companys market share can you address that mr kiely i learned a long time ago that speculating about any of the rumors that come up in the beer business is a fools errand wsj do you think about business when youre on your harley mr kiely whats great about bike riding is you forget about everything else because when you ride a bike youre paying attention this is serious sport it takes your mind to a different place when youre on a motorcycle nobody can talk to you nobody can have a meeting with you
