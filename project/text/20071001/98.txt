monday in october is here and with it a new chance to judge the ideological direction of a u s supreme court that took a decided turn to the right in its last term the new terms docket bolstered almost a week ago with the acceptance of an additional cases has no shortage of polarizing cases as the new york times notes in the last term the courts four relative liberals republican appointed john paul stevens and david souter and ruth bader ginsburg and stephen breyer both appointed by president clinton took to sometimes reading their dissenting opinions from the bench in hope of drawing attention to how the conservative majority "swept aside precedents or skeptically treated individual rights " the wall street journal says at the same time the five conservatives chief justice john roberts antonin scalia anthony kennedy clarence thomas and samuel alito offered no cohesive approach justices scalia and thomas "the most doctrinaire in their method of legal interpretation sought to reverse outright precedents they disliked " while chief justice roberts and justice alito "took a more nuanced approach narrowing those precedents while leaving them on the books " the journal says "justice kennedy the maverick conservative cast his tiebreaking votes rightward while leaving liberals a glimmer of hope in such contentious issues as abortion rights racial integration and student expression " the paper notes in the courts record number of decisions justice kennedy was the only member of the court to always vote with the majority the washington post points out a record that prompted solicitor general paul clement to remark this summer that the court "is going to be about as conservative or about as liberal as justice kennedy " mr kennedy will probably get to cast the deciding vote in a host of so called litmus test cases this fall and most prominent among them could be the courts revisiting of detainee rights at guantanamo bay a pre roberts pre alito slate of justices three years ago said that u s law and specifically habeas corpus provisions treated detainees at the american base in cuba the same as anyone else on american territory which seemed to suggest detainees could appeal their detentions in u s courts but the bush administration chose a different interpretation and the republican controlled congress last year passed a law declaring foreign born enemy combatants to be without habeas corpus rights as the los angeles times recalls the constitution says "the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended" except during times of "rebellion or invasion " and the court has been asked by critics of the law to overrule the executive and legislative branches last april the court declined to hear two relevant appeals but changed its mind a day after the term ended an action without modern precedent the n y times notes among the other upcoming litmus tests legal times says are virginia v moore looking at the virginia supreme courts invalidation of a drug conviction because the evidence was obtained during an improper police search baze v rees which challenges the use of allegedly excruciating lethal injections in executions as possible violations of the eighth amendments ban on cruel and unusual punishment and crawford v marion county election board a challenge to an indiana law that requires voters to present a government issued photo id at polling places which democrats consider an illegal move to suppress minority voting "all thats missing now " legal times says "is an abortion case "
