mergers and acquisitions market culminating in a last deal heavy splurge in july between and sept there were &# trillion of transactions the biggest stretch of deal making in history even when adjusted for inflation how hot has this market been even including the steep drop off in deal making during august and september the years first nine months have made the busiest year ever for mergers and acquisitions the period produced some &# trillion in transactions slightly surpassing the full year figure outpacing by more than and by nearly according to thomson financial yet those distinctions dont reveal the most important aspect of the latest quarter the complete falloff in the deals market as credit dried up in response to a broad repricing of risk by credit investors even as the stock market recovered from its august lows to post solid gains august and september registered some of the weakest deal totals since november public corporations and private buyers hatched some &# billion of transactions world wide during july thomson financial said that slid precipitously to &# billion in august and an even scantier &# billion in september for a total &# billion in the quarter the drop off in the worlds leading m&amp a marketplace the u s was even more severe with &# billion in deals in september about one fifth to one third of monthly volumes earlier in the year "the m&amp a markets are substantially on hold for the moment " said joseph frumkin an attorney at new york law firm sullivan &amp cromwell llp "thats part of the cycle of m&amp a life " mr frumkin said he expects non u s companies to take advantage of a weakened u s dollar and acquire a few domestic targets creating a reasonable level of m&amp a next year akin to the levels last seen in a deutsche bank analysis projects that at current rates total deal volume next year will be roughly equivalent to about &# trillion of transactions around the globe the list of the biggest deals in the latest quarter demonstrates how activity has tapered off leading the list is rio tinto plcs &# billion acquisition of canadas alcan inc other large transactions include blackstone group lps &# billion purchase of hilton hotels corp and basell holdings nvs acquisition of chemicals maker lyondell chemical co for about &# billion each of these transactions was announced in july of the quarters top transactions tracked by thomson financial were announced that month two were announced in august and four in september the largest signed transaction since august was the &# billion purchase of korea exchange bank by hsbc holdings plc struck in early september the largest u s deal since the start of august was the &# billion purchase of financial firm checkfree corp by fiserv inc aug the biggest change in the latest quarter was the retreat of private equity players after nearly ruling the m&amp a marketplace during the past months they have largely pulled out the reason they are struggling to complete their existing deals a pipeline of &# billion or more awaiting financing banks that once were willing to lend to these buyers arent funding more deals until they can clear this load off their books during the first seven months of each month posted an average of &# billion of private equity transactions that amount sank to just below &# billion in august and around &# billion in september the total for the quarter was below the previous years period this is shaking up the m&amp a market creating an opportunity for some corporations that have been outbid by private equity firms fueled by cheap and plentiful credit "that era is over for the private equity players " said stefan selig vice chairman at bank of america corp "but its not the end of the m&amp a business the fundamental drivers of m&amp a for the last years havent changed " adds london based piero novelli global mergers chief for ubs ag "overall there is a slowdown the m&amp a market is just like the equity markets in that its very linked to overall psychology but from what we see at the moment i think it will turn " still corporations have been reserved many bankers detect a lingering skittishness created by the market upheavals in august and while the stock market continued to push to new heights at the end of the quarter many executives are skeptical about the economy because of a weakening dollar a slowing housing market and declining consumer spending what kind of deals will prosper in this environment jean manas head of deutsche bank ags americas m&amp a practice said he expects more partial stake investments in public companies by private equity firms these would require less debt than standard corporate buyouts and would give these investors the first chance at purchasing the whole company when credit market conditions improve bankers are counting on acquisitions in strong sectors largely insensitive to the credit markets such as technology and energy whatever these expectations there is a new way of thinking across wall street "the mood right now is kind of pensive " said louis l goldberg a partner at new york law firm davis polk &amp wardwell "its a little confused because the federal reserves rate cuts led to something of an upbeat feel in the market but people have a slightly apprehensive sense of whether there is more bad news to come its obviously a more challenging environment for getting deals done " through the first nine months of the year the top five world wide financial advisers as ranked by the total value of transactions on which they work were goldman sachs group inc morgan stanley citigroup inc j p morgan chase &amp co and ubs the top two were the same for the u s with lehman brothers holdings inc placing third and citigroup and j p morgan taking the fourth and fifth slots respectively says thomson financial among legal advisers sullivan &amp cromwell placed first both globally and in the u s a slew of london firms took the remaining spots when measuring global work with allen &amp overy llp coming in second followed by new yorks skadden arps slate meagher &amp flom llp londons clifford chance llp and londons linklaters
