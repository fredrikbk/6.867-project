small business a special report top small workplaces what makes a great workplace among other things having employees who feel empowered and convinced they have a future at the company think "great place to work " and big companies like google typically spring to mind but across the country many small businesses and nonprofits have built workplace environments and cultures that rival or even outshine the big names the wall street journal teamed up with winning workplaces an evanston ill nonprofit that helps small and midsize companies create better work environments to spotlight top small workplaces while each company is very different we encountered some common themes these small businesses tend to let employees at all levels make key decisions and they groom their future leaders from within they offer generous traditional and untraditional benefits how about a six week sabbatical and they constantly hunt for new ways to improve the employee experience or engage employees and many share a sizable slice of their profits with employees teaching them to read company financial statements so they grasp how their job is connected to the success of the organization in all these are companies that can become role models for both large and small companies struggling to lure the new generations of college graduates who increasingly care more about their work environment than the size of their first paycheck and even though these companies invest more in their people they see returns well beyond their expense they spend less time recruiting and training new employees because employees dont flee to competitors their reputations as great employers spill into their communities which in turn rewards them with word of mouth advertising and positive public relations to come up with this list we collected nominations from companies across north america and reduced the pool to finalists those finalists were judged by eight workplace and small business experts who selected the winners along the way we spoke not only with the leaders of these recognized businesses but many employees too they shared stories about how the employer had taken care of them in a time of personal strife or helped them climb into leadership positions they never expected to get so if you wont take our word for why these companies deserve recognition take theirs here in alphabetical order are the top small workplaces alaska wildland adventures business alaska tour operator based girdwood alaska founded employees year round seasonal  revenue &# million hanging onto talented employees is a continuing struggle for many small businesses without ample opportunities to move up good employees inevitably move on alaska wildland adventures inc a girdwood alaska tour operator with year round

manager kyle kelley originally started in as an alaskan safari driver during a summer internship the company later promoted him to natural history guide then safari manager then program director and then an operations manager before he assumed his current role in "theyd always rather hire from someone in our entry level pool and train them up" than hire an outsider whos already trained says the year old mr kelley this upward flow through the company means employees acquire a holistic understanding of how the business functions and can assume one anothers jobs on short notice says heather dudick marketing director because the company is so small all employees chip in on mundane tasks like stuffing envelopes licking stamps and answering phones but that coziness also means the company accommodates each employees personal goals and will custom fit jobs and schedules to their needs "people can sort of carve out their niche" and build on their individual talents ms dudick says former receptionist jackie collins showed skill in handling customer inquiries and was encouraged by managers to do some marketing work by handing out promotional materials to local businesses ms collins was so successful that the company created a half receptionist half marketing job for her she was recently promoted to full time marketing assistant judges were impressed with the camaraderie and loyalty among alaska wildlands employees and how they all seemed to enjoy coming to work in when the company needed to install plumbing at a company owned lodge many employees lent a hand digging trenches

management business manufactures water treatment chemicals based watertown mass founded employees  revenue &# million employees of barclay water management inc own of the company but they dont own it through an employee stock ownership plan like many small companies offer they buy their shares directly the company holds a stock offering each year in which only employees can buy shares of barclay stock about of employees own shares says bill brett the companys president and chief executive the advantage of direct ownership mr brett says is that employees get shareholder voting power people who own stock through esops where the company contributes shares of the stock through a qualified retirement plan dont get actual voting power with those shares because the esops trustee controls them barclays employees "dont have to worry about what their employer is going to do because they are the employer " mr brett says each january the company hosts an annual meeting where the employee shareholders can ask questions and vote on pressing issues a few years ago a major u s company moved into the water treatment business by acquiring one of barclays competitors the employee shareholders discussed the issue at the annual meeting and voted to have the company respond to this new threat by investing money to hire additional engineers lease more space and purchase new equipment even though it meant barclay would forgo profitability for a few years the stock ownership also is one of the reasons employees stay at the company for a long time as of earlier this year current employees had an average tenure of about nine years barclay also encourages employees to stay by giving them career development opportunities "we have a history of home growing successful people and very few people today are doing the job they were hired for " mr brett says several senior leaders at the company including mr brett started in lower roles the human resources manager for instance started as an administrative assistant the information technology manager and the company president were both originally hired as chemists sometimes that also means accommodating employees who are unhappy with their current jobs or need a change former sales engineer amelia brower told her supervisor last fall that she and her husband wanted to start having kids and she could no longer be constantly exposed to water treatment chemicals she suggested creating a new position in which shed design software tools to help manage large clients accounts something she had already done for

newton mass founded employees  revenue &# million at many public relations firms young hires work the phones while seasoned pr executives devise strategy and call the shots at corporate ink public relations ltd everyone regardless of title or experience is involved with decision making "junior people have a lot of opportunities to influence some really significant activities at our firm " says founder and president amy bermar who started the company in after working as a journalist for about years for instance any pr rep who lands a client a high profile interview gets to manage it from start to finish though younger reps will usually get guidance from more senior employees and all employees are given one area to oversee whether its employee training or database maintenance every employee attends company strategy meetings and is expected to actively participate handing over such power ms bermar says instills an ownership mentality where employees control their success or failure and are privy to most parts of the business from brainstorming pitches to working with media outlets this approach also builds accountability each employee is responsible for laying out personal job goals and then evaluating his or her own progress "i think the people here feel like we really really care about their career growth " ms bermar says adam parken a year old account manager who works out of his home in morrisville n c came to corporate ink in from a much larger pr firm at his previous employer there was a clear hierarchy where senior executives were in charge of strategizing while the younger reps like himself executed those strategies "here at corporate ink its no matter what position youre in youre expected to help strategize " he says to get new employees used to the culture and help them feel confident in their roles the company assigns each newcomer a mentor at the firm besides the career growth opportunities ms bermar focuses on giving employees reason to stick around new hires are generally promoted within months and employees buying a home within miles of the office can get loans of as much as &# at interest to help make the down payment and the loans that are forgiven after five more years of employment employees with at least four years at corporate ink are eligible for one paid three week sabbatical on top of regular vacation time ms bermar also tries to accommodate rising stars who want or need to leave boston when mr parken and his wife wanted to move to north carolina earlier this year ms bermar encouraged him to stay with the company by working remotely from home "i dont think that happens at most small companies " mr parken says cowden associates business actuarial and human resources consulting based pittsburgh founded employees  revenue &# million its hard to get employees to take initiative if they fear theyll be punished or ridiculed if they screw up at cowden associates inc failure is an accepted part of the culture the pittsburgh consulting firm started by chief executive jere cowden in after he broke off from another consulting firm has a relatively flat work structure where consultants are expected to be self starters and pitch new products and ideas both internally and to clients but along with that expectation mr cowden makes it clear its all right if things dont always go exactly as planned "jere is very good at letting people be people " says kathy colbert a sales and marketing associate whos worked at cowden six years cowdens office environment she says is one where employees talk freely about their work issues and have their projects formally peer reviewed they often joke and laugh about each others foibles both work related and personal at the annual holiday banquet for instance one employee each year wins the "kraut" award a silver plate displayed at the front of the office along with a jar of sauerkraut the kraut is given to the employee deemed by the previous winner to have done the most boneheaded thing over the course of the year ms colbert won the award in after her car alarm went off several times at work and her husband had to drive in to turn it off "all i know is that jere was just in stitches because of all the goofy things i did " she says but whats the key to creating such a jovial yet entrepreneurial culture hiring the right people and thats something mr cowden thinks a lot about "it doesnt take many folks that are out of step with the culture to poison it " he says for hiring purposes mr cowden keeps a running list of consultants he deems best in the business he also evaluates each prospective hire on how well they fit into the culture most job applicants are required to take a personality test that takes a couple of hours to complete the tests are sent to a human resources expert in california who sends back a podcast analyzing the test results and making observations about the applicants personality the tests are used to identify those who are self motivated independent and open minded "we certainly dont want anybody who is verbally rigid who cant see other peoples point of views " mr cowden says top small workplaces judge tim faley liked cowden associates for its "people first" mentality and the fact that employees are given the freedom to fail "it enables them to push themselves to try new things knowing that if they happen to miss the mark with an effort it is not fatal to their career " says mr faley managing director of the zell lurie institute for entrepreneurial studies at the university of michigan

companys executive vice president of research and development in late the company introduced exactech university a series of about free short courses taught by exactech employees on topics including customer service listening skills and project management along with product training and the company often brings in outside speakers or pays for employees to take online and off site courses when in house expertise isnt available an employees training regimen depends in part on his or her employee development plan a document updated at least twice a year by the employee and his or her supervisor that lays out the employees key development area and an "action plan " sometimes an action plan includes reading a book on a particular topic such as effective communication an on site library has books professional journals and audiotapes that employees can check out all employees have a development plan unless they sign a document opting out anacielo vale grogan a year old senior forecasting manager wanted to learn french so she could communicate better with representatives from the companys large french distributor exactech paid for her to take weekly french lessons and recently sent her to france for a six week language course "i think its pretty unique how much they focus on individual development here " she says to identify potential leaders company managers are asked for confidential assessments of some employees the company then invests a lot of time equipping those most promising employees with great leadership qualities exactech employees with at least one direct report are asked to attend a meeting every six weeks where they break into groups to discuss issues like employee recognition problem solving and meeting facilitation in the company hired an outside facilitator to host a yearlong course on emotional intelligence for team leaders and promising employees that addressed issues such as self awareness and dealing with other people "especially as

who takes notes at the department meetings and brings any concerns employees share anonymously to senior management "it gives employees the opportunity to raise concerns that they might be uncomfortable raising in a larger setting " says chief executive jim tippmann while he adds that frch "is by no means a democracy " it tries to maintain a collaborative spirit even though job roles authority and accountability are very clearly defined each september employees complete an anonymous opinion survey asking them to raise any concerns so that managers can keep tabs on what issues need to be addressed about five years ago some employees said they were frustrated that some leadership roles lacked accountability so company executives mr tippmann says created a clearly defined

president who founded the business himself using a van rented from a friend instead of hiring loads of summer help gentle giant employs about of its staff year round the company uses the slow winter months to hold employee training and leadership development classes and keeping so many employees around means the company doesnt have to massively rehire and retrain each spring each new employee completes initial training on company culture and hard skills like how to safely pack and carry household belongings but training goes well beyond that employees especially those looking to move into more senior roles are asked to complete soft skills training on topics like customer relations communication skills problem solving and project management last winter gentle giant hired an improvisational theater group from maine to lead role playing exercises for about employees identified as emerging leaders "we really emphasize that what matters most to us is telling the truth " mr otoole says in gentle giant won a &# matching grant for training from the state of massachusetts all the training pays off mr otoole says customers file fewer claims because gentle giants employees

deberry coody to get a commercial license for its child care facility something that had not been required previously the companys three partners and its employees worried that the high cost of insurance and compliance involved with licensing could force the firm and other small businesses to shutter their child care facilities though guerra deberry did eventually get licensed its employees led a grass roots campaign to persuade state lawmakers to exempt small employers with on site child care facilities from commercial licensing requirements a state legislator drafted such a bill which was passed by the legislature and signed into law last month "i thought it was really courageous that they took the fight and won " says judith cone a top small workplaces judge and vice president of

healthwise in after serving as finance chief at a large company building an enjoyable workplace he says reduces absenteeism and helps with retention and recruitment about job applications roll in for every job opening annual revenue has also flourished climbing to &# million last year from &# million in while all the time and money spent on benefits may seem lavish mr balkins says it fits the organizations mission if healthwise advises other people how to be healthy its employees better be healthy too and being a nonprofit there arent shareholders clamoring for a return on investment he says healthwise is always looking for ways to improve employee well being says founder and chief executive don kemper but not every new idea is adopted several employees with young children have requested on site day care but executives decided the administration and licensing requirements were too burdensome instead a committee of employees looked into developing an off site day care benefit though they ultimately decided against it "you want to be careful because once you offer a benefit to take it back is really hard " mr kemper says managing all of healthwises benefits is also something of a chore volunteer committees of employees have been organized in recent years to oversee the various types of benefits healthwise hounds one such committee manages the dogs at work policy sometimes booting disruptive pooches and the wellness committee oversees employee health and fitness initiatives such as an annual wellness day nrg systems business maker of wind measuring equipment based hinesburg vt founded employees  revenue &# million when it comes to benefits and office environment nrg systems inc blows away most of the competition the company offers an eclectic array of "soft" benefits such as paid six week sabbaticals for longtime employees free chef prepared lunches for all employees four days a week and a cash bonus for employees who make their homes more energy efficient or buy a toyota prius nrg also takes an unconventional tack on some traditional benefits it has a cafeteria style health plan in which each employee receives &# a month that can either be spent on insurance or pocketed individual health insurance is available through the company for &# to &# a month while family coverage costs &# to &# monthly and the setting is unique the company is housed in rural vermont in a newly built square foot solar powered building replete with skylights a commons area reminiscent of a ski lodge and an indoor swimming pool "what has been really important to us as company owners is to do the right thing and to treat people like we would want to be treated " says chief executive jan blittersdorf who owns the company with her husband david ms blittersdorf says she and her husband believe good benefits also make "good business sense " because employees feel appreciated and enjoy coming to work while measuring the real payoff of good benefits can be difficult there is one thing its definitely helped with lowering turnover only one nrg employee left the company in the most successful benefit in terms of employee retention ms blittersdorf says is the companys cash profit sharing plan each month nrg divides of the previous months profit among employees giving them checks apportioned based on their salaries that can reach of

says phelps county bank business community bank based rolla mo founded employees  revenue &# million many business owners dream of hiring employees as passionate about the business as themselves phelps county bank has devised its own way to achieve this make employees the owners with four branches in central missouri phelps is among just a few u s banks that are owned by employees using an employee stock ownership plan or esop congress set up esops in as a tax efficient way for owners to give employees stock in a business phelps currently contributes stock equal to of employees salaries into their esop accounts each year employees are fully vested in their account after seven years and can diversify their stock holdings starting at age by either rolling a portion of the money into individual retirement accounts or their k s or cashing out the esop has created enviable nest eggs for many phelps employees connie robison a year old mortgage loan officer who earns about &# a year and has worked for phelps since has roughly &# in her esop account due to the annual stock contributions annual dividends and the stocks growth "its like youll have to pinch yourself to think youll have this kind of retirement when you leave here " says ms robison adding that she and her husband have little retirement savings outside of her esop account phelpss average esop account balance is &# and about seven current employees have amassed more than &# million but its not just the retirement savings potential that makes the esop a powerful tool says chief executive bill marshall it helps inspire employees to think more entrepreneurially about their careers "stock ownership was the vehicle that really made us focus on what it meant to be an owner " he says phelps employees are taught to read company financial statements at meetings throughout the year and the bank discloses its financial results at least monthly employees are encouraged to suggest new products and procedures for the bank to implement and they can receive bonuses for their ideas they are also cross trained in other jobs at the bank so all employees get a broad understanding of how the bank operates in recent years management has tried to instill more of an ownership mentality by encouraging employees to make decisions without feeling they need a supervisors approval bank tellers for instance are generally expected to handle customer inquiries and complaints on their own "we were standing back saying you dont need to come to us " mr marshall says "this is your job not our job " the esop also greatly helps with employee retention current employees have worked for phelps an average of years longer than any other top small workplaces finalist point b solutions group business project management consulting based seattle founded employees  revenue &# million in an industry renowned for hour workdays and nonstop travel point b solutions group isnt your everyday player the project management firm which has consultants in seven u s cities doesnt take clients outside those cities and so rarely asks employees to travel the company also has no brick and mortar offices so all consultants are based at home when not on site with clients "frankly its worked out way above our wildest dreams " says tim jenkins co founder and co chief executive of the company because of point bs unique work environment he says "weve been able to attract some great people whod otherwise have left the consulting industry for something else " before starting point b with two other consultants in mr jenkins worked for a large consulting firm and was sometimes asked to work in a different city for months at a time leaving his wife behind tired of that taxing lifestyle mr jenkins and his co founders set to build a consulting firm that emphasized work life balance and collegiality instead of building a traditional corporate hierarchy the founders felt it was more practical to install a flat structure today about of point bs employees hold the same title senior associate but those senior associates can be selected to lead particular projects where their expertise is most needed the company generally hires only consultants with at least five years of consulting experience since the jobs entail much autonomy with clients top small workplaces judges were impressed by how the company was able to create a flexible work structure in an industry known for inflexibility point b has had to turn down some prospective clients due to the self imposed limits on travel mr jenkins says but so far that hasnt mattered work has been so plentiful that the company has nearly doubled in size since late when it employed one particular challenge with the companys unique structure is fostering collaboration since theres no traditional office where employees can interact to create a more networked culture employees in the various cities meet six to times a year for "watering holes" at restaurants where they can get to know their colleagues and discuss work issues the company also hosts an annual two day retreat at a resort for every employee and a guest on a day to day basis employees can access an internal knowledge sharing database where they can pose questions to the rest of the staff the companys pay structure and benefits are also self driven and innovative like its culture employees get no paid time off but instead are paid hourly and can take off as much time as they want instead of a matching contribution to the company k employees receive annual bonuses based on the extra work theyve done over the course of the year and their individual performance senior associate elaine mowery takes off several months a year for leisure travel and says she appreciates the recognition that consultants want lives outside of work "i really enjoy the ability to work and live in the same place " she says "and i really enjoy the ability to take as much time off as i want " reflexite business manufactures optical components and films based avon conn founded employees  revenue &# million one dilemma many employee owned companies grapple with is getting their employees to feel empowered by that ownership at reflexite corp where employees own about of the company through an employee stock ownership plan the company has devised some innovative ways to let employees participate in decision making one way is through town meetings where senior management gives a presentation on a timely workplace problem such as high health costs or a financial downturn management proposes some ways to address the problem and employees move to different parts of the room depending on which approach they support employees in each of the groups are asked for their reasoning and sometimes employees switch sides as their viewpoints change "even though its not majority rule its not a vote everyone feels like they got a chance to speak " says michael foley reflexites chief executive town meetings are generally held at every manufacturing facility in the u s and globally where employees are affected by the question at hand employees actions and opinions at the meetings are transcribed and presented to the board or management whichever makes the ultimate decision but in most cases the consensus view among employees is adopted "i think management feels compelled if they decide to go a different route to provide some answers " says brook jerzyk director of global specification and road building often he adds employees will devise alternative solutions that management never thought of last february a town meeting was held to discuss the formula used to disperse reflexites stock through the esop for years the company has given employees a percentage of their pay in stock dependent on their business units performance but in recent years more employees suggested giving each employee the same percentage after management held town meetings at every u s manufacturing facility and saw that most employees supported giving everyone the same percentage the companys board approved the change reflexite also engages its employees in other ways the company holds monthly open book management meetings where management walks employees through the companys financial statements another tool is a communications blitz after an important decision has been made managers will give a presentation and then employees break into groups and brainstorm a list of questions when the meeting reconvenes managers answer many of the questions right away but all questions and answers are eventually published so that every employee can read them the benefit of all this communication employees feel like they have a voice and can influence company decisions they also see why management made certain decisions and hence "buy into" them more mr foley says "they feel like no stone is unturned " he says "we didnt duck the issues " restek corp business chromatography based bellefonte pa founded employees  revenue &# million paul silvis has worked for his share of bad companies including one that "managed by intimidation" where a manager for instance closely monitored the copier because he thought employees were making too many copies so when mr silvis started his own company restek corp which manufactures products for analytical laboratories he set out to create one where employees enjoy coming to work as much as they enjoy going home and one where employees are treated with respect trust and compassion "i didnt want to be like all those other companies that didnt respect their employees " says mr silvis who stepped down as chief executive in but still works as a consultant restek employees are offered several benefits that are unusual at small businesses including an on site fitness facility with exercise and nutrition classes massage therapy and personal trainers who can be hired for about &# an hour the company also hosts an annual summer picnic with a fireworks display and offers volunteer days where employees are encouraged to use a work day to help a cause employees receive stock through an employee stock ownership plan and a dollar for dollar match to the companys k plan for as much as of pay but benefits are just part of the companys allure employees say its how theyre treated by management on a day to day basis that makes restek so different "there are no time clocks here because they trust you " says randy fisher a year old production supervisor who has worked at restek for nine years mr fisher says the work environment feels like "a country club" compared with his past employers because of the numerous recreational activities and walking trails on campus and the authority that employees have to monitor themselves the company tries to help employees move forward in their careers using individual development plans documents filled out by employees and their managers that lay out what employees need to do to meet their desired career goals the company even tries to support an employee when that goal doesnt involve staying at restek one former graphic designer mr silvis says wanted to become a veterinarian so her managers helped her develop a plan to get her bachelors degree and work part time at an animal hospital shes now finishing up veterinary school in philadelphia even employees who are let go because of performance or personality issues are treated respectfully generally when an employee gets fired the manager will sit down and explain why theyre not a good fit for the company but instead of booting them out the door immediately the manager will generally offer them a three month window to find another job the employee in exchange must sign an agreement promising to look for work "we want all employees to leave here with self dignity " mr silvis says summit aviation business aircraft maintenance and avionics based middletown del founded employees  revenue &# million when it comes

for so much and you have to do the same for them " she says many employees set their own work schedules and management tries to be especially compassionate when an employee has a family emergency or illness last year before a longtime employee died from cancer employees were encouraged to take time during work hours to visit him at the hospital "its been too good to leave " says ralph buckingham a year old aircraft inspector who was one of summits three original employees mr buckingham says he can take time off for a doctors appointment or other personal need without worrying the company recently gave him a &# travel voucher for his year anniversary with the company "they really take care of their people " says michael mulqueen a top small workplaces judge and former executive
