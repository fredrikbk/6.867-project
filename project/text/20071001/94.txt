the daily fix phillies claim nl east crown rockies padres face a playoff online edition a wild sunday wasnt enough to sort out the national league playoff slate thatll require an extra day on january the philadelphia phillies jimmy rollins declared his team which wound up games behind the new york mets last year "the team to beat" in the nl east that proclamation was much mocked in new york particularly after the phils stumbled their way to a start yesterday mr rollins finished backing up his words as the phils beat the washington nationals and the mets imploded against the florida marlins the key blow in the phils nats game a fifth inning triple by mr rollins that made it "for the last years starting with joe carters crushing home run in the world series the baseball environment in philadelphia has been dominated by disappointment frustration and even anger " writes jim salisbury in the philadelphia inquirer "sure there were times when the sun peeked briefly through the gray clouds jim thomes signing in the opening of citizens bank park in and ryan howards mvp season of all come to mind ultimately though the disappointment and frustration continued as the phillies time and time again retreated behind the dark clouds and failed to make the playoffs maybe thats why this all tastes so sweet the fog has lifted the sun is out the phillies are champions of the national league east " in the washington post thomas boswell salutes the work of sundays winning pitcher ancient southpaw jamie moyer who grew up in philadelphia and wound up standing in the champagne soaked clubhouse with his four year old son mccabe in his arms and history on his mind "as the year old southpaw headed to citizens bank park on sunday morning preparing to pitch the most important game of his life he drove past a little league field near the park " mr boswell writes " there were kids playing if i hadnt been pitching i might have stopped it brought up a lot of childhood memories for me growing up less than an hour from here rooting for steve carlton going to the phillies parade after they won the world series in moyer said i got those warm and fuzzy feelings it made me appreciate what i was going to have a chance to do to be able to win in this city where i grew up to be able to stand in this clubhouse now im at a loss for words said moyer who fell silent and calmly as he does everything started to cry mccabe seemed surprised but quite proud of course thats how all phillies fans feel now surprised proud and near tears " and on beerleaguer a word poster is worth about a million words the mets season was over early tom glavine got only one out before being lifted and the marlins were up before the phillies even started play that completed the worst collapse in baseball history the mets fumbled away a seven game lead with to play reckoned a to shot by baseball prospectus in the new york sun tim marchman turns a blowtorch on the mets "the mets were viciously jeered off the field yesterday and deserved it " he writes "the people have been served a thoroughgoing travesty and no one can blame them for not liking it for a team or some large important part of it to visibly lose their will to win right there on the field is something else that isnt easily forgiven bitter losses like this are corrosive you can trace a great deal of the traditional zealotry and vileness of some philadelphia and boston fans to the legendary collapses of and when a team plays so badly gives away so many chances and so repeatedly refuses to learn from its mistakes that it actually loses the trust of the fans it finds that trust a very difficult thing to get back " the phillies chicago cubs and arizona diamondbacks are in the playoffs for the nl joining the als boston red sox new york yankees cleveland indians and anaheim angels that leaves one slot to be filled the san diego padres and colorado rockies are tied for the wild card lead the two teams will meet in denver tonight winner take all the rockies forced the playoff by holding off the arizona diamondbacks and have won of "he jumped so high for joy year old first baseman todd helton did not touch the ground until he landed in october for the first time in his major league career " writes mark kiszla in the denver post adding "why not the rockies why not now if you truly believe in baseball magic then colorados magic number is dont blah blah blah me with promises about next year or a sermon on patience a dozen more victories and the rockies win the world series do you believe with the bulletproof confidence of youth these kid rocks do " the padres got to this pass by dropping their final regularly scheduled pair to the milwaukee brewers the last an anemic beating marked by lousy pitching bad fielding and an utter lack of clutch hitting as the san diego union tribunes tim sullivan notes the padres left their still corked champagne in milwaukee rather than pay the freight to fly it to denver the team says it will buy more in colorado if that sounds like a bunch of bad omens mr sullivan counsels calm "among baseballs enduring truths is that lousiness need not be lasting as poorly as the padres played over the weekend their prospects improve immeasurably with jake peavy scheduled to take the mound today manager bud black elected to withhold peavy from yesterdays game on the theory that the padres were not yet facing elimination and on the hope that they might be able to advance without burning their best starting pitcher despite the strafing brett tomko and his successors sustained yesterday blacks decision still looks like a correctly calculated risk better to have peavy available for a must win game than to squander him in a start that could have proved insignificant had the diamondbacks prevailed in denver " quick hits from the nfl sorry football fans in a month mondays will be all yours in san diego fans mocked new head coach norv turner with chants of "mar ty mar ty " as the kansas city chiefs put up unanswered points in beating the chargers the kansas city stars joe posnanski gets off some great cracks at mr turners expense before settling into an examination of the chargers defense chargers qb philip "rivers was spooked unnerved panicked scared because the chiefs defense got in his head when was the last time that happened think about this when was the last time that the chiefs defense got into a quarterbacks head built a home there did some landscaping threw a loud party " there werent a lot of style points in detroit where the lions trailed after three quarters then ripped off points to beat the chicago bears and new qb brian griese "what happened was bananas " marvels mitch albom in the detroit free press "this game was replays reviews more replays more reviews turnovers sacks fumbles blocked field goals blocked extra points a kickoff and an onside kick returned for touchdowns it was chicago coughing up five fumbles and never losing one it was detroit having a tight end run a kick into the end zone it was a record setting fourth quarter that took an hour and nine minutes to play and saw points posted for detroit for chicago " in miami the oakland raiders pasted the dolphins behind qb daunte culpepper let ago amid much bad feeling in july mr culpepper ran for three tds and threw for two more humiliating his former employers in dramatic style but in the miami herald dan le batard says mr culpeppers performance was deceiving "culpepper completed all of five passes and none for more than yards it is nearly impossible to win an nfl game with that little from your quarterback but the fact a bad raiders team was able to blow out the dolphins on the road with their backup quarterback and their backup running back says more about how terrible the dolphins are everywhere than it does about how good culpepper was on this afternoon " tip of the fix cap to readers don hartline and patrick oneill and an angry fling of the fix cap in the general direction of the new york mets thanks for nothing you pathetic chokers found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself
