franchising virtual copies take the franchise model add the web heres what you get fast food restaurants retail stores fitness chains for most people those are the images that come to mind when they think of a franchise its an easy idea to grasp a successful business expands by granting others the right for a fee to open carbon copy stores in untapped markets now a small but growing number of online companies are tailoring the concept for the internet call it "virtual franchising " where web pages substitute for physical storefronts and customers drop by using keyboards though it may be less straightforward than the brick and mortar version online franchising offers distinct advantages according to some internet business owners who have taken the plunge chief among them is the elimination of frustrating time consuming searches for suitable commercial space that in turn makes it easier to get operations off the ground "you eliminate a huge chunk of something that can turn the franchising process into a nightmare " says dan martin president of the san diego software firm ifx online who sits on the board of the international franchise association and as more business shifts online he adds "i guarantee you that more people will come in with online franchise models " teri gault is the founder of thegrocerygame com a seven year old web site that tracks the best deals at supermarkets for coupon clipping consumers the company generates revenue by charging members fees which typically start at &# for eight weeks worth of research on price deals at stores in their zip code like many business owners ms gault saw franchising as the best way to expand her los angeles based company nationwide she rejected the idea of simply hiring staff in other cities because "i wasnt sure i could trust employees that far away to be reliable " she says "i needed a sense of ownership for people who would be providing the customer service " ms gault now has an online network of franchisees and company owned territories in all states a system she says has worked for her she declines to supply details about her franchise fees or how much franchisees typically earn new franchisees get a turnkey system that includes a training manual and access to grocerygames proprietary software and databases she says when grocerygame members log in they are routed by zip code to a franchisees web page which lists the best deals at local stores "i cant conceive how difficult it is for a national operation to monitor the quality of a brick and mortar franchise " she says "we can just log in and monitor the quality of customer care and products online " a number of web consulting firms meanwhile say the internet is the most efficient way to design and develop a franchise model truepresence a baltimore company that sells internet design and search engine marketing services to businesses awarded its first franchise almost two years ago and now has in locations such as denver austin texas and various cities along the east coast truepresence franchisees typically act as sales agents signing up new clients and directing technology projects back to the main office for staff designers and programmers to complete after paying an initial fee of &# for a territory franchise owners receive web based training marketing materials business stationery and a personalized page within the truepresence web site the companys online "office locator" sends local prospects directly to franchisees web pages franchise owners get access to truepresence services at wholesale prices and then resell them to clients at the market rate michael teitelbaum president of truepresence says the web based franchise works well because owners spend most of their time in the field and dont require a physical storefront franchisees enter client and prospect activity into a web based database which the national office can monitor and "we typically get a higher caliber individual that wants to be a franchise owner as opposed to an employee " he says "they have an owners mentality they will do whatever it takes to get the job done " franchisees say the model allows them to get off to a quick start "i didnt want to wait two to three years before starting operations and making money " says mike sweeney of reston va who bought into the truepresence system in november and now sells the companys services to clients in northern virginia he figures he saved a lot on overhead expenses because he didnt have to hire a technology staff or lease an office building mr sweeney currently has about eight active clients which he says surpassed his expectations about half were referred to him by the main office he plans to attend an annual conference for truepresence franchise owners in december where he and other franchisees can share best practices and client stories some companies that do business online have come up with alternatives to the franchise model cafepress com a foster city calif company that sells customized t shirts and merchandise via the internet says it didnt consider traditional franchising when it started operations in instead the company allows a network of artistic entrepreneurs to sell their own designs through its shopkeeper program shopkeepers who agree to a term of service get a web page within cafepress coms site and sell their own designs when an order is placed cafepress prints the product and ships it and the shopkeeper makes a commission shopkeepers pay &# to &# a month for a "premium" shop where they can sell multiple designs and products a more limited "basic" shop is free "there are some elements that are similar" to franchising says marc cowlin a cafepress spokesman but unlike most franchisees shopkeepers are encouraged to do their own marketing and unlike say burger king restaurant operators who can call their stores burger king shopkeepers can only say that their stores are "powered" by cafepress he says other companies see little value in creating a network that doesnt have physical locations or brand recognition "we did look into franchising and after a very thorough evaluation it just didnt seem right for our business " says thomas harpointner co founder of ais media a web services and interactive media firm in atlanta potential franchisees would be working from home or a small office and really wouldnt benefit from the association with ais media at least not enough to justify the territory restrictions franchise fees and royalties of a typical franchise agreement mr harpointner concluded "there isnt a mcdonalds of internet consulting " he says "why would they pay a fee for a name thats not well known " instead ais media launched a "partner" program essentially a looser version of a franchise business partners buy ais medias products and services at wholesale rates and then resell them to customers at retail rates keeping all of the profits a partner pays a deposit of as much as &# but gets that money back as performance goals are met mr harpointner says a partner isnt as vested as a franchisee but the program is a way "to attract serious minded individuals " he says for some web based franchise owners building the brand is part of the challenge marty dibello a franchisee of netspace international inc an internet marketing firm in framingham mass says it is a thrill to get in on the ground floor he paid &# in for the franchise and currently works with about clients "theres not a name recognition like microsoft " he says "but i bought into this because i believe we can make some progress in building that brand " he doesnt mind not having a storefront he usually holds client meetings at a local starbucks coffee shop like any business "you have to be committed financially " he says "and willing to bust it for a few years " ms debaise is an editor at smartmoney com she can be reached at cdebaise smartmoney com
