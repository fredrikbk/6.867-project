eurolinks daily view citigroups prince under fire ubss rohner under pressure online edition might the &# billion stumble citigroup inc disclosed monday the cost of its part in the credit crunch also cost chief executive charles prince his job in place for four years to the day and under growing pressure to turn around the largest u s bank by market capitalization he has been unable to significantly lift its stock price which has been underperforming the prices of its peers perhaps the rise in the big banks price monday was due to more than just the reduced uncertainty about the credit crunchs impact like other wall street firms citigroup has been beset by the credit markets turmoil that sidelined many investors and is saddled with loans it had expected to sell its news came hours after ubs ag said it will post a third quarter loss and make changes following &# billion of write downs in its fixed income portfolio but while citigroups massive balance sheet can easily absorb the hit the situation has called into question its ability to manage its risk appropriately last month for example goldman sachs group inc reported unexpectedly strong results despite the market unrest in part due to savvy bets that the value of home loans and related securities would fall not surprisingly the news that citigroups third quarter earnings will fall as much as prompted a fresh round of calls for mr prince to step down after all he had been promising a turnaround and had called a "year of no excuses " importantly however saudi prince alwaleed bin talal the largest individual shareholder in citigroup said monday that he fully supports the banks management including mr prince meanwhile new ubs ceo marcel rohner having led his bank through one of the more spectacular bloodlettings of the global credit crisis now must work out how to shore up the bank amid the departure of key executives and the repercussions of a very bad bet on u s mortgages the changes and strategy he unveiled monday amount to a retrenchment as the swiss bank slashes by nearly a third the assets of the investment banking unit that has helped lead its growth in recent years

observers of russian president vladimir putin who have been waiting for the other shoe to drop to explain why he has seemed so unconcerned at the prospect of no longer being the incumbent after presidential elections in march were treated to a vital new piece of the puzzle monday the man who says he has no plans to change the constitution to allow him to run for a third consecutive presidential term might become prime minister instead at a congress of the pro kremlin united russia party which he helped set up six years ago he said that becoming prime minister after his term ends next spring "is an entirely realistic proposal " it could be explored after the party won the december parliamentary elections and a new president is elected in march "with whom it would be possible to work as a pair " he said and though russias prime minister doesnt have to be a member of the duma or lower house he also agreed to take the top spot on the partys electoral list going into december parliamentary elections as gregory l white and alan cullison report given the presidents plus approval ratings his move to head the partys parliamentary election slate virtually guarantees a commanding majority in parliament for the party which mr putin helped set up six years ago though he probably wouldnt actually take a seat in the duma given that the constitution bars him from running only for a third consecutive term one scenario suggests that viktor zubkov the little known bureaucrat whom mr putin named as prime minister last month might win mr putins endorsement for the presidency at the march elections and that mr putin would run again for the presidency later the next question would be how much later read gregory l white and alan cullisons report from moscow http
