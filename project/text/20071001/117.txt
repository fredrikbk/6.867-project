ubs to report big loss tied to credit woes swiss banking giant ubs ag which recently ousted its chief executive in the wake of losses at an in house hedge fund and defections of top investment bankers plans to write down as much as billion swiss francs or &# billion in assets including securities tied to u s subprime mortgages the big write down would make ubs europes third largest bank one of the most prominent casualties of the recent turmoil in global credit markets it also raises questions about the management of the banks securities business especially the way it has handled its expansion into the u s another casualty of the turmoil is expected to be huw jenkins chief of ubss investment banking division according to a person familiar with the matter marcel rohner the banks new chief executive will personally oversee the division replacing mr jenkins a ubs spokesman in zurich where the bank is based declined to comment after taking a write down of between billion francs and billion francs on its fixed income assets ubs expects to post a third quarter loss ranging from about million francs to million francs people familiar with the matter said for the year earlier quarter the bank reported net profit of billion swiss francs the write down which ubs is expected to announce today would be the latest in a series of problems at the bank since this spring when it disclosed the departure of leading investment bankers and the shuttering of its internal hedge fund after expanding from its traditional base in private banking ubs appears to be struggling in the current environment more than many other banks particularly in areas that are newer for it ubss latest woes according to people close to the matter stem from owning too many asset backed securities that are in part tied to u s subprime mortgages home loans to borrowers with weak or sketchy credit histories turning such mortgages into bonds has been a profitable business for wall street but in recent weeks as concerns have mounted about defaults on those loans the market for mortgage related securities began to dry up that made it tough to determine the value of those assets roiling global credit markets according to people close to the matter other investment banks have similar issues with large holdings of hard to value securities that in some cases have yet to be marked down the expected write down at ubs would be steeper than those posted by the four big investment banks to report results so far goldman sachs group inc lehman brothers holdings inc morgan stanley and bear stearns cos all of which were affected in varying degrees by the upheaval in the u s mortgage market but which nonetheless reported profits for their fiscal third quarters ended in august among banks that havent yet reported merrill lynch &amp co faces a possible third quarter write down of as much &# billion to reflect losses on mortgage related securities and buyout financing commitments a wall street analyst predicted last week the write downs represent the first big step taken by mr rohner who was named ceo in july after the bank ousted his predecessor in the wake of the shutdown of its internal fund dillon read capital management mr rohner said shortly after taking control of ubs that he would pursue a more conservative strategy such as limiting expansion of ubss investment bank in setting its write down ubs is valuing its assets conservatively people familiar with the matter said a write down would also let mr rohner try to isolate problems that started before he took the helm the london based mr jenkins head of ubss investment bank since july masterminded a multiyear expansion of the division trying to shift its focus to high margin businesses such as commodities trading underwriting high yield bonds and selling derivatives all hot areas in which ubs trailed many of its rivals but during his tenure the bank took on subprime mortgage related risks both by making direct loans to subprime lenders and through holdings of mortgage linked securities at a time when those assets were already beginning to founder as the damage unfolded mr jenkins in early august replaced the banks fixed income chief but its troubles mounted in the weeks that followed like many banks and funds ubs drastically cut the value it attached to its asset backed bonds after buyers for those securities disappeared over the summer and failed to return this fall the move provided yet another sign of the widespread damage done by the u s subprime mortgage collapse ubss write down will be closely watched it would signal that the bank is taking a dim view of the trading value of these securities in the near term while banks globally have struggled with fallout from the credit crunch and investors have beaten down many of their stocks stock markets overall have been resilient thanks in part to the federal reserves recent cut in u s interest rates so far this year the dow jones industrial average is up the nasdaq composite index is up and the pan european dow jones stoxx index is up on friday ubs shares which have fallen roughly this year rose to francs the next few weeks though could test that resilience as a number of banks mark down the value of the assets on their books giving investors a more complete picture of the extent of the credit crisis ubs is expected to disclose its problems in fixed income today ahead of its third quarter results which are due oct should other financial institutions also issue warnings the equanimity of the equity markets may not last ubs along with credit suisse group and deutsche bank ag has been prominent among the european banks that have sought to challenge wall streets largest securities firms and banks in the u s market with mixed success and a series of blow ups ubss biggest bet in the u s was to pay &# billion for the retail brokerage firm painewebber group inc at the top of the market in but it has been more cautious in trying to build up an investment bank hiring a few stars like ken moelis from credit suisse and bulking up in selected areas such as health care and media recently some of those stars like mr moelis and consumer goods specialist blair effron have resigned in the past few years ubss investment bank has become a formidable force on wall street and a top trading firm it has also made inroads in some lucrative market sectors such as stock underwriting helped by its presence in fast growing overseas markets while ubs ranked only no in overall global underwriting of stocks and bonds for the first nine months of this year according to thomson financial which tracks new issues it ranked no in the most lucrative category global initial public offerings and no in fees collected however ubss fixed income division suffered after the bank set up dillon read the in house hedge fund it started in june because the unit siphoned off many of the bond teams best traders losses from dillon read widened to million swiss francs in the second quarter from million swiss francs in the first quarter ubs said shutting it down cost the bank &# million in the second quarter to cover restructuring severance payouts and write downs of unused rental space for the traders the latest losses are in part a result of continued costs of writing off dillon reads soured mortgage bets but they are also a result of other securities held by the fixed income division by comparison among major u s securities firms which reported results for their fiscal third quarters morgan stanley reported markdowns of &# million for leveraged loans a &# billion fixed income revenue decline reflecting markdowns in mortgages and other trading positions and a &# million stock trading loss other firms took smaller hits goldman sachs reported a &# billion loss on bond assets reduced by hedges to &# billion lehman and bear stearns both said they took &# million debt markdowns in lehmans case after counting hedges and profits on some debt it owes bear stearns also had a &# million loss on two hedge funds ubs has had rocky periods before the bank said a bad bet on interest rates and weaker trading income helped lower net profit in last years third quarter by from billion francs a year earlier edward taylor contributed to this article
