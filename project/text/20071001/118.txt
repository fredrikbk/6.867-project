why ebay amazon shares are up wall street is re evaluating how to measure growth at ebay inc and amazon com inc and the change is helping to send the stocks of both companies higher for years analysts and investors routinely looked to numbers such as total auction listings and new users to gauge whether ebay and amazon were growth companies such figures helped show whether the electronic commerce companies were adding new customers and building robust enough brand names for themselves analysts said but some on wall street now have begun emphasizing other measures such as revenue generated per internet user operating margins and overall revenue growth many of these metrics are typically used to evaluate retailers such as starbucks corp and gap inc that means some analysts now are comparing ebay and amazon with brick and mortar retailers rather than high technology concerns while the switch isnt new it is being more widely embraced on wall street because as ebay and amazon mature both companies look increasingly weak measured by established web measures now more than a decade old both companies boast huge audiences that are difficult to expand as quickly as in the past moreover they have diversified beyond their original businesses with amazon going into areas such as digital music and ebay adding internet phone calls "as growth slows at ebay and amazon youre going to look at more and more retail type metrics around these names because their fortunes are going to be tied to the consumer " says rafael tamargo a portfolio manager at wilmington trust investment management llc the money manager has &# billion in assets and owns million ebay shares and amazon shares according to factset research systems inc investors who looked at ebays most recent earnings by the traditional web measurements for instance might have been disappointed for its second quarter the san jose calif company posted a decline in listings of goods the first time it has shown a drop the increase in gross merchandise volume or the total value of all goods sold was the slowest growth rate over the past year but by emphasizing some of the new metrics prospects for ebay and seattle based amazon look rosier ebays second quarter revenue rose its strongest performance since the third quarter of and its revenue per listing rose according to some estimates meanwhile amazons free cash flow which is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures and which acts as a proxy for operating profit rose in the second quarter from a year earlier wall streets change explains in part why ebay and amazons shares have risen this year even as the companies have faced questions over new rivals such as google inc and concerns that they have been spending too heavily to ratchet up growth indeed these new metrics serve to highlight the companies fast growing areas because they allow better comparison with slower growing brick and mortar retail stocks all of this helps some analysts and investors justify ebay and amazons expensive valuations amazon currently trades at times trailing month earnings and ebay at times its month earnings both well above starbuckss p e ratio of times its month trailing earnings overall ebays stock is up so far this year while amazons has more than doubled in p m trading friday on the nasdaq stock market ebays shares were down cents at &# while amazons closed at &# cents lower imran khan at j p morgan chase &amp co is one analyst who has made the switch he used to look closely at the overall number of ebays listings but now emphasizes revenue per listing which shows the amount of revenue generated by each item posted for sale on ebays site that is because new ebay businesses such as shopping comparison site shopping com generate advertising revenue that isnt reflected in the total number of listings but is reflected in revenue per listing he says ebays listings growth has slowed steadily since the first quarter of when it hit and then declined in the second quarter of this year revenue per listing on the other hand rose to &# in the second quarter a increase from a year earlier says mr khan whose firm has done investment banking business with ebay partly because of the acceleration in revenue per listing mr khan recently raised his revenue estimate for ebay to &# billion from &# billion and raised his earnings estimate for the year to &# a share from &# a share "people used to look at listings" to measure ebays business but because the "business is getting diversified you need to look at the revenue per listing and revenue numbers too " says the analyst who rates the shares the equivalent of a "buy " ebay itself is spurring the change during the companys most recent earnings call chief financial officer bob swan said the company was increasingly measuring itself by revenue growth instead of the traditional e commerce metric of gross merchandise volume growth an ebay spokesman says the new emphasis offers a more accurate view of ebays evolving business gross merchandise volume and listings alone provide "an incomplete picture " says spokesman hani durzy an amazon spokesman said the company is focused on maximizing free cash flow but declined to elaborate some investors say the evaluation switch is warranted kevin landis chief investment officer of asset management firm firsthand capital management inc says looking at new metrics helps frame the companies momentum properly particularly for wall street analysts who need to adjust their thinking to a long term view he says firsthand which has about &# million in assets owns ebay shares but no amazon shares according to factset mr landis says he doesnt place more emphasis on these new metrics because he has always weighted them along with more traditional web measurements "whats old is new again " he says
