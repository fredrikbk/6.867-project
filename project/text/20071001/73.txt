markets like morocco and oman the rebound from the downturn is a testament to investors hopes that the engines of global growth will continue to hum commodity prices remain high or at records emerging economies are expanding rapidly and nations like europe canada and australia have shown robust expansion the major question is whether the u s economy will slow gently before picking up or decelerate

sept for now the fed move "is great it improves market sentiment " said arjun divecha who manages more than &# billion in emerging market stocks at gmo llc in berkeley calif "but its entirely possible that the sentiment is going to be wrong " emerging markets exemplified the roller coaster nature of the quarter the morgan stanley capital international emerging markets index hit a high on july and then plunged in dollar terms during the next three weeks while these markets took a greater hit than developed countries during the period they also bounced back more markedly in the weeks that followed on sept the msci index hit a high and remains in record territory that performance is feeding a sense that a bubble could be on the way "weve already been in a vigorous bull market for the

advantage of the countrys ultralow interest rates stocks of exporters which have been a bright spot in the japanese markets took a particular hit investors say they arent convinced that the japanese economy and in particular consumer spending is moving into higher gear that means the performance of japanese stocks is likely to continue to lag behind that of their counterparts in other parts of the world japan has been "a bad place to be for a long time and remains a bad place to be " mr gallagher said as japan struggled some other asian markets posted double digit gains for the quarter hong
