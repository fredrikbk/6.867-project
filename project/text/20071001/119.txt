world stock markets in china bulls sire deal making local m&amp a heats up amid rising stock market shanghai chinese companies are fueling a boom in local mergers and acquisitions underscoring the reasons that investors are so bullish on the nations corporate prospects the &# billion in domestic m&amp a deals announced for the first nine months of the year tops last years record full year amount of &# billion the figure also tops the &# billion foreign investors have pledged so far this year to invest in chinese companies according to thomson financial domestic m&amp a is heating up even as chinas government has appeared cool to foreign funded buyouts a new national security provision and other hurdles have convinced some investors that beijing is discouraging deals involving overseas buyers foreigners also are bracing for more competition in deals from chinese brokerages and other firms that recently have been permitted to launch their own private equity firms high prices also are a concern despite the importance of foreign investment into chinas corporate sector much of the m&amp a activity centers on domestic deal making deals are being driven by a rising stock market and at the same time are seen as a justification for market strength "a marked rise in m&amp a activity is fundamentally altering many listed companies earnings prospects and by extension the market itself " z ben advisors ltd of shanghai said in a june report the m&amp a trend cuts across chinas market targets include top business groups considered obvious survivors of industry consolidation and corporate minnows that might become targets because they are cheap analysts point out beijing is particularly focused on building mammoth enterprises in strategic industries including telecommunications energy and transportation though there are lots of them the local deals are often smaller and get less attention than cross border investments such as china development banks plan to buy as much as a &# billion share in united kingdom firm barclays plc a singapore airlines led bid for a &# million stake in shanghais china eastern airlines and blackstone groups &# million purchase of chemical company china national bluestar group the average size of the domestic deals announced this year is just &# million according to thomson financial small as that sounds it is more than in any year since m&amp a stands to substantially change the landscape of chinas stock market by building bigger business groups that enhance shareholder value "this is only the start of this trend " said jin yanshi chief economist at xiangcai securities in shanghai "chinas stock market will be reborn through this trend " the most obvious factor encouraging domestic m&amp a is a sharp rise in stock indexes the majority of chinese companies shopping for buyout targets are using their own stock instead of cash and the strong market makes shares a valuable currency minority holders who need to approve major transactions also tend to put up less opposition to the cost of deals during a rising market even through all stock transactions tend to dilute the value of outstanding shares the surge in m&amp a reflects more than a buoyant market analysts said the activity is tangible evidence that the interests of corporate insiders and minority investors are becoming more aligned stronger companies are emerging from the deals "now the domestic capital market is brisk and active which provides many financing options so its a good chance to do m&amp a " said qian qimin an analyst at shenyin &amp wanguo securities "it is also part of the strategies of our government " many of the deals reflect how china is using its stock market to reduce government involvement in the corporate sector typically when chinas state controlled business groups first went public on stock markets they did so by listing a subsidiary that often didnt hold the best parts of the groups assets one of the biggest factors happening now involves pumping the nonlisted parts of the group into the listed company for example as part of a consolidation in the aluminum industry aluminum corp of china in july announced plans to issue around &# billion in shares to buy what it doesnt own of baotou aluminum a shanghai listed affiliate shareholders are scheduled to vote oct similar transactions have been seen in steel and shipbuilding the market sees the deals as more than asset shuffles while the transactions tend to be hatched by insiders often government appointees analysts said they are market based transactions that require both approval by minority shareholders and an exchange of stock with a financial value the efforts dovetail with a goal announced two years ago by chinas state owned assets supervision administration commission to consolidate the business groups it controls now companies into to world class giants hostile deals remain rare in china but analysts see them on the horizon in late september a share price surge in china eastern airlines signaled to some analysts that rival china national aviation holdings air china might launch a bid for the company to thwart singapore airs buy in effort though it ultimately didnt happen while analysts said stocks have generally done well after deals some investors have been burned trying to take advantage of the m&amp a trend expectations were high earlier this year that unlisted companies would buy control of the weakest listed companies and then pump assets onto the listed company called a "backdoor listing " speculators piled into stocks based on their low price but after beijing increased a tax on trading may these stocks were hammered hard many remain under water ding zhaoyu an analyst at great wall securities said he sees a lack of incentives for top management to undertake the headaches inherent in mergers as one of the biggest risks to the trend few chinese executives have their pay tied to stock performance unlike the west where it is in the interests of chief executives to originate mergers "this trend will continue provided we satisfy the top managements interests " mr ding said bai lin contributed to this article
