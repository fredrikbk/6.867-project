one giant leap the soft beeping at and mhz in the short wave radio bands was the loudest alarm clock since pearl harbor for the first time since world war ii another nation had beaten the united states to a major scientific achievement fifty years ago this week sputnik entered space and the history books as the first man made satellite of earth it was a soviet and not an american achievement indeed weighing pounds and being inches in diameter sputnik seemed gigantic it was almost nine times heavier than the still unfinished vanguard satellite which president dwight d eisenhower had promised would be americas flagship contribution to the international geophysical year the igy was an month period in which the nations of the world would make intense efforts to learn about our planet because it was to be purely scientific vanguard was to be launched by a new rocket built without using stages and motors from long range missiles it was constructed entirely from rockets adapted from those built for science in contrast sputnik was hurled into space by the soviets very large r intercontinental ballistic missile sputnik did not seem gigantic for very long on nov the soviets launched a pound satellite carrying a part samoyed mongrel dog named laika because the climate control in sputnik failed early in the mission laika survived only nine hours instead of the hoped for days neither sputnik nor sputnik returned much scientific information on dec it was finally americas turn to try the first vanguard test vehicle lifted off the pad at cape canaveral and rose majestically to four feet where the engine failed the rocket settled back gracefully toppled and exploded the six inch diameter three pound test satellite transmitting all the way hit the ground and bounced the u s space program was a global joke and the threat of nuclear missiles from the soviet union seemed far more real than before but the u s army under the technical leadership of william pickering of cal techs jet propulsion laboratory and james van allen of the university of iowa lashed together a scientific payload it was placed on top of a launch vehicle derived from a jupiter c missile which launched the first american satellite on jan that improvised moonlet made one of the most important discoveries in space science to this day it found the what became known as van allen radiation belts which encircle the globe from pole to pole on march after a second failure a vanguard rocket finally placed its grapefruit sized vanguard payload in orbit it is still there the oldest artificial satellite of earth and still providing useful information about the shape of our planet although its solar powered radio transmitter died in it is still being tracked by telescopes in all probability the eisenhower administration was actually glad to have been beaten into space in deepest secrecy the u s was working on another satellite program a system intended to take close up photos of russia and replace the u airplane the u s worried that the soviets would object to any satellite flying over their territory and would claim that soviet sovereignty reached to the stars since sputnik orbited over the u s without objection the right of satellites to pass peacefully was firmly established before the first military spacecraft was launched in its first successful flight on aug a corona spy satellite called discoverer xiv in public returned more photos of the soviet union than all of the u flights together that first roll of film disproved forever the supposed missile gap between the two superpowers indeed it showed that the u s was probably ahead in later years president lyndon b johnson would remark that the whole space program was worth every penny it cost because he knew where every single russian missile was based it was and he did the humiliation caused by being beaten into space had other consequences president john f kennedy attempting to seize back the initiative declared on may that the u s would "land a man on the moon and bring him safely back to the earth" within the decade apollo landed on the moon on july and returned safely on july but the importance of the space race for the country was far greater in the wake of sputnik congress quickly passed the national defense education act the first federal law aiding education generally contributing large sums to the education of scientists and engineers and even linguists students were encouraged to choose scientific careers many including me did where previously it appeared that the nation didnt value scientists highly enough to create jobs for them after sputnik the american research establishment expanded steadily for more than a decade through project apollo until the beginning of the nixon administration where there was money there were jobs and the possibilities of careers spent doing what i and other young scientists in waiting loved the young men and women who studied science during the post sputnik boom created our world two fields of science high energy particle physics and space research itself pushed forward technology by asking for ever smaller electronics ever faster computing and ever faster transfers of data if your calling plan lets you telephone europe for two cents a minute instead of the &# for three minutes it cost me in thank sputnik and the geostationary communications satellites that followed in its wake if your weather forecasts are generally accurate thats because of the huge amount of data gathered by weather satellites and the electronics originally built so that more functions could be crammed onto a single satellite and if you didnt get lost on last weekends trip nor have to ask directions because your satnav plotted your route the gps system is just one more in the constellation of sputniks descendants finally the beautiful and inspiring photographs sent back from the hubble space telescope from the rovers on the surface of mars and of the earth taken from lunar orbit by human ambassadors are all part of the legacy of sputnik and the race to space which it started to adapt the words of neil armstrong from the surface of the moon sputnik was one small step for the soviet union and the first of many giant leaps for humanity happy th mr zimmerman a physicist recently retired as professor of science and security at kings college london he was previously chief scientist of the u s senate foreign relations committee and science adviser for arms control at the u s state department see
