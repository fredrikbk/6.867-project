nightmare in nigeria how blunders and neglect stoked an african air tragedy downpour dark runway spell end for children crisis across the continent port harcourt nigeria just shy of her th birthday owanari amachree told her diary she was too young to figure out what she called lifes puzzle theres still plenty of time she wrote "i still got like or years left " a day after her th birthday owanari died in a plane that smashed into the ground at the airport here the capital of nigerias rich oil industry the runway lights were off in part because the airport hadnt bought a generator the plane crash investigators said should never have tried to land a storm was lashing the area but the pilots didnt know that because the airport didnt have its own weather warning system it also had only one firetruck owanari and many other victims appeared to have survived the impact but died later when engulfed in flames owanaris father says he found her with her fists clenched in front of her as if shed been beating on a window pane she was one of children returning from boarding school who died in the dec crash of nigerias sosoliso airlines flight they and others who perished were like many victims of african plane crashes casualties of widespread neglect that makes this continents skies the most dangerous in the world africa accounts for less than of global airline traffic it accounts for roughly of crashes for decades african aviation has suffered from antiquated planes crumbling airports broken equipment and poorly trained pilots the broadest reason for the dismal safety record is simply that governments havent enforced minimal standards powerless or in some cases dishonest regulators allow ill equipped carriers to fly with little regard for safety airports stay open without electricity or qualified air traffic controllers emergency services lack equipment or disaster plans the multitude of blunders behind the crash that killed the children from one school was particularly striking given that just a few weeks earlier a crash by another nigerian jetliner had taken lives a public outcry followed the one that killed the children and nigerias president fired nigerias civil aviation director fidelis onyeyiri and its air traffic management chief emperor onasanya neither could be reached for comment "theres a lot of corner cutting at the expense of precious nigerian lives " said the then president olusegun obasanjo at a meeting of aviation officials according to press reports of the gathering the government took some steps to improve air safety after the crashes it barred planes older than years concerned that many airlines couldnt afford training and maintenance it raised their minimum capital a move that forced more than carriers to close nigeria also made its civil aviation authority independent of elected officials seeking to end years of meddling by politicians with financial stakes in dodgy carriers but a year later yet another nigerian jetliner this one flown by an airline called adc crashed on takeoff killing under pressure to remove his transport minister mr obasanjo switched the official babalola borishade to another ministry mr borishade couldnt be reached for comment at the nigerian ministry of transportation today suleiman kassim permanent secretary for aviation says the government is investing millions of dollars in new infrastructure such as radar and runway lighting and is training safety inspectors and air traffic controllers parents of the children killed in the sosoliso crash have been educating themselves on air safety and many are doubtful that current efforts will bring real change "if another crash happens theres no sign that the government is ready " says joseph ajilore an oil company manager who lost a teenage son in the sosoliso airlines crash months ago on that sunny december saturday nimi and kunbi amachree had risen early to pick up their daughter owanari at the airport she and other children were coming home for christmas from loyola jesuit college a high school in abuja miles away the family had arranged a surprise party for her th birthday also to be celebrated owanari had gotten on the honor list she dreamed of going to johns hopkins medical school in baltimore one day "she had it all mapped out " her mother says port harcourt children who attend the boarding school once traveled to it by bus as crime on nigerias crumbling roads rose in the s parents felt the hour trip had become too dangerous when the small sosoliso airlines started flying the route in parents flocked to it flying had its own risks in july an air france plane narrowly avoided disaster when it landed in port harcourt amid a herd of cattle which had wandered onto the runway through gaps in the airport fence in november isaac okemini a government economic official was on a sosoliso flight that made an emergency landing he recalls telling his wife that the carrier was "an accident waiting to happen " a month later he the amachrees and other parents arrived at port harcourts airport around noon chatting as they waited for their children to land no arrival information had been posted because as often was the case at the airport the electricity was out nigerias aging grid cant handle surging demand although port harcourt is a gateway to nigerias oil rich niger delta the state owned airport never got funding for a backup generator the mcdonnell douglas dc flew most of its route in fair weather according to the official crash report the problems started as it approached its landing as a coastal city port harcourt is subject to abrupt weather shifts even so the airport had never bought its own meteorological equipment air traffic controllers had to rely on information from the countrys national meteorological agency updates they received only at half hour intervals the pilots didnt get even the latest of these updates when they radioed in at p m for landing instructions and a weather report controllers gave them the state agencys bulletin from p m had the tower relayed the p m one the pilots would have known the weather was worsening at p m the pilots checked again asking specifically whether it was raining controllers said no four minutes later controllers told the pilots of approaching rain they didnt alert them to the severity of the storm ahead at p m as torrents pounded the airport controllers cleared the plane to land according to the crash report they cautioned that the runway was slightly wet but they neglected to convey another piece of information the wind had changed direction making landing far tougher the pilot didnt ask for wind information and the tower didnt offer it investigators later concluded the plane probably encountered so called wind shear sudden changes in airflow that can slam a plane to the ground landing in high winds and rain is hard enough but the pilots were hindered by yet another failing administrators of the airport had ordered the runway illuminated only at night unless a pilot specifically requested lights the sosoliso crew didnt so despite the storm the runway lights remained off at this point the pilots might have considered waiting to land until the weather cleared investigators say instead still unaware of how bad the weather was near the ground they proceeded as planned "since the crew was not expecting danger there was no way they could have been prepared " angus ozoka chief investigator on the case said in an interview the pilots descended below the so called decision height of feet beneath which aborting a landing is far riskier approaching the runway the plane was buffeted by the wind the last thing kechi okwuchi who was one of the two survivors remembers is agitated passengers gasping as the plane sped toward the ground seconds from landing the pilots tried to abort and climb again it was too late the tail section bounced off a grass strip feet left of the runway when the plane came down after the bounce it might have skidded to a jarring stop but another blunder interfered this one involving the airports design a rainwater drainage ditch and culvert ran close to the runway as the plane hit the ground a second time one of its two engines caught in the depression and was sheared off according to the crash report now the jetliner began to disintegrate chunks cartwheeling half a mile down the airfield many passengers were still alive at this point according to eyewitness and investigators reports many might have survived investigators say had the airport been prepared for a crash instead it had no ambulances its one firetruck soon ran out of foam and water as workers tried to rescue passengers flames engulfed the plane back at the terminal parents at first knew nothing of the crash from their waiting place outdoors they couldnt see or hear the runway suddenly the lights inside the terminal building went on parents spotted smoke one parent kosmos ntemuse broke open a gate and sprinted to the wreckage he searched for his year old son emmanuel the dead child was still inside the plane mr okemini the economic official says he dashed onto the runway with a young daughter and covered her eyes as she screamed "there were lots of bodies all over the place " he says "the firetruck was just sitting there " word spread that survivors had been taken to an emergency medical center andy ilabor a physician whose three children were all aboard the flight rushed to the center he says he found only a dilapidated bungalow where two badly burned victims lay unattended on the dirty floor with intravenous drips in their arms nearby a janitor was raising dust with a broom the next day dr ilabor and his wife went to the morgue dozens of bodies lay piled outside in the steamy air wet from an early rain he says his son chuka a gangly year old who towered over his parents had wanted to study medicine in america chukas body was so mangled his mother identified him by his big toes which bent like her husbands she also found the body of their daughter buso they never found another daughter year old nkem introverted and prim nkem had been writing a novel which remains unopened on a computer at home her body was one of six never identified mr ajilore the oil company manager identified the remains of his son wole four days later through dental records just as another family was about to bury him as their son the crash killed people in all since the crash parents of the children of sosoliso flight have been fighting to improve nigerias air safety they sued the government and the airline and have refused settlements seeing the still delayed trial as a way to publicize the need for change for a year on the th of each month they placed newspaper ads reminding nigerians of their "fallen angels " an ad last october headlined "whos next " ran days before the crash that killed more people port harcourts airport shut down for repairs after the crash remains closed in april authorities revoked sosolisos operating license for failing to meet new capital requirements efforts to reach officials of the airline for comment were unsuccessful ms okwuchi the only student who survived is undergoing burn treatments in texas she is attending a hospital school and thinking about applying for college in the u s "my life is almost back to normal " she says the ilabors have launched ilabor angels a charity for orphans and aids patients and are hoping to have more children "the whole house is empty and lonely " mrs ilabor said recently as she gazed at photos of her three children on the living room walls upstairs their beds remained untouched since the morning of dec
