based fuel looms while the price of ethanols primary component corn had risen that is squeezing ethanol companies profits and pushing some ethanol plants to the brink of bankruptcy financing for new ethanol plants is drying up in many areas and plans to build are being delayed or canceled across the midwest as investors increasingly decide that only the most efficient ethanol plants are worth their money some ethanol companies are "under deathwatch" now says chris groobey a partner in the project finance practice of law firm baker &amp mckenzie which has worked with lenders and private equity funds involved with ethanol that could be fine for big efficient players like archer daniels midland co one of the nations biggest ethanol producers by output adm and other big ethanol companies probably can ride out the storm even though they might have to scale back on their production smaller players may not fare as well and may be snapped up by bigger survivors the downturn exposes the industrys reliance on political support in washington which has offered tax credits to refiners to blend ethanol with gasoline as well as tariffs on imported ethanol and other measures some lawmakers and the bush administration are pushing corn based ethanol as a complement and substitute for gasoline amid tight and unpredictable global oil markets ethanol companies are seeking increases in pending energy legislation in the amount of ethanol refiners are required to use at the same time food cattle poultry and other interests are quietly nudging lawmakers to pull back on subsidies that encourage ethanol production and have indirectly led to increases in food costs due to the increase in the price of corn and other grains "its probably going to get worse before it gets better " said brian bolster a vice president in the investment banking division at goldman sachs group inc which has invested in at least one ethanol plant he nevertheless remains bullish over the

than seven billion gallons ethanol might be faring better if the transportation infrastructure was more amenable to the fuel but the pipelines in place arent ideal for transporting ethanol because the
