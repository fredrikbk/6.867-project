politics &amp economics north koreas economic fog pyongyang reveals little clouding outside analysis seoul south korea south korean president roh moo hyun wants to focus on economic cooperation when he meets north korean leader kim jong il this week but that could be a challenge because no outsider really knows what is going on in the norths economy the meeting in pyongyang with mr kim expected to take place wednesday will be the second between leaders of the two koreas mr roh plans to offer aid and capital projects to the north his aides say and about south korean business leaders including the heads of samsung electronics co and hyundai motor co are joining mr rohs person entourage but some south korean researchers and economists who follow north korea closely want mr roh to focus instead on pushing the north to engage in substantive economic research and disclosure with outside help if necessary that would help south koreans understand the impact of their investments and lay the groundwork for north korea to engage financially with the world including joining the international monetary fund and world bank though north korea is known to be one of the most impoverished countries in the world mr kim conceals economic data leaving researchers to make some extremely imprecise measurements analysts at south koreas unification ministry for instance take rulers to satellite photos of corn fields to estimate crop output north koreas economy is believed to be only a third the size it was years ago statistics from trading partners suggest it is getting worse with north korea shipping fewer exports and taking in more imports market entrepreneurialism does appear to be taking root in some places defectors and visitors say "people are very busy surviving " says dong yong seung economist at samsung economic research institute who visited north korea in june "the mechanism to make your own money exists for some " it is unclear whether mr roh will discuss economic data and broader liberalization with mr kim mr rohs spokesman and other government officials have discussed the summit agenda in broad terms only mr kim agreed to jointly study the future of the korean economies when he met mr rohs predecessor in but nothing has been done since "if you can start to get that grand picture it would be a really nice result " says jo dong ho a professor at ewha university in seoul who has been studying the north korean economy for years moon jung in an international relations professor at yonsei university who advises mr roh and will attend the summit says he thinks there is room to talk about economic liberalization with mr kim noting the north korean leader has made more public visits to businesses and economic projects than to military ones this year "a moderately larger opening of north korea will not undermine kim jong il " mr moon says chinas economic liberalization several economists note began in the late s with the decentralizing of economic information and vietnam signaled its opening to the world by inviting outsiders to survey its economic situation the risk to mr roh is that mr kim will see such actions as a challenge to his power rather than as opportunities to spur north koreas economic growth mr kim and his father kim il sung before him maintained their dictatorial power for five decades through fear and an iron fisted grip on information including economic data under the kims the country has never released gross domestic product information or published price indexes in its own currency it occasionally estimated gdp in u s dollars though without underlying data it hasnt provided trade data since the s what little information that comes out of pyongyang is often contradictory north koreas per capita national income for was either &# according to a speech by a north korean official who visited washington in or &# according to a filing to the united nations a year later none of that stops government officials intelligence agencies military analysts and economists from trying to quantify the north korean economy the most complete data are the so called mirror statistics that show the flow of goods in and out of the north by its trading partners chiefly china south korea and thailand north korean defectors are the next best source for information the researchers say followed by getting into the country for an up close look then things get creative the souths unification ministry combs through tv and radio broadcasts from the north for economic tidbits such as a mention of a new factory or completion of a construction project though much of it may be inaccurate the ministry relays it to other researchers in a book published this year on the north korean economy nicholas eberstadt economist at the american enterprise institute in washington created a chart showing how north koreas gdp for years since could be gleaned from a handful of broadcast statements submissions to the u n and official speeches including just one by kim il sung the most comprehensive analysis of north koreas economy is the south korean central banks annual study which even breaks down performance by industrial sector the bank of korea released figures last month saying north korean gdp fell from to &# billion but that precision is an illusion the bank of korea says and many other economists say the study overstates north korea wealth under the latest bank of korea data per capita income in north korea now exceeds &# putting the country above what many international aid agencies define as poor the korea institute of national unification a think tank affiliated with south koreas unification ministry estimates the norths per capita income to be about &# mr jo the ewha professor thinks it is more likely about &# shin chang sik who leads the bank of korea study acknowledges the distortions caused by the banks methods but he notes that its consistency for nearly two decades has yielded at least a glimpse of economic trends in the north the bank of koreas work starts from data supplied by south koreas intelligence agency that the bank cant verify then the bank applies a price index from south korea because there is no pricing information available from the north that step produces the big distortion because few goods and services in the north are likely to be as expensive as in the south finally it applies south korean exchange rate valuations to the north which also muddies the picture mr shin says he discusses the problems every year with other north korea watchers but with so much basic information missing from the north mr shin says "there is no alternative to what we do " sungha park contributed to this article
