has air travel become mass transit yes good a number of letters to the editor writers recently complained that air travel is "now amounting to mass transit in the skies" "the sardines on jetliners are rude " sept well duh thats precisely what it is and a wonderful thing too thanks to this mass transit i can get from boston to texas in a morning for under &# if i had to drive it would take me days and id spend more than that just on gas yes i have to spend minutes in a security line and take off my shoes but thats a small price to pay to deter terrorists yes there are delays because of weather and mechanical problems but i would prefer a delay to having my plane crash as for flight attendants whose primary responsibility by the way is safety not hospitality they are at least as hospitable as department store clerks receptionists customer service reps etc and under far more stressful conditions if you dont think flying coach in a jet is luxurious try flying miles in a cessna if you really think you deserve four star service in the air you can always charter a flight as for me ill take mass transit thomas f harrison cambridge mass
