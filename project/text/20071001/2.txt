americas democrats vs central america americas only socialist senator traveled to costa rica last week but it wasnt to work on strengthening ties between our two nations vermonts bernie sanders went to san jose with rep mike michaud d maine to aid the local opposition to the u s central american free trade agreement which has not yet been ratified by that country the congressional visit was strategically timed as one of seven signatories to cafta and the only one that hasnt made it official costa rica has only until feb to adopt the legislation necessary to join the pact but first it must be ratified and time is running out the costa rican congress has been gridlocked on the matter so on sunday there will be a national referendum asking the electorate to decide directly messrs sanders and michaud were invited by the leader of the countrys anti cafta movement otton solis their role was to boost the "no" campaign by declaring that the rejection of cafta will not affect the preferential access to u s markets for a variety of costa rican products that now exists under the caribbean basin initiative reps charlie rangel d n y and sandy levin d mich sent a similar message by letter to mr solis in january harry reid and nancy pelosi sent a letter last week to the costa rican ambassador in washington telling him the same the idea is to undermine the reciprocity argument that might help get cafta approved it is odd that u s legislators are going out of the way to discourage the opening of markets for u s exporters but egging on costa ricans to defeat cafta also runs contrary to u s political interests cafta is an essential tool for strengthening democratic capitalism in central america if it is killed in costa rica it will be a victory for venezuelas hugo chavez who is trying to drive a wedge between latin america and the u s and help iran put down roots in americas backyard according to the latest polls the race is a statistical dead heat anti cafta strength is partly explained by the countrys powerful and well organized labor unions led by the union for the governments monopoly electricity and telecommunications company known by its spanish initials as ice the union resists cafta because it would force competition in wireless and internet services though it would do nothing to disturb the ice monopoly in fixed line telephony and in electricity the ice union is joined in its opposition to cafta by other public sector unions notably teachers as well as by intellectuals the university set and a surprising number of radicalized costa ricans whose most important political issue seems to be anti americanism the anti cafta campaign has been marked by violence and intimidation costa rica is often held up as a model for tolerance and democracy in the region and if nothing else the fight over cafta reveals just how far left this nation has tilted the hard left might not be a majority but it is certainly a force that threatens the nations civility a cafta defeat is likely to pull the country further in the direction of the anti globalization extremists there are also enormous economic costs associated with rejecting cafta costa rica would be the only country in central america without an institutionalized commitment to open trade and investment with its neighbors and with the u s this would inflict grave damage on its investment profile things could get even worse if panamas fta with the u s is ratified by the u s congress as is expected import barriers in costa rica would be likely to divert trade and capital flows to more open markets in that case efficiency productivity and growth will almost certainly suffer in telecom for example costa rica is already falling far behind its neighbors because of the ice monopoly many of its services are unreliable and modern technology that other countries take for granted hand held wireless devices such as blackberries for example are but futuristic dreams for costa ricans at some point foreign investors comparing costa rica to its neighbors are bound to respond negatively to the countrys declining competitiveness in a sector so tied to productivity in a sense sundays vote is a referendum on whether costa rica should move forward by integrating with the modern world or cling to its closed economy and nanny state traditions mr solis a losing presidential candidate in last years election wants to preserve the past though it is hard to see how he can make it work wages pensions debt service and higher education drain of the budget every year law enforcement the judiciary roads and ports are being starved the government simply doesnt have the money to build a modern telecom network two weeks ago the pro cafta campaign took a big hit when a leaked memo revealed that a member of president oscar ariass cabinet had been counseling the use of hardball tactics as a way to win votes then messrs sanders and michaud arrived to shore up the solis agenda thats when the free trade side bounced back up in the polls the visit from the gringos seems to have widely insulted the costa rican nation not least because it doesnt appreciate u s politicians meddling in its internal affairs but there may have been something else that angered the locals here were two protectionists promising to leave the u s market open for costa rican goods even after the death of cafta they smelled a rat within days costa ricans learned just how protectionist these "friends" of mr solis are mr sanders always votes against free trade and as recently as last year he and mr reid voted against the caribbean basin trade partnership act which provides duty free access to the u s for costa rican textiles mr michauds web site boasts of his opposition to cafta in defense of maine jobs these notorious protectionists would champion trade preferences or a new fta for costa rica after cafta that was perceived as an insult to costa rican intelligence one local politician called them "wolves in sheeps clothing " the fact is that cbtpa expires in september and the caribbean basin initiative can be terminated by the president if beneficiaries dont make an effort to liberalize moreover protectionist sentiment is growing on capitol hill and trade preferences for countries that refuse to open their own markets are coming under scrutiny both sen charles grassley r iowa sen max baucus d mont have suggested they might not continue in other words if costa rica rejects cafta it should be prepared to lose its preferential u s market access thats a price that even mr soliss followers may not be prepared to pay which is why he invited his friends down from washington see related letter "letters to the editor free trade treaties mean impoverishment" wsj oct
