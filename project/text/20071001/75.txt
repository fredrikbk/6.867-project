americas at credit suisse group in new york "they obviously were affected by it but relative to other crises they held up quite well thats probably a good indicator for continued issuance from those areas going forward " mr bunzel said even in the u s stock issuance is expected to be brisk as investors focus on growth sectors like technology and health care based on the backlog of deals and the number of scheduled road shows in which presentations are given to prospective investors a slow september should give way to more activity in the months ahead "there is certainly a great deal of optimism " said joe morea head of u s equity capital markets at royal bank of canadas rbc capital markets in new york "the backlog is stronger than it has been in more than a year this could prove to be an exceptionally active fourth quarter " one ipo sector in the u s that was hit hard in the third quarter isnt expected to fare well going forward there was waning interest in financial services

high profile financial services deals in the u s pipeline alternative asset manager och ziff capital management group llc and private equity firm kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co may not be able to

inc which jumped the day of its august debut bankers said they were able to launch a number of successful deals even after the broader market indexes turned south largely because the new companies were in strong growth segments such as technology "thats in part a reflection of the underlying quality of those companies that came public i think wall street has been successful in telling companies

major force for the region "nearly of latin american issuance came out of brazil " mr bunzel said "its a large country with a large economy and the only country in latin america that truly has a liquid domestic market it also has an economy that rewards entrepreneurship " mr bunzel said while activity will continue to be strong in brazil in the future he also expects more deals from mexico colombia and countries in the southern tip of south america
