can secs cox win playing the middle sides still far apart on holder proxies some seek do over securities and exchange commission chairman christopher cox has largely been able to smooth ruffled feathers and push through policy objectives but now a plan unveiled in july on elections of corporate directors is straining that approach after a federal appeals court asked the sec to clarify its position on whether companies could exclude shareholder proposals related to the election process the sec put two different rules out for public comment mr cox a republican was the swing vote for each proposal mr cox voted with the commissions two democrats for a proposal that would allow shareholders with a stake in a company to propose changes to bylaws governing the election process he said he favored this rule still he voted with the two republican commissioners for a rule that would do the opposite and allow companies to reject such proposed bylaw changes by putting both rules out for comment mr cox sought to foster more debate and buy time for the commission to work out a compromise before his self imposed year end deadline but the commissioners are no closer perhaps are further apart and public comments which are due tomorrow arent expected to point the way toward middle ground so far shareholder groups arent happy they say the level is too high especially for some big companies others protest the additional disclosures required by groups that want to propose changes business groups oppose access on the grounds that it will allow special interest groups like unions to win seats and lead to fractious board meetings they support the rule that would codify the previous standing to reject such proposals some shareholder groups are pressing for a do over and on thursday barney frank the massachusetts democrat who heads the house financial services committee said just that the sec needs to "start over " mr cox is wringing his hands over how to proceed he lost a key supporter when commissioner roel campos a democrat who voted for greater shareholder access left the commission the other democrat annette nazareth is expected to depart by years end it isnt likely that a new democratic commissioner will be seated by november when the agency is tentatively scheduled to vote on the issue congressional democrats are in the early stages of coming up with recommendations on candidates for the president who nominates commissioners that could shift support to the proposal favored by republican commissioners paul atkins and kathleen casey mr cox is adamant about meeting the deadline and has been creative in finding solutions people close to mr cox say he is leaning toward voting for the republican supported proposal that would deny access those people say that approach has the advantage of having a rule in place for the proxy season and opens an opportunity to revise it to allow access the following year some investors and democrats are prodding mr cox to extend the deadline some investor groups say they dont expect to file many access proposals for next years proxies
