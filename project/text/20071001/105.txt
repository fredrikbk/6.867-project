trigger happy journalists they are immature shooters and have very quick trigger fingers " says an anonymous lieutenant colonel "why are we creating new vulnerabilities by relying on what are essentially mercenary forces " asks a nameless intelligence officer "they often act like cowboys over here " says an unidentified commander ever since a recent shootout in downtown baghdad newspapers have been ablaze with charges that private security contractors in iraq are trigger happy this rush to pass judgment is hardly surprising frequently derided as "mercenaries" and "rent a cops " security contractors make an easy target for war opponents as a former employee of a major blackwater competitor i find this categorical smearing of contractors to be starkly at odds with my experience i served as an officer in the navy seals for six years after i left i joined a private security firm and was promptly sent to iraq contrary to the popular belief that blackwater contractors are "thugs for hire " most are highly professional and well trained blackwater operates the worlds largest private military training facility its contractors working in iraq are drawn from the ranks of former military and law enforcement officials many of its workers are former seals or veterans of other special operations units the risks these workers assume are underscored by the infamous ambush in fallujah in which four blackwater contractors were murdered and mutilated to date blackwater has lost contractors for all anyone knows last months incident could have turned into another fallujah had blackwaters contractors reacted differently the details are still terribly unclear the contractors and the u s diplomats they were escorting claim they were ambushed yet iraqs ministry of interior almost immediately issued a report declaring that the contractors were " guilty " prime minister nouri al maliki has charged that the operators killed "in cold blood " with conflicting reports condemnations should not be made until the joint iraqi u s investigation is completed the media however has accepted the ministry of interiors version of events all but writing off the accounts of both blackwater and the state department this follows a long established pattern of unfounded claims in the press about security contractors for instance numerous reports reference contractors making over &# a day far more than active duty soldiers some point to the more than &# million blackwater has received in state department contracts in order to denounce security firms as war profiteers the truth however is that contractors are cost effective blackwater contractors for example are generally paid &# &# a day more important unlike u s servicemen they usually receive no benefits and are paid only for the days they work security contractors at the better firms have typically retired from active duty or left the military on their own accord after extended service they are honorable veterans who have chosen to risk their lives to protect american diplomats in a war zone instead of depleting our armed forces security contractors allow the government to recapture its investment in these men during wartime and avoid the extraordinary expense of training new recruits in short theyre already trained and experienced and cost money only when theyre needed another common myth is that contractors are above the law true the june coalition provisional authority order exempts contractors and other diplomatic personnel from local prosecution but that doesnt mean that contractors have been granted blanket immunity from prosecution in fact the order clearly states that this immunity is limited only to acts necessary to fulfill contracts indiscriminate attacks on civilians as alleged in last months incident are not covered contractors are also subject to numerous u s statutes and regulations as well as international treaties just last year congress amended the uniform code of military justice to include contractors contractors can also be prosecuted under the military extraterritorial jurisdiction act of which permits charges to be brought in federal court for crimes abroad like soldiers security contractors are sometimes forced to make split second decisions with enormous consequences they must be and are accountable to our government for their actions but the people i worked with in iraq including veterans working for blackwater were hardly rogue cowboys i did however meet some trigger happy journalists over there mr ryan is a former u s navy seal officer who spent time in iraq as an employee of triple canopy a private security firm
