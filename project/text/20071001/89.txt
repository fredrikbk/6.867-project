special education when should taxes pay private tuition a decade ago tom freston then a top viacom inc executive began a legal battle to force new york city to pay for his sons tuition at a manhattan private school for children with learning disabilities today the u s supreme court is set to hear arguments to resolve the central question of the case must parents of special education students give public schools a chance before having taxpayers reimburse them for private school tuition how the justices respond will have broad implications for school budgets and the movement toward "mainstreaming " or educating disabled children in regular classrooms mr freston pledging to donate any proceeds has said the fight is about principle not money under a landmark special education law now known as the individuals with disabilities education act school systems must provide a "free appropriate" public education to disabled students congress alarmed that schools were warehousing kids with special needs in poorly equipped classrooms said that wherever possible the children should be placed in the "least restrictive environment" often the same classrooms as their nondisabled peers in about of special education students spent or more of the school day in a regular classroom up from in nonetheless the act permits parents to seek public financing for private schools if they can establish that the public schools cant meet their childrens needs about of the nations more than six million special education students are educated in private schools or in private residential facilities at public expense the events leading to todays case date to the s when mr frestons son who suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and other learning disabilities began his education at the private stephen gaynor school in and the family sought special education evaluations from the new york city department of education which came up with plans to educate him in a public school each time the family rejected the plan as inadequate and sued for an administrative hearing and both times the city settled agreeing to pay the gaynor schools tuition in after another evaluation the city recommended that mr frestons son be placed in the new york city lower lab school for gifted education the boy was to be placed in a fourth grade special education class with students and one teacher for nonacademic subjects like gym and art he would be with nondisabled peers he was performing at grade level in math and a teacher testified that another student with similar skills attended a mainstream class but the family thought the math class wouldnt be appropriate sent the boy to gaynor and asked for an administrative hearing to get repaid for tuition which was &# mr freston won his first two legal rounds in an initial administrative hearing and before an appeals board the board of education took the case to u s district court in manhattan where a judge found that a family couldnt receive tuition reimbursement unless a child first attended public school an appeals court reversed that decision saying the boy shouldnt first have to be subjected to an inappropriate public placement before attending private school the u s solicitor general on behalf of the federal government is backing mr freston before the supreme court mr freston declined to be interviewed about the case in a statement he said he contributed reimbursements he received from the city and will donate future ones to a special education support center in a public school he says he is pursuing the case so other children "without jumping through hoops " can attend appropriate schools "regardless of their familys financial means " mr freston left viacom in after serving as chief executive officer in recent months organizations including the national school boards association and the u s conference of mayors have urged the court to side with new york saying the costs of increased private placements would drain school budgets in the school year new york city spent about &# million on private school placements the city itself recommended that of the most severely disabled be sent to private facilities about other parents asked the city to pay for private school over the systems objections in about half the cases the children never enrolled in public schools before making the requests the city couldnt provide data on the outcomes of these cases mr freston and his supporters assert that private placements are still relatively rare and are hardly overwhelming to most school districts the new york city school system for example has a &# billion budget and million school children including kids in special education mr frestons brief says the tuition at the gaynor school was actually &# less than it would have cost the average new york city school to educate his son apart from the financial debate new york and other school officials say that the freston familys request flies in the face of the education law parents who seek private schools that teach kids with disabilities are depriving them of the social and academic benefits of being included in the general population they say "theres a strong presumption in the law that what is best for children is the least restrictive environment mainstreaming as much as possible " says tom hutton a senior staff attorney with the national school boards association in alexandria va but mr freston and disabilities advocates say the education law first and foremost ensures that students receive an "appropriate" education even if it is in a separate school in his statement mr freston says the education his son now years old received years ago has meant he can now "successfully perform in a mainstream school and i believe this is the opportunity every parent and child deserves " his son attended gaynor for four years gary mayerson director of the autism speaks federal legal appeals project which also filed a brief supporting mr freston calls the schools mainstreaming argument a "pretext" to cover up inadequate services children with autism and other disabilities "cannot afford to waste six months" in an inappropriate placement he says "by that time the damage has been done "
