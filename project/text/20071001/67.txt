politics &amp economics myanmar issue is unifier left right join call to defend activists overreach danger washington myanmars democracy movement has emerged in a political environment polarized by the iraq war as a rare unifying cause bringing together democrats and republicans and groups as varied as hollywood stars and evangelical christians but a number of foreign diplomats and lobbyists have voiced concerns that the white house buoyed by nonpartisan support could overreach in its drive to defend myanmars democracy activists and hurt its cause in recent days as myanmars military junta forcibly cracked down on street protests comedian jim carrey and first lady laura bush emerged as leading voices advocating an international response many human rights activists are pledging to intensify bipartisan cooperation as the push increases to punish myanmars generals and their financial backers outside the southeast asian nation formerly known as burma "burma is a place where the line between good and evil is absolutely clear " said tom malinowski of human rights watch an advocacy group in washington "its one of those issues were theres not a partisan divide " over the weekend myanmars military junta offered no signs that it would heed the international communitys call for it to engage in a dialogue with the opposition the juntas crackdown and curfew left the capital of yangons streets largely empty and the united nations special envoy to myanmar ibrahim gambari failed in his attempt so far to meet with the juntas leader gen than shwe mr gambari did meet with the opposition leader aung san suu kyi and a number of the juntas other top generals mr gambari "looks forward to meeting senior gen than shwe before the conclusion of his mission " the u n said in a statement the aggressive american response to the myanmar crisis isnt sitting well with everyone in washington however and it isnt certain that the kind of economic sanctions being discussed would work one area critics point to is the white houses talk in recent days that it may force u s energy company chevron corp to divest itself of its stake in a myanmar energy project chevrons yadana gas pipeline serves as a major source of hard currency for the myanmar junta and human rights activists charge it has contributed to human rights abuses inside the country a claim chevron denies forcing chevron to sell might not necessarily work in the democracy activists favor said one industry official working with chevron any sale of the companys stake likely will bring profits to myanmars junta the official said while allowing a country like china to take it over "you wonder if the white house is going to think any of this through " the official said "or are they going to be cowboys" in an effort to support the burmese a senior bush administration official said no decision has yet been made on chevrons myanmar project after years of debate over the white houses policies in the middle east senior bush administration officials are quietly voicing relief that a foreign policy initiative is receiving such uniform support on the left and right in the u s president bushs decision last week to impose financial sanctions on myanmars leading generals was lauded by liberals and conservatives white house strategists said they are crafting other tools to pressure myanmars military and its supporters in china southeast asia and the corporate world they said they are working to freeze out myanmars ruling elite from the global banking system and to dry up outside investment in the countrys oil and gas sector still a number of asian diplomats say they are concerned about how a new u s sanctions regime might play out in their region they say that for any actions to work they must be tightly focused on myanmars elite and coordinated closely with the countries with the most influence particularly china india and russia otherwise they could only make matters worse for myanmars masses "myanmar is already one of the poorest countries if sanctions are very carefully and surgically applied it might have some effect the negative effect might be bigger " said south koreas foreign minister song min soon in an interview he added that if the sanctions are poorly implemented it could give myanmars rulers an "excuse" to repress its people more an unlikely stalwart behind washingtons emerging policy on myanmar has been mrs bush in her nearly seven years in the white house the first lady has rarely defined herself as an outspoken champion of foreign policy issues but the year old mrs bush has taken an aggressive position on myanmar urging the u n to pressure myanmars junta to enact political reforms and regularly meet with burmese dissidents and political activists last week she took to the airwaves arguing in nearly religious terms it was the worlds responsibility to defend those fighting myanmars military junta "im also obviously very concerned for the safety of the protesters and the people of burma " she said in an interview on voice of america "i want them to know were praying for them "
