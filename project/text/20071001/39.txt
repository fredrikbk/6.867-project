its yahoos lawn but this artist says keep off the grass why tech giant whacked its swampy art installation trouble with berkeley sedge when yahoo moved into its sunnyvale calif headquarters six years ago it kept peace with local authorities by buying and installing &# worth of public artworks now yahoo says it is suffering for its art on its front lawn the technology giant installed a work by new york artist sharon louden that paired real wetlands grass with artificial cattail like reeds the grass grew the city complained last year to rein in its overgrown yard yahoo dispatched a grounds crew with weed whackers artificial reeds were cut bent and twisted the artist horrified responded with letters from her lawyers which were met with letters from yahoos lawyers "they turned my art into a bad miniature golf course " ms louden says as negotiations continue over who controls yahoos front yard the company has found itself caught at the intersection of two artist friendly laws one that made the company install art and a second that essentially prohibits the company from messing with it like sunnyvale many cities across the u s have embraced the "percent for art" movement typically cities ask or require companies to allocate of their construction budget to buying and prominently displaying art often in exchange for tax cuts or use of public land in philadelphia and portland ore such ordinances are responsible for dozens of commissions typically city committees approve the potential purchases while owners are responsible for maintaining the art sunnyvale passed its art in private development ordinance in the citys requirement that new developments place art in public view has been controversial with companies and real estate developers says nancy bolgard steward the citys superintendent of arts and recreation but yahoo was enthusiastic ms bolgard steward recalls it formed an art committee that rejected dozens of proposals before selecting three including a series of bronze doors around the campus a nod to yahoos role as an internet portal and a revolving metal sculpture in a fountain the committee also tapped ms louden whose post minimalist work has been collected by insurer progressive corp and at&amp t ms louden proposed creating a landscape that would mimic the natural wetlands that border yahoos campus but with a high tech twist she offered to plant white wires clumped into grassy patches and topped with inch reflective squares during the day the wires would blend into the surrounding grass at night the reflectors would catch the headlights of passing cars on matilda avenue and her marsh "grass" would glow mary ritchey an art consultant yahoo hired to help with the project says the idea was a hit with the committee "they didnt want anything fancy or flashy " ms ritchey says "her piece was beautiful because it was so subtle " for a swampy effect ms louden insisted that yahoo plant a billowy grass that wouldnt need mowing and would grow no more than inches high around her groupings of reflector tipped wire after leafing through the color encyclopedia of ornamental grasses she illustrated her proposal with images of three types she liked a clumpy sesleria heufleriana a low growing bamboo called pleioblastus auricomus and a puckered carex plantaginea but unfamiliar with california flora ms louden says she left it to yahoos landscaper to pick a grass suited for sunnyvale dennis taniguchi the landscape architect yahoo hired chose carex tumulicola or berkeley sedge which he explains is hardy and grows into wispy bunches with arching blades mr taniguchi says he told yahoo and ms louden that the grass would deliver the desired effect but could also grow up to two feet in ideal conditions ms louden says she wasnt told that detail "we were making a lot of decisions quickly " mr taniguchi says "we werent sitting around pondering grass " in june ms louden finished installing her work "reflecting tips " yahoo paid her &# then the berkeley sedge grew and grew last fall a city recreation employee noticed the tall grass on yahoos campus and reported it to her bosses says ms bolgard steward the citys art superintendent in october the city told yahoo its overgrown front lawn needed tending yahoo sent a crew to cut the grass with string trimmers nearly half of the wires were severed in the process over the years other wires had become bent to the ground or twisted into shapes shortly afterward yahoo told ms louden about the damage the artist and company agreed to wait until springtime to address repairs but on march ms louden says the plan changed she received a call from yahoos senior facility manager who she says told her that terry semel then yahoos chairman and ceo was unhappy with the work and wanted it removed mr semel sits on the board of the los angeles county museum of art and was recently a board member of new yorks solomon r guggenheim museum he declined to comment in a phone conversation the next day ms loudens dealer oliver kamm says he and a yahoo senior facilities manager agreed that ms loudens clumps could stay he says they discussed flying her to california to survey the damage and paying her &# to repair damaged wires but according to mr kamm the facilities manager said that yahoo intended to tear out the sedge having already ordered &# worth of lawn grass as a replacement two days later mr kamm says the facilities manager sent an email suggesting ms louden not book her flight yahoo tore up the lawn on april yahoos legal director tad ravazzini emailed ms loudens dealer and her lawyer photographs of what they called the "improved site " which showed closely mowed green grass where the sedge had been plus a new border of perennial flowers "i am confident these photos will assuage sharons concern " mr ravazzini wrote the artist howled mr kamm the dealer called his lawyer the attorney reminded yahoo that sunnyvale had approved the installation in part because the grass mimicked the wetlands behind yahoo "what remains of the work " lawyer john cahill wrote on april "mimics nothing so much as a miniature golf course or the median of a shopping malls parking lot " in early may ms louden flew to california she says she was "devastated" at the sight of her remaining wiry patches standing like corn stalks on a silky lawn in a may letter mr cahill accused yahoo of breaching its agreement with the artist and violating a number of laws the lawyer invoked the little known visual artists rights act of which aims to prevent intentional modification of public artwork without the artists permission before this act many courts had ruled that owners were within their rights to repaint or remove public works by the likes of alexander calder diego rivera and isamu noguchi congress passed the law after the federal government was criticized for using welding torches to remove a foot long richard serra sculpture from manhattans federal plaza the job was done in the middle of the night yahoo says it is satisfied with its new look lawn in a may letter to the artists attorney mr ravazzini wrote that the company had been "willing to dedicate reasonable resources" to working with ms louden to improve the site but the artists legal threats "handcuffed" the company he says by summer talks stalled ms louden says she tried to appeal to jerry yang the yahoo co founder who succeeded mr semel as ceo in june by calling the company directory and leaving mr yang a voice mail in it she says she suggested cutting out the lawyers and finding a way to fix her piece she says her call was not returned mr yang declined to be interviewed in a statement yahoo said it is committed to preserving both its art and its relationships with artists "given that yahoo is a culture of innovation and creativity we are very supportive of local artists and appreciate the opportunity to display various artworks on our property " it said elsewhere in sunnyvale more public art is going up a new lowes store satisfied its quota by installing a giant concrete and slate wall mural depicting the history of the tool at moffett towers an office development now being built artist cliff garten has a &# million commission to add works including "the great ellipse " a foot long berm of earth that hes covering in a floppy grass called festuca rubra says mr garten "they know what theyre buying a sculpture "
