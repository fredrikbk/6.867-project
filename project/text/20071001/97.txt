the money game dealing with deadbeats what do you do with clients who are really slow to pay sometimes you just have to cut them loose joshua silverss medical supply business has grown substantially over the past years thanks to his commitment to developing client relationships and its because of those painstaking efforts mr silvers says that he gets a lump in his throat when he has to tell a nonpaying client that its time to cut their ties "you realize you would have been better off without some accounts even those with good volume because they owe so much money " says mr silvers president and chief executive of xcel supply llc in evanston ill "once in a while i make a hard decision which is ive got to get rid of these people because theyre killing me " businesses were stiffed to the tune of &# billion in according to a study released last year by aca international a minneapolis based national association for the credit and collection industry and pricewaterhousecoopers eventually &# billion was recovered that year through collections larger companies usually do a better job of preparing themselves for bad debt losses than small companies says terry callahan president of the credit research foundation in columbia md and in most cases he says big firms reserve a higher amount for bad debt than they actually incur for small companies though delinquent payments are often an acute crisis since many depend on those funds to cover their own expenses small business owners often try to work with clients to resolve the issue and get at least part of a debt paid off sometimes though they have no choice but to face the unpleasant task of filing lawsuits and cutting ties a drastic measure that would have seemed unthinkable during a companys lean infancy and many firms that go through such episodes then set up formal payment policies to ensure that such predicaments dont happen with future clients "its just as difficult to end a client relationship as a personal one " says dawn bijou janes president of mn insurance group inc an insurance agency in hopkins minn "you think maybe if i hang on for another six months it will get better " ms bijou janes says she recently won a small claims judgment for &# against a client of five years who refused to cancel a policy he no longer wanted obligating her agency to pay the premium trying to work it out many small companies first make the effort to salvage the relationship with a delinquent client michael franz director of the washington small business development center in seattle says businesses should try to determine whether a customer is contending with financial difficulties and might be able to recover a company thats enduring prolonged problems may still be able to settle even a part of its debt "try to communicate with them " mr franz says "most small business vendors will give you an honest picture and opinion as to the chances of paying the bill in total " dave hirschkop didnt allow a bankruptcy to deter him from salvaging a relationship with a customer whose legal and financial woes saddled him with a &# unpaid bill "we try to avoid" cutting ties says mr hirschkop chief executive of daves gourmet inc a san francisco based condiments and salsa company "the only time we ever tell a customer that we cant do business " he says "is if they have payer problems and theyre rude and demanding in a way thats problematic " he saw the reorganization as a way for the client to make a fresh start and start paying bills on new purchases "were still doing business with them because were now earning" money from them he says mr hirschkop also considers whether payment problems arise from a drastic personal situation particularly among his mom and pop customers whose businesses are just as significant to the companys bottom line as bigger buyers mr hirschkop says he "bent over backward" to help the family of a small business whose owner had a stroke including counseling the customers son on how to run things in his fathers absence "yes we do want to get paid " he says "but we also want to help them out " sometimes communication efforts fail however leaving small business owners no choice but to cut ties and pursue legal action jean dufresne a principal with space architects + planners in chicago says he was concerned about possible repercussions including damaging the firms reputation of filing an &# lawsuit against a client who knew numerous players in the local business community as well as other clients but he decided that any threat the client may have posed to the architectural firms professional relationships paled in comparison with developing a reputation as a business that could be easily bilked "we didnt want to set the standard of businesses thinking they could just walk all over us and that we just roll over " says mr dufresne who works with one other principal and five employees ms bijou janes the insurance agency owner says she attempted to resolve the payment issue with her client via email and regular mail for more than four months before going to small claims court slow payers can be just as devastating to small businesses as clients that dont pay at all they are a drag on business profits because they raise costs and lower available cash says mr franz of the washington small business development center indeed small businesses continually have to draw funds from other sources or even take loans to pay for supplies services and employee efforts expenses a late payers money would have covered about of small businesses cite slow payers as one of their most significant payment concerns according to an estimate by the national federation of independent business a trade group in washington d c "its the million dollar question for small business owners is it better to have a slow payer or no payer at all " says bradley hass president of great lakes logistics inc a transportation brokerage company in romeoville ill for mr hass its the latter he ended a relationship with his largest customer which brought in &# million in sales for two consecutive years and comprised &# of great lakes logistics profit annually the customer typically paid its bills to days after an invoice was sent that forced mr hass to regularly rely on a line of credit to cover the customers bills which cost him &# a month in interest about of the companys total profit from that account great lakes logistics is still struggling to recover from losing such a large revenue stream but ending the relationship proved fortuitous the customer filed for bankruptcy several months later he says to avoid being burned again many companies are adopting pre emptive measures ms bijou janes now spells out payment obligations and cancellation procedures in handouts that require a customers signature she also is more careful about choosing her clients among the warning signs clients who ask to post date a check or complain about a minimum down payment requirement "there was some embarrassment at first" about being stiffed says ms bijou janes "but then i thought about what could have prevented me from being in this situation " jenaly technology group inc a seven employee information technology firm in portsmouth n h established a credit policy that it communicates to clients and consistently enforces says mj shoer the companys president in its early days the company would order and ship products before receiving payment but that policy changed after five years and customers now must make a payment before jenaly will place an order on their behalf "were not in a position to be a bank " mr shoer says jenaly assesses late charges for payments not received within days after days an account is placed on credit hold meaning the companys software blocks employees from entering clients work or support requests unless the client speaks with the office manager about its payment issues "when we have to do this repeatedly " says mr shoer "its no longer worthwhile to do business " the company is even offering incentives to keep payments current clients who prepay a full year of service instead of paying monthly receive one month free to avoid uncollected debt mr hirschkop the salsa company executive requires cash on delivery after customers fail to pay or pay late even just once before "we may have let things drag out for six months " he says "now were fast " some customers may gripe about the policy he adds but they comply mr silvers the medical supply executive now employs a full time credit and collections department at xcel supply the company checks customer references from businesses vendors and banks he says he also takes credit cards and absorbs any fees as an incentive to getting paid upfront "its been a very expensive education but a worthwhile one " mr silvers says "we wont make those same mistakes twice " ms barlyn is a writer in
