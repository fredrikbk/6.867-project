burmese days mae sot thailand i survived years in a burmese jail seven of those years were spent in solitary confinement my only crime was to give a speech now i am concerned for the well being of the hundreds of people who have been arrested in recent weeks in burma the arrests began when burmas generation students group the name comes from the uprising when troops opened fire on student demonstrators killing thousands began protesting on aug the protest was in response to the dramatic increase in fuel prices the burmese regime responded swiftly and brutally by arresting the leaders of the protest in the middle of the night these activists will likely be sentenced to years imprisonment without trial trials dont exist in burma having experienced the brutality and cruelty of the interrogation centers and prisons in burma i have no doubt they are being severely tortured there are rumors that many have been hospitalized all of these activists have previously served lengthy prison sentences like mine life in a burmese prison must be the closest thing to hell the regime breaks all international laws even those it has agreed to uphold torture is the main method of interrogation and intimidation the idea is to degrade humiliate and break our spirit by methods such as electric shock heavy shackles and inedible and odorous food and water i was shackled and chained for two and a half years while shackled i was forced to crawl over sharpened stones all the while being severely beaten of course i was not allowed to see a doctor they put my body in prison but i decided they could not have my mind we were not permitted to read or write and were given barely enough food only after four years a visit from the international committee of the red cross icrc loosened some of these restrictions but most of the medicine and supplies the icrc brought us were taken away and sold by the prison authorities if we needed injections the same few needles were used for all of us the number of deaths in prison due to hiv aids is unknown in june the president of the icrc in an unprecedented action strongly denounced the regime publicly for major violations of international humanitarian law the icrc has not been allowed access to burmese prisons since during my first two or three months in prison i was very depressed i wanted to see my parents talk to my friends and take a bath then i decided that to survive i would put these desires out of my mind and concentrate on how not to die in prison i had to survive to deny the burmese military victory over me and the aspirations of all my comrades my buddhist religion instilled in me by my parents along with daily meditation kept my mind focused and sharp for buddhists monks are revered above all others even to touch a monk is forbidden therefore to see monks being humiliated by having their robes publicly removed and by being arrested beaten and shot is an outrage in such a devoutly buddhist country when i now think of those monks and the imprisoned democracy activists min ko naing and ko ko gyi and other generation leaders i am sad but hopeful these brave friends dared to defy the authorities with peaceful demonstrations against a mismanaged economy knowing full well they were risking jail if not death i know they will survive because they like me believe in the rightness of our cause more importantly they believe in themselves the regimes violent crackdown against peaceful protests in did not solve the problems facing the country nor will its brutal response to these demonstrations taking place almost years later after decades of civil war and years of military rule it is clear that the regimes approach is not the solution without genuine dialogue leading to a permanent political solution there can be no positive outcome for the country the world was not watching in when thousands were killed by the guns of the regime they are watching now the people of burma must not be let down again mr myint a founder of burmas national league for democracy youth and the generation students group served years in a burmese prison seven in solitary confinement
