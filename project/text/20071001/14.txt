diors latest makeover focuses on the grown ups paris two years ago dior chief executive sidney toledano suddenly panicked after the company sold t shirts in a single day worried that the more than &# tops trendy among teenagers who liked the brands slogans such as "jadore" across the front were hurting diors cachet he abruptly pulled the plug "we needed to stop the power of the t shirt " says mr toledano "the brand has to stay exclusive " at the time dior was struggling against one of the biggest challenges facing high end fashion maintaining both a youthful buzz and exclusivity in an industry obsessed with youth creating hype among young consumers is vital to making a brand desirable and profitable but as dior discovered too much of a young following risks damaging a brands prestige and potentially denting its prospects for long term growth two years later dior is in the midst of a delicate rebalancing act the french fashion house is trying to attract a sophisticated consumer one likely to stick with the brand for years it is replacing t shirts and pink logo bags with &# python skin purses after years of fashion shows inspired by homeless people and biker chicks mr toledano promises an "elegant" collection when dior puts on its semi annual womens ready to wear fashion show today in paris the evolution at dior is part of a subtle realignment rippling across fashions upper echelon guccis racy advertising several years ago sparked outrage from older magazine readers though it helped give the label credibility among younger shoppers today gucci is cultivating a prim image with knee length dresses at its fashion show in milan last week at the same time as selling &# crocodile bags in its stores louis vuitton had a hit with its colorful murakami purses in which swung from the arms of thousands of teenagers in tokyo but recently limited its run of &# patchwork bags to beyond the budget of all but the most established wealthy "dior gucci and vuitton need to preserve their high ground to serve a larger and larger audience " says luca solca a luxury goods analyst at sanford c bernstein in london when mr toledano joined the brand in diors image was languishing its business split between a fading couture line for older women and dozens of licenses for leather goods mens wear and womens suits "we needed to show a young image not talk about the dior from " recalls mr toledano bernard arnault the chief executive of diors owner lvmh moet hennessy louis vuitton poured hundreds of millions of dollars into advertising and flashy new stores and buying back licenses that had cheapened the brand mr toledano hired three star designers one each for womens clothing mens clothing and jewelry accessories boomed and logo bags and perfumes drove customer traffic dior never abandoned its high end couture business but it broadened itself re establishing its fashion credibility with young consumers which helped bump it into the black womens wear designer john galliano sent black motorcycle jackets and frayed denim down the runway generating buzz among the something in crowd the brand flooded its stores with key chains hanging with charms and little t shirts plastered with diors logo cheaper products that young consumers could afford the brand became so hip that mr toledano began to notice that even his teenage daughter wanted to wear dior the fresh sexy image resonated with older consumers too who liked the youthful fashions mr toledano says the work paid off dior has turned a profit every year since sales grew more than last year to &# million many of its rivals in attempts to craft their own renaissances followed in diors footsteps but dior soon began to realize how fickle young consumers can be in japan one of the biggest luxury goods markets mr toledano noticed shoppers in their teens and early s would flip flop among other brands such as louis vuitton and gucci in addition they usually bypassed diors expensive leather bags in favor of small canvas accessories emblazoned with the dior logos "consumers just went after the branded product " he says diors recent strategic shift demonstrates just how wobbly success in the fashion industry can be brands from gucci to hermes must sell different product segments in dozens of countries at the same time and often they struggle to make their message unified and desirable year after year "the search for eternal youth is part of every brand " says dana telsey the head of luxury goods consultancy telsey advisory group in new york "but they have to appeal to the teenager her mother and her grandmother to be big " two years ago mr toledano and mr galliano began to prepare for the celebrations of two landmark anniversaries at the fashion house the centenary of founder christian diors birth and the labels th anniversary this year the pair examined how they might better draw on the brands history in order to fine tune it mr toledano began phasing out entry level products such as the t shirts and small logo bags in favor of a more sophisticated look and clientele that he felt was both coming into vogue and in line with the brands roots at the same time the high from diors return to profitability was beginning to fade and he began feeling pressure to ramp up profits in operating profit margin fell for the first time in three years to from the previous year he hoped elegant bags and shoes would help restore double digit growth diors new look took its cue from the runway but the sophistication didnt always stick mr gallianos couture show in july with draped silks and fallen chandeliers was followed several months later by a goth like ready to wear replete with black bandanas and heavy boots nor was mr galliano always on board with the new style direction a year ago prodded by messrs arnault and toledano to do more suits the designer presented a drab collection that was panned by fashion critics "its very difficult for management to provide the inspiration " says jean jacques picart a fashion consultant who has advised dior and lvmh over the years but mr toledano was determined to make dior seem more grown up when the revamped lady dior line of bags hit stores in japan last year using more exotic skins such as python and with a starting price tag of about &# versus about &# previously it quickly became a hit among the something crowd the very demographic dior is trying to attract and the jump in sales of expensive products also suggests dior is successfully tapping a higher level of consumer sales of bags costing more than &# have tripled in recent months mr toledano says when dior celebrated its th anniversary in paris last month the list of celebrities highlighted the fashion houses new strategy the guest
