tom hermans tax tip not ready you can get an extension memo to procrastinators the tax filing deadline is april but if you need more time file for a six month extension as millions of people do each year its a simple process you dont even need to give the internal revenue service a reason the extension is automatic as long as you file your request on time and include a proper estimate of your tax liability the irs says just remember though that getting an extension only gives you extra time to file your return it doesnt give you any extra time to pay taxes that may be due if you dont pay what you owe by the deadline you will owe interest and you may also get hit by a late payment penalty please dont write me as some readers have to say you read in some irs publication the filing deadline is april not april it really is april take a look at an irs news release dated jan which says "taxpayers will have extra time to file and pay because april falls on a sunday in and the following day monday april is emancipation day a legal holiday in the district of columbia " so how come some irs publications say april "officials recently became aware of the intersection of the national filing day and the local observance of the new emancipation day holiday after most forms and publications for the current tax filing season went to print " the irs said but an irs spokesman says if you file for a six month extension it will only be to oct not oct the april deadline applies to tax returns whether filed electronically or on paper it also applies to requests for extensions whether filed electronically or on form available at irs gov as well as to tax year contributions to a roth individual retirement account or traditional ira and it applies to individual estimated tax payments for the first quarter of this year send questions on taxes to askdowjones sunday wsj com and include your name address and a daytime telephone number questions may be edited we regret that we cannot answer every letter
