eyes on the road amid fuel economy emissions debate gms lutz says horsepower still sells product chief issues challenge to green critics online edition here in the temporary capital of horsepower nation new york city bob lutz general motors corp s vice chairman for product development worldwide last week painted a bleak picture of the automobile fuel efficiency and global warming debate swirling around the auto industry today and he had a challenge for the industrys green critics mr lutz never one to shy from jousting with the industrys detractors faces a difficult task in his role as chief product strategist for the worlds largest auto maker on the one hand he says "the simple naked fact is every time you come out with a vehicle with more horsepower it sells better than the old one with less horsepower " thats why gm is eager for the crowds at the new york international auto show this week to notice not just the three cute chevrolet micro car concepts on display but also two horsepower buicks video and a hummer h with a v engine packed under the hood video other auto makers flaunted high performance creations including hybrid gas electric technology leader toyota motor corp even honda motor co named the greenest automobile company by the union of concerned scientists used the show to tout what is for honda a hot rod a special edition of the honda s sports car that honda describes as "the closest thing you can get to a honda built racecar with license plate holders and a horn " at the same time leaders of congress and the president who agree on very few issues these days are in harmony in calling for auto makers to do more to cut co emissions and oil consumption including boost the average fuel economy of new vehicles by a year for the next years bolstering the case for more aggressive standards studies like a recent paper from the union of concerned scientists arguing that auto makers could build a minivan with about &# in extra equipment that would exhale lower volume of greenhouse gases and generate about &# in savings to consumers over its lifetime paying back the extra initial cost in less than two years "we can have it all " says a ucs online brochure explaining the "vanguard" vans technology all of this highlights perhaps the most confusing aspect for consumers of the debate over automotive fuel efficiency and its connection to global warming everyone is talking past each other mr lutz says market trends show consumers arent willing to pay more for vehicles that use expensive new technology to get better mileage walter mcmanus a researcher at the university of michigan says thats just wrong his analysis of recent vehicle pricing and sales trends is that sales of gas guzzlers have held up since only because car makers have discounted them heavily in a recent paper he wrote that the average price of a large suv fell by &# between and while gas prices rose by adjusted for inflation during the same period auto makers over the past decade have tended to build cars that are faster and heavier but mr lutz says thats a response to market demand in a country where gas is cheap and that with modern technology just making cars slower wont make much difference to their fuel intake "if it were as simple as sacrificing performance to get fuel economy thats the first tradeoff wed make " he says his accounting of the cost of improving fuel economy "take all of the available technology spark injected direct injection dual cam phasing electric power steering active battery management where the battery only cuts in when the alternator sends a signal that it needs it go to lower rolling resistance tires all of that gets you at a cost of &# &# " he says phase two he says is hybrid technology such as the starter alternator system used to extend the mileage of gms saturn vue "now you are adding &# on top of that and that gets you another you are short and now were out of ideas " out of ideas he says unless theres a government subsidized push to transform the current gas fueled vehicle market into a market in which all vehicles can burn ethanol ideally distilled from low cost materials such as wood chips and operate in all electric mode much of the time mr lutz acknowledges that a lot of people including political leaders in washington dont buy the idea that little can be done to improve on current technology without substantial costly investments "i know after you write your article the union of concerned scientists will bombard us with letters saying what mr lutz says is absolutely not true theyre just trying to sidestep the thing again the technology for achieving these goals is readily available it costs very little "my challenge to them is come to my office meet with me and my staff show us your technology and if it works and its cost effective and readily available we will gladly meet the target using your technology gladly come to my office next week if at all possible run dont walk " as of the time this went to publish a representative for the ucs couldnt be reached for comment meanwhile mr lutz says all these conflicting pressures including wall streets demand that gm stop losing so much money in its home market are forcing gms management to re think future product strategy "several programs we were embarked on we have elected to put on temporary hold until we figure out how its going to come out " he says that includes potentially putting on hold plans to produce a rear wheel drive version of the chevy impala he says "meeting these accelerated and very very steep standards would consume the quasi totality of our investment in engineering resources " mr lutz says "so thered literally be nothing left over to work on new architectures if the choice is you can either spend the money meeting the law or spend the money to do the cars youd like to do but you cant do both then you are compelled to meet the law " send comments about eyes on the road to
