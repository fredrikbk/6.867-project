getting going what we want to hear drowns out the rest just tell me im right as investors we face a heap of uncertainty including inflation rate fluctuations gyrating markets and tax code changes to make matters worse we could be forced to sell our investments at short notice because say we lose our job or we get hit with hefty unexpected expenses its unpleasant to live with all this so what do we do we hunt for reassurance especially in turbulent stock market years like but this hunt can lead us astray at issue is a behavioral phenomenon known as confirmation bias we like to think of ourselves as rational observers of the world weighing the facts and reaching well reasoned conclusions but in truth we all have our beliefs and we latch onto nuggets of information that support them while shrugging off dissenting views and conflicting evidence "confirmation bias is so pervasive that it affects people without them realizing it " says meir statman a finance professor at santa clara university in california that brings me to a recent example from my own finances as i look around the global markets i cant find much to get excited about but japanese stocks are an exception tokyos year bear market hit bottom in april and the nikkei stock average has rebounded handsomely since then still i think the recovery has a ways to go all of which meant i was initially pleased when i recently read a financial newsletter that was advocating japanese stocks and then i caught myself the reason i had long thought the newsletters editor was an idiot and yet here i was taking solace in his opinion think youre immune to confirmation bias if you are a regular reader of this column ask yourself this question why do you keep reading my articles sure i like to think i offer brilliant financial insights served up in peerless prose but the reality is i am not warren buffett and i am not charles dickens either i peddle a limited array of prosaic ideas worse still i revisit these ideas all too frequently so why do you keep reading its no great mystery you dont read my columns because they open your eyes to the financial world instead you read them because they confirm what you already believe there is nothing wrong with this provided you and i have truth on our side but what if we dont its hard to imagine there can be anything wrong with saving diligently keeping investment costs low and betting on stocks for the long haul but maybe were making some fundamental assumption that will prove badly flawed one possibility suppose history turns out to be a rotten guide to the future and stock returns fall far short of our expectations this isnt wildly improbable we may take comfort from the u s stock markets long history of impressive returns but as financial historians are quick to note this is history as told by the winners other national stock markets didnt fare nearly so well over the past century and some were shuttered for long periods by war and political turmoil even without some sort of calamity there is good reason to think u s stocks wont rival their historical performance in early stocks were trading at times earnings and yielded in early they are at times earnings and yield less than because stocks are more richly valued today than they were years ago returns are likely to fall short of their plus historical average i am not arguing that you should dump your stocks rather i believe we need to accept that there is great uncertainty and that our best defense is to avoid big investment bets instead spreading our dollars across a broad array of stock and bond market sectors it is those big bets that can do serious damage to our finances and where confirmation bias can be most dangerous suppose you decide rough times lie ahead for the stock market and you sell all your stocks and stock funds and then you make an even bigger mistake which is to tell your brother in law now not only is your money on the line but so too is your ego and there is no backing down "youve invested yourself not just your money " prof statman says "confirmation bias becomes more and more severe the more invested you are in the idea " on the other hand investing a little of your ego isnt such a bad idea if youre going to stick with your portfolio at times of market turmoil you need unflinching commitment my advice develop a sense of conviction about your profound ignorance i have been covering personal finance for two decades and i am continually amazed by how little i know i cant with any certainty tell you where share prices or interest rates are headed over the next year or even the next five years similarly i have no idea which highflying stocks and which star mutual fund managers will continue to shine and i dont think others can do any better predicting markets is all but impossible in part because extraordinary things happen with alarming frequency think about the past years we had the dow jones industrial average plummet on a single day in communism collapsed the u s went to war with saddam hussein not once but twice we held a presidential election and one man won the popular vote and the other won the electoral college terrorists destroyed the world trade center standard &amp poors stock index gained over in five consecutive years in the late s and then suffered three years of devastating losses faced with this sort of uncertainty and our own ignorance it makes sense to focus on controlling those things that we truly can control hold down investment costs diversify to reduce investment risk minimize taxes save aggressively this may not sound terribly exciting but it should be reasonably profitable an added bonus if we build our investment strategy around the notion that were pretty darn ignorant we probably wont have to wait very long for confirmation jonathan clements also writes the "getting going" column that appears wednesdays in the wall street journal write to him at jonathan clements wsj com
