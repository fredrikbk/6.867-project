smartmoney com selling a house fees are negotiable the real estate madness of the past several years had one side effect that may benefit todays sellers it created a glut of real estate agents "there are a lot of people out there who have been attracted to the possibility of getting of what are now very high sale prices " says lawrence white an economics professor at the new york university stern school of business consider this the national association of realtors had million members in when million new and existing homes were sold back in the association had half as many members to share in million home sales to be sure not all real estate agents have realtor certification the total number of licensed real estate agents may be twice the number of realtors according to the association now as more brokers compete for sales in a slowing real estate market savvy homeowners can save thousands by negotiating their commissions "commissions are becoming more negotiable than used to be the case " mr white says he chalks it up to several factors including more competition from discount and a la carte brokers who offer less comprehensive services than full service brokers but charge discounted sales commissions or offer buyers rebates upon closing and then theres more consumer awareness of the market thanks to web sites like zillow com anyone with an internet connection can find out what homes are for sale or recently sold in a given area in theory of course broker commissions are always negotiable setting up fixed commission rates has in fact been considered illegal since a s supreme court ruling but real estate brokers certainly dont want you to know that "the owners of the large firms want everyone to think the broker fee is " says jay michael a realtor and founder of estate property group a boutique real estate firm in chicago that firm while a full service brokerage negotiates its fees with its clients typically charging to for sellers there are a number of ways to help successfully negotiate the fee your broker charges use leverage if youre selling your home and buying a new one at the same time ask your broker if hell offer a lower commission in exchange for using his services on both transactions and the same goes for selling an "in demand" property if your house is in a good school district and you know it will sell quickly ask your broker for a commission reduction go with a smaller firm the smaller a company is the less red tape your real estate agent has to go through in order to get permission to discount his or her fee mr michael says thats because the brokers firm typically takes half of his or her commission consider the alternatives if one broker refuses to negotiate remember there are thousands of others out there some like discount brokerage foxtons based in new york new jersey and connecticut offer full range services at a fixed rate the savings according to les newlands a senior vice president at foxtons come from lower overhead expenses as the firms brokers have virtual offices there are savings for buyers too dont be shy to ask the broker for a cut of the commission especially if you found the listing yourself not an unlikely scenario these days as buyers increasingly start their home search online just keep in mind that some states prohibit brokers from offering rebates although their number has decreased in recent years as the justice department seeks legal action against such regulations alleging they restrict competition among brokers the states that still have such rebate bans according to the justice department are alabama alaska kansas louisiana mississippi missouri new jersey north dakota oklahoma and oregon even traditional full service brokers are starting to realize the need to compete on fees the average home sale commission at realogy which owns full service brokerages corcoran coldwell banker sothebys international realty and franchises century was in according to the companys annual report filing with the sec since two firms typically split the total commission that suggests the total commission averaged less than realogys figure has been declining steadily since at least when the average was but diane saatchi a senior vice president at the corcoran group a full service real estate brokerage in new york warns negotiating broker fees can be a mistake if you want your home to sell quickly brokers have more incentive to show properties to buyers where their compensation will be greater meanwhile some full service brokers say they have always given breaks to clients regardless of the real estate market at the time "ive done that for family members and for repeat buyers or sellers that have stayed with me over the years " says susan moock a realtor with keller williams realty in bucks county pa who has more than years of experience she says shes often given breaks to her sellers or a credit toward closing costs for her buyers coming out of her own
