love &amp money we want to go to london but were heading to london or maybe not to save a little money my wife amy and i have decided to merge a family vacation we had planned for later in the year with an adults only vacation we try to take annually i hit upon london as the perfect place to visit because we both love the city and it dovetails nicely with lessons our year old son is learning in school about medieval history the feudal system and castles but amy didnt see it as quite so perfect how she wanted to know were we going to manage such a trip with our daughter shell be nearly when the flight departs and amy and i agree thats too young for anything except maybe boredom and jet lag to amy that means the trip itself is a bad idea and that we should wait until both kids are old enough to enjoy the vacation i disagree why penalize our son just because his sister is too young thus were debating the best course of action for a family with kids of disparate ages do you wave bon voyage to your plans and layover for a few years as amy wants to do or do you pack up both kids as i prefer and go have an adventure i come into this debate biased by my own past my mom earned little money but worked in the airline industry which allowed us free access to airplanes and hotel rooms so i traveled the world as a kid getting lost in the basement of a castle in heidelberg germany swimming with local kids at a pool in guatemala city sipping a coke with the most hospitable shopkeepers in bangalore india as such i see great benefits in exposing my son to other lands at an age when such impressions will favorably shape his views of our world and other cultures sure we could wait several years until our daughter is older but then our son will be a teenager whod rather not be anywhere we suggest and particularly not with his parents as i see it we have five options  dont go we skip the trip until our daughter is older  two go two stay either amy or i spend the week in london with our son while the other stays home with our daughter this makes sense when one spouse isnt interested in wherever youre going however both amy and i would like to be in london with our son  three go one stays amy our son and i head off and leave our daughter at home with amys mom we did this a year ago when our daughter was too young for a trip to vancouver british columbia but neither of us wants to constantly impose on amys mom moreover i want our daughter to grow accustomed to overseas travel  five go we pay for amys mom to travel with us to help care for our daughter who will certainly grow tired of sightseeing and want to nap every day that potentially gets too pricey though id be willing to consider it if not for one fact amys mom is scared to travel internationally  four go we suck it up and all travel together i went searching for parents whove dealt with this in their own travels and the messages were decidedly mixed laura a friend in baltimore says she and her husband share a similar situation with a year old and toddler her advice "drop the idea of taking your daughter overseas " they flew to germany when their oldest was and "she was as good as any year old can be and it was still incredibly difficult to deal with the time change and lack of routine " laura says "you have lovely mental images of the four of you strolling though museums but imagine that stroll when all of you have four or five hours of sleep because your daughter was up until a m acting out running all over the place because her stomachs telling her its time to eat " laura and her husband have found that the two go two stay approach "works fantastically " her husband and older child recently spent a week in disney world while laura stayed home with the younger child "i happily had a mini vacation with only one kid to care for " she says "id forgotten how mellow life is without all the year old chatter and foot dragging " eric the husband of my friend deanna in milwaukee sees it differently "its true that when weve gone somewhere when our youngest wasnt ready she didnt get much out of it " still he has the attitude that "you do things now because in a few years there will be other travel ideas better at that time than trying to catch up with all the old ideas you passed up until your youngest is old enough " still he says "ive tried to make it special in small ways each day i want her to remember one thing and at the end of the day we review what we did to reinforce that one thing " tara a friend near philadelphia admonishes me to take our daughter because "traveling with small children changes the trip for the better " she and her ex husband worried about taking their year old to paris for a friends event to their surprise tara says "we experienced paris as never before " they found carousels on street corners theyd never paid attention to and because they didnt want to sit with a cranky toddler in a nice restaurant "we discovered street cafes and wonderful markets filled with meats and cheeses and bread that we bought and had picnics in the park " best of all tara says "kids are a unifying force with our daughter people talked to us helped us out and struck up conversations we still say it was the best vacation we ever spent together " amys big concern is the plane ride she isnt a good flier to begin with and doesnt relish managing the demands of our daughter who typically gravitates toward mom over dad "youre going to get tired of year old games quickly " she says "and thats where the problem will be " shes right im much better entertaining older kids than younger kids still amy says shes willing to "suck it up and go if youre willing to suck it up and play with her on the plane " so i guess thats our compromise were going with option five with the added caveat that im on duty for flight time entertainment while amy agrees to handle issues that might arise when were there neither of us is sure what to expect but thats always the beginning of an adventure jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal write him at lovemoney wsj com
