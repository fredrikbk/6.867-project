secs solomon cox splits vote on proxy access chairman backs change and the status quo buying time to fix rule washington christopher cox chairman of the securities and exchange commission has pushed his agency to make big decisions unanimously but yesterday faced with an irrevocable split on a thorny issue whether to allow shareholders a greater role in the election of corporate directors mr cox chose a novel tactic he voted both ways with one hand mr cox a republican voted with two democratic commissioners to put forward a proposed rule that would allow shareholders who own of a company for one year to propose changing bylaws governing how directors are elected at the same time he voted with his fellow republican commissioners to propose a rule calling for the exact opposite forbidding shareholders from putting forward election related proposals that is the stance the agency has taken since but one that was called into question last september in a federal appeals court decision the issue of electing directors has become a central battleground in the world of corporate governance and is part of a broader push by some shareholders to make boards more accountable both proposals will now go forward for a period of public comment in straddling both sides mr cox has become the swing vote on an issue that has long proved hard to solve as chairman he has often stated he wants sec commissioners to act in concert because it makes their decisions more credible in this case one of the first times he has had to make a tough call he essentially ducked yesterday mr cox said the criticism that shareholders shouldnt be able to have access to the proxy they pay for stands "fair corporate suffrage" on its head he said he favors doing something that would be "very positive to shareholders " mr cox said the reason for releasing both proposals was part of the "process" of perfecting the ideas and to solicit wide ranging comment he said any changes should be "cautious and measured " the votes represent the first divisions since mr cox took over as chairman two years ago and underscore the challenges the commission has faced for decades on the question of "proxy access " as it is known ultimately his desire to satisfy both business and investor groups may lead to unhappiness in both camps mr cox could ultimately change his mind and vote the other way in the final vote which he says will be in place this fall before next years proxy season the secs double barreled stance has raised speculation that mr cox may be preparing for an arduous fight at a tense open meeting yesterday republican commissioner kathleen casey who voted against access said she felt the sec had made its mind up months ago and wasnt interested in soliciting alternative approaches "the aggressive schedule laid the foundation for a predetermined proposal " she said the sec should instead issue a release that fosters "several different approaches seeks comment and welcomes ideas " republican commissioner paul atkins the other opponent said he was concerned that special interest groups would try to "hijack" boards to press their own interest over that of all shareholders he also questioned whether the move was necessary given other advances in corporate governance in recent years mr atkins also raised the question of whether the sec had the authority to allow shareholder access that is a major concern for mr cox who has wanted to avoid any court battles after the sec has lost four recent unrelated losses democratic commissioner roel campos who voted for shareholder access was nonetheless unhappy with the structure of the proposal he expressed concern that the threshold might be so high as to make the rule ineffective mr campos pressured the staff to say that if a final rule isnt crafted by next years proxy season the sec would take the same position it has this year which was to not intervene democratic commissioner annette nazareth who voted for access said she only yesterday became aware that the sec was considering voting to maintain its position which she called the "shareholder nonaccess proposal " the sec is also seeking comment on how nonbinding shareholder resolutions would be handled ms nazareth expressed concern that management could eliminate them without shareholder approval and put shareholders "in a worse position than they are currently " mr cox said after the hearing that such a situation wouldnt happen while he is chairman michael ryan head of the competitiveness center at the u s chamber of commerce the nations largest business lobby opposes giving shareholders any access he said the chamber is "very closely" looking at whether the sec has the authority to allow such a change to take place the chamber successfully sued the sec over its mutual fund governance rule
