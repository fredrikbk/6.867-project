terror finance u s tracks saudi bank favored by extremists officials debated what to do about al rajhi intelligence files show jidda saudi arabia in the s two bedouin farm boys from the desert began changing money for the trickle of traders and religious pilgrims in this then remote and barren kingdom it was a business built on faith and trust sulaiman al rajhi once told an interviewer and for many years he would hand gold bars to strangers boarding flights in jidda and ask them to give the gold to his brother on their arrival in riyadh today mr al rajhi is a reclusive octogenarian whose fortune is estimated at &# billion and al rajhi bank grew into the kingdoms largest islamic bank with branches in saudi arabia and more spread across the muslim world following the sept attacks the bank also set off an intense debate within the u s government over whether to take strong action against its alleged role in extremist finance confidential reports by the central intelligence agency and other u s agencies reviewed by the wall street journal detail for the first time how much the u s learned about the use of al rajhi bank by alleged extremists and how u s officials agonized over what to do about it after the saudi monarchy pledged its full support in the fight against global terrorism and following violent attacks inside the kingdom in the next two years the saudis did launch major strikes against militants operating on their soil but the saudi government has been far been less willing to tackle the financial infrastructure essential to terrorism u s intelligence reports state that islamic banks while mostly doing ordinary commerce also are institutions that extremism relies upon in its global spread as a result the bush administration repeatedly debated proposals for taking strong action itself against al rajhi bank in particular according to former u s officials and previously undisclosed government documents ultimately the u s always chose instead to lobby saudi officialdom quietly about its concerns the u s intelligence reports heretofore secret describe how al rajhi bank has maintained accounts and accepted donations for saudi charities that the u s and other nations have formally designated as fronts for al qaeda or other terrorist groups in addition mr al rajhi and family members have been major donors to islamic charities that are suspected by western intelligence agencies of funding terrorism according to cia reports and federal court filings by the justice department a cia report claims that a year after sept with a spotlight on islamic charities mr al rajhi ordered al rajhi banks board "to explore financial instruments that would allow the banks charitable contributions to avoid official saudi scrutiny " a few weeks earlier the report says mr al rajhi "transferred &# billion to offshore accounts using commodity swaps and two lebanese banks citing a concern that u s and saudi authorities might freeze his assets " the report was titled "al rajhi bank conduit for extremist finance " al rajhi bank and the al rajhi family deny any role in financing extremists they have denounced terrorist acts as un islamic the bank declined to address specific allegations made in american intelligence and law enforcement records citing client confidentiality in the bank sued the wall street journal europe after an article said saudi authorities were monitoring some al rajhi bank accounts at u s request in a bid to prevent them from being used wittingly or unwittingly for funneling money to terrorist groups the bank dropped the suit in and the journal published a statement saying its article hadnt reported any allegation that the bank supported or financed terrorism also in a u s judge dismissed al rajhi bank from a lawsuit filed by relatives of sept victims the ruling said banks couldnt be held liable for providing routine services to people who turned out to be terrorists in a statement in response to questions about suspected terrorists among its clients the bank noted that "al rajhi bank has a very large branch network and a very large retail customer base " u s law enforcement and intelligence agencies acknowledge it is possible that extremists use the banks far flung branches and money transfer services without bank officials knowledge the u s has never obtained proof that the bank or its owners knowingly facilitate terrorism according to documents and former officials despite what they describe as extensive circumstantial evidence that some executives are aware the bank is used by extremists the cia report concluded "senior al rajhi family members have long supported islamic extremists and probably know that terrorists use their bank " most major banks around the world are bound by a patchwork of treaties and agreements that in effect require them to know their customers and report any suspicious activities to regulators the rules are designed to fight terrorism money laundering and narcotics trafficking its generally acknowledged that saudi banks are bound by these rules although experts differ on when compliance became mandatory the top counterterrorism official at the u s treasury department while declining to comment on al rajhi bank specifically says saudi officials havent met a promise to create a commission to oversee saudi charities many of which bank with al rajhi "they are also not holding people responsible for sending money abroad for jihad " says the treasury official stuart levey "it just doesnt happen " the saudi government maintains it has been working diligently with the u s and others to counter terrorism it cites its arrests of several alleged terrorist fund raisers in recent years the saudis didnt respond to specific questions about their efforts to counter terrorist finance or oversee banks a white house statement said that "the saudis continue to be a strong partner in the war on terror we have made significant progress on numerous fronts including the freezing of assets and the shutdown of known conduits of terrorist funding " a cia spokesman said "publishing details of how our government seeks to track extremist financing" could undermine those efforts for the ruling saud family any confrontation with the al rajhis could be politically treacherous to stay in power the sauds rely on the tolerance of clerical and business elites many of whom view the royal family as corrupt the wealthy al rajhis are a clan long at odds with the royal family and u s intelligence files show the al rajhis also have close ties to another group critical of the royals saudi arabias conservative clerics the al rajhi empire includes hotels housing developments commodities trading shipping aviation leasing and poultry its core is the bank with more than branches in saudi arabia and other offices abroad from pakistan to malaysia for the publicly held institution reported &# billion in profit and &# billion in assets sulaiman al rajhi grew up in the nejd desert the birthplace of a severe form of islam called wahhabism that forbids birthday parties musical instruments and photographing people in the s he and a brother saleh went to the saudi capital city "from literally nothing making change on what were then the dirt streets of riyadh sulaiman and saleh al rajhi built the al rajhi bank " sulaimans lawyers told a u s court in new york in sulaiman described the business in a rare interview with euromoney magazine in with two other brothers he and saleh began changing money for pilgrims taking camel caravans across the desert to the holy cities of mecca and medina when throngs of migrant workers came to saudi arabia during the s oil boom the al rajhis helped them send their earnings home to places like indonesia and pakistan in the brothers won permission to open saudi arabias first islamic bank one that would observe religious tenets such as a ban on interest but relations with the ruling family frayed the government controlled press in publicized al rajhi banks tangential role in an international scandal of that era that of the bank called bcci u s diplomats reported then in an infant relative of the al rajhis died in a kidnapping official press accounts said the kidnappers slit the childs throat but saudi dissidents claimed police shot the child mr al rajhi blamed the royal family the cia report says although al rajhi bank continued to make a show of support for the sauds annual reports had flowery tributes to the royal family the bank began refusing to make loans to the sauds or to finance their projects u s diplomats said at the time with its islamic procedures the bank was a magnet for the clerical establishment which grew rich from alms amid the oil boom as the clerics charities spread they became entwined with al rajhi bank and the conservative al rajhi familys own extensive financial support for islamic causes there is no reliable estimate of how much the al rajhis have given to promote islam over the years but an endowment holding much of saleh al rajhis wealth gives an indication of the scale its web site details nearly &# million in direct donations within the kingdom to islamic causes and at least &# million in donations abroad the overseas money went to aid embattled muslims in kosovo chechnya and the palestinian territories and to finance islamic instruction there are indications not all the giving was for such purposes the al rajhi name appeared on a list of regular financial contributors to al qaeda that was discovered in sarajevo bosnia in the list was authenticated for the federal bureau of investigation that year by americas top judicial witness against al qaeda a onetime al qaeda business manager named jamal al fadl who is in the federal witness protection program he called the contributor list the "golden chain " a german police report said sulaiman al rajhi and other family members had contributed more than &# in to a charity that financed weapons for islamic militants in bosnia in addition to providing humanitarian aid the cia report tells of efforts by two al rajhi brothers to keep some giving secret it says that sulaiman and saleh transferred &# million to parties in germany and pakistan in december using "a unique computer code to send funds at regular intervals to unspecified recipients suggesting they were trying to conceal the transactions and that the money may have been intended for illegitimate ends " the report says extremists "ordered operatives in afghanistan indonesia pakistan saudi arabia turkey and yemen" to use al rajhi bank mamduh mahmud salim convicted mastermind of the embassy bombings in kenya and tanzania was carrying records of an al rajhi account number when arrested in germany in german police found in the cia report says al rajhi bank couriers "delivered money to the indonesian insurgent group kompak to fund weapons purchases and bomb making activities " a u s intelligence memo dated nov says a money courier for osama bin ladens second in command ayman al zawahri traveled on a visa that the bank had obtained for him the memo adds however "reporting does not indicate whether bank management was witting" of the couriers terrorist connections al rajhi bank maintained at least accounts and handled unusual transactions for al haramain foundation a charity that treasury officials say has acted as a front for al qaeda in countries until the saudi government ordered the charity shut down in late according to intelligence and law enforcement reports the united nations has designated top officials of al haramain foundation as terrorists and most of its offices now are closed according to a federal indictment in oregon a top al haramain official in carried &# in &# travelers checks from portland to riyadh and deposited them with al rajhi funds the indictment says were for the ultimate benefit of al qaeda fighters in chechnya the indicted official soliman al buthe now works for the city of riyadh in an interview he confirmed carrying the checks and depositing them with al rajhi bank but said that they werent for al qaeda and that he did nothing wrong a jidda based charity called the international islamic relief organization or iiro arranges for donors to send their donations directly to the al rajhi bank the iiros chairman adnan khalil basha says the charity is "absolutely apolitical" and has elaborate spending controls to prevent illicit diversions the charity says it works with al rajhi bank simply because its fees are low and its service is best however the u n has labeled two of the iiros branches and some of its officials as al qaeda supporters in the iiro solicited donations through al rajhi bank for the iraqi city of fallujah then largely under the control of insurgents and the base of the late abu musab al zarqawi who led al qaeda in mesopotamia the iiros workers oversaw construction of a trauma clinic in an insurgent controlled area of fallujah the u s saw the clinic as a haven for insurgent fighters and marines destroyed it in november that was "a big tragedy for us " says the iiros chairman mr basha he denies the charity had any involvement with the iraqi insurgency charity officials complain that the u s has produced no evidence of their alleged ties to terrorism two years earlier federal agents raided the virginia offices of a network of charities funded by sulaiman al rajhi that worked closely with the iiro and that according to justice department court filings provided funds to palestinian terrorists no charges have been filed a year after the attacks u s authorities began to lament the lack of saudi action in taking down terrorists financial infrastructure a november cia report said the saudi government "has made little independent effort to uncover terrorist financiers investigate individual donors and tighten the regulation of islamic charities " largely because of "domestic political considerations " the report advised against a noisy confrontation "a key factor for continued successful counterterrorism initiatives with the saudis whose society is by tradition private closed and conservative will be to ensure that their cooperation with the united states is handled discreetly and kept as much as possible out of the public eye " the u s began to rethink that approach after an al qaeda attack in riyadh in may that killed people including nine americans deputies from the national security council cia treasury and state departments debated a proposal for legal and political action against al rajhi bank including the possibility of covert operations such as interfering with the banks internal operations according to bush administration documents and former u s officials one idea kicked around was "listing or threatening to list" al rajhi bank as a supporter of terrorism such a listing can be done if recommended by a committee representing the treasury state and defense departments and the cia and nsc and signed by the president the designation bars u s companies from doing business with the named entity a u s designation also normally is forwarded to the u n and if that body puts the name on its own terrorist supporter list all member states are obliged to freeze the entitys assets other ideas u s officials discussed included enlisting friendly countries to step up scrutiny and regulatory action against the al rajhis the cia report said that "a successful effort against the al rajhis would encourage efforts against other donors or at a minimum would discourage private funding of al qaeda " ultimately the bush administration again chose merely to continue privately exerting pressure on the saudis to stiffen their oversight
