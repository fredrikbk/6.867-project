at the scene of the crime csi the experience museum of science and industry through sept chicago so youre the new recruits " a guarded but friendly gil grissom greets you and his other attentive visitors dr grissom is the fictional boss of the las vegas police forensics team from the hit cbs series "csi " "are you good with puzzles crime scenes are puzzles youll use your powers of observation and science to decipher their clues " grissom played by actor william petersen speaks from the flat surface of a larger than life size video screen but his audience is made up of real life three dimensional citizens aged maybe to grouped in a darkened room in chicagos museum of science and industry "when you arrive at the crime scene " grissom instructs "keep an open mind notice everything document everything remember the dead cant speak for themselves listen to what the evidence is saying oh one more thing if its not in the report it didnt happen good luck " so pencil and clipboard in hand you scurry into the heart of "csi the experience " a cleverly designed hands on multimedia forensic science exhibit running at the museum through sept there are three mock crime scenes to choose from in this "immersive interactive" experience most visitors have time to examine only one you a special guest will investigate all three "a house collided " where a car has smashed through a houses front wall apparently killing the driver on impact "who got served " in which the corpse of a waitress turned actress is sprawled in the alley behind a seedy motel and least gory most "child friendly" "no bones about it " a desert scene displaying a skeleton with a bullet hole in its skull "what did you see what did you hear what did you smell " a csi team member prompts from another video screen "ask yourself what is the evidence telling me " printed directions and visual cues guide you through a maze of instructional films evidence comparisons high tech acronyms layout tables and "over here over here " one young patron urges his lagging parent that most vital of chambers the autopsy room "hi " says the looming lab coated image of actor robert david hall "im dr albert robbins the victim is a white male found in the drivers seat of a car " on a real pallet beneath the video doctors gaze lies a dummy upon which a hidden projector reveals vital organs "remove the stomach " dr robbins instructs "contents prove that his last meal was a pizza " the medico pokes through its semidigested ingredients "pepperoni and heavy cheese crushed tomatoes " he gives his windy city guests a meaningful look "experience tells me he had chicago style deep dish " back in the exhibit proper the filmed remarks of a number of actual experts mix with those from the tv characters forensic anthropologist and mystery novelist kathy reichs warns "one thing you have to be really careful about at a crime scene with skeletal remains is that everything isnt still stuck together because you dont have the muscles and the tendons you have to be very careful that you get all of the little bits and pieces that are sometimes left behind " the handlebar mustachioed dr ron singer a real life forensic scientist demonstrates blood spatter patterns with a gusto that gives the mordant dr robbins a run for his money "transfer spatter occurs when a bloody object actually comes into contact with some other object and ill demonstrate that by painting my glove with blood and pressing my hand against the window " "ooooh " says one watching dad with a squeamishness that may or may not be feigned "thats gross " the father bends down and addresses his young son "ok so listen remember what he said drops of blood theyre passive " "drops of blood " the boy repeats "are passive this is transfer so they wanna know what you think the blood on this card is " all around the sprawling exhibit people young and old are rushing here and there then lingering comparing tire treads and shoe sole patterns peering at ballistics markings matching up fingerprints gaping notating deducing "the people are spending frankly a little longer in the exhibit than we expected " says kurt haunfelner vice president of exhibits and collections for the museum "we expected between and minutes were actually finding that many of our guests are spending an hour or more " drawn perhaps by its fascination with the tv show the public stays for an intense experience with forensics "its an opportunity to get into the essence of the scientific method " says mr haunfelner "were seeing every day with our guests they want to collect every clue they want to evaluate and then of course at the end you get to test your hypothesis about what actually occurred that is the essence of the scientific method and that is the core idea thats behind the exhibit " the payoff comes in a visit to a replica of boss grissoms office and a computer guided review of each recruits conclusions on screen csi style visuals re create the crime as evidence shows it must have occurred and gil grissom praises each participants work "your first impression may not have been correct so your theory changed to match the evidence congratulations you are now a rookie crime scene investigator " only after youve left the chiefs office and returned to the exhibits main space do you observe whats been hidden all along in plain sight among the databases and laser ablation devices and other high tech tools a humble magnifying glass of the sort that helped sherlock holmes identify different types of cigar pipe and tobacco ash back at the victorian dawn of the forensics age plus ca change you muse as you ponder a ish father puzzles over which conclusions to draw from the clues clamped to his csi clipboard "i think " he says "it was colonel mustard in the library with the pipe " mr nolan is editor of the just published "the archer files the complete short stories of lew archer private investigator " by ross macdonald
