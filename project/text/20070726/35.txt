faith in science vs faith in god an ancient argument persists contrary to what peter berkowitz states in the "the new new atheism" editorial page july all atheists do not share the same "errors and excesses" as christopher hitchens the crimes committed against humanity during the th century were indeed perpetrated by societies advocating secular ideas however by no means should this be used as a justification or validation for religious beliefs mr berkowitz fails to recognize that these secular ideas have the same moral foundation of the bloodiest religions they are all based on the dogma of altruism mr berkowitz also gives too much credit to the christian church for sowing the seeds of freedom and prosperity of western civilization in fact aristotle is the father of western civilization he was the first to acknowledge the power of the human mind with its faculty of reason and logic he understood that for the mind to properly function it must be free to act on its own volition with its own happiness being its primary motivator i believe in individual freedom economic and social so if people want to dedicate their lives to something other than themselves then thats fine that is their individual choice however i do take offense at being forced to behave altruistically as our current progressive tax system does now and when a government or entity has unbridled power to force altruism onto a society atrocities that occurred during the th century and the middle and dark ages will undoubtedly occur again ed ortiz san diego mr berkowitz writes that "by treating all religion as one great evil pathology todays bestselling atheists suppress crucial distinctions between the forms of faith embraced by the vast majority of american citizens and militant islam " as long as one group feels its religion entitles its members to dominate another group of people politically economically and militarily and as long as the other group believes its religion compels its members to retaliate with terrorism then religion must be regarded as a corrupting influence the belief that ones own faith is superior is a critical part of the pathology mr berkowitz also criticizes the skeptics for pointing out numerous contradictions in the bible without considering the "interpretive traditions that have elaborated its teaching " however a belief in the literalism and inerrancy of either the bible or the koran is a core part of both christian and islamic pathologies this is not to say that religion is inherently evil but it is and has always been a powerful tool in the arsenal of those who seek power if the skeptics can blunt this tool a bit by encouraging people to confront their prejudices then they are serving a good purpose david perrine dallas christopher hitchenss grounds for a justified atheism are tenuous much affirmative evidence of gods existence has been amply proven by vigorous and well funded scientific investigations of the cloak of guadalupe the shroud of turin the stigmata of st pio and of therese neumann the certified miraculous cures at lourdes the prophecies of the visionaries deaths and the onset of world war ii at fatima in and real time calibrated measurements of the physiology of the visionaries at medjugorje bosnia herzegovina since charles sykes san jose calif mr berkowitz offers a brilliant vivisection of the most recent spate of religion hating idolators of "natural science " science is a human creation not a natural creation atheists unwillingness to acknowledge stephen jay goulds acceptance of the notion that "darwinism is fully compatible with atheism" is further evidence of their non scientific prejudice against any argument that refutes their point of view further when one considers mr berkowitzs quote from the super credentialed mcgraths that "there are many questions that by their very nature must be recognized to lie beyond the legitimate scope and proof of the scientific method " shouldnt one think that perhaps the atheists might profit from a review of bohrs principle of complementarity as well after considering mr berkowitzs chastisement of mr hitchenss failure to admit that his "atheism is the rigidly dogmatic premise from which his inquiries proceed and that it colors all his observations and determines his conclusions" one can only hope "scientific atheists" make a startling inference from infinitesimal evidence that evidence consists of the physical earth and its history as perceived by scientists through instruments of their own design and creation which amounts to the consideration of a fraction of our solar system which is a fraction of our galaxy which is a fraction of the universe the startling inference from this non random and insufficient sample there is no god instead they posit spontaneous generation and the existence of intelligible but not intelligent laws at this point one can only recommend a refresher course in statistics sidney helfant professor kingsborough cc cuny brooklyn n y i sympathize with educated sophisticated religious apologists such as peter berkowitz who are able to see religion in metaphorical terms it is agreed that much good can be done in the name of its influence but a cursory look at history over the past several millennia will swiftly reveal that harm is preponderant such continues to be in todays world in the form of unethical primitive iron age "my god is the only genuine one and yours is bad" attitude of the masses that continue to languish from a pre scientific society with no understanding of the scientific processes whatsoever john m shane m d tulsa okla as has been so glibly stated in the past all religious adherents have rejected all gods but their own and mr berkowitz falls into the trap of equating a position based on lack of evidence of any gods existence as a non belief that is on a par with belief he also expresses the canard that middle eastern religions are the basis for western morals as if humanity was somehow immoral before those religions existed religion has had a fair hearing about understanding the universe but as neil degrasse tyson has said questioning the limits of knowledge stops when god is invoked given the poor standing of scientific education perhaps its time to give science a fair hearing instead alex tolley los gatos calif
