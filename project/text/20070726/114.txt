what was old is young again time and the shape of history by penelope j corfield yale university press pages &# in one of the more profound moments on "the simpsons " a successful pretzel vendor named frank recalls how he once believed he was unsuited for the pushcart trade that was "the old me " frank says "which was ironically the young me " i know its just television but its a deep remark why do we refer to the time before christ as the ancient world when in fact civilization was in its infancy then why as francis bacon asked dont we instead think of our own time as "the true antiquity inasmuch as it is a more advanced age of the world and stored and stocked with infinite experiments and observations" such questions are at play in penelope corfields "time and the shape of history " a nuanced exploration of the ways in which different views of time shape our understandings of the past ms corfields central claim is that the same moment in history can be viewed as a radical break a modest marker of gradual progress or simply and perhaps disappointingly as just more of the same take the french revolution at the time it was felt as a seismic shock as if it had pulled down the old order for good and altered the course of history seen in the light of europes halting progress toward liberal democracy with many a royal restoration and tyrannical episode along the way it seems today merely to have played a role in a gradual trend away from monarchy and in the future the french revolution may end up as just one event in a long series of continuous political struggles a series with no particular direction or pattern ms corfield reminds us that when asked whether the french revolution was a success a "wily th century politician" some say de gaulle others ho chi minh still others zhou enlai replied "its far too soon to say " this kind of observation is hard to quarrel with but it is also not particularly earth shattering its a bit like noting that a shoreline may appear jagged when viewed close up but smooth from the vantage of space ms corfield becomes more compelling when she wanders away from her main theme to offer a few asides taken together they show how different interpretations of time shape human conflict and disagreement think of whether classical greece should be seen as an old civilization or a young one what is at stake here if we view the past years as the "time after classical greece" through which classical ideas have lasted and so to speak grown old then classical greece is ancient and venerable but if we view the past two millennia as "the time before now " it is our own civilization with all that experience to draw on that is as bacon argued older and more mature neither view is obviously truer but we often rely on one or the other to settle competing claims one military historian might push for a strategy in iraq that takes instruction from thucydides account of the peloponnesian war another historian far from bowing to this ancient example might dismiss it as irrelevant or even dangerous in the th century philosophers argued over whether descartes had superseded aristotle today legal scholars not to mention ted kennedy fight over whether supreme court justices should defer to the wisdom of the founders or favor modern precedents that presumably exploit the freshly gathered wisdom of americas past but these debates pale beside other time claims certain political regimes for instance such as those guided by marxist reasoning thrive on the prospect of being the last one standing at the "end of history" the perfect state that leaves nothing for history to do afterward others have tried to dominate for the longest duration within time itself as when hitler boasted of creating a year reich such bloody quests as ms corfield shows would not have been possible without the ideas of time and history that lie at their core not all civilizational conflict however rests on such deadly views of historical time consider the arts and sciences the arabic number system the dutch idea of perspective and the copernican account of planetary motion all squeezed out their competition they became the last ones standing in their particular spheres but the history of mathematics drawing and astrophysics didnt stop with such achievements rather it enshrined them permanently and then built yet more achievements on top of them similarly golden age alexandria high renaissance rome and fin de siecle vienna each existed for one brief shining moment yet each can lay claim to a kind of permanence the first is unmatched in intellectual ferment the second in artistic brilliance the third in psychological acumen science and art unlike toxic forms of politics enable cultures to find permanent triumph without "stopping" history or conquering vast stretches of it our tendency ms corfield argues is to regard history as "all that has gone before up until the micro moment before the present moment " yet there are occasions when we do the opposite theologians speak of a gods eye view in which all events in history endure forever in what ms corfield calls "one long never ending now " science has discovered its own version of never endingness as ms corfield notes the light we see tonight from a distant star represents what was happening on it eons ago the time it takes for its light to travel to us in principle this "delay" means that on the distant star itself our dinosaurs are news in other words everything that has ever happened in human history is still happening right now somewhere such ideas are peculiarly beguiling why possibly because the notion that our existence is infinite whether in the mind of god or on the scrim of the universe serves our longing for transcendence and awe but even in the world of the here and now ms corfield shows time plays seductive tricks with our judgment guiding our sense of cultural wisdom civilizational triumph and spiritual mystery and causing us to disagree about such things seemingly forever mr starks latest book is "the limits of medicine" cambridge university press
