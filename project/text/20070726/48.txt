hurling in america has a problem too few irishmen the lure of the old sod and immigration issues make for a player shortage for five years straight the clan na ngael sports club in atlanta sent a team to the north american hurling championships that ended a year ago try as it did clan na ngael could muster only players and it takes at least to make a team "we didnt play any competitive games last year " says jim whooley vice chairman of clan na ngael "we just played scrimmage games among ourselves six on six and five on five " hurling a centuries old sport that has elements of field hockey and lacrosse has an immigration problem with the irish economy booming and the u s tightening borders irish expatriates are returning home and fewer newcomers are taking their place the new york board of the gaelic athletic association gaa has lost four of its eight hurling teams in the past three years in boston the wexford hurling club is worried it will soon lose one of its two teams and ever since the san jose calif team folded a few years ago northern californias two remaining clubs have played each other and only each other they settle the local "championship" with a best of five competition hurling "is becoming extinct " says tom flynn an irish immigrant who started with a new jersey team in and remains involved with the clubs management to keep going hurling teams enlist irish students who come to america for the summer hoping to build a new generation of hurlers they also are setting up youth leagues and as part of a recruiting push they are trying to interest americans in the sport "american born players must become the backbone of our clubs in the long term if the games are to survive out here " says eamonn gormley a san francisco web site developer and gaa member who has been trying to get hurling teams started on college campuses in northern california turning americans on to hurling will be tough to many americans hurling is just a slang term for vomiting once they learn that its a sport they often confuse it with curling the winter olympic sport played with brooms perhaps the greatest obstacle is that hurling which requires the endurance of soccer the grit of football and the finesse of hacky sack is hard to play americans who try the sport quickly find themselves outclassed by irishmen who have been playing since they were toddlers a hurling team has or players armed with wooden paddles called hurleys players tussle with another team over a baseball size sphere called a siothar there are goals at either end of the field and teams score three points each time the siothar pronounced "slit ar" makes it in a siothar that flies through uprights above the goal scores one point the hardest part of the game is learning to handle the hurley which is like an extended arm for the minutes of a match hurlers cant throw the siothar and they can carry it in their hands for only a few steps so players pass the ball with a combination of open palm slaps kicks and for extra long shots by tossing the siothar in the air and striking it downfield with the hurley when the siothar is balanced on top of the hurley a player can run for as many steps as he likes but that isnt easy with the opposing team throwing body checks and slashing at the siothar as if they were in a sword fight brian whitlow an american graduate student in san francisco tried out for a hurling team two years ago after seeing the sport on television it didnt go well in practices he rarely got the ball and when he did he never made it more than a few steps before the ball was knocked away after playing in one match he was benched he quit halfway through the season mr whitlow now has a new strategy with help from mr gormley he has organized a club for american players "the idea is to get an opportunity to play in a match and kind of learn as we go " he says irish games have been played in the u s for as long as there have been irish immigrants in the summer irish expats flock to places like gaelic park in new yorks bronx borough where they cheer from the bleachers and drink beer or magners cider over ice the new york board of the gaelic athletic association was formed in and by the clubs reckoning it has had a hurling team ever since for all that time the size and strength of u s based hurling teams have been tied informally to u s immigration policy and the strength of the irish economy until recently the new york gaa says its toughest recruiting period was the late s and early s the immigration act of had reduced the flow of irish immigration today there are two problems the strong irish economy is keeping people from emigrating or drawing them back home while u s immigration laws are making life tougher for irish who are in the u s illegally irelands gross domestic product has grown an average of annually for the past decade according to the international monetary fund more than twice the rate of the u s there were irish born residents of the u s in according to the u s census bureau down from in in there had been about the decline has accelerated in recent years as post immigration reforms particularly a new york program to verify social security numbers for drivers licenses have made it tougher for illegal immigrants to live normal lives alan gleeson a year old electrician who hurled in new york until last year recently returned to county offaly in part because his illegal status was making it harder to live in the u s "you couldnt get a drivers license so you were limited to where you could work " he says at its height in the s the new york board of the gaa had about hurling teams today there are just four offaly galway tipperary and new jersey kilkenny the decline worries john phelan a retired accountant he left ireland years ago and has been playing or watching hurling at gaelic park ever since the league he says is as small as it can be "if it goes below four were a dead duck " on a recent afternoon mr phelan and two irish friends chatted while watching new jersey kilkenny face off against galway before the game galways manager gave his team a profanity filled speech in which he encouraged his players to "use the timber " translation dont be gentle with the hurley it would take more than a pep talk over the next hour hurlers from new jersey kilkenny sent shot after shot through the uprights above the goal mr flynn the former player who has been involved with the team since the s is confident it will win its third straight championship this year but he isnt sure how much further the team can go "the way its going now " he says "we will be lucky to get two more years out of hurling in new york " corrections &amp amplifications sliothar is the correct spelling of the round ball used in the sport of
