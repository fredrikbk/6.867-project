it didnt happen barack obamas latest pronouncement on iraq should have shocked the conscience in an interview with the associated press last week the freshman illinois senator and democratic presidential candidate opined that even preventing genocide is not a sufficient reason to keep american troops in iraq "well look if thats the criteria by which we are making decisions on the deployment of u s forces then by that argument you would have troops in the congo right now where millions have been slaughtered as a consequence of ethnic strife which we havent done " mr obama told the ap "we would be deploying unilaterally and occupying the sudan which we havent done those of us who care about darfur dont think it would be a good idea " mr obama is engaging in sophistry by his logic if america lacks the capacity to intervene everywhere there is ethnic killing it has no obligation to intervene anywhere and perhaps an obligation to intervene nowhere his reasoning elevates consistency into the cardinal virtue making the perfect the enemy of the good further he elides the distinction between an act of omission refraining from intervention in congo and darfur and an act of commission withdrawing from iraq the implication is that although the u s has had a military presence in iraq since the fate of iraqis is not americas problem unlike his main rivals for the democratic nomination mr obama has been consistent in opposing the liberation of iraq in a speech he declared that "an invasion of iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the middle east and encourage the worst rather than best impulses of the arab world " but mr obamas side lost that argument and it is no longer for america to countenance genocide of arab muslims hardly seems a promising way to extinguish the mideasts flames or to encourage the best impulses of the arab world one may take the position that genocide would not be the likely result of an american retreat from iraq that is the view of mr obamas massachusetts colleague john kerry the presidential nominee mr kerry who served in vietnam before turning against that war voted for the iraq war before turning against it he draws on the vietnam experience in making the case that the outcome of a u s pullout from iraq would not be that bad "we heard that argument over and over again about the bloodbath that would engulf the entire southeast asia and it didnt happen " he said recently "it didnt happen" just as mr kerry predicted it wouldnt in his june debate with fellow swift boat veteran john oneill on "the dick cavett show " the year old mr kerry said "theres absolutely no guarantee that there would be a bloodbath one has to obviously conjecture on this however i think the arguments clearly indicate that there probably wouldnt be there is no interest on the part of the north vietnamese to try to massacre the people once people have agreed to withdraw " mr kerry acknowledged that "there would be certain political assassinations " but said they would number only "four or five thousand " here is what did happen in the u s withdrew its troops from vietnam as mr kerry had urged in december the democratic congress ended military aid to south vietnam in april saigon fell according to a investigation by the orange county register hanois communist regime imprisoned a million vietnamese without charge in "re education" camps where an estimated perished "thousands were abused or tortured their hands and legs shackled in painful positions for months their skin slashed by bamboo canes studded with thorns their veins injected with poisonous chemicals their spirits broken with stories about relatives being killed " the register reported laos and cambodia also fell to communists in time magazine reported in that some laotians had been imprisoned in re education camps "the regimes figures do not include unfortunates who have been packed off to phong saly there no pretense at re education is made as one high pathet lao official told australian journalist john everingham who himself spent eight days in a lao prison last year no one ever returns " the postwar horrors of vietnam and laos paled next to the "killing fields" of cambodia where the khmer rouge undertook an especially vicious revolution during that regimes year rule at least a million cambodians and perhaps as many as two million died from starvation disease overwork or murder the vietnamese invaders who toppled the khmer rouge in were liberators albeit only by comparison in the aftermath of americas withdrawal from vietnam hundreds of thousands of refugees fled vietnam cambodia and laos according to the u n high commissioner on refugees between and more than million indochinese escaped nearly of them by boat this does not include "boat people" who died at sea of the total by some estimates mr obamas blase cynicism about the possibility of genocide in iraq is of a piece with mr kerrys denial of the humanitarian catastrophe that followed americas departure from vietnam it also creates an opportunity for the democratic front runner in hillary clintons husband traveled to rwanda where he apologized for failing to intervene to prevent the genocide in which hutus massacred some tutsis "we cannot change the past " president clinton said "but we can and must do everything in our power to help you build a future without fear and full of hope " it was in this spirit that mr clinton intervened in kosovo in over republican objections to prevent ethnic cleansing of albanian muslims like mr kerry mrs clinton voted for the iraq war then tilted against it before facing the democratic primary electorate her opponents on the left have made much of her refusal to apologize for her vote but if she can find the courage to defend a continued american presence in iraq on humanitarian grounds it will reduce the likelihood that the next president will have to apologize for something far worse mr taranto is editor of opinionjournal com see related letter "letters to the editor exaggerated claims of violence in vietnam" wsj aug
