the daily fix drug woes for the tour de france add to sports bummer summer online edition and the latest from the tour de france once those words might have prepared you for tales of athletic courage now if youre a sports fan they probably make you cringe race leader michael rasmussen has been tossed off his team rabobank for lying about his whereabouts during pre race training alexandre vinokourov and cristian moreni have been sent packing for positive drug tests race director christian prudhomme called mr rasmussens departure "probably the best thing that has happened in the last eight days " which is putting a remarkably brave face on things so whos wearing the yellow jersey at the moment no one it will be awarded at the end of the latest stage in the sydney morning herald rupert guinness notes that mr rasmussen was jeered by spectators on the way to the close of wednesdays final mountain stage in the pyrenees thats the beginning of an exploration of the tours depressing history of doping controversies its a long history but one that seems to be crossing a rubicon with this years farcical race "when does the revolution begin " asks george vecsey in the new york times "when do the fans lining the highways in france take it personally that the magnificent men on their cycling machines have been systematically cheating for decades when do sports fans everywhere start waving their wooden pitchforks and picking up paving stones and blocking the roads to these fakes when do we hear the rolling of the tumbrels and the clatter of the symbolic guillotine " as mr vecsey notes shutting yourself off from cycling news wont stop the stink these are dark days for sports days that leave the washington posts sally jenkins surveying the sports landscape and shaking her head "everyone has their own level of tolerance the tipping point at which they abandon ingenuousness " she writes "its hard to find any plain honesty on playing fields this week suspicion is everywhere barry bonds the slug who passes for a slugger in baseball keeps hitting home runs nfl quarterback michael vick is indicted for tormenting dogs and at the moment banned from training camp steroids have supposedly shown up in golf and another tour de france leader is accused of doping if games reflect a societys values then welcome to rome just before the fall " but ms jenkins then holds her nose and steps through the muck and her conclusion is the scandal surrounding nba ref tim donaghy is the worst of all of these stories we wish would just go away "the vick case is about a vile and sadistic practice but vick is just one player " she writes "the baseball steroids issue is a cool scandal about the nature of performance and the definition of cheating a topic on which were not unanimous in fact large numbers of fans dont seem morally outraged at all judging by the box office an argument can be made that bonds still had to hit the ball but the donaghy allegations cause a place to go cold in the pit of the stomach colder than a pond of dark water a referee shaving points messes with the authenticity of well everything you have to be able to believe your own eyes " ok whoa stop the fix isnt going to pretend all of this isnt happening but for the rest of this column its going to make a concerted effort to find some distractions lets start with that citadel of positive thinking and allergy to irony new york city ha ha that was fun to write yesterday two new york baseball stars the yankees alex rodriguez and the mets tom glavine moved to the brink of baseball milestones rodriguez whos putting up mvp numbers in a personally tumultuous season hit his th home run last night as the yankees beat the kansas city royals barring something very strange a rod will be when he hits no making him the youngest player ever to hit that mark and making him the heir apparent to bonds "rodriguezs critics have fired slings and arrows for years hes a mercenary an october failure vain self centered not a true yankee etc " writes bob klapisch in the bergen record "but theres no denying his work ethic a rod trains harder than anyone in pinstripes and came to spring training in better shape than derek jeter jorge posada or even the much younger robinson cano in an age where steroids taint nearly every accomplishment no one has even hinted that a rod juiced his way to all world status instead hes done it the old fashioned way by working out before and after every yankee game the red sox mocked rodriguez for his ill timed comments about waking up at a m to lift weights but no one accused a rod of making it up " mr glavine meanwhile beat the pittsburgh pirates for his th career win leaving him one away from becoming the rd member of the win club in the new york daily news john harper hails mr glavine as just what sports needs right now "hes one of the good guys in baseball always has been and if ever there was a time to celebrate that often inconsequential detail as it applies to wins and losses it is now " another respite from the daily horrors will come this weekend when cal ripken jr and tony gwynn are inducted into baseballs hall of fame on tuesday the baltimore orioles saluted ripken on his way to cooperstown a briefly glorious interruption of a rather dismal season "for now theres something to celebrate if you live and die orioles baseball " rick maese writes in the baltimore sun "for now the trade deadline is on the back burner the hunt for a new manager is only a mild curiosity and the prospects of a th consecutive losing season arent reason to throw yourself out the nearest window just as he did for so many years ripken is saving this team in a time of need albeit momentarily " the new york suns tim marchman hails ripken but tries to detach him from the myth of cal ripken which he could do without "born and raised in maryland the son of a humble baseball journeyman he played for his hometown team and made his name not with the obscene physical talent of a rickey henderson but because of his hard work and dedication best symbolized of course by his signature trait his overwhelming need to just show up for work " he writes but then adds "this was of course the most ridiculous nonsense its possible to imagine cal ripken was feet inches pounds built like a god and blessed with enough athleticism that he probably would have been a truly great basketball player he wasnt the best possible version of david eckstein or joe mcewing but the most physically gifted player in the sport what made him unique was the overwhelming effect of his personal dedication and discipline on his unparalleled natural gifts by all accounts no one worked harder but the myth of ripken located his greatness in his will as if will were sufficient to command the greatest heights of achievement it isnt " in the press enterprise greg patton pens a nice tribute to gwynn saluting "his sunny disposition and his genuineness condescension is rampant in professional sports locker rooms but you never got that from the long beach native there is a "gee whiz aw shucks" quality about him that rings absolutely true in that high pitched voice of his ive never advocated sports hero worship or even choosing an athlete as a role model from afar too many variables too many things we dont know too many stars over the years whose auras have dimmed but if you want to admire someone you have to like your chances with gwynn " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself
