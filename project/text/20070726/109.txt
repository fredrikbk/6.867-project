quarterly wall street journal survey of major metro areas shows that the surge in inventories of unsold homes is slowing in two of those markets boston and denver the number listed for sale has actually declined from a year ago the latest trends offer some hope for an eventual recovery in a u s housing market that generally has been cooling since mid even so many economists and industry executives say that recovery will be very gradual and wont start before at the earliest thats partly because more stringent lending policies are keeping many potential buyers on the sidelines while others are holding off in hopes of prices heading even lower meanwhile there is still a glut of homes on the market in much of the country especially in florida and parts of arizona nevada and california home sales and prices generally should bottom out around mid says mark zandi chief economist at moodys economy com a research firm in west chester pa "the market will not revive quickly however " he says "it wont be until the turn of the decade before housing activity returns to more normal conditions " the message for home sellers is that they need to be flexible on price and may
