the corporate tax myth today treasury secretary hank paulson will lead a discussion on the effects of the corporate tax on our economy it will in part be a political discussion as democrats want to increase taxes on corporate capital while republicans want to cut the corporate tax rate a position championed by president george w bush but the more interesting part of the discussion may well come on two issues whether corporate taxes are an effective way to raise revenue for the government and importantly who really pays the tax economists have stressed for generations that corporate taxes distort the allocation of capital between the corporate and noncorporate sectors and that they also distort corporate investing and financing decisions this distortion prevents the tax from "efficiently" raising revenue that is the tax imposes a larger cost on the economy than it raises in revenue in the early s both the treasury department and the american law institute recommended removing one layer of our current double taxation of corporate equity capital which is subject not only to the corporate tax but to investor level taxes on dividends and capital gains in president bushs tax cuts reduced though they didnt eliminate this double taxation that the corporate tax is inefficient in these ways is not controversial among economists a traditionally less settled question has been one of incidence who bears the corporate tax burden some may be tempted with a quick answer "corporations " but that is clearly wrong the econ admonition that people pay taxes in this case suppliers of capital through lower returns workers through lower wages and or consumers through higher prices remains true even when the tax is aimed at capital and the category "owners of corporate capital" that is stockholders is also too narrow in his celebrated analysis of the corporate tax almost years ago arnold harberger showed for a closed economy that a separate tax on corporate capital would reduce returns to all owners of capital making it a tax on saving and in a framework more general than mr harbergers on investment recent research has cast an eye in a somewhat different direction showing that the tax may be borne not entirely or even principally by owners of capital but by workers globalization plays a role in an open economy with mobile capital a source based tax like the corporate tax will lead to a capital outflow reducing investment and productivity and wages indeed mr harbergers updated research on the incidence of the corporate tax concluded that labor bears not just the brunt of the tax but a burden that may be larger than the tax itself in other research assuming that the world wide capital stock is fixed william randolph of the congressional budget office finds that labor bears about of the corporate tax more generally the burden on labor is higher to the extent that saving is responsive to after tax returns and the country has a small effect on world prices of goods most of this research has relied on theoretical models albeit sometimes with parameters calibrated from actual experience but direct empirical tests of the effects of openness corporate taxes and their combination on workers wages tell a similar story a recent paper by kevin hassett and aparna mathur of the american enterprise institute analyzes data across countries and over time concluding that for countries that are part of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd a increase in corporate tax rates results in a decrease in manufacturing wage rates economic intuition suggests significant negative effects of the corporate tax on manufacturing wages because of the complementarity of capital and labor for skilled workers wage effects of this size suggest labor bears much of the burden of the corporate tax in fact workers collectively would be better off if they voted for higher taxes on labor with corresponding cuts in the corporate tax sound crazy well while this economic research has been carried out in the u s tax action has occurred abroad not only has the u s corporate tax rate been high by the standards of the rest of the industrial world but other countries continue to reduce their rates a recent survey and study by kpmg shows for example that competition for investment continues to drive down tax rates around the globe with further cuts in the pipeline from china germany singapore and britain among others the desire for these cuts comes in part from the significant responsiveness both of real investment and taxable income to corporate tax rates among our european competitors reductions in corporate tax rates are being financed by increases in consumption taxes akin to the "vote" i described earlier this is also similar to the fundamental tax reform advocated by many economists where corporate taxes are replaced by consumption taxes how much offsetting revenue or lower government spending would we need to finance a cut in corporate taxes the answer is not entirely clear the old economists maxim of "broaden the base lower the rates" is sound advice though economically wise base broadening alone is not likely to finance a significant rate cut recent research by michael devereux of the university of warwick suggests though that the revenue maximizing corporate tax rate in oecd countries is likely less than that is higher corporate investment and subsequent corporate profits and corporate tax revenue and shifts in taxable income by multinational firms will substantially reduce the revenue "cost" of a corporate rate cut from the present to say cutting the corporate tax rate would be positive for investment productivity and economic growth it would also reduce a tax burden now borne in large part or even entirely by labor bolstering wages and business responses to the tax cut will offset much of the "static" revenue cost i think secretary paulson is on to something mr hubbard dean of the columbia business school was chairman of the council of economic advisers under president bush see related letters "letters to the editor flat cats
