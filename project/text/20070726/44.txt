home &amp family cranky consumer calculating your retirement nest egg we test web tools that figure what you need to save theres no shortage of online retirement calculators promising to tell you how much you need to save for retirement but because these internet tools use different assumptions users get divergent advice even though theyre using the same numbers to assess how they compare we plugged a sample set of numbers including income savings rate and life expectancy into four different calculators then we asked a financial adviser to run the numbers for comparison each of the four calculators we tried is free and sponsored by a well known nonprofit group or company there are many others of course some more elaborate and some that charge a fee for our test we said we were a single year old man who earns &# a year a bit higher than the average u s household his only debt is a mortgage and hes got &# invested in a k account and &# in taxable accounts hes putting &# or of his income into his k annually he wants to retire at and live on of his preretirement income that is &# a year he expects to live until that may sound unlikely but its safer to overestimate given that half of us will outlive the average life expectancy his likely monthly social security benefit is &# based on his current income and expected retirement date some sites allow you to enter your assumed rate of return and expected inflation we put return and inflation but other sites make their own assumptions ballpark estimate it took about minutes to run the numbers through ballpark estimate at choosetosave org operated by the employee benefit research institute a nonprofit group the result to reach his goal our subject will need to save of his compensation or &# this year a far cry from the actually being socked away unfortunately this calculator doesnt offer much advice beyond the dire results still the tool is fast and simple and its easy enough to go back and plug in different numbers to see how they affect the final results one downside the calculator doesnt save your figures so you must re enter all of them if we push our retirement age from to for instance our subject will need to save of his compensation still not pretty but strikingly better than the earlier estimate you can also add in part time or other income to see how that affects your results go to choosetosave org and click "ballpark estimate " compare and contrast we plugged the same numbers into nationwide financial services inc s retirability check which took eight minutes to complete the site offers a "host" to walk you through each step this calculator incorporates data from boston colleges center for retirement research so savers can learn how they compare with other americans unlike most other tools nationwides calculator incorporates home equity for our sample guy we said his home value is &# and he still owes &# this tool offers a retirement readiness score with the ideal score topping our sample guy earned an the tool also offers tips to improve your score one problem the answers are general and dont seem to take our specific situation into account for instance the tool says weve got "room to improve" in the assets and debt area yet our only debt is our mortgage and weve got &# in our k versus a national average balance of &# according to the site go to nationwide com and look for "retirability check" under "investments and retirement " aarps verdict when we plugged our numbers into the aarp calculator we got a graph clearly delineating our retirement savings shortfall this tool isnt as slick as nationwides retirability check nor as straightforward as ballpark estimate but the information it provides is clear and helpful "in order to retire at age with an annual income of &# you must save &# by if all other assumptions remain the same your household can invest a total of &# per month and achieve your goal " it told us thats still a big jump from our current &# a month but at least this calculator provides a clear description of what needs to be done go to aarp org click on "money and work " then on "financial planning and retirement " and look for the "retirement planning calculator " debatable assumptions fidelity investments myplan calculator offers a quick five question tool that ends in an interactive chart besides our basic numbers it asks our investment style we picked "aggressive growth" the result we need to have saved &# at retirement to replace of preretirement income a debatable assumption since many people expect spending to stay steady after retiring the myplan tool does offer one of the easiest methods to rejigger assumptions to see how to improve results fidelity also offers a minute online tool the retirement quick check which requires free registration it told us we were on track to have only to of our preretirement income the tool is helpful in suggesting a specific amount to save an extra &# to &# a month in our case but the "action plan" page also steers you to sign up with fidelity with links to "open a fidelity ira " "portfolio advisory services" and "transfer your assets " retiring at sheryl garrett a certified financial planner agrees with the calculators our retirement outlook isnt rosy running the same numbers through her financial planning tool she finds "he cant make it all the way through his th year " the page report from ms garrett founder of the garrett planning network in shawnee mission kan provides more detail than the online calculators such as a graph that offers clarification of how an "average" investment return can yield wide variations depending on whether the highs come early in your savings years or late pushing retirement to age upping our savings slightly and seeking
