wells take voyage to bottom of the sea smaller oil and gas fields lower costs lead to a boom in pumps on the ocean floor gulf of mexico standing on the deck of anadarko petroleum corp s independence hub platform crew chief darwin nichols cant hide his enthusiasm "you can see everything from here " he marvels his view a computer screen with a spider web of wells pipes and flow lines used to extract natural gas all of which are invisible from the platform because the wellheads pumps separators and meters distinguishing most petroleum platforms sit on the ocean floor as the wells start up over the next few weeks mr nichols will use his computer to monitor the status of all of them checking how much gas is flowing out of each with a couple of taps on the screen he could shut off a well or choke its flow painted traffic light yellow the independence hub floats in the deepest water of any offshore platform the ocean floor is two miles below the surface plans call for the hub to suck up to one billion cubic feet of natural gas from the earth every day by itself the platform is expected to produce enough gas to heat about million u s homes giant offshore platforms remain the hollywood stars of the petroleum industry appearing on covers of countless glossy annual reports but the industry is finding fewer fields large enough to justify building a massive structure loaded with drilling derricks and well controls atop the reservoir this has opened the door for a distinctly less photogenic alternative the subsea well ten different gas fields are feeding into the independence hub which is basically a floating pipeline hub with an assortment of gas compressors the remotest field cheyenne is miles south of the hub together the fields hold an estimated two trillion cubic feet of discovered natural gas reserves if it were a single field it would be one of the largest in the prolific gulf the fields are all stitched together by miles of "umbilicals" thick flexible tubes that send electricity orders and chemicals to the wells it is so cold feet below the waves that droplets of water in the gas can freeze and gum up the flow to fight this antifreeze stored in tanks over feet tall is pumped down the umbilicals to the wells subsea technology is quickly gaining favor in the oil and gas industry and has become a &# billion market according to wachovia securities this industry niche has grown at a compound annual rate for the past three years and is expected to keep growing at that rate for the next few years lower costs and the ability to tap smaller reservoirs are major advantages but not the only ones the industry can squeeze more oil out of aging fields by adding pumps on the seabed closer to the oil another plus going underwater puts the hardware out of the way of hurricanes cyclones icebergs and other destructive natural events not to mention terrorist gangs in places such as nigeria statoil asa the norwegian state oil company and a subsea pioneer is constructing a subsea network to produce gas feet below the icy barents sea and ship it miles to shore the project known as snohvit will have no platform at all this was done to satisfy demands from the local fishing industry which didnt want to share the waves with man made structures the equipment is encased in a steel structure designed to prevent cod fishing nets from getting entangled in the wells another statoil project tordis will be the first to separate oil water and sand on the seabed as it ages the reservoir is producing more and more water but the nearby platform couldnt accommodate additional equipment to get rid of the water a new platform would cost &# million installing the subsea separator on the floor will cost half as much "it will make a hell of difference in economics " says statoil executive oivind reinertsen the system was recently tested onshore at fusa norway the test required nearly truckloads of sand leaving the town contentedly with a new beach the tordis equipment is due to be installed this month and start pumping gas later this year the growing subsea market means booming business for fmc technologies inc the houston based company built the underwater equipment used at most of the wells feeding the independence hub as well as tordis other companies in this growing niche include cameron international corp also of houston norways aker kvaerner asa and switzerlands abb ltd the growth of the subsea market could mean less business for companies that design and build the big platforms such as frances technip sa and kbr inc as well as asian shipyard owners such as hyundai heavy industries co this shift can be seen in the economics of anadarkos independence hub the cost of building and installing the floating platform was &# million less than one quarter of the total cost of the project according to the companies involved this ratio is fairly typical of the current crop of deep water platforms but a far cry from the past when much more of a projects budget was spent above the wave line "as you move into deep water relatively more of the budget goes to drilling and subsea work " says bp plc spokesman ronnie chappell of course putting equipment below the waves has disadvantages also getting it into place is akin to landing a ship on mars but with more extreme temperatures and pressures says peter macinnes fmcs marketing development manager in fact cameron international which is currently working on more than major subsea projects uses motors and other equipment made by an aerospace industry contractor the subsea equipment is designed to last for the lifetime of the project because sending down a maytag repairman requires an unmanned submarine "is it high tech " asks camerons chief executive sheldon erickson "you bet your sweet bippy it is "
