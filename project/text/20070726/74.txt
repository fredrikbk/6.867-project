pinata gonzales here we go again democrats in congress have made little headway in their own investigations into the non scandal over the firings of nine u s attorneys last year so theyve hit upon another strategy get the justice department to do the investigating for them and right on cue republican senator arlen specter has joined the call for a special counsel to investigate the dismissals now theres a truly bad idea weve said it before but it bears repeating u s attorneys are political appointees they serve at the pleasure of the president who has the right to fire them at any time just ask bill clinton and janet reno who fired all the u s attorneys in one fell swoop in to little political or media consternation had the bush administration said this candidly from the outset the entire controversy might have been put to rest instead assorted justice officials tried to dodge the "political" charge and so they provided conflicting explanations to congress and now this piece of political theater has dragged on for seven months yesterday the house judiciary committee voted along party lines to hold former white house counsel harriet miers and current white house chief of staff josh bolten in contempt of congress for refusing to testify about the firings their refusal to testify is not only understandable but necessary and whats more a favor to any future white house occupant from either party presidents are entitled to deliberate within the executive branch about matters of official business without interference from congress a principle that goes back to the countrys founding thats especially true on the matter of political appointees where congress has little legislative interest this fiasco has never really been about white house personnel policy or decisions it has been from the beginning an exercise in casting a pall over the justice department and through justice over the last months of the bush presidency congress has nearly run out the string on its capacity to bludgeon attorney general alberto gonzales so the special counsel idea is best understood as a way to keep the issue percolating maybe get a grand jury empanelled and generally keep president bushs approval rating as low as possible through november the bush administration should know all too well where this leads amid the valerie plame brouhaha it let attorney general john ashcroft recuse himself which allowed deputy ag james comey to appoint his pal patrick fitzgerald as a special counsel to investigate another non crime everyone knows what happened next only this time it would be white house officials not reporters resisting subpoenas from a prosecutor who would have no justice supervision and every incentive to find some "crime" to justify his time and expense unless the bush administration wants to spend the next months fighting in court with the second coming of the willful mr fitzgerald it should refuse mr specters demand as with the plame affair the u s attorneys fiasco is a political dispute not a criminal one this week house judiciary chairman john conyers released a page "memorandum" that tosses the word "criminal" around in support of the contempt charges against mr bolten and ms miers too bad the report lacks even a modicum of evidence it does little more than rehash familiar allegations that the u s attorneys were fired for political reasons which is perfectly legal for example the report claims that u s attorney steven biskupic was dismissed "after he failed to pursue vote fraud charges" in wisconsin but an administration has every right to fire an attorney who wont pursue its priorities there is no evidence that anyone in the bush administration interfered with any specific prosecution by mr biskupic our favorite moment in the conyers pseudo brief is its coda quoting at length from a newspaper editorial as a legal authority theres no better evidence that this is all about politics theres no doubt that mr bush could use a new attorney general someone who was more than a political pinata but if mr gonzales were to resign now the price democrats would extort for confirmation would be an agreement by any replacement to appoint a special counsel this would criminalize another political dispute and allow a further assault by congress on executive authority by refusing to resign and taking congresss abuse mr gonzales is doing the country a favor by protecting the presidency see related letter "letters to the editor extraordinary measures" wsj aug
