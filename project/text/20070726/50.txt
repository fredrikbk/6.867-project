hurricanes and hot air though the hurricane season is off to a slow start my colleague phil klotzbach and i will be updating our seasonal atlantic basin hurricane activity forecast on aug we still anticipate another active season an above average number of major hurricanes with maximum sustained winds in excess of mph since the atlantic basin has experienced a significant increase in major hurricanes with major storms in the last years during the prior year period to there were only major hurricanes or on an annual basis slightly less than as many on a long period normalized basis major hurricanes account for about to of all u s tropical cyclone related destruction some scientists journalists and activists see a direct link between the post upswing in atlantic hurricanes and global warming brought on by human induced greenhouse gas increases this belief however is unsupported by long term atlantic and global observations consider for example the intensity of u s land falling hurricanes over time keeping in mind that the periods must be long enough to reveal long term trends during the most recent year period to hurricanes hit the united states of them major in contrast during the year period from to hurricanes more made u s landfall including or more major hurricanes the hypothesis that increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases the number of hurricanes fails by an even wider margin when we compare two other multi decade periods and in the years from there were u s land falling major hurricanes in the period there were such storms only as many even though global mean temperatures have risen by an estimated celsius and co by the number of major hurricanes hitting the u s declined if global warming isnt the cause of the increased atlantic hurricane activity seen over the past dozen years what is my colorado state university colleagues and i attribute the increase in hurricane activity to the speed up of water circulating in the atlantic ocean this circulation began to strengthen in at exactly the same time that atlantic hurricane activity showed a large upswing heres how it works though most people dont realize it the atlantic ocean is land locked except on its far southern boundary due to significantly higher amounts of surface evaporation than precipitation the atlantic has the highest salinity of any of the global oceans saline water has a higher density than does fresh water the atlantics higher salinity causes it to have a continuous northward flow of upper ocean water that moves into the atlantics polar regions where it cools and sinks due to its high density after sinking to deep levels the water then moves southward and returns to the atlantics southern fringes where it mixes again this south to north upper level water motion and compensating north to south deep level water motion is called the thermohaline circulation thc the strength of the atlantics thc shows distinct variations over time due to naturally occurring salinity variations when the thc is strong the upper ocean water becomes warmer than normal atmospheric circulation changes occur and more hurricanes form the opposite occurs when the thc is weaker than average since the atlantics thc has been significantly stronger than average it was also stronger than average during the s to early s another period with a spike in major hurricane activity it was distinctly weaker than average in the two quarter century periods of and when there was less hurricane activity a number of my colleagues and i have discussed the physics of atlantic thc variations in our seasonal hurricane forecasts and in various conference talks for many years those who are convinced that greenhouse gas increases provide the only plausible explanation for the recent increases in hurricane activity are either unaware of our work or dont want to consider any alternative one reason may be that the advocates of warming tend to be climate modelers with little observational experience many of the modelers are not fully aware of how the real atmosphere and ocean function they rely more on theory than on observation the warming theorists most of whom no doubt earnestly believe that human activity has triggered natures wrath have the ears of the news media but there is another plausible explanation supported by decades of physical observation the spate of recent destructive hurricanes may have little or nothing to do with greenhouse gases and climate change and everything to do with the atlantic oceans currents mr gray professor emeritus in the department of atmospheric science at colorado state university and a research fellow at the independent institute has been issuing atlantic basin seasonal hurricane forecasts for the past years see related letters "letters to the editor the storm before the calm" wsj aug
