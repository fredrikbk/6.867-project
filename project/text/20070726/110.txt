verizon wireless offers google olive branch in fcc auction firms proposal allows competitors devices to work on its network verizon wireless offered a compromise with google inc in their high stakes dispute over the coming government auction of radio spectrum google and others have argued that a significant chunk of the spectrum being auctioned early next year by the federal communications commission should go to a wireless operator that promises to open its network to all devices and software applications including those that internet companies want to offer such a business model would be novel in the u s cellphone industry where carriers such as verizon and at&amp t inc more or less control distribution of phones and their features verizon wireless a joint venture of verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc has staunchly opposed such regulations arguing they would put an unfair burden on traditional wireless companies interested in the bidding with an fcc vote on the rules approaching however verizon has shifted its position lowell mcadam chief executive of verizon wireless says the company would agree to rules requiring a winning bidder to allow any device onto its network but the operator shouldnt be required to guarantee that all games video and the web applications will work properly verizon also said it would reserve the right to continue blocking certain applications and features for phones it sells mr mcadam raised the proposal tuesday in a meeting with fcc chairman kevin martin mr martins draft rules for the auction include some of the "open access" guidelines google was seeking and which verizon is eager to water down "this is an experiment the fcc wants to do " mr mcadam said in an interview "well do it but we wont be able to guarantee those customers much other than that the network will operate properly " mr mcadam also said verizon wouldnt be able to police lewd and offensive content on third party phones the way it has done quite aggressively on its own handsets an fcc spokeswoman declined to comment rick whitt a google lawyer based in washington described verizons proposal as "a promising half step forward for consumers " but he said it doesnt go far enough to guarantee consumers can "download applications and use devices on any network " google has been pushing mr martin to toughen the draft auction rules it also wants a requirement that a slice of spectrum be reserved for a "wholesale" network where operators would have to lease access to resellers that want to offer mobile services google has said it would bid at least &# billion if the fcc heeds its full proposals verizon remains opposed in principle to any new open access requirements but it sees the fcc leaning toward implementing some such rules and wants to influence the process before a vote if mr martins draft rules arent revised "there is a real possibility this will be a failed auction " mr mcadam said because there will be reduced demand for the spectrum in an fcc filing tuesday verizon claimed the regulations would violate wireless carriers first amendment rights by curbing their ability to put the content they want on mobile handsets at&amp t has taken a milder stance essentially saying it could live with the fccs draft rules presently verizon isnt required to support phones it doesnt sell although it does provide basic support for models sold by sprint nextel corp which uses the same network technology for example verizon doesnt offer a phone that integrates googles web search bar into its software verizons proposed rules would require the carrier to allow all legal devices on its network including phones with built in multimedia and web services that compete with verizons corey boles contributed to this article
