political ads stage a comeback in newspapers political consultant cathy allen isnt yet certain which issues will define the elections but shes already decided that the campaigns she manages will make heavy use of an old fashioned advertising vehicle newspapers "newspapers are back " says ms allen a democratic political consultant in seattle who manages mostly local and statewide campaigns in the northwest of the quarter million dollars in spending that she directed on behalf of candidates in newspapers received a larger share than television she says at a time when many categories of newspaper advertising are declining the political message is making a comeback as overall spending on campaigns doubled to &# billion between and the amount spent on newspapers including their online editions tripled to &# million according to pq media the rate of growth appears to be highest in races for local posts such as mayor and state legislator because newspapers boast greater penetration and influence in small to medium size markets newspapers are still far from their status in pretelevision times as the premier vehicle for political advertising even with the recent gains they are receiving less than of the advertising dollars spent on political campaigns and some of their recent political gains are merely a by product of the surge of campaign ads on television as political ads clog the airwaves newspapers have become a way to stand out yet a growing number of political consultants say newspapers can offer distinct advantages over television and other media "recognition is growing that newspapers are highly effective and highly cost effective " says jordan lieberman publisher of campaigns &amp elections magazine which conducts seminars for candidates consultants and other political professionals newspaper readers vote at above average rates even amid circulation declines newspapers in many markets reach an audience that is competitive with any single broadcast channel a strength that online editions are bolstering online editions also are reaching a demographic group that their print editions have been losing the young reader online newspaper ads "are reaching people under the age of and by definition people attracted to news are good voters " says ms allen who is also a spokeswoman for the american association of political consultants newspapers also allow for more sophisticated arguments than are delivered in the typical second television campaign in a race for the junior senate seat in alaska republican incumbent lisa murkowski was battling it out with her democratic opponent each claiming in television spots to be the better candidate then republican consultant arthur hackney ran a series of independently funded newspaper advertisements making a more complex argument voting for ms murkowski the ads suggested would help republicans maintain control of the u s senate thereby preserving the immense power of alaskas other senator ted stevens as those newspaper ads played out ms murkowski who was appointed to the senate in but hadnt been elected to it zoomed past her rival to win the election a spokesman in sen murkowskis office declined to comment on the newspaper ads but mr hackney a consultant who has worked both in washington and alaska says newspaper messages have helped "turn the tide" in several campaigns that he ran "its a secret weapon " he says "secret" may be an understatement a poll last year by the e voter institute asked about political consultants to rank nine media by effectiveness the consultants ranked newspapers next to last behind not only broadcast and cable television but also blogs radio and direct mail that perception conflicts with polls showing that voters rank newspapers third behind broadcast and cable television as their primary source of political news and information says thomas edmonds a republican political consultant who has studied the issue on behalf of the newspaper association of america moreover surveys taken on behalf of the naa have shown that voters rank newspapers ahead of other media in the credibility of their political messages some consultants however argue that newspaper credibility derives from editorial coverage rather than from advertising this explains why when a newspaper endorses a candidate many campaigns purchase television advertisements to boast about it it is also why campaigns are more likely to expend effort gaining news coverage than money purchasing newspaper ads "the primary use of newspapers in political campaigns continues to be trying to get good coverage " says david beattie a national democratic consultant the newspaper industry may be partly to blame for its low profile among political advertisers when a candidate holds a press conference to announce his candidacy radio and television stations often send a reporter and a sales executive newspapers typically send only a reporter moreover round the clock campaigns that decide late in the day to run an advertisement often find that newspaper sales forces dont answer their phones after hours even consultants sold on the value of newspaper advertising say that newspaper sales forces often lack the aggressiveness of competing media after spending more than &# on a full page political advertisement in a national newspaper mr edmonds says he never received another call from that papers sales force an oversight no radio or television station would commit he says "political advertising is a multibillion dollar business and some newspapers dont have a clue " he says adding "but that problem is getting better " both to enlighten newspapers and to woo political consultants the industry association has been holding educational and sales forums among other strategies the association is highlighting the many ways political ads can be delivered including a front page post it note a delivery bag message an online banner ad an insert or a traditional print ad the newspaper association is also promoting success stories such as democrat nancy boyda who last fall unseated republican congressman jim ryun of kansas using page newspaper inserts as her primary advertising vehicle the nations fourth largest newspaper chain lee enterprises inc of davenport iowa has appointed a corporate sales executive to drum up political advertising at lees some papers in mostly small to medium size markets among other strategies the executive joanna smith is holding forums for candidates on how to use newspapers to their advantage lee already boasts some powerful testimonials south dakota gov mike rounds a republican used newspapers in to upset tremendously better financed rivals and again in his successful re election campaign "weve found the best way to reach voters with our campaign message is through the use of south dakota newspapers " says gov rounds in a written testimonial touted by lee adds gov rounds "people who read newspapers vote in elections "
