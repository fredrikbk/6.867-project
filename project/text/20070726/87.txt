politics &amp economics murtha shifts toward more flexible stance on iraq washington a leading democratic critic of the iraq war predicted that u s commanders will begin drawing down troop levels early next year and that congress can afford to be more flexible in setting a fixed deadline for ending the occupation rep john murtha d pa chairman of a house panel that oversees the pentagon budget made clear he still wants all american combat forces out of iraq but in an effort to reach out to republicans and build some consensus with the administration he said he will focus first on beginning the redeployment by the end of this year most republicans however war weary will be reluctant to support rep murtha before hearing from iraq commander gen david petraeus who is to report to congress in september but mr murtha said he now expects gen petraeus who recently met with a special iraq commission set up by congress for a review of its own to tell lawmakers that he expects to be able to pull out about troops by next spring that hope is important in shaping mr murthas position and could redefine the battle lines for an expected debate over iraq policy this fall "maybe well start some movement get some kind of agreement " said the pennsylvania democrat an ally of speaker nancy pelosi "im hoping they will look at it and realize were willing to make some adjustments " toward this end mr murtha yesterday avoided adding any strong antiwar language to the &# billion defense budget approved by the house appropriations committee the bill which covers the pentagons core spending separate from iraq includes what could be a controversial &# million cut from the administrations plan to locate ballistic missile defense sites in poland part of a missile defense shield criticized by russia and some other european nations and mr murtha has made a major commitment to increasing funds to oversee contracting by the pentagon but as the bills manager he will confine himself to an iraq floor amendment next week that would require mr bush to begin redeploying forces within days but set no date for completing a u s withdrawal given the legislative calendar the bill wont be enacted before october meaning the days would run into december and the true significance of the amendment is it could redefine the battle lines for september democrats are girding themselves for a showdown then with president bush over iraq and a rash of veto threats against the partys domestic agenda the threats continued to mount yesterday the latest against sweeping farm legislation due on the house floor today but iraq is the single biggest flashpoint and war spending is sure to be a factor in a massive year end budget bill to be voted on after labor day that will also decide appropriations levels for the fiscal year that begins oct following gen petraeuss report congress will take up a &# billion emergency spending request to continue war operations after oct and the iraq funds will almost certainly be drawn into negotiations over additional spending democrats want for domestic priorities government subsidy programs for agriculture are also slated to expire in the same period and the house farm bill would extend major loan and price support policies for five years while also imposing tighter limits on subsidy payments and greater transparency advocates of more subsidy cuts face an uphill fight on the floor today but the white house veto threat coupled with republican concerns over the measures financing could pose problems for the bill on an early procedural vote setting the terms for debate at issue is a tax provision valued at &# billion over years to help pay for improving food stamp benefits for poor families u s subsidiaries of foreign corporations would be targeted by the language and while democrats said their intent was only to improve tax compliance business interests complained that legitimate multinationals would be hurt by a last minute tax change that hasnt been subject to hearings "this is out of left field and the repercussions are real " said todd malen president of the organization for international investment a trade group for u s subsidiaries of companies based abroad the national association of manufacturers weighed in last night and virginia rep bob goodlatte the ranking republican on the house agriculture committee said he would no longer support the bill "its a lot of moving parts " conceded majority leader steny hoyer d md but democrats still hope to move ahead as ms pelosi sought to shore up liberal support by solidifying changes in nutrition programs
