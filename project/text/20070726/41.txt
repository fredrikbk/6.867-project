fiscally fit the mcmansion effect the cullens neighborhood is super sizing so what does it mean for terris home online edition our neighborhood is changing a number of homes are undergoing major renovations that will double their sizes and new homes are being built that are much larger than existing homes in the community our three bedroom one and a half bath sq ft home once among the largest in the neighborhood will soon be among the smallest the building boom has given gerry and me pause what impact is the sudden mcmansioning of our neighborhood going to have on the value of our home and will the super sizing of nearby homes have any affect on our neighborhoods culture is it cause for concern or are we just jealous the building boom began across the street early in the spring our neighbor started an addition doubling the size of his home then another home one of the smallest in our neighborhood a tiny two bedroom situated on a ft by ft lot was purchased for &# and quickly razed by a building company a three story five bedroom "castle" is taking its place complete with spire as summer began our next door neighbors contractor began adding a third floor to their home up the block three large five bedroom homes have sprung up on a lot where neighborhood kids used to play baseball remodeling activity nationwide is far from the blistering pace in my neck of the woods but despite the soft real estate market homeowners are still investing in their homes growth in spending for home improvement projects is expected to increase by for and spending is expected to remain constant through the first quarter of according to harvard universitys leading indicator for remodeling activity my husband gerry and i have done our fair share of renovation but our focus over the last six years has been on updating our homes dated interior look and infrastructure and making our outdoor space more livable weve lived with contractors overrunning the house and all the dirt dust and inconvenience involved in a home renovation project after completing a backyard renovation this spring gerry and i agreed it was time to take a breather still as i watch the addition next door begin to tower over our house i have to admit to having space envy ok so yes im jealous in the summer my father in law gerald often stays in our guest bedroom on weekends when he comes up to visit and spend time on our boat that room has done double duty as my home office for the last seven years and i often find myself having to interrupt my father in law to handle work related tasks at times i suffer internet withdrawal not being able to check the news or poke around my favorite web sites whenever the urge strikes can be frustrating the remodeling boom in my neighborhood reminds me daily how an additional room or two would make my life easier gerry doesnt covet our neighbors newly added space so much as he resents how the new construction makes our home look more dated if youve ever spent any time driving through middle class new jersey suburbs youve seen our home a boxy colonial bi level encased in aluminum siding when we first considered adding a room and bathroom back in gerry suggested we make other changes he wanted to add a portico and make some architectural changes to make our home look less boxy he said our friend steve whos also our contractor warned that our "small addition" of a bedroom and bath which he estimated he could do for about &# might easily escalate into a home makeover that would cost &# or more if we made the other changes gerry wanted after a long talk we decided against the addition we didnt think it was worth more than doubling our current &# mortgage one of our longtime financial goals has been to have our year fixed rate mortgage paid off before our year old son gerald enters college doubling our mortgage now to pay for an addition would torpedo the chances of achieving that goal with all the construction going on in the neighborhood its wasnt long before gerry once again raised the topic of adding on to our home after talking over the pros and cons again we agreed that it wasnt a good idea so weve made our peace with living within our homes boundaries but we wondered would not keeping up with the joneses hurt the homes resale value most long established new jersey neighborhoods like ours have a mix of large and small homes when shopping for homes the general rule of thumb is to avoid buying the largest home in the neighborhood a home thats much bigger than other homes in the neighborhood will typically sell for less than if that same home were in a neighborhood with equally large homes why recent home sales help determine the fair market value of your home if no comparably large homes have been sold in your area it may be difficult to convince home buyers that the larger home is worth considerably more than recent sales of smaller homes in the neighborhood on the other hand having a medium sized house in a neighborhood with much larger homes can boost its resale value so in a situation like ours where larger more expensive homes are now more common than our home my neighbors home renovations should help to improve our homes value adding to its value is our lot size with an acre of land theres plenty of room for a homebuyer to add on to the home that said people who are shopping for homes in a certain neighborhood expect certain amenities in those homes says kermit baker director of the remodeling futures program at harvard universitys joint center for housing studies "if youre not keeping up with other homes in the neighborhood you may have home buyers walk away from it " he says "theres a limited number of folks who want to buy assuming theyre going to have to do a significant remodeling project " figuring out how the super sizing of neighborhood homes will affect our neighborhoods culture is more difficult the larger homes will likely attract more affluent families and discourage older homebuyers who are looking to downsize home maintenance costs so our neighborhood should remain a kid friendly haven walter molony a spokesman for the national association of realtors says the neighborhoods location is also key to how home improvements alter a neighborhoods culture if the neighborhood is run down and a few home buyers come in and do home improvements and tear downs it could attract more investment in the neighborhood "the broad impact is that it raises property values overall and attracts more buyers because its perceived as an up and coming area " he says harvard universitys mr baker says its less clear how cultures are affected when major home improvements are made in more affluent neighborhoods "a lot of times when homeowners begin to make big home improvements other homeowners will update their homes as well " he says so generally little actually changes in terms of the neighborhoods culture gerry and i arent planning on super sizing our home but well continue to make upgrades to make the home a more comfortable and attractive place to live are homes in your neighborhood being super sized what impact has it had on your homes value write to
