mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q i bought a compaq presario notebook that came with many games that i dont use can i increase the available memory by deleting all of the games a you can increase the disk storage space thats available to you by deleting the games which take up room on your hard disk but that isnt the same as increasing "available memory " memory is the capacity of the computer to manage data at any one moment and it is governed by the random access memory or ram inside the machine unless any of the games or some game launching programs are automatically loading into memory when your pc starts up the games arent wasting memory just disk space getting rid of the games is still a good idea but dont try to do so by simply deleting them as you would a file you should do it by properly uninstalling them using the windows uninstaller control panel which is called "add or remove programs" in windows xp and "programs and features" in windows vista q i plan to buy an intel based mac i will need to run some windows software for school if i use parallels to run windows and the mac operating system simultaneously and someone does happen to get me with a windows virus can that migrate over to the macintosh side of my computer a first of all i cant stress enough that anyone running windows on any hardware even an apple computer should obtain install and run windows security software including antivirus and antispyware software i do so not only on my physical windows computers but on the virtual windows computers that run on my macs via parallels even if you are using apples own boot camp solution for running windows on a mac which doesnt allow the two operating systems to run simultaneously you should be running security software on the windows side such security software is primarily intended to protect the windows environment on a mac it is unlikely that a windows virus could migrate onto the part of the computer controlled by the mac operating system and even if it did it couldnt run there if it was written strictly for use in windows it could run only in the faux windows computer created by parallels however the people who write malicious software are relentless and creative and its impossible to rule out anything they might try or do there is one danger to your mac in this scenario parallels includes an optional feature that allows windows and windows programs to access folders and files on the mac side of the machine if you turn on this file sharing feature and if you get a virus whose purpose is to delete or corrupt files it could attack these mac files because windows has access to them so for maximum security id advise that you leave this feature off but even if you do so you should still obtain install and use windows security software for use when running windows q in your column last week about the ooma device that gives you free domestic phone calls over the internet you mentioned that until the product goes on sale in september the company is giving away free models but only to people who have been given a special token by existing owners can i get one of your tokens a sorry even if i had been sent enough tokens to fulfill the numerous requests i got i couldnt fulfill them i am sending my few tokens back to the company along with the ooma gear i was lent for my testing for ethical reasons i dont keep the products companies lend me for review or take anything of value from them including tokens entitling people to get a &# product free of charge nor can i help the numerous other readers who asked me to get them on oomas free distribution list
