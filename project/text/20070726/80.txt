politics &amp economics house bush head for full showdown panel votes to cite aides for contempt in attorney firings washington the house judiciary committee took a step toward a constitutional showdown with the white house voting to issue criminal contempt citations to two members of the bush administration relating to the firing of eight federal prosecutors both sides now seem set on a collision course that would provide a major test of each institutions claimed powers typically combatants come to an accord before reaching court preferring to operate in the murky legal environment that governs these areas rather than asking a court to pick clear winners and losers yet neither the white house nor congress has shown any sign of seeking a compromise the range of possible outcomes include a compromise a continuing standoff a trip to the courts or the appointment of a special prosecutor something lawmakers have started to request the contempt citations are the first in almost years to be passed by a house committee the last time a citation was passed by the full house chamber the next stop in this particular battle was the house panel voted yesterday to issue the citations for not complying with previously issued subpoenas a vote by the full house will likely come after the august break for both sides the constitutional questions are particularly thorny the white house says white house chief of staff joshua bolten and former white house counsel harriet miers dont need to comply with subpoenas in connection with the attorney firings to do so its relying on a concept known as "executive privilege" that says the president needs access to unfettered advice without the threat of congressional interference the constitution doesnt mention the notion but presidents have invoked the privileges since the administration of george washington meanwhile congress is asserting its right to issue contempt citations against officials seeking such protection if approved by the full house the citations would be sent to the u s attorney for the district of columbia an action that would move the government into a little traveled legal area prosecutors are members of the executive and the white house says they wont be expected to punish other executive staffers following the advice of the president "there is a nice constitutional question there since prosecutors are part of executive branch and the executive branch is claiming executive privilege " said paul rothstein a constitutional law professor at georgetown university and author of "federal testimonial privileges " "this will be uncharted waters " john yoo a former deputy assistant attorney general in the bush administrations office of legal counsel said the presidents position stems in part from justice department opinions in the s the last time the president challenged a congressional criminal citation in that case the house issued a citation against a reagan era administrator of the environmental protection agency after she failed to turn over documents relating to superfund cleanups the justice department tried to stop the citation from being sent to the prosecutor but was rejected by a court rather than appeal the department resumed negotiations and ultimately the subpoenaed documents were released however during the litigation and negotiations the u s attorney refused to present the contempt citation to a grand jury for its consideration the question of whether the attorney was required to do so was never resolved because the house withdrew the contempt citation as part of the settlement the question of whether congress has the authority to pursue the contempt citation is a controversial one david rivkin a washington attorney who served in the reagan and first bush justice departments says authority to issue such citations resides only within the judicial branch "both are asserting positions that are part of their constitutional prerogatives " he said "the decision over which power trumps the other is a decision made properly only by a judicial officer " mr rivkin said congress could instead go to court and litigate the underlying issue of the executives claim of privilege john wesley hall a little rock attorney and next president of the national association of criminal defense lawyers said congress clearly has the authority to pursue the contempt citation "and if the justice department doesnt prosecute does the court have the inherent power to appoint a special prosecutor my response would be yes " democrats have been pursuing white house aides for several months to question them about the firing of eight u s attorneys which democrats allege was politically motivated
