own but in a rare double decision voted to approve two opposing policies shareholders and corporate governance advocates have long sought more influence on the boards of directors that generally steer a corporations course a movement that has gained momentum in a decade that kicked off with the enron and worldcom scandals and has seen executive compensation soar to new heights one of the measures up for a vote would let investor blocs owning at least of a company for a year or more propose amendments to corporate bylaws that would let shareholders nominate directors as the los angeles times explains though it doesnt go far enough for shareholder advocates the commissions two democrats voted for the measure and were joined by chairman christopher cox allowing it to pass the second measure would essentially maintain year old sec policy by formally excluding such possibilities it too was passed with mr cox joining the commissions two other republicans mr coxs predecessor william donaldson tried to enact a plan to give shareholder blocs more access to official corporate ballots in but businesses said it would make special interests too powerful and the issue was put on the backburner a federal appellate court decision last fall however came down on the side of expanded shareholder power forcing the sec to intercede in what the wall street journal notes is one of the thorniest areas of dispute in corporate governance and it seems a difficult one for mr cox "as chairman he has often stated he wants sec commissioners to act in concert because it makes their decisions more credible " the journal says "in this case one of the first times he has had to make a tough call he essentially ducked " mr cox said he backed both proposals for the sake of letting the secs process perfect the ideas and produce changes that are "cautious and measured " but ultimately the journal adds "his desire to satisfy both business and investor groups may lead to unhappiness in both camps " still an aide to mr cox tells the new york times the chairman is leaning toward backing the choice that would bolster shareholder rights a toughening credit environment yet more bad news

significant impact on students served by college health centers the journal says students are confronting tough choices between for example switching to cheaper generic contraceptives or having to turn to their parents insurance and thus sacrificing their privacy "one of the seminal concepts in contraceptive medicine is when a woman is using a method correctly and successfully the last thing
