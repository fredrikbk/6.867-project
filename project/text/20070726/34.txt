"its come to jesus time " mr huttmann told the heads of a software firm a machining firm and a technology consulting firm the men who had known each other for years through a group in the san francisco area told mr huttmann to dismiss some managers and close a struggling office one ceo came to ha logisticss christmas party to vet the managers himself later telling mr huttmann which ones hed suggest firing mr huttmann says the candid and often painful counsel is why he turns to peers with his thorniest business problems "these guys have no stake " he says "thats the beauty of this model " ceos say its tough to get advice they can trust consultants tend to be abstract and concerned with keeping their contracts they say lower level executives are too deferential friends often dont have the business experience so as pressure builds from activist shareholders fast moving competitors or stricter boards chief executives are increasingly banding together in formal peer groups mr huttmann is among members of the walnut creek calif based alliance of chief executives which convenes groups of a dozen or so ceos to discuss anything from corporate strategy to personnel problems another company that connects executives vistage international counts ceo members and has grown a year since these executives typically run small closely held companies but heads of big public companies also join in jim balsillie the co ceo of blackberry maker research in motion ltd is one of members of the young presidents organization carl bass ceo of autodesk inc a software maker with an &# billion market capitalization is a member of the los angeles based center for corporate innovation stephen newberry ceo of lam research corp a maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment with a market value of &# billion is in both the center for corporate innovation and the alliance leaders of publicly traded companies say they often turn to peers with issues too small or unformed to raise with a board of directors in an era of increasingly arms length relationships between boards and ceos top executives say they also use the sessions to talk about their directors "there are issues you can take to your boss and some you cant " says autodesks mr bass "its almost like friends in high school youre going through the same thing at the same time " public company chiefs are bound by strict rules on insider trading as well as the security and exchange commissions regulation fd or fair disclosure which aims to prevent companies from releasing important information to select investors and analysts the companies that run the peer meetings typically make participants sign nondisclosure agreements the alliance and securities lawyers say they believe such a confidentiality rule satisfies the secs guidelines the alliance also prohibits members from trading in each others stock mr huttmann and his circle have come together each month for nearly a decade members come and go but a nucleus of four ceos all of whom run private companies in california has remained intact doug hill years old from precision machine company true tech corp is known as the "hatchet man" for quick cost cutting decisions bob brown head of consulting firm teladata llc is an enthusiastic entrepreneur whos always trying out new ideas bruce nagle ceo of business software maker rw technologies inc tends to mull things before speaking mr huttmann describes himself as a "sales guy" who likes discussing management techniques at a november meeting mr nagle presented a proposed marketing campaign for rw the person company he founded in its business software programs track which products are on store shelves for consumer goods manufacturers such as kellogg co lately it had started analyzing sales and product placement and the ceo wanted to make sure clients knew that mr nagle presented a case study showing how a customer had used the services he unveiled a new logo as well as names for his business lines software report services strategy services and a new company tagline "insights innovation real world solutions " mr hill said he didnt think mr nagle had enough clients to justify rebranding "customers dont want to hear the tagline sorry " mr hill said "they want to know what can you provide to me " mr brown jumped in "some of these words are killing me " he said pointing to mr nagles proposed copy "like strategy to me its bull " in the tagline he suggested the word "innovation" should be replaced with something more "meat and potatoes " and the case study mr brown continued didnt say how much rws client had saved by using its services afterward mr nagle reworked his case studies hired a new copywriter and excised the word "strategy " he kept his new logo and tagline the bluntness doesnt appeal to everyone mr huttmann says he has scared away members by expressing himself too forcefully though he says he has toned down his critiques with newcomers "some people cant take the pain " he says getting the chemistry right is tricky says paul witkay the alliances founder mr witkay whose organization charges members &# to &# annually says he matches ceos with comparable management experience but different personal and professional backgrounds he separates those with competing businesses every group gets a moderator mr witkay attends each of the huttmann groups meetings and he says he encourages executives to push each other without getting personal "my job is to make it ok for them to be brutal " he says such peer groups typically meet for a half or full day some executives say its not worth the commitment after seven years in a group run by another organization barry shames owner of a construction company in livermore calif says he wasnt getting much new management advice "it got a little stagnant " he says though he quit he says he continues to confer with some of the executives he met the four ceos in the alliance program each joined in the late

drank silver oak cabernet at a m mr huttmann approached mr nagle who had been relatively quiet at meetings "bruce i really love you " mr nagle recalls mr huttmann saying "the only problem is youre thinking things youre not saying spit it out " mr nagle says he opened up more afterward mr huttmann says he doesnt recall specifics of the talk at around that time mr hill was wrestling with a bigger problem his partner in closely held true tech wanted to sell his half of the business mr hill was optimistic that the company would grow but he would have to borrow nearly &# million to buy his partners stake mr huttmann told mr hill that if he had faith in his company hed take the risk "either you believe in what youre saying and step up to the plate or its bull which is it " the trucking executive recalls saying mr hill took the leap but his timing was lousy technology stocks had been declining since march of that year a few months later orders dried up from the semiconductor equipment makers who were mr hills biggest customers in the first half of mr hill slashed his work force to people from and cut his own pay in half "i felt real guilty for a long time " mr huttmann says mr hill says that buying out his partner was the right move and that true tech is now above levels in staffing revenue and profit "i dont regret it a bit " he says soon mr hill was in a position to dispense payroll slashing advice to his peers by january mr browns consulting business was hurting teladata had thrived by designing phone and computer networks at internet companies and now those customers were going under in april mr hill advised mr brown to cut staff and expenses quickly and deeply to avoid having to do it more than once just weeks before mr hill explained hed pummeled his own companys morale with a second round of layoffs mr brown waffled but finally decided to halve his staff to people in june the night before he called mr hill "stay tough " mr hill advised "dont let them see you cry " soon after mr nagle also took mr hills advice to heart after one of rws big clients filed for bankruptcy mr nagle let go one quarter of his workers in february mr brown was driving a dune buggy on the central california coast and plunged into a ravine one of his vertebrae was pulverized doctors recommended that he stay immobile "the business was in survival mode and i couldnt do anything to help " mr brown says the other ceos stepped in the group broke with precedent to let mr browns second in command gregory bell attend meetings mr huttmann coached mr bell on how to track
