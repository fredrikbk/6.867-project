politics &amp economics a kinder gentler spitzer the street fighter under fire vows to change stripes a little the firestorm surrounding new york gov eliot spitzer is raising a question about a democrat long seen as a rising star will the hardball approach he used as a crusading attorney general undermine his political future with the disclosure this week that close aides misused state police in an effort to damage a republican rival mr spitzer is facing the same kind of high profile scrutiny that he was famous for inflicting upon others from wall street executives to radio conglomerates as new yorks attorney general in a role reversal the aggressive mr spitzer now is on the defensive and vowing to make amends "im determined to reach out to not let the personal dynamics get in the way " mr spitzer said in an interview yesterday "ive played myself for the last seven months but im a grown up i get it ill try to show a different side of me " the big question is whether the hard charging street fighter can in fact become a consensus building diplomat mr spitzer is promising to improve but only to a point "ill be the same and different " he said as attorney general mr spitzer took on wall street forcing some firms to pay huge fines and clean up illegal practices and going after such business icons as former new york stock exchange chairman dick grasso and investor kenneth langone during his campaign for governor he played up his reputation as an ethical crusader and pledged to clean up state politics he won the governors race with nearly of the vote and has been seen by fellow democrats as a politician with a national future since taking office as new york governor on jan determined to shake the status quo in albany mr spitzer has used hardball tactics with mixed success an adviser to the governor cites a "productive" legislative session where mr spitzer pushed through business savings in workers compensation a boost in education funding and lobbying and ethics overhauls but two advisers to mr spitzer say they told him that his "take no prisoners" tone against his opponents could lead some underlings to "misconstrue" his goal to win "hes a guy who forgot he became governor " says new york criminal attorney stanley arkin "when youre a prosecutor you can pursue anyone but when you become governor you become a target yourself he didnt make the transition " a report issued by the new york state attorney generals office on monday concluded that two of mr spitzers top aides improperly used the new york state police in an effort to sully a political opponent new york state senate majority leader joseph l bruno while the report by attorney general andrew cuomo found that no laws had been broken it found that a close spitzer aide schemed to create and give detailed reports to the media showing that mr bruno had been using state aircraft to attend fund raisers and other political events rather than for state business as mr bruno had certified the attorney generals report concluded that mr bruno didnt do anything wrong in trips using state aircraft that it investigated because in each case he conducted at least one legislative business meeting the report recommended that the state enact a more rigorous policy concerning the use of state aircraft the report found that the governors communications director darren dopp and his top liaison to the state police pressured the state police to create and in some instances re create records of mr brunos use of state aircraft and police escorts the report also suggested that the governors staff gave a false story to investigators to explain why the information was being gathered saying they were acting on a freedom of information act request from a newspaper responding to the report mr spitzer announced tuesday that he was suspending mr dopp indefinitely without pay still people who know mr spitzer couldnt help but question this week whether the governor and other of his top aides were directly involved in the smear campaign mr cuomos investigators built their case on email communications of mr dopp and others but they provided no evidence that mr spitzer and other top aides knew of the scheme in the interview mr spitzer seemed to acknowledge that his aggressive style has contributed to his difficulties in one graphic illustration of that style mr spitzer weeks after taking office shouted over the telephone at a republican legislative opponent "im a f steamroller and ill roll over you and anybody else " according to news accounts which mr spitzer hasnt refuted asked about the incident later mr spitzer told new york magazine "when youre on the playing field you fight as hard as you possibly can " he said that "afterwards you shake hands and you say that was great on to the next " yesterday mr spitzer changed his tune "now ill try to play hard on the field and be friends during the game " in the current controversy over use of state police mr spitzer conducted his own internal probe and asked four of his senior advisers with law enforcement experience to "find out what happened " an adviser said earlier this month the advisers turned their investigative techniques fine tuned under mr spitzer as attorney general on their colleagues almost immediately the emails pointed to mr dopp also a close friend to mr spitzer "how could this happen on my watch " mr spitzer asked his advisers according to a person familiar with the situation "this is me this is my failure " for now mr spitzer is dialing down his aggressive behavior say two people familiar with the situation a "shift in style" is under way one person says when aides suggested earlier this week that mr spitzer "counterattack" mr bruno by focusing on the part of the attorney generals report on mr brunos use of aircraft an aide says the new york governor refused saying "no lets fix our own house " without a change in behavior mr spitzers legislative agenda may suffer "hell get over it but hes got a long way back " says new york publicist howard rubenstein who says he has been friends with mr spitzer for years "his legislative and executive programming will suffer dramatically unless he rethinks his position and rebuilds broken bridges " a spokesman for mr bruno says that the state senator believes mr spitzer "has politicized the office of governor more than any other governor in history " he says mr bruno would like to see mr spitzer "put politics aside and focus more on governing "
