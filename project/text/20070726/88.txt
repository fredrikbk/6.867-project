politics &amp economics why afghan opium output keeps growing kabul afghanistan with this conflict torn country on track to produce another record amount of opium this year u s officials want to significantly step up efforts to eradicate poppy crops before the fall harvest the problem for the u s officials is that their afghan and north atlantic treaty organization allies oppose their aggressive plans the united nations estimates that farmers in afghanistan are cultivating about acres of poppy the source of opium that would represent a increase from last year and an jump from the acres harvested in according to the u n "we are all disappointed with the eradication efforts so far " said u s ambassador william wood profits from the opium trade are being used to fund both taliban insurgents and local warlords militias these groups have sapped the influence of the central government in kabul and contributed to increased unrest in the southern part of the country where the taliban movement was born the taliban movement which sheltered al qaeda before the sept terrorist attacks was driven from power in afghanistan by the u s later that year today it is the base of an insurgent movement that seeks to remove the countrys democratically elected u s supported government u s afghan and european officials remain divided over how best to deal with the poppy crop leading largely to inaction "there is really no clear consensus from my view for a comprehensive way forward on the counternarcotics in afghanistan " said adm william fallon the top commander of u s forces in the region european and afghan officials worry that a very aggressive approach could hurt the local economy and drive farmers to join the taliban movement u s officials would like to rely on aerial spraying which is the most effective way to destroy the poppy crop but afghan and nato officials in afghanistan say such an approach is indiscriminate instead u s officials are pushing a program to spray poppy crops from the ground while the europeans and afghans believe that some modest eradication must be done through ground based spraying they argue that this should be accompanied by a push to provide a realistic economic alternative to growing poppy the problem is that there is no crop or industry in afghanistan that can match its profitability the u s to blunt the impact of spraying on the economy plans to flood the major poppy growing provinces in the south with aid helmand province a taliban stronghold dominated by the opium trade is on pace to get about &# million in aid next year european officials caution that even the massive influx of aid wont make up for the impact of the poppy eradication on the afghan economy "the economy of this country is based on the opium trade " said one senior european official in afghanistan "you cant just pull it away it is a moral dilemma " u s officials counter that the aid programs which are focused on building schools roads and health clinics arent having the impact they should because of the violence associated with the opium trade and the growing taliban presence intensifying eradication efforts would also put major demands on u s afghan and nato forces senior u s military officials say large numbers of afghan troops may have to be redirected to protect eradication teams those troops are focused on patrolling afghan cities in the south and east where the taliban are seeking a foothold and if they are pulled to focus on poppy eradication some military officials worry that the taliban would fill the void "it takes a significant amount of manpower to secure an eradication effort " said brig gen robert cone who oversees the training of the afghan army and police forces
