targeting ships ballast stowaways industry scrambles to stop costly invasive species from catching a ride new york commercial crabbers robert gabrielson jr and michael frank hauled up a wire pot from the hudson river near nyack n y early last month trapping a dozen desirable blue crabs and one stranger with hairy claws "it was a little freaky thing " says mr gabrielson who has worked the river for years "the claws looked like they were boxing gloves or mud i tried to wipe the mud away but it was hair this is not what id ever seen before in my life " they had caught a male chinese mitten crab the first and so far only one found in the hudson a handful of specimens of the yellow sea native have been caught in the delaware and chesapeake bays in recent months likely transported in ballast water that empty merchant ships draw at port for stable sailing this crustacean can undermine riverbanks with its burrowing and could threaten native species and it follows a stream of invasions in north american waterways by other waterborne nuisances like the zebra mussel and quagga mussel both from the caspian sea because aquatic invasive species pose a world wide environmental threat and are estimated to cost the u s economy more than &# billion a year as utility pipes are clogged fish stocks decline and slicks of toxic algae foul popular beaches ballast water treatment has become a hot issue for ship operators saudi arabian oil co bp plcs bp shipping horizon lines ltd and others face new international standards for ballast water purity due to begin in even more stringent legislation was introduced in the u s congress over the past couple of months with roughly affected merchant ships at sea and a projected price of &# to &# million a ship the costs and opportunities tied to the fight against invasive species are considerable "its an immense economic opportunity for technology suppliers if they have a powerful yet environmentally friendly solution " says luke daly chief executive of floridas ferrate treatment technologies llc which is developing a system using a "supercharged" liquid form of iron to cleanse ballast water saudi arabian oil co or saudi aramco the worlds biggest oil company is trying a system that continually flushes seawater through the ballast tanks of supertankers while under way aramco which estimates that retrofitting ballast water treatment systems would cost in excess of &# million a supertanker says its patented "aubaflow" system is expected to comply with international maritime organization standards bp shipping is taking another tack with ozone technology designed by arlington va partner nutech o inc to treat water for a local commercial laundry service bp shipping and nutech o are in the final stages of testing the ozone system aboard the tanker prince william sound if successful the system will kill enough nasties to meet international guidelines and the potentially tougher u s standards says simon lisiecki bp shippings director for government and industry nutech o vice president and general counsel joel mandelman says it would cost roughly &# million to retrofit a large oil tanker with the ozone system but adds that doing so could save many times that over the life of the ship because the system would make expensive and potentially hazardous deep water ballast transfers unnecessary ships are required to rinse out their ballast tanks with colder saltier water far out to sea before entering u s ports development of ballast cleaning systems isnt limited to big companies particularly in the u s "the minute this law gets handed down in washington d c thats when the american entrepreneur takes over " says john jamian president of the seaway great lakes trade association an industry group one of these entrepreneurs mr daly from ferrate treatment technologies says he has invested about &# million of his own money and &# million from family friends and others to develop a method to generate a form of iron called ferrate that kills the waterborne creatures mr daly says that the only byproduct from the process is harmless rust the system is set for second stage testing aboard the container ship horizon producer later this year ecochlor inc of acton mass has invested in a system using chlorine dioxide chief executive charles miller says chlorine dioxide is a safe option because it doesnt combine with organic materials in the water to create carcinogens as elemental chlorine does the system is already in use on two ships swedens publicly traded alfa laval ab in partnership with norways wallenius wilhelmsen logistics as is in advanced testing of its pureballast system which works by creating highly reactive free radicals in the water with a catalyst and ultraviolet light sales manager niclas dahl says the system is the first to complete the first step of the imos lengthy two stage approval process adding that the company expects pureballast to be cleared for use when the standards take effect in other technologies under development include systems using filtration and separation deoxygenation electricity heat radiation and several different chemical treatments though some of these may be too risky to appeal to many legislators and ship operators one canadian firm is even working on using yeast to deoxygenate ballast water starving the creatures of oxygen and killing them in the process legislation on the matter has languished for years in congress prompting states like michigan to start enacting their own rules now the subject of a shipping industry lawsuit frustration with inaction in washington led a coalition of environmental groups to call in may for an all out ban on oceangoing ships in the great lakes and only a fraction of the required imo members have ratified the convention setting a standard nutech os mr mandelman joins many in the business in decrying the "catch " situation in which shipping companies and technology developers have been stuck for more than a decade lawmakers have declined to set a standard because they say the technology isnt available to show what that standard should be nevertheless many people involved say they hope this turns out to be a watershed year "im cautiously optimistic that were going to move the ball down the field this time " says jeff skelding campaign manager for the healing our waters great lakes coalition the group that called for the great lakes ban on oceangoing ships
