can your friends make you fat friendship offers support laughter and the occasional spare tire just ask jamie tighe a year old stay at home mother in franklin mass in college ms tighe and her friends "all gained weight together " then she and her best friend added more poundage over margaritas and chips her appetite and her avoirdupois spread to her husband kevin tighe who she says had been "rip cut" when they married "he just started putting on the weight " she says "he didnt even care hed call it his buddha belly and make fun of it rub it " mr tighe a year old technology salesman says its true "i ballooned up " he says "if someone else is doing it you dont feel as bad about it " the tighes mutual overeating isnt unusual a study in this weeks new england journal of medicine finds that social networks have an even greater effect on chances of becoming obese than genes do the findings may help explain why obesity is rising in america despite widespread dieting and other weight loss techniques and why peoples best efforts to slim down on their own are so often short lived they also suggest that public health initiatives to fight obesity should take social networks into account and work with overweight people in groups as organizations such as weight watchers international inc have done for years dr nicholas christakis at harvard medical school lead author of the study says the results indicate that behavioral "norms" shift depending on how people in a social circle look and act even if they only meet once a year "people might say look christakis is getting fat its okay for me to be obese as well " social contacts propelled weight gains even among individuals a thousand miles apart indicating that social proximity overrides geographic proximity "its become very fashionable to speak of an obesity epidemic " says dr christakes "but we wondered in fact is obesity really an epidemic with person to person transmission was there a kind of social contagion " the study found that indeed there was a persons chance of becoming obese jumped if he or she also had a friend who became obese during a given time if one adult sibling became obese the chance that the other would follow suit increased by these findings were particularly true if siblings and friends were of the same sex since researchers say people are more influenced by those they resemble than those they do not indeed the chance of becoming obese rose if it was a same sex friend who gained the weight the study examined people who underwent repeated body measurements over years as part of the framingham heart study considered the crown jewel of epidemiological studies over the years each participant in the heart study was asked to list close friends and workplace contacts to allow doctors to track them down many of these friends it turned out were also part of the study so their information was available to researchers from these contacts researchers examined family and social relationships charting associations between a persons weight gain and the weight gain among his or her social circle including relatives friends and co workers among married couples the study found if one spouse became obese the likelihood that the other spouse would do the same increased by the study also suggested that most people dont keep up with the joneses when it comes to weight gain since it found no effect from the obesity of neighbors who arent part of the social network the study is part of a larger trend in science and social science to examine the effect of networks from the role that interconnected neurons play in cognition to even networks of terrorism theres evidence for instance that political attitudes are shaped by social circles and that when it comes to sexual behavior teens are more influenced by their immediate friends than by the most popular group at school or by the media "networks are really important for the transmission of ideas and values " says katherine stovel a university of washington sociology professor who studies networks "people come to resemble one another " but she cautioned "i dont want anybody to read this and think about dropping friends because theyre fat " traci joyce a year old lab technician at a regional cancer center in greensboro n c says she and many of her co workers need to "lose a few pounds " yet they push pastries cookies cakes and chocolate turtles on each other "theyll try to sabotage you sometimes " she says "oh come on you can have some itll be alright " some doctors are excited about the new obesity study from a public health perspective because if weight gains can spread through a network then presumably so can healthful habits medical and public health interventions in obesity might be more cost effective than previously thought the studys authors wrote "since health improvements in one person might spread to others " in an editorial in the new england journal of medicine albert laszlo barabasi of the university of notre dames center for complex network research urged the medical profession to take the network effect seriously he wrote that "the role of links and connections does not stop here " and that such studies "should start to affect medical practice " many communities are already harnessing the force of networks to reduce obesity in guilford county n c where of residents are obese local health officials held a community wide weight loss program this spring called the guilford county mayors challenge the program joined together citizens who wanted to lose pounds in weeks the group chatted online about exercise routines and exchanged healthful recipes ten weeks later people had shed pounds toni anzalone zirker a year old substitute teacher in greensboro guilfords county seat says she originally tried to lose weight with a group of friends "i tried to call several friends they didnt follow through " she says but when she joined the mayors challenge she found an instant support group which motivated her someone would write online she says "i gotta take off this pork belly " she says shed think "yeah i can relate to that " "you didnt feel all alone out there " she says and ultimately a group setting rescued jamie and kevin tighe the franklin mass husband and wife who had literally grown as a couple after marriage ms tighe struck with the desire to be healthy for their two daughters started dieting first mr tighe was uneasy with her new attitude "hed say oh god youre not fun anymore " she says "you dont get the appetizers " mr tighe says he was merely feeling guilty for eating fatty foods while she was eating salad but sure enough as she began to trim down he wanted to do the same the two became active in a chapter of weight watchers ms tighe leads local meetings and both are at healthy weights mr tighe whos shed pounds since says having a support system "got my butt off the couch "
