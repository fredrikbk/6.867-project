readback revisiting two classic thrillers bingham is a scholar of the soul in five roundabouts to heaven plus the manchurian candidate online edition i have never seriously considered murdering anyone and i tend to think of murderers as a defective subspecies of humanity to convince me that i or one of my friends might murder a so called loved one would take some fancy footwork john bingham does it chillingly well in his novel "five roundabouts to heaven " proving that pretty much anyone can talk himself or herself into murder under the right circumstances like patricia highsmiths tom ripley mr binghams philip h bartels seems like the kind of regular guy who might read the wall street journal a well educated wine salesman with a radiant wife and a comfortable home if anything bartels is a bit of a softie anguishing over the suffering of a bug yet this upstanding citizen becomes convinced that he must kill he also believes his action is morally justified im not going to say anything more about the plot except that its twisty mr bingham is a scholar of the soul an expert in the way good and evil can run side by side in the same person his writing is confident and precise hes a thinking persons mystery writer yet i would never have picked up "five roundabouts to heaven" except that the current edition is introduced by john le carre an author i greatly admire like mr le carre john bingham is a pseudonym mr binghams real name was michael ward also lord clanmorris and in his day job he was mr le carres mentor in the british intelligence service while both were writing novels on the side mr le carre so admired mr bingham that mr bingham became one of the primary models for the george smiley character in several of mr le carres books but the two men had a bitter falling out after mr le carre published "the spy who came in from the cold " to be precise mr bingham was furious with mr le carre for "dragging the good name of the service through the mud " and he never forgave him mr le carre always admired mr bingham who died in both for his patriotism and his fiction "as a dedicated custodian of society he cared passionately about the containment of evil " mr le carre wrote "he wasnt interested in the whodunit but as a master interrogator and explorer of human motive he wanted to know whydunnit and whether justice was going to be served " i will definitely read more of mr binghams crime novels and thrillers at least two of them "a fragment of fear" and "my name is michael sibley " are in print in the u s last week i also read another period thriller richard condons "the manchurian candidate " about a brainwashed korean war veteran years ago i had seen the movie directed by john frankenheimer and starring frank sinatra laurence harvey and angela landsbury but i didnt see the remade version of david thomson a film critic once described "the manchurian candidate" as "a book written so that an idiot could film it " as louis menand points out in his introduction to a recent edition brainwashing intensive indoctrination of political prisoners was tried by chinese communists on american prisoners of the korean war with limited success many succumbed but only for the short term mr condon took the brainwashing idea and cranked it up a few notches his korean veteran raymond shaw is permanently programmed as a ruthless assassin while disguised in day to day life as a newspaper columnist although mr condon is no john le carre his prose usually gets out of the way of his story what he does exceptionally well is crawl inside shaws washed brain and report on the combat between his instructions and his conscience some of the other characters however particularly shaws mother would be more at home in a comic book mr menand calls "the manchurian candidate" "tony pulp " an echo of time magazines book critic who in said it could qualify as one of the ten best bad books "condon distributes his sour malicious humor with such vigor and impartiality that the novel is certain to be read and enjoyed " the critic wrote i think theres something to be said for regularly revisiting the topic of brainwashing even in such an exaggerated form as mr condons today persuasive language is shoveled into our ears and eyes every minute were awake ray shaw didnt know he was brainwashed he just knew what he wanted write to cynthia crossen at cynthia crossen wsj com
