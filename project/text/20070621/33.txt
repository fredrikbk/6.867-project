estrogen shows benefit for heart health findings counter earlier warnings on hormones women in their s who use estrogen have healthier arteries than women who dont take the drugs boosting the evidence that hormones protect the hearts of menopausal women according to a new study the research published today in the new england journal of medicine used high tech heart scans to look at calcium buildup in the arteries of women who took part in the womens health initiative a major government study of menopause hormones coronary artery calcium is an important predictor of heart attack risk in the whi the to year old women who were taking estrogen were to less likely to have severe coronary artery calcium than women of similar ages who received a placebo among women who took the study pills regularly the benefit was even more pronounced estrogen users had a lower risk of severe coronary calcium joann e manson a whi investigator and harvard professor who led this analysis and other researchers say the data dont mean women should take hormones solely to protect their hearts more information is needed about the effects of hormones on women as they age in addition the study looked only at women who had undergone hysterectomy and used only estrogen menopausal women who still have a uterus take a combination of estrogen and progestin and its not clear if that combination also leads to healthier arteries but the study is important because it offers the first piece of physical evidence from a clinical trial that hormones play a role in keeping arteries healthy and slowing heart disease the findings add fuel to the controversy about whether women have been misled about the risks and benefits of menopause hormones five years ago officials from the national institutes of health halted the whi and warned that menopause hormones posed a heart attack risk prompting many women to stop taking the drugs overnight but further analyses of the whi data have suggested there are striking differences in the heart effects of hormones depending on a womans age and how recently she entered menopause while starting hormones or more years past menopause raises a womans risk for heart attack using hormones at the time of menopause to treat symptoms appears to lower heart risk in april the whi published a major analysis that showed hormone users in their s had a lower risk of dying of any cause during the five to seven year whi study than those given a placebo the latest findings should provide reassurance to women who are considering using estrogen to relieve hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause says dr manson "this is still a group struggling with the hormone therapy decision and wondering whether the benefits outweigh the risk " she says "the pendulum had swung so far in the direction of estrogen being bad for all women that many younger recently menopausal women were afraid of hormone therapy " its not clear why estrogen appears to protect a womans heart the whi and other studies show the hormone lowers bad cholesterol and raises good cholesterol women who use estrogen have lower diabetes risk the hormone also appears to increase the elasticity and dilation of blood vessels while the new analysis shows that estrogen users have healthier arteries its not clear whether that translates into a lower risk for heart attack the whi suggested that younger hormone users were less likely to have heart attacks but there werent enough such women in the study to reach a statistically valid conclusion in the whi estrogen only users younger than had a lower heart attack risk but that finding could be due to chance while investigators continue to mine the whi data another study called the kronos early estrogen prevention study keeps is under way to evaluate the effects of various hormones on younger women because women dont typically start having heart attacks until their s and s the keeps study www keepstudy org will also rely on coronary artery calcium scans to determine if there are differences in the artery health of hormone users and nonhormone users hugh taylor an associate professor at yale university and keeps investigator says evidence continues to mount that hormones help the hearts of younger women "if this is preventing heart disease and saving lives i think its really wrong not to consider that in the equation" when deciding whether to take hormones says dr taylor however an nejm editorial accompanying the new whi study urged caution saying that hormones "should not be considered as a strategy to prevent cardiovascular disease in women there are proven therapies for cardiovascular disease that remain underused in women " estrogen and the heart heres what the womens health initiative showed about heart risk for women in their s who took estrogen compared with non hormone users  lower risk of severe coronary calcium in their arteries  decline in mortality  less likely to have a heart attack this finding didnt involve enough women to make it statistically significant source whi reports
