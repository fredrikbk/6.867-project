they are a focal point for trading in the u s subprime debt markets which lately have come to dominate attention on wall street because of problems at two big bear stearns cos hedge funds founded and run by a former bank credit trading executive year old lance uggla the markit firm with the backing of of the worlds biggest banks is helping turn the opaque world of credit trading into a high volume and more transparent business the abx he indexes that it runs are acting as a barometer of the subprime market and also allow investors to trade credit protection against that market markit collects price data from dealers and banks that trade billions of dollars daily in these designer credit contracts markit cleans the data into a presentable form and sells the information to clients mostly banks and hedge funds the price data of credit derivatives has been something banks and funds have struggled to see because they buy and sell largely through individual transactions between a bank and an investor rather than on public stock exchanges the abx he name is derived from asset backed index and home equity the indexes track credit default swaps essentially insurance policies against default tied to mortgage loans granted to americans with poor credit histories an unexpected increase in abx prices this spring after a plunge tied to increasing loan delinquencies by subprime

concerns the riskiest portion of the abx index hit record low territory this week lehman brothers holdings inc used the index to help hedge against losses and deutsche bank ag told investors last month that it benefited from using the index in the first quarter the bank bet on a decline in the subprime market and sold short "the abx index because our traders felt that the u s mortgage market was probably overheating and was potentially going to soften " chief financial officer anthony di lorio told investors on a conference call he declined to specify how much the bank made on the trade traders of the abx indexes can take opposite views of the mortgage market investors can hedge positions by buying protection a move taken by selling an abx index whose value is initially set at the
