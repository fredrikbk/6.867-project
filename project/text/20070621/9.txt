at&amp t gears up for the iphone carrier increases staff in high stakes rivalry with verizon wireless at&amp t inc has experience bringing to market popular cellphones like the motorola inc razr but it has never had to gear up for anything quite like june when it offers apple inc s iphone in its stores for the first time in preparation for its exclusive launch of the cellphone industrys most anticipated device at&amp t is pulling out all the stops it is adding about temporary employees to cope with the influx of shoppers in the first few months and it is planning for enhanced security to control the potentially large crowds and avoid theft of the phones which will go for a steep &# or &# depending on memory capacity some sales agents expect to see people camping outside the night before but the enormous hype poses some risks for at&amp t and apple all the attention will magnify any glitch or negative consumer reaction it is impossible to know whether the device will live up to the expectations of those who have heard about it for months but have never played with its features there are many who would like to get their hands on an iphone early but at&amp t is making very few exceptions even hollywood a listers are being turned away people close to at&amp t say both at&amp t and apple do have short vip lists but the few people who are on them wont get the device early and will still have to pay the people close to at&amp t say the only benefit they wont have to wait in line like everyone else the stakes are huge for at&amp t which has banked on the iphone to jump start subscriber additions as it competes for subscribers with verizon wireless a joint venture of verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc at&amp t formerly known as cingular once had a sizable lead of about five million subscribers over verizon after acquiring at&amp t wireless in but verizon has chipped away and now trails by only million to guard against defects in the first wave of devices at&amp t has more than testers around the country checking to make sure the phone works correctly in a variety of locations from high rise buildings to freeways to densely populated urban areas applehas conducted its own testing to iron out any software and hardware issues already apple has said it has upgraded the surface of the phone from plastic to more durable optical quality glass and made changes to enhance battery life at&amp t will offer the phones only in its roughly company owned stores not through third party dealers like radioshack corp and best buy co apple will carry it in its u s retail stores both companies will make it available online but at&amp t wont do so initially "we think its a good idea to have people come into the stores and touch it and see what other services at&amp t has to offer " at&amp t spokesman michael coe says at&amp t hasnt said how many phones it will have at the launch but mr coe says stores with the highest demand will get more by now many tech savvy consumers are familiar with the key features of the phone which will combine a touch screen interface with multimedia and web functionality whats unclear is how much at&amp t plans to charge for a monthly "data" plan a fee on top of a monthly calling plan to allow users to surf the web unlimited at&amp t data plans for other phones cost &# a month the price of the device itself could scare some off some people a survey by research firm idc found that while of respondents were interested in the iphone only wanted to pay full price and sign a contract with at&amp t apple added to the buzz around the internet capabilities of the phone yesterday when it said it would offer content from google inc s youtube including putting a link to the service on the phones home screen unlike verizons youtube service which allows users to see to popular videos from the video sharing site at any given time the iphone initially will offer videos and eventually will offer all of youtubes catalog apple says still the iphone wont work on at&amp ts fastest "g" network which could make web surfing slower than on many verizon phones users will be able to connect it to wi fi hot spots for faster speeds a recent survey by m metrics inc showed that roughly two thirds of the consumers who have a high interest in the iphone would switch carriers to get it but nicholas pantalone a year old verizon user from blairsville pa says that while "the iphone is really cool " he wouldnt want to pay the roughly &# fee to get out of his contract "i definitely like it but the problem is this two year plan " he says in europe consumers will have to wait until at least the end of this year to get the iphone apple hasnt announced any carrier partners overseas yet bart peeters a customer of vodafone in holland says he is holding off purchasing a new phone until he finds out whether he will be able to get an iphone through his carrier "im definitely waiting for it " he says nick
