how timex plans to upgrade its image fashion house deals may help watchmaker break into new market some of italys most exclusive fashion houses have found an unlikely business partner timex the brand known for cranking out mass market timepieces that "take a licking but keep on ticking " this morning family owned salvatore ferragamo spa will open the doors of its medieval palazzo on the banks of the arno river in florence to timex group chief executive joe santana who is expected to unveil a deal whereby the u s based company will produce high end watches for the italian fashion house closely held timex has similar partnerships with two other illustrious names in the italian fashion scene family owned versace spa and valentino fashion group spa recently taken over by private equity firm permira to make watches in the &# to &# range it inked the valentino deal in february and has made watches for versace since through these pacts timex whose own brand of watches normally retail between &# and &# hopes to make its way into the higher echelons of the watch industry where business is booming and rising prices are buoying profit margins but the company will need to tread carefully in promoting its ties with the luxury labels given its history as a mass market manufacturer it is an "assault on the high end of the watch market world wide " shannon eis a spokeswoman for timex said in an email about the deals without giving details ferragamo confirmed the deal but declined to elaborate versace and valentino declined to comment for this article for fashion houses entering the watch business is a fast way to boost revenue and profit especially for companies like ferragamo and versace which are considering public listings on the milan stock exchange and therefore will have to woo investors for watches as with perfumes and sunglasses designer brands justify a high premium for an otherwise mass market product watchmakers also often pay lucrative royalty fees for the right to license high end labels through license deals fashion houses dont have to pour capital into setting up a watch manufacturing business "the watch market is very competitive " versace ceo giancarlo di risio said in an interview earlier this year "you really need a specialist " versace originally made its watches in house but as part of a wide ranging restructuring plan for the italian label mr di risio in sold its switzerland watch making division to timex which now produces versace watches under license the partnerships carry risks for both sides however seeking a higher paying customer is a major about face in strategy for timex which forged its image half a century ago as a producer not of finely crafted objects of desire but of blunt machines that could withstand "torture tests " timex has taken a number of steps upmarket in october the company acquired vincent berard sa a so called haute horology brand that produces high end

advertising them in glossy fashion magazines it could take years for timex to get its new higher priced brands off the ground says rune gustafson chief executive of the british unit of interbrand a global branding consulting firm that is part of ad holding company omnicom group inc timex based in middlebury conn and tracing its history back to doesnt boast the swiss watch making legacy that helps elite manufacturers such as rolex create an aura of exclusivity swiss watchmakers mr gustafson says "are all marketing from a heritage of engineering excellence i dont think timex has that " stepping into the image obsessed world of luxury may also prove somewhat of a culture shock for timex mr gustafson says timex cant trumpet its ties to fashion companies too loudly or customers might think twice about shelling out cash for watches that arent actually made by the high end brands the upside for timex could be huge however by manufacturing watches for luxury brands timex gets quick access to the most lucrative end of the watch market without having to build a brand from the ground up the timex made and versace labeled dv one watch ranges in price from about &# for a basic model to &# for a diamond studded edition although the timex name doesnt appear anywhere on these watches some analysts say the companys links to the fashion labels will boost the cachet of its basic timex brand "if theyve got a big marquee brand they can persuade a retailer to take one of their smaller brands that theyre trying to develop " says jim hurley a luxury industry analyst with new york based fashion retail consulting firm telsey advisory group "it means they can get more shelf space "
