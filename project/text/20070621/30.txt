econoblog debating whats behind recent jump in bond yields online edition the wall street journal online treasury bond yields a benchmark for market interest rates scared investors earlier this month with a sharp rise and then a pullback what was behind the uptick in yields was it merely a hiccup or a sign of things to come how high might yields go and how might persistently higher yields affect other big economic stories from the private equity buyout binge to the struggling housing markets globally does this reflect a change of course for foreign investors wsj com invited james d hamilton an economics professor at the university of california san diego and mark zandi chief economist at moodys economy com to discuss their takes on bonds and what hints about the economic future their yields may yield what do you think share your comments on our discussion board james hamilton writes despite settling down a bit this week interest rates on year treasuries are up basis points since the beginning of may what could account for that dramatic increase it doesnt seem to be worries about inflation since the inflation protected tips yields are up just like the nominal have foreigners become more reluctant to buy treasurys if that had been the key development it should have also shown up in a weakening exchange rate with less demand for dollars and a declining stock market with more discounting of future profits but both stocks and the dollar have gained even as bond prices plunged long term bond yields are generally procyclical falling with the decreased spending and borrowing that accompanies an economic slowdown indeed a lot of us look at the spread between long term and short term yields as a predictor of what is going to happen to economic growth when the year yield fell below the overnight fed funds rate from q to q that was followed by slower than average real gdp growth but if investors are now expecting stronger growth that could explain why nominal rates tips yields the dollar and stocks have all risen together mark zandi writes i agree with jim that the recent increase in long term interest rates is not due to increased inflation expectations actual and expected underlying inflation remain low and tame i dont agree however that the principal reason for the higher long term rates is investor expectations of stronger u s economic growth consensus expectations of economic growth later this year and next have not changed appreciably behind the higher rates is slowly evaporating global liquidity this is most evident in tighter monetary policies across much of the globe central banks ranging from the european central bank to the chinese central bank are in the midst of a series of tightening moves indeed the federal reserve is the only major central bank not expected to tighten policy again before the year is over long term interest rates have risen across the globe not just in the u s reflecting a normalization of global monetary policy after a long period of being highly accommodative my view has two key implications first the rise in long term rates is more secular than cyclical second the higher rates will in fact soon weigh on growth the already very fragile u s housing and mortgage markets appear particularly vulnerable james hamilton writes marks survey of forecasters was conducted may before most of the big move in interest rates but mark is right that i cant point to a more recent survey showing greater optimism and the latest surveys from builders and consumers dont look good one way to gauge what investors really think is to ask them another is to see where they put their money and the strength in equity values suggests to me that people are betting on not just higher interest rates but also on higher income and profits it is certainly true that there is an international component to these rising rates but here again foreign central banks are raising rates because of inflation concerns which reflect continuing growth i agree with mark that the rising rates spell trouble for some sectors housing will surely continue to be a drag on the economy keeping growth rates below for the rest of the year but that could still be better than people were expecting two months ago i calculated from the historical yield spread gdp regression that the rise in long term yields over the last two months would imply a change in the expected quarter average real gdp growth rate from to that could still be consistent with significant ongoing pain in housing mark zandi writes since jim and i have referred to housing lets more carefully consider the fallout higher long term rates will have on this key part of the economy according to freddie mac fixed mortgage rates have risen by some basis points over the past month to their current given that the average mortgage loan is close to &# this will add almost &# to the average monthly mortgage payment for a potential new homebuyer given that of mortgage loans are fixed rate loans this will be another significant hurdle for the housing market to overcome the spring selling season was already a bust prior to the run up in long term rates home sales are being hit hard by the tightening in lending standards in response to the stunning erosion in mortgage credit quality it will be very difficult to make any progress in reducing the bulging inventories of new and existing homes without further substantial cuts in housing construction and house prices while the even weaker housing market will not undermine the expansion later this year it will be a measurable impediment to better growth particularly if it weakens the resolve of consumers to keep on spending aggressively which remains a considerable risk james hamilton writes unfortunately mark is exactly right about housing i had been among those who incorrectly predicted that lower mortgage rates would arrest the housing downturn last fall i think we did see some evidence of a rebound but then the sector was hit badly by the tightening lending standards mark mentioned now with mortgage rates back up and as mark also noted the inventory of unsold homes its hard to find any reason for optimism in this sector but the housing bust has been subtracting from annual gdp growth for a year now what weve clearly seen is that unless some other part of the economy follows it down a recession in housing need not mean falling overall gdp the recent numbers for retail sales including autos seem encouraging durable and capital goods orders have rebounded from their lows and employment growth has been stronger than many of us expected although it appears likely that the bls establishment data are overstating that strength mark zandi writes i agree with jim there are reasons for optimism that the broader economy will be able to overcome the ill effects of the higher long term rates a key reason is the resilience of the stock market unlike jim i dont think the strength of u s stock prices is related to better growth expectations supporting stocks are their relatively attractive valuations both compared to even the now higher long term rates and particularly compared to other global equity and fixed income markets the price earnings ratio on the s&amp p is close to approximately equal to its year average while the year treasury yield despite its recent rise remains well below its year average of nearly this translates into a healthy equity risk premium that is measurably greater than the risk premium on nearly any other global asset sturdy stock prices will underpin the balance sheets of wealthier households who will thus remain avid buyers they will also induce businesses to expand their operations through investment and hiring if long term rates rise much further however there will be a negative impact on all asset prices including u s stocks the private equity fervor has been fueled by heretofore low interest rates james hamilton writes but will interest rates head even higher to the extent that it is real economic activity that has been moving rates recently the feedback is self limiting if the economy softens further i would expect to see rates come back down and indeed some of the retrenchment that we saw this week may be due to a recognition that growth prospects are still far from robust if instead the market is being driven by international developments then of course a flight of foreign capital could still produce some real fireworks but while that concern has always been with us so has the potential salve where does world capital go in times of trouble if not u s treasurys the final player that should be mentioned here is the u s federal reserve although some have the impression that the fed might raise rates as easily as bring them down i really dont believe that were experiencing a crash in housing and a significant overall slowdown the fed has no desire to take that any further but they can live with gdp growth rates and until we see more progress on headline inflation they will so barring further changes in real economic activity or international developments i am not expecting further changes in interest rates any time soon mark zandi writes like jim i think long term rates are unlikely to move much higher until the worst of the housing and mortgage market corrections are over indeed they may move even lower late this year when i expect house prices to fall more significantly and mortgage foreclosures to mount i also believe however that next year as global liquidity continues to dry up long term rates will resume climbing equilibrium year treasury yields are closer to in other words this is the rate that should prevail in the long run abstracting from the vagaries of the business cycle and the effects of shifting global liquidity one likely catalyst for going from the current year yield of just over to next year will be the short circuiting of the yen carry trade global investors have been borrowing extraordinarily cheap money in japan and investing in higher yielding assets such as u s treasurys this will come to a quick end once the japanese economy finally enjoys a self sustaining expansion and the bank of japan responds by normalizing tightens monetary policy the u s economy which has benefited from a long period of unusually low long term rates will have some more adjusting to do what do you think share your comments on our discussion board write to matt phillips at matt phillips wsj com
