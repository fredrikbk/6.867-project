smoke screen philip morris gears up for fda regulation using science it tries to prove its products can be lower risk richmond va at a research park thats home to several biotech companies a &# million facility under construction will soon house hundreds of researchers but instead of testing lifesaving medicines these scientists will be focused on a product that kills an estimated americans a year the facility due to open in august is owned by philip morris usa the nations biggest tobacco company the altria group inc unit is preparing for a tectonic change regulation of tobacco by the food and drug administration with democrats in charge of congress the long debated step appears more likely than ever a senate bill is expected to clear a key committee next month and companion legislation has been introduced in the house both bills would give the fda broad sway over tobacco products including the power to set product standards which could include limiting certain ingredients in cigarettes tobacco makers whose products have been largely unregulated would have to turn over to the agency extensive information about their products the bills also dangle a potentially lucrative opportunity they say that if a new kind of cigarette can be scientifically proven to "significantly reduce harm" to smokers and its availability would also benefit the health of "the population as a whole" the cigarettes marketing claims may win approval from the fda the legislation which is backed by longtime tobacco industry critics rep henry waxman of california and sen edward kennedy of massachusetts has won wide support from public health advocates but many advocates warn that the fda needs to be very careful about allowing any health related marketing "we must be extremely wary of claims made by manufacturers " says kenneth warner dean of the university of michigan school of public health dr warner serves on a pfizer inc advisory board that examines tobacco policy issues and turns the honorarium over to his university pfizer makes the smoking cessation drug chantix philip morris which is working on a slew of new products it hopes might qualify for fda approved health claims acknowledges it must transform itself into a credible player in the expected scientific debates at the fda so the company is trying to emulate an industry already under the agencys purview the drug companies the company has a number of highly engineered products in the works all of which are designed to possibly reduce tobaccos dangers among them marlboro ultra smooth a cigarette with a high technology carbon filter accord which uses a holder to primarily heat rather than burn tobacco and snus a line of "spit free" smokeless tobacco products so far the products arent selling well in test markets philip morris confirms possibly because they arent being pitched as having any health advantages philip morris hasnt announced when or if any of them might be sold nationally analysts say the effort is consuming about half of the estimated &# million philip morris spends on research and development each year philip morris scientists are conducting human studies presenting results at research conferences and publishing findings in scientific journals such as the journal of clinical pharmacology to staff its square foot research center its biggest investment in two decades philip morris is trying to recruit dozens of physicians biochemists and other scientists and in the same way that pharmaceutical companies pay top researchers to lead drug studies and speak about their findings to regulators and other scientists the tobacco maker is trying to forge relationships with outside experts who might support philip morriss research efforts the company faces immense technical hurdles in its quest to develop an fda approved lower risk cigarette scientists say there arent proven measures that would allow philip morris to verify that any new kind of tobacco product is less likely to cause cancer or heart disease cigarette smoke contains thousands of different components many of which are known to be toxic and testing a cigarette is far different from testing a cholesterol drug a big problem for philip morris may be its reputation for many years tobacco companies denied the health risks of their products quietly funding research that ran counter to scientific opinion they peddled "light" cigarettes with implied health benefits when under real world conditions the products were generally no safer than standard smokes as a result philip morris faces many deeply suspicious public health experts many of them believe its efforts are at best empty public relations gestures and at worst manipulative "the industry has no credibility with the scientific community and the fda " says david kessler a former fda commissioner whose efforts in the s to regulate tobacco were struck down by the supreme court if there are to be reduced risk tobacco standards he says "the opinion leaders that are going to develop the science are not going to be the tobacco industry " dr kessler says he has made tobacco policy speeches in the past and accepted honoraria from pharmaceutical companies that make smoking cessation products while they have been reaching out to outside scientists and medical researchers who can review their own reduced harm product research philip morriss rivals havent done as much to ready themselves for regulation in the eyes of some wall street analysts philip morriss efforts are a gamble not only might the bills fail to become law but it might be decades before cigarette makers are able to amass enough scientific data for reduced risk products to pass muster with the fda philip morris is "making a sizeable and substantial investment particularly versus the outlay of their peers " says david adelman morgan stanleys tobacco analyst the risk he adds is that the companys newfangled products flop and "the time energy and resources have been wasted " philip morris says it has no choice but to pursue its high risk strategy last year it sold an estimated billion cigarettes roughly one of every two smoked in america but per capita adult cigarette consumption plummeted between and according to the u s department of agriculture "were doing this because we think its in the interest of our business " says john r nelson president of operations and technology at philip morris usa the company began beefing up its research operations around at first the work was mostly done through outside contractors "it was an infrastructure that we had never done and really didnt exist" at philip morris says jane y lewis vice president of product assessment at philip morris usa one challenge for the company was designing the human studies it would need to satisfy health agencies since it would be unethical to force cigarettes on study participants who elect to quit philip morris officials say they pay people fully for their time even if participants decide to stop smoking halfway through a trial because certain results can be blurred by the food subjects eat company researchers have also begun studies in which smokers stay in a facility for a period of time that way philip morris researchers can control and monitor subjects diets another reason to have smokers stay at a facility the new research center will have roughly beds so smokers can spend the night is that philip morris researchers are able to control the number of cigarettes subjects smoke in a day ms lewis says still she notes "we dont control how they smoke " the way smokers puff or even how they hold a cigarette can affect how much nicotine and other toxins they consume for one prototype of accord which uses a battery operated holder to heat the tobacco the company ran short term studies in humans beginning in it also followed consumers for as long as a year in philip morris started an ambitious yearlong examination of american smokers the total exposure study to help answer questions about the effects of cigarettes the study eventually involved people at about sites across the u s scientists gathered data about more than a dozen measures that might reveal the impact of exposure to cigarette smoke smokers had their blood checked for the presence of carbon monoxide and markers that signal heart risk such as cholesterol and a protein that is a sign of inflammation urine was tested for an array of chemicals that might be signs of cancer causing substances these data could eventually serve as a baseline giving a picture of what measures best highlight the differences between a smokers body and a nonsmokers body company officials say many public health researchers while conceding that the research could prove useful say theyre wary of furthering philip morriss agenda they also fear the peddling of a "safer" cigarette could discourage smokers from quitting ultimately the safest option tobacco companies "have a long and successful track record of subverting people in public health " says david burns a professor at the university of california san diego who has testified against tobacco companies in court and says he refused an invitation from philip morris to apply for research grants "we have to be very careful that we maintain both objectivity and independence " philip morriss mr nelson says the company is committed to trying to work with researchers who have opposed it "some of our critics have a lot of constructive things to say some are a little shrill but we listen and we talk " he says one of the companys efforts hiring the life sciences research office in bethesda md has already sparked controversy a nonprofit founded to conduct research for the army it has done work under contract for the fda as well as such projects as weighing the evidence of walnuts health benefits for a group of walnut growers in life sciences began a philip morris project that focused on reviewing research from tobacco companies and others related to potential reduced risk products with the goal of figuring out what evidence was needed to prove reduced risk claims the nonprofit says it reached out to about scientists and organizations seeking recommendations on what questions to address and who might serve on panels that would conduct the review it also invited scientists to submit research and participate in meetings some tobacco industry opponents informally boycotted the process declining invitations to join the philip morris funded scientific panel or speak to the group "im not going to lend my name to the perception and credibility of the company " says mitch zeller an fda official under dr kessler who says he declined to participate in the nonprofits work mr zeller consults for drug maker glaxosmithkline plc on its smoking cessation products some "of these folks just dont want to participate in company funded projects " says philip morriss mr nelson adding the organizations work was transparent and independent life sciences findings issued in april appear to be a win for philip morris the organizations main outside panel concluded that its possible to generate data to "assess differences in risks of adverse health effects" between tobacco products it endorsed the idea of reduced risk claims arguing that information about potentially safer products is being withheld from the public the choice may be whether "some good is better than none at all " the report says the conclusion clashes with views of a number of public health researchers who say the science isnt developed enough to justify reduced risk claims for tobacco products earlier this month two university of california san francisco researchers published a paper in tobacco control an antitobacco journal accusing life sciences of downplaying or concealing its "true level of involvement" with the tobacco giant it warned that life sciences may not be fully independent saying that some members of the nonprofits outside panels have had financial relationships with tobacco companies "anytime you come out with a conclusion that someone doesnt agree with the whole process is called into question " says michael falk life sciences executive director dr falk says the nonprofits process was transparent and that it didnt find professional or scientific conflicts of interest among the people it allowed on the tobacco review panels a spokesman for philip morris said it is still reviewing the results of life sciences report with its new research center a few weeks away from completion philip morris is trying to persuade scientists with a range of backgrounds including pharmacologists and neurologists to join the staff of a tobacco company mr nelson says the facilities will have labs and offices for at least scientists and engineers "were still looking around to hire people " he notes in august the company launched a careers web site intended to attract potential applicants the site has a link to an artists rendering of the completed center alongside photos and testimonials from current employees on the web site physician barbara zedler says that "to work on projects that may potentially reduce the health risks associated with smoking is both challenging and exciting " and the company is "eager for us to succeed " she conducts studies of philip morris products on smokers another testimonial from "kimberly " a molecular biologist says "going to work for a tobacco company was a total leap for me " but the text says she believes her work "has the potential to positively impact public health "
