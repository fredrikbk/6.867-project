the afternoon report taxes in the sunshine online edition florida is often held up as exhibit a when the excesses of the housing market boom are being discussed but a massive property tax cut signed into law today could as well make the state a case study in dealing with the hangover gov charlie crist signed off on the first part of what would eventually be the largest tax cut in floridas history putting his name to a measure that will slash up to &# billion in local property taxes over five years florida was in many respects the epicenter of the housing boom but with the market sliding into a deep freeze the state has emerged as a symbol of the housing bust one byproduct of the downturn buyers who had swarmed into the state suddenly find themselves facing massive tax bills on properties that are stagnating or even depreciating in value the law adopted today is an attempt to provide those individuals with some relief even though the real savings appear to be rather small the typical owner is expected to save about &# in the first year of the cut a reduction of roughly just the same gov crist believes slashing property taxes will help bolster an economy that is ultrasensitive to housings gyrations by leaving owners with a few more dollars to spend those who have vacation homes in florida will also see relief of while the owners of commercial and industrial properties will

under the law neighbors in similar houses could have dramatically different tax bills but the provision can cut both ways owners looking to sell and move elsewhere in the state complain that the prospect of a dramatic escalation in their tax bills locks them into their current homes even if they wish to move into a less expensive property and real estate agents say that has exacerbated the overall pain in the market resulting from broader economic forces the republican backed amendment would expand the homestead exemption in the short run and has thus run into opposition from those who think that the current exemption unfairly tilts the playing field others worry that the proposal would dish a punishing blow to the states revenue florida has no state income tax and so is dependent on property and sales taxes to fund its schools public works and other government bankrolled services others argue the amendment doesnt go far enough in easing the burden its prospects for passage in january are thus far from clear whatever the outcome floridas economy appears to be in the balance construction accounts for some of its economic activity and a number of other sectors from brokers to
