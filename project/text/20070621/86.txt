new fund raisers for candidates need people who know people how mr heckler became a key clinton bundler asking &# at a time miami a few weeks before his recent wedding year old attorney alex heckler made a half joking proposal to his fiancee tiffany zientz why not convert the wedding reception for into a &# per plate fund raiser for presidential contender hillary rodham clinton its not such a far out idea for a man who met his future wife by lifting her email address from a political fund raising list more far out ms zientz considered the idea cocking her head over a sushi dinner she paused "my father would be for it " she finally said "my mother would hate it " mr hecklers single minded devotion to fund raising is characteristic of a clutch of little known political operatives shaping the pricey presidential campaign he is a bundler one of the few hundred americans underwriting the early rounds of the campaign by cajoling friends relatives and contacts to dash off checks for a few thousand dollars to their favored candidate bundlers have been associated with presidential bids for decades but their worth is on the rise in the age of campaign finance reform with corporate contributions virtually eliminated and individual contributions capped at &# per candidate through the presidential primary season and another &# in the general election its up to bundlers to raise the tens of millions of dollars candidates need for a realistic shot at the white house the most well connected bundlers can bring in &# or more and campaigns vie for the best on the republican side candidates are wooing the or so bundlers who raised &# or more for president bushs re election democrats make aggressive plays for longtime operatives such as mr heckler who despite his youth was a top fund raiser for presidential nominee john kerry mr bush is widely credited with elevating the role creating an air of exclusivity by dubbing six figure consolidators "rangers" and "pioneers " republican rudy giuliani has his "all stars" and "sluggers " while fred thompson has his "first day founders " mr heckler is a "hillraiser" one of five in florida and nationally who raised more than &# for sen clinton in the first fund raising quarter ending march thanks in large part to their efforts she was able to raise &# million in the first quarter more than any other candidate in the race mr heckler declines to say precisely how much more than &# he generated these are busy weeks for bundlers until the end of this month theyre staging multiple fund raisers before the second quarter books close finishing up his honeymoon in europe mr heckler is intent on surpassing his first quarter numbers hell return in time for a miami fund raising round that will culminate in a june "mother daughter" event at parrot jungle island a miami convention center where contributors will pay at least &# each to mix with sen clinton many bundlers are well known lobbyists or business leaders driven by a desire to gain influence with a future white house a government post or perhaps an ambassadorship other clinton bundlers include supermarket billionaire ron burkle former ambassador and banker carl spielvogel and new york hedge fund executive steven rattner others like mr heckler a miami area lawyer who specializes in land use and public procurement have few or no business ties mr heckler says he has no national political ambitions he sells the fund raising activity to his law firm as being good for business and says hes given wide latitude to do it his own boss is a bundler for new mexico gov bill richardson another democratic candidate but mr heckler allows that hes also something of a groupie he likes the personal calls from sen clinton and audiences with her and former president clinton "given the choice of having lunch with george clooney or chuck schumer id go with schumer " mr heckler says referring to mrs clintons fellow democratic new york senator he also is motivated by the competition campaigns use internal codes to track the amount of money each bundler brings in sen clintons campaign chairman terry mcauliffe says bundlers constantly pester him for precise rankings and he admits to playing to mr hecklers obsessive side "whenever i go to miami he asks how am i doing how am i doing mr mcauliffe says "and i always say alex if you could just raise another &# youd be right up there at the top " short and sunny with slicked back short hair and a wide grin mr heckler was introduced to politics at an early age his parents are lifelong democrats and his stepfather is franklin sands the current democratic leader designee of the florida house of representatives in sixth grade at a family get together in new york he announced that he had joined the republican club of beth shalom academy in fort lauderdale "i said i liked republicans because i wanted to be rich " he recalls stunned his father and an uncle led the boy to a la z boy chair in the paneled den its fine to be rich he recalls them saying but never forget the poor "they told me why democrats were good " mr heckler says back home in florida he switched camps as a political science major at brandeis university in waltham mass he was a white house intern under bill clinton he also shuttled former texas gov ann richards to and from campus when she did a teaching stint at the university mr heckler went to law school at the university of miami and ms richards helped him score a clerking job at a politically connected washington law firm he currently lives in miami beach and works in the fort lauderdale office of shutts &amp bowen a florida based general practice law firm in the run up to the elections mr heckler began raising money for u s senate candidate betty castor the florida politicians bid was unsuccessful but at the event mr heckler made two key contacts sen clinton gave a speech of support ms zientz attended as a donor mr heckler saw ms zientz but didnt meet her he cribbed her email address from the fund raiser sign in sheet for the presidential race mr heckler supported sen kerry his first kerry event at a fort lauderdale restaurant in mid was disappointing the candidate waylaid by a last minute endorsement in new hampshire showed up five hours late mr heckler who had promised to raise &# that evening found himself in a bind when weary attendees drifted toward the parking lot without donating he raised &# that evening but only after dunning his parents for maximum contributions he went on to become one of mr kerrys most prolific fund raisers as well as one of the youngest meanwhile he had added ms zientzs name to his campaign distribution list when mr heckler sent out a group email telling dozens of people on his list that he was moving to a new law firm ms zientz emailed congratulations mr heckler replied with an invitation to lunch it was then that ms zientz now realized she wasnt quite sure who alex heckler was "i asked somebody in the office and they said isnt he the guy who sends out all that kerry spam " ms zientz says she agreed to lunch mr heckler also gained the notice of mr mcauliffe then the chairman of the democratic national committee mr mcauliffe attended a dnc fund raiser in miami organized by mr heckler and noted the unusually large haul the bacon and eggs event generated "the guy raised &# for a breakfast " mr mcauliffe says "a breakfast " in december various democrats began flirting with a presidential run and virtually all of them romanced mr heckler former north carolina sen john edwards and gov richardson paid personal visits to his office illinois sen barack obama telephoned mr heckler said to each camp he said the same thing he was a kerry man "its a loyalty thing " he said mr mcauliffe by then the leader of sen clintons campaign says he was determined to recruit mr heckler on jan mr kerry publicly declined to run two days later mr heckler says he received a call from sen clinton "she said john kerrys a good man and i wanted to wait on his decision before i called you " mr heckler recalls two weeks later he attended a cocktail party at her washington home for about large bundlers that night he joined the team among the florida bundlers mr heckler may be the most important to sen clinton in the first quarter he was the only new blood among her current crop of mega donors the rest having worked with the presidential campaigns of sen clintons husband people such as mr heckler help reach a new set of wealthy contributors sustaining the daisy chain of financial support that campaigns need to survive the clinton campaign declined to make sen clinton available for an interview as a hillraiser mr heckler was reintroduced to chris korge a miami lawyer and businessman with years of fund raising experience the two had worked together as bundlers for the florida gubernatorial campaign of democrat rod smith with mr korge as his mentor mr heckler learned fund raising rule no spend as little as possible on the event "a &# fund raiser isnt very impressive if it cost you &# to put it on " says mr heckler on march the last day of the first financial reporting quarter mr korge invited more than guests each of whom contributed the maximum &# to meet the clintons at his sprawling mediterranean lakeside home in pinecrest fla south of miami guests chatted with the clintons over cocktails and as the sun set across the water ate a buffet dinner at tables by the shore such massive fund raisers often are tiered events that allow access but less of it for medium rolling donors before dinner about guests each paying between &# and &# apiece had been treated to an hour and a half of cocktails with the candidate at the home of mr korges next door neighbor hip hop impresario timbaland combined the events raised more than &# million as people filtered out of the korge manse at the end of the evening mr heckler and his fiancee were standing in the foyer the elder bundler walked up and clapped him on the shoulder "youre about to experience something you are going to remember forever " mr korge said he steered mr heckler and ms zientz into his family room on mr korges widescreen tv the florida gators were manhandling the ucla bruins in a college basketball tournament in a loveseat looking tired but absorbed by the action sat the clintons the senator and former president stayed until the end of the game almost midnight "it was just a handful of people " he says "and tiffany and i hung out quietly very quietly with bill and hillary clinton " for bundlers who work without pay such access is one of the jobs prime benefits mr heckler flew on mr korges private jet to a democratic debate in april when he recently mentioned the high cost of homeowners insurance in florida he says sen clinton advised him to write up a memo and send it to her policy staff "another candidate might say uh huh good idea and keep walking " mr heckler says in mid may mr heckler oversaw a fund raiser in parkland fla where people mingled with sen clinton and ate cheese and crackers from paper plates in the backyard swelter of the mayors home the event generated &# and another success two attendees asked about staging similar events of their own with individual donors topping out at &# and a presidential bid running &# million or more candidates can survive only if they bring in new people with a new crop of friends sen clinton attended five additional fund raisers in south florida during that hour period raising more than &# after shed left town mr heckler was tucking into a large mixed salad at a miami beach steakhouse when his cellphone chirped he missed the call but got the voice mail "alex i just wanted to thank you for all of your support and to let you and tiffany know that ill be thinking about you when you get married in a few weeks " he reports sen clinton said ms zientz the development director for a nonprofit group called the womens fund of miami dade rebuffed mr hecklers suggestion to turn their wedding into a fund raiser still she tolerates the constant buzzing from mr hecklers two blackberry devices and two cellphones and the big gmc yukon truck he drives because a kerry campaign staffer once told him to buy american when mr heckler vowed to forgo fund raising during the couples honeymoon in europe she rolled her eyes "the only question is whether hell have two hours a day or just one " she says the couple married on june rehearsal dinner invitations trimmed in red white and blue announced "the next married couple of america" and named a "host committee" made up of the couples parents campaign style yard signs festooned the median strip outside of the reception hall the cake was shaped like a democratic donkey guests included top fund raisers for gov richardson and delaware sen joe biden two days later a wedding gift arrived it was a simple silver picture frame inscribed with the names of the couple with congratulations from bill and hillary clinton
