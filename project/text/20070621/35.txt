of love frye boots are back like a blast from the past and unlike other flash in the pan fashions their comeback is a telling sign of the times frye boots previous heyday was the first time the brand founded in became a fashion icon for women they represented a new and formerly impossible combination of strength and hipness wide toed and heavy they were a bold reaction against a period of restrictive femininity housewives vacuuming in heels claudia goldin hitched herself to a pair of fryes in the s and stomped around the west village with her tight jeans tucked into the bootlegs now a well known labor and history economist at harvard university she welcomes their return "fryes are kick ass boots " dr goldin says fondly "they say strength " with the benefit of hindsight we can safely say that the s woman used her fryes to look more liberated than she actually was the woman behind the man habits persisted for some time "there was tension she was a strong woman but she was still making coffee for the war movement " dr goldin says still the boots exemplified the effort of forging past the fifties with its traditional roles for women into a stronger more confident era though they remained popular into the seventies frye boots are so closely tied to the image of the sixties that they are on display at the smithsonian as an emblem of those years but there are also some ways in which their aura earthy utilitarian and anti fashion fits the current times too in fashion were coming off a similar period of femininity with floral prints and flouncy dresses finally on the wane our feet ache from the manolo blahniks that weve been wearing to work politically when fryes were last in fashion it was a period of unsurpassed idealism unrest over an unpopular war and a president who was out of favor today the political winds are blowing in some similar directions we have the iraq war darfur global warming and george bush whose approval ratings have plummeted to historic lows women have won many victories in the workplace and progressed to work life balance issues but studies say we still do more than our share of the housework and still struggle for professional equality political activism and social conscience are cool again rather than marching in protest activists are forming investment funds producing sustainable products going on world tour with bono "i really believe theres a strong societal connection between and the s " says leslie schnur a year old new york author who owned a pair of harness boots in the s when she attended berkeley jeannie the heroine of ms schnurs latest novel "late night talking " clomps through ms schnurs book in a pair of fryes jeannie does wear a stella mccartney dress rather than some india import smock "then it was paisley now its pucci " says ms schnur but now as then her frye boots serve to define her rebellious idealistic character for most wearers frye boots are about the freedom to blow off fashions dictums they are rebellious and at the same time in touch with the earth and a certain cowboy reality frye was founded by john a frye in an enterprising boot maker from england mr frye managed to sell to both the yankees and the rebels during the civil war the company maintained its utilitarian customer base for many decades putting boots on pioneers who crossed the west on soldiers

tarica sons of jimlars founders who own and operate it larry tarica who is years old and wore frye harness and campus boots in college says he and his brother bought frye thinking that leatherwear was a match for premium denim which has been booming since after the heady rush of their s popularity frye boots were left to their cowboy and motorcycle stalwarts for a quarter century or so three years ago actress sarah jessica parker helped bring them back after being seen about town in a pair of fryes in screeching contrast to her manolo blahnik tv persona on "sex in the city " now fryes are back

texas cant find enough vintage fryes to sell "they can bring an outfit down if its too frilly " she says again the message is jarring and rebellious and there you have it fryes arent just an emblem of geopolitical unrest theyre a response to fashion unrest as well perhaps like the culinary trend toward "slow food" healthier and more flavorful consumers yearn for slower fashion david wolfe creative director at doneger group retail consultants believes the fashion industrys fast fashion frenzy may be inadvertently driving people into frye boots and items like converse sneakers that feel more substantial zara h&amp m and other retailers have become expert at feeding us new styles in two week increments so there are new items each time we pass the store priced so inexpensively that we can afford to buy every week but the cycles move so quickly that i cant tell whats in vogue anymore are skinny jeans in or out theres no consensus "i think were in fashion burn out " mr wolfe says "were looking for things that are so out of fashion theyre cool " so now a whole new generation is finding an alternative in frye boots lauren goodman the year old fashion director at domino magazine counts
