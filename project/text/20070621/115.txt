the daily fix sammy sosa hits th home run unleashing rather mild celebration online edition the summer of saw sammy sosa and mark mcgwire duel for the chance to break roger mariss single season home run record a chase credited with bringing fans back to ballparks after labor strife wiped away the world series that summers fans would have been startled to peer nearly a decade into the future and see a rather muted celebration for mr sosas th home run today both mr mcgwire and mr sosa are suspected without hard evidence of fueling their feats with performance enhancing drugs today a disgraced mr mcgwire shuns the spotlight barry bonds is about to topple hank aarons all time home run record despite a huge number of baseball fans whod rather see him do anything else and every day brings headlines about steroids and human growth hormone for the record mr sosa connected in arlington texas in the fifth inning of the rangers victory over his old team the chicago cubs he rounded the bases accompanied by the theme music from "the natural " which to a lot of fans is one of those jokes that writes itself "i make no apologies in calling it cheap unceremonious and suspicion marred a dubious moment that someday may be affixed with an " writes jay mariotti in the chicago sun times adding that when he finally was done celebrating with these texas strangers while in the uniform of the rangers i felt empty i did for the same reason ill feel nausea when barry bonds passes henry aaron when i grew up the home run record was the most sacred in sports if someone had said two more men would hit and join aaron babe ruth and willie mays in the power frat id have made travel reservations years in advance well as you can tell by the absence of a dateline i am not writing from arlington texas what does mean when it is so hollow and clouded " so will mr sosa be a hall of famer before this cynical era that wouldnt have even been a question now it is last fall an espn com survey found less than of hall of fame voters said theyd induct mr sosa if eligible but if mr sosa wants comfort seven out of eight espn com writers surveyed said theyd vote him into cooperstown "there is no definitive proof about his alleged steroid involvement so in the absence of hard evidence his numbers are what we go by and they are of cooperstown quality " offers tim kurkjian the lone dissenter jerry crasnick counters with this "if barry bonds is neck deep in the steroid controversy and mcgwire is waist deep then sosa is at the very least knee deep " and then theres jayson stark who voted yes but noted "i dont feel comfortable casting votes based on assumptions or popular opinion or messy appearances before congress or who got named in jose cansecos book but i reserve the right to change my mind if we all know a lot more about him and everyone else when the ballot arrives " mr sosas milestone was just a warm up for the sour coronation of bonds as baseballs new home run king an event certain to release such waves of sour outrage and counter outrage that the fix is weary just thinking of it in the new york sun the always compelling tim marchman does a marvelous job trying to deflate the whole rancid souffle ahead of time "bonds the best player to ever step on a field is completely irrelevant " he writes "he remains the best hitter in the game but he plays for a lastplace team and no matter how good he still is he just has the feel of some old fossil hanging around to finish out his career records hes a more famous craig biggio " but mr marchman saves his best jabs for commissioner bud selig "a craven and ridiculous ditherer who has almost by accident done something noble by refusing to make any proclamation about the supposedly burning issue of whether or not hell be in attendance when bonds finally breaks the record people of one cast insist that his refusal to say he wont attend constitutes tacit approval of bondss atrocities people of another cast cry out in anguish that selig is dishonoring baseball by entertaining the notion of shunning someone against whom no charge has been proved selig meanwhile has done the honorable and sane thing presented with a nation of lunatics hes mocked the whole thing hes perhaps done it inadvertently but he has done it " the atlanta braves just finished dropping two of three to the boston red sox a series notable for the large numbers of bosox fans in the turner field stands thats nothing new the red sox are a big road draw everywhere but hearing bosox rooters shout down the hometown teams supporters on monday night still didnt sit well with the atlanta journal constitutions mark bradley "its a free country " he writes "youre allowed to root for the team of your choice but every so often there comes an atlanta sporting event that makes you wonder if this is still atlanta and if theres such a thing as an atlanta sports fan such a thing as we know has happened here often it happened in when legions of cubs fans celebrated a division series clinching it happened in when pacers people flew in by the planeload knowing thered be playoff tickets available at the old omni it happens whenever the cowboys or steelers play at the dome question is will it ever stop happening " these days at least braves fans have an excuse the new york mets once the beasts of the senior circuit are a putrid in june but theyre still in first place in the national league east because the braves are this month the old saying still holds true those who do not study bay area baseball history are doomed to repeat it so declares mark purdy of the san jose mercury news looking at the san francisco giants and oakland as two teams he says have been remarkably consistent in their philosophies since setting up west coast shop in and respectively "it is difficult to imagine two major league organizations with such dissimilar cultures or cultures that have remained basically the same through different owners general managers players and brands of overpriced ballpark beers at different ballparks " he writes mr purdys thesis "from the day the giants opened up shop in san francisco they have mostly been focused on giving their fans a lot of big stars with charisma while never winning a world series and since the as moved to oakland in they have mostly built their team organizationally and through trades to give themselves a lineup of very good players who have never been as famous as the giants famous guys but over the decades the as have won many more championships at every level " on tuesday the kansas city royals sent their fifth starter scott elarton to the hill against the st louis cardinals mr elarton came in with an era and departed with a era leaving joe posnanski of the kansas city star to ask a simple question "the royals and just about every royals fan knew before the game started that elarton was going to pitch approximately the way he pitched " he writes "so the question is why are the royals starting scott elarton in a game more to the point why do the royals even use five starters why dont they break away from the pack and return to the four man rotation " mr posnanski discusses the origins of the five man rotation he says it dates back to the los angeles dodgers in the early s before wondering how it got set in stone found a good column from the world of sports
