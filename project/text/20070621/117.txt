the expat life uncertain summers for expats having friends world wide is nice but the continual good byes are hard online edition this is a time of great excitement and movement for many expat families as the school year ends and people begin departing for extended home leaves however a cloud of uncertainty hangs over one group of folks those who still dont know where they will be stationed next year they say goodbye to departing friends without a clear idea of when or if they will see them again most of the people i know in this situation approach it with an admirable shrug and sense of adventure my friend ilene and her family arrived in beijing at the same time as us in august like us they had no previous expat experience and little in the way of expectations and like us they took to life here quickly learning to be amused by the daily frustrations that leave some folks enraged ilenes husband is working on one year contracts which arent uncommon here because of the expense of employing a full package expat no company wants someone here who isnt deemed totally necessary a year ago they werent ready to head home and were enthusiastic in june when his contract was extended for a second year but theres no word about a third year so far "wed love to stay and were trying to work it out " ilene says "you have to take a step back and say this is a fantastic experience and if it ends right now its been great and i feel blessed to have had this chapter in our lives " i feel much the same way and a big part of that experience is the people ive met here i had no idea that this would prove to be such a social time in our lives because the expat community is pretty tight knit the continual goodbyes are hard we have recently hosted or attended farewell parties for people bound for singapore sydney and cleveland a decade ago we moved to ann arbor michigan where an old friend of rebeccas lived with his wife pursuing a ph d the first time we met he asked how long we planned on sticking around i wasnt sure and he wasnt reassuring "we dont hang out with people coming here to get masters degrees any more " he said "theyre gone too soon you need to be going for a ph d " he was just joking we left ann arbor after two years but remain dear friends with him and his wife but now i understand what he was getting at its difficult to continually make new friends get close then say farewell and now i can sometimes sense this wariness when i meet longtime expats were relative rookies and i hope the folks wholl arrive over the summer will find me open and inviting it can be hard to get the kids to take a long view however last year i wrote about our eldest child jacob losing two of his best buddies the three boys remain close we visited javier wong in san francisco over christmas break and he and jacob reconnected like theyd seen each other the day before in august well visit andrew moy in washington d c this year its jacobs little brother eli facing a big loss as his dear friend hugos family pack their bags for singapore eli has suffered more than any of us from leaving friends and family behind in the u s and i feared the worst when i learned about hugos impending move i thought back to when we first met hugos family on vacation in thailand a place i really never thought id see playing on the beach hugo asked my boys if they could be friends forever "sorry no " jacob replied acting as the spokesman "we actually live in new jersey and were just in china for three years " "oh " hugo replied "can we be friends for three years then " "sure " hugo smiled three years is forever to a five year old now months later hugo is about to become another long distance friend eli took the news surprisingly well but it only reinforced his view of expat living as an endless series of heartbreaks i try to convince him his life is richer for the experience but he doesnt want to hear it "everyone in america is still there and we still love them and they still love us " i tell him "and now you also have all these great new friends in your life after we go back to america well have friends in australia hong kong china england " its a kids version of "better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all" and he doesnt buy it any more than anyone else nursing a broken heart ever has as i think about such things ilene is running around beijing doing "exit shipping" and planning a trip to japan which she and her husband wanted to visit before leaving asia she has enrolled her kids in school both here and in the u s for next fall and while some parts of suburban america will be welcome such as clean air and family nearby she worries about readjusting "ive enjoyed the new experiences and travel and going back to carpooling and being a soccer mom will take get some getting used to " she says ilene has no major concerns about her kids her son is happy either way while her daughter is pushing for a move to finland her best friend in china is preparing to return to helsinki next week and that seems like a perfect destination to her eight year old mind her fathers employer doesnt have many people there but maybe nokias hiring write to alan paul at expatlife dowjones com write to me and ill post selected comments in a future column please let me know if you want to share your thoughts but dont want your letter published below are some edited responses to my previous expat life column on food safety concerns my year old son and i spend two weeks in china in april of each year teaching in a small village near xian city shaanxi province once we arrive we eat nothing but the food the locals eat we have never had any problems and buy most everything at the public markets in a nearby town the chickens for example are alive when we buy them and they kill and dress them while we wait the birds look healthy how fresh can it get if they eat it we eat it and we have not had any bad experiences we like china john and alex metelski i like china too and i love the food but there are some serous long term implications to eating here all the time i doubt that anyhing you do two weeks a year will cause you any problems however i am an american living in yunnan and i think the biggest food safety issues here are the same ones back home you can usually avoid a lot of the dangers by going as small scale and local as possible the dangerous stuff bad additives residues and contaminants are more likely to be found in the giant factories that run on tiny margins and cutthroat schedules still theres always the problem of pesticide use a lot of pesticides that are banned from human contact in the states are widespread here and all kinds of unscrupulous chemical dealers are scouring the countryside theres really no way to know what goes on in the fields here are my general rules of thumb cook everything you may actually be more prone to food poisoning at western restaurants for this reason stay away from processed foods wash and peel and be wary of high water content fruits such as watermelons and tomatoes which tend to suck in more stuff as they fill themselves with water i tend to spring for organic tomatoes when possible and after several years in china i couldnt care less if i never see a watermelon for the rest of my life jeff crosby im not sure "organic" and "safety" are necessarily equivalent especially in a place like china yes you avoid the chemical pesticides and fertilizer but organic food is exposed to "natural" fertilizer that could introduce all kinds of other nasty things also i question the notion that organic farming methods are "sustainable" in a country that has to feed billion people they might work great for culinary elites expats and others with the money to spend but not the average person living on a few thousand dollars per year on a side note the only place in china where any member of my family ever got a strong case of food poisoning was at mcdonalds jeffrey s burk good points about organic farming the focus of my story was on my own decisions about what to eat and feed my family one attractive thing about lejen chens farm is i can visit there and see exactly what is going on calling that type of small scale farming sustainable does indeed seem questionable but i am not an expert i lived in dongguan guangdong for years and recently repatriated myself back to u s we miss the variety of foods available there both in terms of restaurants sichuan cantonese hunan xingjiang and much more and market shopping living in a smaller town in the desert southwest we find our choices limited in the range of vegetables and seafood and we have to make a twice a month two hour drive to nearby larger citys "chinatown" to get the more authentic veggies as far as seafood i still remember sitting at the fresh market in dongguan watching the fish vendor grab a live fish out of the tank scale and clean it in about seconds flat food safety yes its a concern i usually managed to get some sort of case of food poisoning about once a month usually from the food at the factories dont ever eat factory food or an occasional bad piece of meat or veggie one quickly learns which restaurants to go to and not we never had problems with food from the local groceries fresh markets or local restaurants and avoided street food like the plague i suspect the extremely hot temperatures the chinese cook the food to kills all the bacteria i think it also helped that my wife is local chinese from the area and was very picky about the food shed buy bob i think the diversity of food here is really spectacular there are a lot of cuisines that are basically unknown in the u s i had a great yunnanese meal tonight in fact my family lived in beijing in the late s and we enjoyed local produce and meats the only precaution i recall was to rinse produce in a mild bleach solution while chinese cuisine was a highlight of our life in beijing your reference to mrs shanens bagel shop brought a big smile i was a very happy camper when i found great bagels there back in jack gleeson thanks from what i gather the bleach solution is effective for killing bacteria but wont do much for non water soluble pesticides i lived in mainland china for more than years and can confirm the food safety complaints the water has been badly polluted with no sign of coming back even wealthy people have to live with it my mother has a decade long problem with her stomach nothing serious has been identified but the uncomfortable feeling persists it went away when she visited me in louisville ky last year and returned after shed been back in china for a month she is a physician and blames the water the air pollution and the pesticide intensively used on produce those effects will be enlarged among senior citizens lijian chen i hope your mothers good health returns as has been noted elsewhere here the water supply in china is a real concern when i lived in russia between and finding decent healthy food that wasnt contaminated or nuked as in chernobyl induced irradiation was at times a struggle in the summers at the open food markets id buy from the old ladies who i presumed grew the veggies at their dachas but in the winters i was stuck with imported frozen food found in the supermarkets despite coming from europe or the u s it was often of dubious quality production leftovers damaged goods unknown brands etc even being hyper vigilant i still got food poisoning on a regular basis eventually i compiled a list of gastric commandments thou shalt not eat anything with mayo avoid all prepared foods only buy parmalat and never purchase refrigerated food that wasnt delivered that day felicia
