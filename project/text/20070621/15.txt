capital globalization brings south africa gains and pains south africa is a miracle political power passed years ago from a small white minority to a black majority without a bloodbath it didnt become zimbabwe or yugoslavia "we went from being one of the ugliest societies in the world to the most hopeful " says bobby godsell chief executive of gold producer anglogold ashanti south africa he says with a touch of patriotic hyperbole is becoming "a normal society with normal problems " south africa long will be regarded as a triumph of leadership but it is also an economic experiment can a free market developing country democracy blessed with gold platinum english speakers and an inspirational story but plagued by aids violent crime poverty and an inconvenient location deliver a better life for the bulk of its people in an era of globalization during apartheid sanctions created "an unsustainable economy that could only compete against itself " says philip hourquebie chief executive of ernst &amp young in south africa when the african national congress took over in the failures of soviet communism and african socialism were evident but todays backlash against globalization hadnt yet arrived anc leaders chucked decades of rhetoric and opened the south african economy to the rest of the world they balanced the government budget didnt expropriate mines and lowered tariffs joel netshitenzhe head of policy coordination in the presidents office calls it "a self imposed structural adjustment program " an insiders boast that south africa didnt wait for the international monetary fund to force it to sober up south africa is playing by the rules of the new global economy if it fails to improve living standards for most of its citizens the lesson would be ominous early returns are promising the economy has been growing at annually for three years not asian style growth but far faster than in the past private economists think the economy can sustain close to a growth rate despite obvious capacity constraints such as a recent shortage of carbon dioxide to put the fizz in soda and beer with a population growing at a year thats enough to deliver a better life for the typical south african if prosperity is widely shared the government is meeting its goal of new jobs a year and is hopeful it can halve poverty from todays by south africa has first world shopping malls but of south africans dont even have pit latrines they use buckets is globalization the integration of south africa into an increasingly integrated world economy a help or hindrance to the countrys aspirations the answer is yes globalization is a double edged sword chinas and indias thirst for commodities has sharply raised the prices south africa gets for its minerals plus but also has raised the prices it pays for imported corn and oil minus global financial markets are helping to finance an investment boom plus and stoke a big home grown banking and money management industry plus but foreign money is flowing into the stock markets and lending not factories and that poses a risk the money will flee when interest rates rise elsewhere potential minus and contribute to volatility in the countrys currency potential minus the growing mobility of people is drawing skilled workers even luring back some expats plus but it also draws unskilled african immigrants to add to the existing surfeit of low wage labor minus and creates a brain drain of disgruntled south african nurses teachers and engineers to europe and australia minus lowering barriers to trade brings the usual pluses imports for consumers export markets for producers a spur to the efficiency of flabby businesses but here too globalization brings challenges at first glance the bmw plant outside johannesburg is a paean to globalization the robots are as modern as in bmws german plants assembly line workers nearly all black are unionized and well paid by south african standards computer printouts clipped to each of the series sedans tells where the car is headed japan australia the u s last year south africa exported bmws to the u s in all of cars coming off this assembly line are exported but the plant produces one car every four minutes bmws bigger german plants produce one a minute labor costs are only of the cost of the car so the savings from wages one fifth german levels go only so far a chart on the shop wall reveals that only half the south african made bmws come off the line without flaws that need to be fixed in the best german factory making the same car its employment at the plant is falling as robots replace workers good for workers getting trained to keep ahead of the machines bad for those who will never get hired and the enterprise is viable only because of a government subsidy a complex formula allows bmw to avoid tariffs on importing other models in exchange for every car it exports the government sees this as temporary expedient until productivity climbs to world levels the plants german technical director sees it as vital for the foreseeable future heres the rub south africa occupies a middle ground in the global economy the haves are doing well both whites and the new black working class and upper crust but the same global economic forces that make them winners pose a challenge to widening the winners circle south africa cant create enough low skilled jobs to employ its population its wages are too high to compete with china or india as a magnet for low wage low skilled manufacturing but south african workers see how well their best off countrymen are doing and are pushing for higher wages the countrys world class companies can compete in finance engineering construction synthetic fuels but they demand an increasingly educated and skilled work force yet the countrys education system is dysfunctional and changing too slowly for the swift currents of the global economy and as mr netshitenzhe cautions "the who are still poor in will be angrier than todays they will be more impatient "
