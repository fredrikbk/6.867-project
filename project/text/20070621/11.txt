bloombergs politics michael bloomberg says he isnt running for president and maybe we should believe him but his recent preoccupation with the state of national politics combined with his announcement tuesday in california that he is leaving the republican party to become an independent keeps the speculation on a low boil which is probably where the new york city mayor wants it mayor bloomberg has been traveling the country making the case that theres something rotten in our two party system "we do not have to settle for the same old politics " mr bloomberg said in california "we do not have to accept the tired debate between the left and right between democrats and republicans between congress and the white house " its less than clear what mr bloomberg would prefer in place of debate between congress and the president agreement abolition of congress debate between the legislative and executive branches and among competing "factions" was designed into our system of government by the founders but his contention that what the country really needs is an executive that transcends politics to "get things done" merits closer scrutiny in his own words "any successful elected executive knows that real results are more important than partisan battles and that good ideas should take precedence over rigid adherence to any particular political ideology " he added in a statement that would make any motivational speaker proud "working together theres no limit to what we can do " terrific amid such happy sentiment it seems churlish to point out that our disagreements about what the country should do are what lead to those debates that mr bloomberg finds so tiresome but underlying his critique is a belief inconveniently belied by the evidence that there is a large american center unserved by our two party system this is not to say that there arent plenty of moderates in america but moderation takes many forms antigun pro gay rights vaguely pro business but tax increasing mike bloomberg is one sort pro gun economically populist jon tester the junior senator from montana is another different sort pro war democrat joe lieberman is yet another kind their differences from each other are at least as important as their supposed moderateness as for "rigid adherence to ideology " its hard to understand how president bushs current support for immigration reform bill clintons signature on welfare reform or george h w bushs tax hikes fit into this caricature pragmatism is not the sole province of the mike bloombergs of the world but calls on our politicians to be more pragmatic are usually in practice calls for them to agree with whoever is doing the calling speaking of pragmatism mr bloomberg has not shown himself to be above using the two party system to his own political advantage he registered as a republican after a lifetime as a democrat when it allowed him to avoid a crowded primary field in the race for mayor he has chosen the independent path now for similar reasons of political expediency whatever his stated motivations frustrations abound in a two party system or any other political system but democrats and republicans each reflect fairly stable coalitions of interests which is why those two parties are settled so comfortably in our political mainstream independent candidates have always had great difficulty putting up a credible showing in a presidential race this is in part a function of the electoral college but is also evidence that even well funded independents tend to overestimate their appeal independents who have made a splash have done so by adopting an issue ignored by the existing parties lincoln and the early gop had slavery while even the mercurial ross perot had the federal budget deficit mr bloombergs plea for post partisan "managerial competence" wont soon have voters marching in the streets he has been a competent mayor and he has taken political risks in particular to push education reform but his popularity also owes no small part to the bush tax cuts that have floated the citys financial markets and revenues something he himself doesnt seem to understand or give credit to mr bloomberg has been quoted as saying that he wouldnt run unless he could win we hope he means it hes rich enough to afford the race but a candidate for the nations highest office should have more on his agenda than competence and should have reason to believe hed be more than a political spoiler
