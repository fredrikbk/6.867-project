starbucks ethiopia agree on licensing starbucks corp s decision to sign a licensing agreement with the ethiopian government could make it easier for other coffee growing countries to harness their intellectual property the seattle coffee chain said that it reached a deal with ethiopia to license market and promote coffees named after several of the countrys coffee growing regions starbucks had for months refused to sign a licensing agreement with the african country on the grounds that it was legally onerous and wouldnt help ethiopian growers earn more money the dispute was the subject of a page one article in the wall street journal in march neither side would explain exactly how starbucks and ethiopia bridged their differences but ethiopian officials said they made their greatest strides after starbucks chairman howard schultz stepped in to broker the agreement in march "he is clearly the one who enabled for mutual trust to immediately set in for conversation to replace hostile argumentation for us to travel both of us " said samuel assefa ethiopias ambassador to the u s ethiopia has spent the past few years trying to trademark the names of three prized coffees it grows sidamo harar and yirgacheffe in order to eventually earn higher prices for the beans by turning them into stronger brands as part of that effort it has asked coffee companies to voluntarily sign royalty free licensing agreements that would help build the market for its beans the agreement starbucks signed is broader than the one it initially rejected under the deal starbucks will promote ethiopias coffees in its stores and help farmers improve the quality of their beans starbucks wont pay a licensing fee to use ethiopias regional names on its packages starbucks initially bristled at the idea of signing a licensing agreement because some of the coffee names it covered hadnt earned trademarks in the u s but the agreement it signed applies even to ethiopian coffees with names that havent earned a trademark ethiopian officials say they hope the agreement will eventually lead to higher prices for farmers "its a great framework for cooperation between starbucks and the ethiopian coffee sector " said sandra taylor starbuckss senior vice president of corporate social responsibility
