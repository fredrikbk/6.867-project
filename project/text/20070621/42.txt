heres an earful congress should ban all earmarks in regard to sen tom coburns june editorial page commentary "earmarxists" excuse me but what we need is a ban on all earmarks not "earmark reform " in a federal system of government the central government exists only to enact generic laws applying to citizens in all states it should not enact laws that either tax or provide benefits to citizens of a particular state thats what state legislatures are for instead we have members of congress charting how much each state "gets back" in local pork on what it pays to washington if every state "gets back" a proportional amount then everybody is happy and congressman and senators get re elected for what they "accomplished" for their local supporters its all a shell game where the middleman congress gets his cut barry milliken new york sen coburn makes a lot of sense in his commentary but it seems to me he is ignoring the essential question what is the driving force behind the "earmark" phenomenon its so clearly destructive yet it persists im sorry to say that the answer can be found more on main street than inside the beltway congressmen like pork because it helps them get re elected main street likes pork because of avarice the chance to get something for nothing listen to politicians on the stump the first thing they talk about is all the money and projects they have brought back to the home district to do otherwise would be political suicide the problem is simple earmarks bound for my home district are "economic opportunity " earmarks bound for your home district are "pork " until that reality changes folks like sen coburn are rolling this boulder uphill fiscal responsibility for thee and thee but not for me peter himmel quincy wash
