human rights hoax the u n s new human rights council marked its first birthday tuesday in geneva by voting to withdraw monitors from cuba and belarus while enacting rules that will make it more difficult to launch investigations of rights violations in other countries we knew this outfit would be embarrassing but it keeps surpassing expectations the council was sold as an improvement on its predecessor but with members almost half of which are ranked either "unfree" or "partly free" by freedom house and a mandate to reach consensus that was always unlikely in trying to placate china cuba saudi arabia and russia this week council president luis alfonso de alba of mexico drafted a set of rules that mock the institutions very mission the new rules promise to review u n monitoring of the nine countries still on the human rights watch list burundi north korea democratic republic of congo haiti liberia cambodia burma somalia and sudan at the request of china the council will now insist on the "broadest possible support" for initiating any investigation preferably a minimum of supporting nations thematic probes on subjects like food will undoubtedly continue while those aimed at defending freedom of speech and political rights will come under attack the one investigation that remains certain and permanent is the monitoring of israeli "violations" in the palestinian territories the real scandal here is the wests abandonment of moral leadership under the "consensus" mandate even a handful of the members could have blocked this anti democratic document yet only canada objected to the indictment of israel and mr de alba refused to acknowledge the canadian concerns
