blackstones world of cash will the private equity party this weeks blackstone ipo is icing on the cake end with a bang or a whimper lets recall that on friday oct the almost &# billion employee led buyout of united airlines fell through a bookend on a wild s of junk bond led takeovers the dow dropped points that day almost thats points today ouch could it happen again sure the money involved here aint small potatoes private equity funds raised &# billion last year up from &# billion years ago there are now over private equity funds with more than &# billion in assets the value of deals done last year was &# billion up from &# billion five years ago most of it was taking public companies private equity office hca harrahs clear channel and on and on whats fueling the boom with the dow over its not like theres lots of cheap companies just begging to be bought and turned around rather the world has been awash in cash the money supply has been growing like a weed at the same time that the federal deficit is shrinking &# billion through the first eight months of budget year down from last year as our trade deficit with china grows they keep buying our long term bonds add to that the japanese carry trade borrow in japan at negligible interest rates and invest elsewhere and you get distortions especially from fixed income investors such as banks insurance companies pension funds and hedge funds all chasing higher yields the biggest beneficiary has been private equity funds they buy companies by putting up some cash and then borrow the rest their borrowing costs which show up in the spread between their rates and year treasuries have been at historic lows anything less than four percentage points is a gift it bottomed recently at percentage points thats a ridiculously low hurdle to jump over to justify a buyout plus wall street has created a huge business in credit swaps and derivatives to help more money flow into private equity deals so everything has been in play environmentally challenged electricity generator texas utilities sure dying auto maker chrysler why not the dirty little secret is that private equity investors really arent all that good they take mediocre investments with lackluster growth but steady cash flow and add leverage to amplify the returns one great move we saw from the pe crowd is hertz immediately after investing borrow &# billion and pay it out as a dividend to the investing group so they can get their money out all of a sudden management is focused and will do anything to maintain or increase cash flow heres the usual list cut spending workers offices factories and advertising and with tech companies now in play cut r&amp d their lifeblood dont mistake financial engineering for company building damage the franchise no matter its still lucrative buyout firm kkr and friends paid &# billion for toys r us two years ago they should change the name of private equity to fees r us besides the same management fee and of the upside carried interest that hedge funds and venture funds charge for the money under management private equity heaps it on there are transaction fees for doing the deal in the first place hertz was bought for &# billion plus debt and incurred "transaction fees and expenses of &# million" monitoring fees to keep tabs on their investment toys r us pays &# million a year to its investors consulting fees investment banking fees and even termination fees when the company is flipped back to public investors why not accounting fees to keep track of all these fees this booty often goes to the general partners of the fund not the pension funds and university endowments limited partners who invest in the funds is there an economic purpose to all this sure someone has to squeeze efficiencies out of lackluster businesses but couldnt management of public companies do this in the first place excuses of sarbox and public market scrutiny or demand for short term quarterly results ring a little hollow its just more lucrative to do the high risk high wire act of going private borrowing until theyll lend no more and load companies with debt up to their eyeballs borrowers chasing yield tend to forget about the risks late in the last buyout cycle just before the ual deal blew up deals were being done with piks payment in kind bonds rather than interest payments in cash lenders just received more of the same bonds these were sold with a straight face mainly to japanese banks whose aging managers wanted one more bonus before retiring well theyre ba ack with names like covenant lite and pik toggle these debt instruments are designed to help companies by suspending cash payments when times get tough and are being sold to hedge funds which book profits now so much for discipline on either side tomorrow the stock of private equity king blackstone group with &# billion in assets starts trading in the public markets forget the irony of a firm that takes companies private going public itself or the paradox that only accredited investors can get into blackstones fund but any ordinary schmo can invest in the risky stock it will be a hit the senates baucus grassley shakedown bill aims to take their own fees by taxing publicly held pe companies at the corporate rate instead of perversely blackstone could just load up with debt to avoid the higher taxes adding risk no one can call a top but there sure are signs of fatigue with the dow near all time highs prices arent cheap lenders are feeling stretched and may dry up their bottomless pit of funding bank of america chief executive ken lewis suggested last week that "we need a little more sanity in a period in which everyone feels invincible " ten year bonds have been backing up with yields approaching this surely means money supply growth is slowing the chinese are making noises of slowing treasury bond purchases and usually what happens is that everyone remembers at the same time that cash flow is for suckers and the flow can dry up fast if the economy slows debt payments get tougher piks wont be worth the paper they are printed on hedge funds will go chase something else this is the stuff that sours credit cycles maybe private equity deals will just slow down to a more reasonable pace yeah right these guys have raised big funds and are paid not to back off more likely some giant deal icarus inc will get its wings clipped just like united then we get a point drop in a heartbeat on a happy note the demise of buyouts in the late s led to a technology funding cycle that peaked a decade later something productive is sure to emerge after this buyout cycle as well keep some powder dry mr kessler is an author and former hedge fund manager
