foreign affair is end near for u s only accounting the securities and exchange commission took its first step toward embracing international accounting standards for all companies that file financial reports in the u s the sec yesterday voted unanimously to propose allowing companies based outside the u s to file financial results using international financial reporting standards or ifrs as set by the international accounting standards board without reconciling the figures to u s generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and highlighting the differences as is now required regulators hope the move will attract more stock listings to u s exchanges and may mark the beginning of the end of gaap the proposal is a "significant next step" toward one globally accepted accounting standard and having all companies speak the same financial language sec chairman christopher cox said the proposal will be open for public comment for days and must be approved again by the five member sec before taking effect the sec also said it would take an initial step this summer toward exploring the possibility of allowing u s companies to file financial statements either under u s gaap or the international alternative such a choice if permitted could mark the eventual death of gaap but one sec official said yesterday that such a move is likely to take five to years given all the changes that would be required yesterdays decision is the latest by the agency to adapt to the increasingly global securities market and to address concerns that u s financial markets are losing their edge to london and hong kong the move also raises concerns which the sec acknowledged about ensuring american investors receive accurate and consistent information earlier this year the sec approved rules that make it easier for foreign companies to stop filing financial reports if they no longer trade on u s exchanges the sec also is studying ways to recognize other nations regulations to facilitate trading of foreign stocks in the u s while ensuring protection for investors international standards still are in their infancy and differences remain between those rules and u s gaap "i have to admit im really torn " said janet pegg an accounting analyst at bear stearns "if you believe in convergence which i do this sec proposal is a natural progression but i think im concerned that it may be happening too soon " differences between the two accounting systems could make it difficult for investors to compare companies even firms in the same industry under u s gaap research and development costs for example are generally expensed when they occur under the international standards once a project gets to the development stage costs are spread out over time the upshot is that a company could show different operating income and net profit depending on which system they use the move toward one global standard discussed for years picked up steam in when the secs then chief accountant donald nicolaisen drew up a road map toward that goal and sec chairman cox endorsed it shortly after taking the helm in august the european union began pushing for such a move after mandating that publicly traded companies within the bloc from start reporting results using ifrs scrapping the dozens of national accounting systems in use by public companies the idea was to make it easier for investors to compare financial results whether a company was in london or lisbon since then european companies have said it is too costly to report under both the international and u s systems among many companies investors and analysts a convergence of national accounting systems into one set of global standards is welcome "if were serious about the investor community having opportunities to invest broadly the sooner we can get to one model around the globe the better " said mr nicolaisen u s companies and investors may be reluctant to shed an accounting system they have used for decades but mr nicolaisen urged them to focus on the benefits of a global accounting system "were better off being part of the solution than being the only country on earth with our own unique accounting because it makes it difficult for investors outside the u s to invest in our capital markets " he said yesterday the sec recognized that some companies might shop around for the most favorable accounting treatment john white the secs director of corporation finance said "the important thing to remember is if you are in that group of companies that wants to access u s markets without reconciliation you still have to comply with what were proposing here " which is compliance with ifrs as published by the international accounting standards board "were moving cautiously because we dont want to be in a position where were imposing our will and interpretation of ifrs " he said the international board is a privately funded group based in london that was formed in april to take over international accounting standards responsibilities from a predecessor committee u s gaap is overseen by the financial accounting standards board a year old private sector group based in norwalk conn although the statutory authority to set accounting standards for public companies rests with the sec
