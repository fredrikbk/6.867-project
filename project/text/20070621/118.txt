open spaces shoots intruders on sight and he shoots to kill the official gamekeeper for europes busiest trading hub mr noorlander patrols the docklands in a tireless hunt for the varmints that could undermine global trade by tunneling under the pipelines rail tracks and levees that keep europes economy operating smoothly as a container of chinese goods rumbled by on a train early one morning recently the year old mr noorlander quickly shouldered his weapon and cut down his first rabbit of the day "thats a small one " he said "ill feed it to my ferrets " ports are especially vulnerable to pesky animals like rabbits and deer because they offer large fenced in areas of dirt and grass charles de gaulle airport outside paris employs five hunters who bag rabbits with nets officials at washingtons dulles airport organize occasional hunts to keep the deer population below but rotterdams situation is hairier than most like much of the low lying netherlands the square mile port is built over rocks and sand and surrounded by giant levees or dikes within the port oil and chemical companies use minilevees to protect the rest of the port from spills rabbits love to dig in dikes unchecked the ports nearly rabbits could cause serious structural damage says han vrijling a professor of hydraulic engineering at the technological university of delft its unlikely they could ever dig holes big enough to draw sea water but they could easily cause rail track or pipelines to collapse thats where mr noorlander comes in port officials cant poison the rabbits because of environmental restrictions "if we didnt have cees wed be in trouble " says tie schellekens a port spokesman the stakes are increasingly high thanks to the global boom in trade to keep up with the rising tide of chinese and other goods rotterdam is building a new &# billion terminal that involves filling in acres of the north sea with sand prime beachfront real estate for bunnies a retired

world of wind turbines oil refineries and mounds of coal taller than houses the port hunter cruises for his quarry in a green range rover driving over bumpy grassland and a latticework of bicycle paths he hunts mornings and late at night often wrapping up around a m other than the occasional hunt with his son rene his only companions are his browning shotgun a german longhair pointer named rex and ferrets all named "cees" which mr noorlander uses to force the rabbits out of their holes at night mr noorlander often doesnt need the ferrets there are so many rabbits out in the open he sometimes rides shotgun in his vehicle blasting rabbits from the passenger window while rene a crane operator drives "or else i can drive and my son can shoot " he says he kills about rabbits per sortie his record is anything over is reason to crack open a bottle of jagermeister liqueur last year he notched about kills and is on a similar pace this year he feeds dead rabbits to his ferrets sells them to a butcher in amsterdam for &# apiece or gives them to his wife to make stew "my favorite recipe is with fruits and honey " he says hunting in a busy port requires stringent safety guidelines "you have to be careful about the place where youre shooting " mr noorlander says "is there a pipeline a railway a car a man on a bicycle " he rarely misses he says he has never hit a tank or pipeline or a man on a bicycle the shot carries only about yards sometimes mr noorlander is called in for a special hit sitting in his lodge one afternoon he took an urgent call from exxon mobil corp rabbits had invaded the oil giants refinery complex the company needed help mr noorlander checked his schedule and made a date for thursday mr noorlanders efforts have earned him the ire of dutch

terminals " says dimitri schildmeijer a spokesman for exxon mobil in the netherlands on patrol one night mr noorlander spotted rabbits on the grassy strip between rotterdams new rail freight line and a refinery owned by the kuwait petroleum corp the next morning at a m mr noorlander packed his green range rover with his shotgun shells his dog and two trained ferrets he clamps the ferrets mouths shut with steel rings so they dont kill the rabbits inside their warrens navigating his way past trucks laden with petroleum and coal he glanced skyward rabbits hate water and wont leave their holes if its raining satisfied with the weather mr noorlander jerked the wheel and pulled off the road crossing a bicycle path he parked on a grassy strip in front of a network of a dozen holes atop an underground oil pipeline the kuwaiti refinery emitted a low hum nearby traffic on the a highway was building with morning commuters mr noorlander pulled the two ferrets out of a wooden box and poured them down one of the holes three minutes later a rabbit emerged a loud boom from mr noorlanders browning rumbled across the flat land the rabbit fell dead its body peppered black with shot shortly thereafter a smaller rabbit jumped out of the hole mr noorlander held his fire "i wait for the big one " he said on cue the big rabbit appeared the hunter fired but succeeded only in wounding his quarry mr noorlander released rex instincts blazing the six year old bounded out of his cage toward his prey his master guided him with hand signals rex returned rabbit in mouth it was still alive mr
