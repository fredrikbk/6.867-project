mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q having recently switched to a windows based smart phone treo which has sensitive information on it i am concerned about the need for antivirus and firewall security is security prudent for these phones a first of all the "windows" on your phone isnt in any way the same software as the "windows" on your computer programs including viruses and spyware which are designed to run on a windows pc typically wont run on a windows mobile phone there is some evidence of malicious software infecting phones but the problem is quite minimal and i dont see a need to install antivirus programs and firewalls on phones yet q i am limping along on microsoft me and would like to obtain microsoft vista "ultimate " i am finding that there are no desktop machines available in the stores that have "ultimate" preinstalled on them they all seem to have vista home basic or home premium why is this a windows vista ultimate is the most expensive version and doesnt do very much more for an average consumer than home premium but it can be found on some higher end model computers in stores and can often be specified when ordering a higher powered computer online from companies like dell and hewlett packard q as you know there is a limit of pcs on which you can store play your itunes copy protected music i recently donated a pc but forgot to de authorize it from my list of available computers is there a way to accomplish this even though i no longer have the machine a yes apple allows you to reset your authorizations either by going to the account settings in itunes or by contacting them and explaining the situation the account page in itunes is reached by going to the itunes store and then selecting "account" under quick links at the upper right this reset will deauthorize all your machines but thats not as drastic as it sounds it merely forces you to enter your password the next time you play a copy protected song on any of the computers you want to remain authorized after that youre all set
