prokofievs works for the fleet fingered prokofiev festival san francisco symphony continues tomorrow saturday and sunday san francisco michael tilson thomas musical director of the san francisco symphony since sets aside a couple of weeks each summer for a mini festival devoted to one of his favorite composers mahler in stravinsky in or to a theme that interests him like the memorable "american mavericks" festival of or the wide reaching tour of russian music in this summers concerts are devoted to the work of sergei prokofiev whose music ranges from spiky wry and jarring to easy listening to soviet mush along with a dozen other compositions the festival features all five of his piano concertos played by four well known russian pianists which makes sense for years from to prokofiev was as well known as a concert pianist often of his own works which showcased his hammering fast fingered style as he was as a composer and he paid most of his bills from his concert fees although he also wrote operas ballet and film scores symphonies songs and sonatas a number of which have become very popular it could be argued that it is in his piano concertos that we encounter prokofiev at his strongest as he set the instrument of which he was himself a master in the richest possible context of still accessible and emotionally moving symphonic orchestration ideally he merged the two in indisputably modern music that never completely breaks its ties with his moscow conservatory training while twisting and bending almost all of its rules the prize performance of the first two concerts was yefim bronfmans of the third piano concerto the most often performed of the five he can meet all of the composers formula one racing car demands for speed up and down the keyboard outpacing the panting strings while either pounding at volume or rippling in spring trills crossing hand over hand as if he had fingers on one wrist and yet the concerto never sounds like a mere virtuoso display piece the speed and dynamics matter profoundly in large part because the orchestra never better than it sounded this week is always an equal partner each section almost each instrument marvelously distinct finishing the pianos sentences overlapping its lines replaying its themes basses and cellos seconding the thumping left hand the sinuous "snake charmer" theme of the second movement is transmuted into five wide ranging variations that display the whole orchestras skills as well as the pianists the "allegro ma non troppo" finale if this is not "too fast " what is moves from high singing strings and thunderfooted piano chords to a piano versus orchestra race to the finish that had the audience leaping to its feet for repeated curtain calls there was no way vladimir feltsman could equal this in the second piano concerto at the second concert even though it is notoriously more difficult to play he hit all the hyper rapid notes precisely luxuriated in a long rippling solo cadenza raced through the wild scherzo and pounded away at the warring close like the soul of prokofiev himself but an inner meaning was lacking a sharpness of stroke the sense of controlled madness that so outraged early audiences the third symphony recycles thematic material from prokofievs orgiastic diabolic opera "the fiery angel " which he had been unable to persuade anyone to perform i first saw it in in an r rated production from st petersburg but these themes were translated and expanded into an independent and unified work which grows almost too exciting in the second half mr tilson thomas and his eloquent orchestra brought into piercing focus many of the elements i associate with the composer strings squirrelling up into high e string melodies with slightly skewed acidic harmonies brash intrusions of brass and percussion the work begins and ends with clanging bells harsh single note sawing of massed violins matched to bass and drum beats but even at its most furious prokofievs remains classical music classical music stretched and reshaped into brave new sounds but never to my ears into sounds that seem wrong or painful to hear we were reminded of the composers range by a preconcert performance of his first violin sonata a risky varied piece of disjunctive moody modernism written for david oistrakh in and performed with flair by concertmaster alexander barantschik with mr feltsman prokofievs popular persona was represented by the conductors choice of of bits from the ballet "romeo and juliet" which always makes more sense complete and with dancers in this case unfortunately the orchestras rendition fell considerably below the definitive standard of their recording which includes pieces the first of five grammy winning discs by mr tilson thomas and the sfso mr feltsmans piano version of five episodes indifferently played struck me as a perverse thing to do to good music actually my second favorite work of the two concerts was a refreshed and joyful reading of the ever popular suite from "the love of three oranges" which captures so much of prokofievs musical sense of humor as well as his unique ability to achieve maximum color at maximum volume without being the least bit reactionary if you disregard some of his patriotic works for stalins soviet union where he resettled in he remains more an ingratiating "everymans" modern composer than either stravinsky or shostakovich at the remaining concerts the orchestra will perform with ilya yakushev a year old pupil of mr feltsman prokofievs first piano concerto a short explosive defiantly antiromantic piece written while the composer was still a conservatory student and the fourth a virtuoso piece written in for a one handed pianist who rejected it as unplayable mr yakushev will also play piano sonata no and as an hors doeuvre on sunday no mikhail rudy will play the fifth concerto some peoples vote for the best of the five and for early arrivers friday and saturday the short fleeting "fugitive visions" of the friday saturday program will also include pop orchestral suites from the ballet "cinderella" and the unmade film "lieutenant kije " on sunday mr tilson thomas unleashes a work of the composers enfant terrible phase the "scythian suite " a brassy dissonant intentionally shocking minute orchestral work that drove audiences to catcalls and cheers at its premiere in st petersburg in as the similarly barbarian "rite of spring" by his archrival stravinsky had done in paris three years before mr littlejohn writes about west coast cultural events for the journal
