ahead of the iphone other makers offer some quality devices despite the feverish hype around apples forthcoming &# iphone which goes on sale next week the established makers of smart phones arent idle they continue to turn out new models capable of not only making voice calls and exchanging text messages but of handling email surfing the web taking pictures and playing music and video in fact this category is getting so crowded that its hard to follow all of the contenders t mobile and sprint for example have just announced very similar smart phones running microsofts latest windows mobile software both feature horizontal keyboards that slide out from beneath the screen the t mobile wing costs &# after various rebates while the sprint mogul which runs on a faster network costs &# but ive been testing two other new smart phones that i find especially interesting one is the latest attempt by blackberry maker research in motion to appeal to consumers the other is a high resolution camera phone by nokia which costs more than even the iphone the new blackberry curve sold by at&amp t is sort of a cross between the makers low end consumer oriented pearl and its larger more traditional models like the series it costs &# after rebate with a two year contract unlike the pearl which manages its slender size by sporting only a squished keyboard where two letters must share each key the curve has a full if slightly compressed keyboard i found it no problem to use accurately it does however use the pearl like trackball instead of the famous blackberry side mounted wheel to accommodate the keyboard and a wider screen the curve is wider and a bit thicker than the pearl and has more of the traditional blackberry look and its over heavier but its narrower shorter and lighter than the though a bit thicker the silver colored curve doesnt boast any technological breakthroughs its mostly an attempt to bring the blackberrys email capabilities to a model that doesnt compromise the keyboard the way the pearl did it has all the traditional blackberry features plus a two megapixel camera a slot for a memory card and the ability to play music and videos in my tests i had no trouble at all sending and receiving email on the curve taking or displaying pictures or playing music i was able to move over some songs and pictures from my own computer and they displayed and played as promised voice quality was fine and phone talk time is about four hours reasonable but not outstanding in a welcome move the curve has a standard headphone jack capable of playing music in stereo and handling phone calls it also includes bluetooth for wireless headsets and use in cars but it doesnt have wi fi wireless networking it also runs on at&amp ts relatively slow edge network instead of the carriers faster data network and the web browser is mediocre the nokia n lacks a full keyboard physical or virtual and its email is primitive but thats not its main purpose this device is the best combination of a camera and a phone ive ever tested and includes a long list of other media features the camera boasts five megapixel resolution highly unusual for a phone and it takes marvelous photos when i transferred my shots to my computer they were large sharp and vivid just as if theyd come from a standard camera the camera has carl zeiss optics autofocus multiple flash settings and various scene settings it also has a burst mode capable of taking six shots in rapid sequence but getting such a good camera in a phone will set you back a whopping &# and you cant buy it through any phone carrier only from nokias web site nseries com or from various electronics stores you have to buy a phone plan separately like the curve the n has good voice quality but runs on the slow edge network though a future version could support faster networks unlike the blackberry the current n also can use wi fi networks battery life is only fair hours of talk time while nokia touts the phones web browser i found it to be unimpressive but the phone includes gps mapping with optional navigation it also accepts memory cards for storage physically the n is small but chunky on one side it looks like a plum colored camera if you slide its screen in one direction the keypad is revealed sliding it the opposite way reveals standard controls for playing music and video clips i was able to move pictures and songs from my computer but the songs failed to display album covers when played for &# you could buy the curve and a very nice digital camera but the n is for photo enthusiasts who want an all in one device the curve is a more mainstream smart phone that aims for a balance of features at a low price email me at mossberg wsj com find all my columns and videos online free of charge at the new all things digital website http walt allthingsd com
