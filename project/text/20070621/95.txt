politics &amp economics bloomberg a real long shot history and polls give new york mayor little reason for hope washington an independent presidential campaign by new york mayor michael bloomberg would be fueled by the widespread public disaffection with the current political environment and what could be the biggest financial war chest for any third party candidate in american history but the former chief executive of a business media empire would face the same obstacles that have snuffed out all prior such renegade ventures from the attempt by former president theodore roosevelt to ross perots campaigns in and the last time an opinionated billionaire sought to upend the two party system indeed there are signs the democratic and republican parties are stronger than years ago making an outsider bid particularly tough in and to the extent that americans are aware of mr bloomberg an unlikely president as he himself has observed being a divorced jewish new yorker they dont seem enamored with him according to a recent pew research poll of registered voters said they had heard of mr bloomberg that was well below fellow new yorkers hillary rodham clinton and rudy giuliani the democratic and republican front runners respectively but above other top tier candidates such as republicans mitt romney and fred thompson of those recognizing mr bloombergs name only said there was a "good chance" they would vote for him said there was "no chance " "the likelihood of any independent being elected is remote " says democratic pollster peter hart who conducts polls for the wall street journal with republican neil newhouse but "the likelihood of an independent changing the total dynamics of the election is great and the impact of a michael bloomberg on the election would be to throw all the cards up in the air and redeal them " what exactly that impact would be is the subject of an increasingly intense debate mr hart says the independent bid could help mrs clinton by splitting the opposition to a politician whose poll ratings show an unusually large number of americans who say they wouldnt vote for her others say mr bloomberg would undermine mrs clinton or any democrat since he has generally taken liberal stances on issues such as gay rights and abortion and his most recent ambitious proposals have included tougher gun control and a congestion tax aimed at curbing traffic jams and global warming pollster frank luntz estimates that mr bloomberg with hundreds of millions of his own money to spend ultimately could draw upward of of the popular vote and electoral votes making it difficult for any nominee to secure the needed to claim the white house if no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes the house elects the president from the three candidates with the most electoral votes it remains unclear whether mr bloomberg a longtime democrat who ran for new york mayor in as a republican and tuesday switched to independent will actually run for president next year at a news conference in new york yesterday he gave mixed signals saying on the one hand that he has "the greatest job in the world" and intends to stay put until his term ends in while on the other hand observing that in next years presidential race "i do think the more people that run for office the better " one critical factor governing a potential bloomberg entry may be the outcome of the battle for the republican nomination if mr giuliani triumphs mr bloomberg would face the challenge of competing for votes with another new york mayor with similar views on key issues mr bloomberg hinted as much yesterday when he played down reports of his potential candidacy by expressing doubt that the race would have room for three new yorkers the uncertainty around a possible bloomberg campaign has spilled into questions about the future of the financial data and news company he founded in mr bloomberg was elected to his first term as new york city mayor in november and soon after he stepped down from the company he founded he has repeatedly said that he wont go back to bloomberg lp though he still owns of the company according to a person familiar with the matter a bloomberg spokeswoman yesterday said the company isnt being sold history and circumstance suggest a bloomberg presidency would be a distant goal among third party candidacies in the past years only george wallace in won even a single state in the last century only the "bull moose" candidacy of mr roosevelt has managed to draw more popular votes than one of the major party candidates the starting point for a bloomberg presidential run would be an appeal to the large and growing bloc of voters who profess disgust with washington and no allegiance to either major party in the latest wall street journal nbc news poll taken earlier this month said they considered themselves independents up from just before the election also in the recent poll the popular mood had soured to the point where just said the country was heading in the "right direction " the lowest since the height of mr perots candidacy in mid still mr bloomberg would face big obstacles even compared with mr perots bid then the first president bush had alienated core conservatives with tax increases and lost much of the rest of the country as a result of discontent with his handling of the economy at the same time the emerging democratic favorite bill clinton appeared badly wounded by allegations of an extramarital relationship and controversy about how he avoided military service during the vietnam war the latest wall street journal nbc news poll shows that with the expected entry of former tennessee sen thompson into the race seven in republicans and democrats alike express satisfaction with their partys slate of presidential hopefuls for an independent candidate to have a chance of winning "the set of circumstances has to be where one party collapses " says longtime republican strategist ed rollins who advised mr perot in early that year mr perot grabbed a brief lead in the polls but he faded and the he eventually received was about half mr bushs popular vote total stephanie kang in
