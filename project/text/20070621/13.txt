boss talk changing the course of jetblue new ceo dave barger reviews discount carriers strategy seeks calmer approach to growth for nine years at jetblue airways corp dave barger played the quiet no executive to david neeleman the discount carriers passionate high profile founder and chief executive now the reserved mr barger is manning the controls when the airline most needs a steady hand jetblue lifted off in to rave reviews and four years of strong profit before plunging into losses as it struggled with its own rapid growth and rising costs then in february it infuriated customers with its botched handling of an ice storm although jetblue recently seems to have recovered by winning top honors in two airline polls and yesterday raising its second quarter earnings guidance last month jetblues board unexpectedly asked mr neeleman to step aside and become nonexecutive board chairman mr barger years old was named to succeed him the detroit native an ardent fisherman and detroit tigers baseball fan comes from an airline family his father was a united airlines pilot his mother and stepmother were flight attendants and his brother was a navy top gun aviator who now runs jetblues training campus in orlando fla in an interview at jetblues headquarters in forest hills n y mr barger talked about how hes revisiting the airlines strategy his views on prospects for airline consolidation and how to deal with a customer crisis excerpts wsj you come from an aviation family what draws people into this industry mr barger its the freedom it gives us the liberty theres something really cool about connecting cultures and connecting people and lets face it airplanes are fascinating machines but if you dont like logistics and you dont like external factors and you want to control your destiny do not get into this business because there are too many forces that are in play wsj will the long predicted consolidation of the airline industry ever happen mr barger i truly believe it will take a look at the auto industry and the steel industry and these other maturing industries and one cant help but be led to a conclusion that there will be consolidation how many alliance carriers do you need to go from a to b how many domestic brands do you need but how do you merge cultures that seems to be the lone question that never has been answered adequately you can merge operating certificates and facilities and fleets and the infrastructure but even if a merger makes sense there isnt enough creativity to say listen how are we going to make the cultural side of the equation work wsj analysts have been buzzing about delta air lines coveting your company has anybody approached jetblue about an acquisition mr barger no what weve accomplished over the last seven years is organic growth something very important to me i wouldnt welcome any overture in an acquisition the product would get lost the focus on costs would get lost most importantly this relationship we have with our crew members strong would be lost i just dont think thats a good solution for us wsj and youre not looking to buy another airline mr barger were not but its not lost on us that our route network from jfk could plug in nicely with other marketing partners thats why we have a new relationship with cape air a turboprop commuter carrier that serves new england its small as were stepping into the shallow end of these relationships wsj will the airline industry ever be broadly consistently profitable or will it continue to hobble along mr barger the airline industry can be long term profitable if the market economics are allowed to play out this deregulated industry is highly regulated and i dont mean from an faa perspective but from the standpoint of the involvement of washington as a young airline how do we compete with all these competitors who have adjusted their cost structure as a result of going through the bankruptcy car wash wow that was a lesson that was rather rude that of the domestic seats at one point were being operated by airlines under bankruptcy protection were taking a different approach the commitments weve made to our original equipment manufacturers our communities our crew members we cant back off on those commitments wsj what did you learn from your valentines day meltdown that you could tell managers in other industries confronting similar disasters mr barger hope isnt a plan you better assume that plan b is not going to materialize either so whats plan c and d keep it to a one day event dont make it a two day event or in our case a six day event limit the damage make sure that the problem is identified and there are fences put around it service recovery is key as well wsj so mr neelemans profuse apologizing was part of the solution mr barger yes but apologize and then get on with it what i heard from so many customers was thank you for the apology stop apologizing go fix it boy this was new to us this airline is all about hugging our crew members and hugging our customers but i think its important to get the message out and move on wsj you went straight from college to new york air and then continental airlines youre known as the operator how is jetblue going to be different under your leadership mr barger david neeleman is second to none from the standpoint of vision in the airline business at the same time there are only so many ideas we can digest at any given time do we need a new airplane every three weeks i dont think so whats the report card on the airplanes being deployed today has every airplane earned its way into the route network or the fleet plan were going to continue to grow but lets just calm it down as the eighth largest airline in the country you cant turn on a dime any more you want to be able to move with alacrity when opportunities present themselves but behind the scenes be very deliberate wsj mr neeleman said things fell apart in february because jetblue hadnt kept up with its growth and lost control when did you first start to worry that the company wasnt managing the transition between upstart and major airline mr barger there wasnt an event or a meeting but there were smoke signals whether it was the cost creep or the decision to take on airplanes a year we ended up with a unionization effort within our airport group what triggered that what werent we doing right a consultant said you keep blowing the same candles out you end up trying to fix the same problem the same way or the same problem crops up and you try another fix but theres not a comprehensive fix as a leadership team you better be listening to the signals because otherwise heres the next airplane and the next new city and were going to blow the same candles out again wsj the airline business has reinvigorated network carriers discounters continue to grow and new airlines like skybus and virgin america are coming along how is jetblue coping with intensifying domestic competition mr barger our cost structure while we can always hone it is in very good position make sure we continue to keep the product fresh our ability to really compete on a cost and a product standpoint really positions us well for the future you cant rest on your laurels when consumer reports comes out and says jetblue is the top airline we have a responsibility to make sure if somethings not performing lets redeploy the airplanes wsj wall street says it loves the airline hates the stock what do you do about that mr barger our mission is to really with rigor review what were doing today lets manage the company airplanes cities lets evaluate however are we deploying our newest asset the embraer i think every airline would love to have a seat airplane they could deploy across north america many of them cant from a revenue perspective there is plenty of running room for our brand and not just in the domestic u s lets look at canada mexico the caribbean i really believe the share price will take care of itself wsj jetblue is talking about raising additional revenue but the concepts refundable full fare tickets and premium seating arent necessarily in line with being a discount airline whats the right balance mr barger once we start to deploy our airplanes into markets that are more nondiscretionary traditional business markets its important for us to really respect that he or she who purchased that full price ticket should be offered the best seat instead of a middle seat its important to listen to our customers who say if you offer refundable tickets well fly your airline this is really under the banner of dont be afraid to experiment theyre not all going to be successful but if you dont experiment you can become stagnant
