real estate investors head overseas as the u s property market cools off americans start to look at foreign properties and funds buying a condo in bulgaria investing in real estate once meant owning rental property downtown or buying shares in a u s based real estate investment trust today it increasingly means putting money in a reit trading in singapore or buying a pied a terre in a refurbished medieval village in northern italy these days real estate investing is a international proposition nearly a score of global real estate mutual funds have launched in the u s in the past two years more than doubling in number they now manage some &# billion collectively with more than &# billion in new money flowing in this year alone according to investment researchers morningstar inc earlier this month the american stock exchange listed its second international real estate exchange traded fund in the last six months the wisdomtree international real estate fund and last summer private bank northern trust corp launched the first international real estate index fund northern global real estate index which now has more than &# billion in assets not content with owning real estate through the stock market some americans are venturing abroad to buy properties especially in lower cost markets such as brazil morocco and portugal they then turn them over to property management firms to generate income thats what beth damberger and her husband orlando londres are doing instead of investing in stocks and bonds the vallejo calif couple who own a pet care business in the past year have put their investment dollars into a villa in southern france a beachfront apartment in brazil and a studio in a bulgarian ski resort they hope to one day move to france with their two young children but for now are renting the villa to vacationers to cover the mortgage payments the apartments in brazil and bulgaria each of which cost about &# "are purely investments " says ms damberger the trend comes as u s investors seek ways to sidestep the weakening u s housing market and as they grow wary of a domestic reit market that has been exceedingly strong in recent years at the same time real estate is emerging as a more viable asset class around the world and among u s institutional investors as recently as five years ago reits publicly traded real estate portfolios were a rarity outside the u s and a few other developed markets now roughly countries have reit like investment vehicles that trade in the local stock market or are considering adding them the chief benefit to investors from going abroad diversification real estate is the ultimate "local" investment since what happens in new york or london for instance has little effect on the real estate market in say perth australia moreover foreign real estate is only mildly correlated with the movement of u s stock prices meaning a hit to the american stock market wont necessarily ripple through foreign real estate investments the risks include a crumbling economy in a particular real estate market or a swoon in stock prices for local reits then theres the dollar whose current weakness against many other currencies makes foreign real estate more expensive for americans worse if the dollar rises after you buy property overseas the value of your investment will erode since a stronger greenback means foreign assets from stocks to bonds to houses are worth less in dollar terms ibbotson associates a chicago investment research firm recently studied international real estate and concluded that foreign real estate should equal about to of an investors portfolio charles schwab &amp co which recently launched the schwab global real estate mutual fund says investors should have about to in overseas property noting that adding foreign real estate to a portfolio increases returns and reduces overall risk buying shares in a mutual fund or an exchange traded fund which resemble index funds that trade like stocks is easy to do in your brokerage account but buying property directly presents numerous logistical challenges for one thing many hot property markets such as china are exceedingly difficult for foreign investors to access ms damberger and mr londres shes hes used a firm they found on the web london based bulgarian properties ltd to locate a studio in a new resort being built in bulgarias pirin mountains they hired a local attorney to ensure all the title work was accurate and to help open a local bank account when the resort opens next spring the couple plans to begin generating rental income through a property management firm that will lease the studio to vacationers the cash will be directly deposited into their bulgarian bank account and any bills will be directly debited any local taxes due will be handled by the property firm their ultimate goal to sell the studio when bulgaria which joined the european union in january begins using the euro in that ms damberger says "should drive the property prices higher" as western europeans look east toward cheaper markets for second homes and investment opportunities foreign property management
