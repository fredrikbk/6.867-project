how sin ruined his song the prodigal comes home by michael english with lynn vincent thomas nelson pages &# as one might expect the lyrics of southern gospel music concern themselves with sin and the saving grace of the lord in the early s michael english was one of southern gospels stars a charismatic stage performer with a honey voice and a knack for song writing then the sin part of the song entered real life in "the prodigal comes home " mr english with writer lynn vincent offers a personal narrative of infidelity divorce homelessness drunkenness drug addiction and yes god although he seems to view christianity as both a source of strength and in a certain milieu a breeding ground for hypocrisy a christian singer since the age of nine as opposed to a singer who happens to be a christian mr english began performing in the s as part of the singing samaritans a group that included mr english his father and his older brother they started out at their own church north east pentecostal freewill baptist in wallace n c and then began appearing at the services of local pentecostal churches in the area eventually traveling throughout both carolinas and virginia the churches on their circuit ascribed to the philosophy that all worshiping sinners were of course free to accept christ and his message but to accept him truly you had better follow the rules "clean up your act " as mr english puts it anyone walking into north east pentecostal baptist wearing a pair of shorts would have been taken aside by the head deacon and told to find himself some proper trousers more severe transgressions were viewed with a similar starchiness the singing samaritans wore matching outfits "tan leisure suits with huge cuffed bell bottoms black velvet lapels and black bow ties" and knew how to "sell" a song in a ringing tenor mr english would hit a high note and an emcee would push the congregation in their sunday best to applaud eventually mr english joined other groups such as the gospel couriers and singing americans with whom he recorded his signature song "i bowed on my knees and cried holy " in he went solo and for good reason by then mr english had learned how to create a spiritual experience for his audience and exploit their emotions he might whimper through a verse or pray aloud between verses at times he would stop singing to tell a story "many times bringing little old ladies to tears " as mr english notes candidly "crying congregations buy records " mr english sold a lot of them but his personal life was not what it should have been when mr english was only he had married a pretty young christian music groupie named lisa they were both ready for a divorce a few years later but mr englishs managers wouldnt allow it worried that the scandal of divorce itself would ruin his career instead he was sent to california for a three week therapy session it didnt work in the early s just as his reputation was soaring with the release of "in christ alone " his biggest hit mr english fell into an adulterous relationship with another christian singer marabeth jordan when the affair became public his publisher stopped all promotion of his records and pulled his songs off the air that was only the beginning of mr englishs troubles when his relationship with ms jordan didnt work out he began taking loritab a prescription painkiller to alleviate his depression and his panic attacks over the next several years as he tried to rejuvenate his career by singing straight pop music and eventually southern gospel again he plunged deeper into drug and alcohol addiction by he was "a grungy unwashed hermit" who sold his performance clothes and other collectors items on ebay to finance his drug habit he began taking cocaine and heroin but one evening in late something happened mr english was listening to the televisions drone and floating on a narcotic high when he found himself looking down on the swollen dirty pathetic man he had become a voice told him that he "could keep heading down the road of addiction and be dead at forty " or he could turn his life over to god as mr english describes it the experience wasnt like sauls on the road to damascus an audible admonition rather he felt a voice speaking within him whatever it was mr english considers the moment a miraculous one rolling off the couch he knelt down and prayerfully promised to tell the world of gods goodness and mercy if only he might be helped to get off drugs now in his early s mr english has reclaimed his life with divine help he happily says as well as the help of methadone and counseling he has married a second time and has returned to christian music when he performs he recounts parts of his painful embarrassing story "the prodigal comes home" is its full version mr english says early on that he is not trying to excuse his actions or sell records it is easy to believe him given the vivid unsparing tone of his testimony not to mention his unflattering portrayal of life in the christian music limelight rather he seems to be trying to help others navigate the thorny territory that comes with earnest religious belief and the inevitable flaws of human character as this deeply felt memoir makes clear the ways of god are often not the ways of man ms scharper teaches english at towson university
