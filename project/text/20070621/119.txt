though inflation appears tame fed to focus on clouds in forecast despite benign reports officials may emphasize risk factors in outlook washington with inflation soon likely to drop into the federal reserves so called comfort zone of to fed officials are seeking to shift their emphasis away from todays benign inflation readings to the more uncertain path of future inflation to that end the central banks policy makers when they meet next wednesday and thursday are likely to continue to highlight the risks that low unemployment could yet push inflation higher at next weeks meeting fed officials are expected to debate whether to continue describing inflation as "elevated" in their post meeting policy statement an issue complicated by their lack of consensus on whether inflation ought to be much lower than it already is there is little chance the fed will alter its target for short term interest rates which has stood at since last summer officials appear on hold for at least the next several months inflation alarms sounded at the fed when the annual pace of core inflation which excludes food and energy prices jumped to in february from in december as measured by the feds preferred inflation gauge the price index for personal consumption expenditures the jump prompted officials to describe inflation as "elevated" following their march and may meetings but core inflation has since dropped back to and data to be released june the day after the fed meeting ends are expected to show it falling to in may the fed doesnt think this decline is a quirk dropping the word "elevated " which did disappear temporarily from the feds statement in january may stir up some opposition within the fed several officials taking their cues from a proposal by ben bernanke in when he was being confirmed as a fed governor have said their inflation comfort zone is from to federal reserve bank of chicago president michael moskow last week reiterated that he prefers inflation at about the midpoint of his to comfort zone by that criteria the current inflation rate is still too high but only a handful of officials still publicly back that range other officials including mr bernanke no longer cite it several others never agreed with it theres no simple way to clarify this for the public the fed itself is engaged in a lengthy internal discussion of communications strategy the european central bank in contrast has a public goal of keeping inflation "below but close to over the medium term " despite the talk of an inflation comfort zone mr bernanke has long preferred that the fed and public focus on forecasts of inflation and economic growth by that criterion whether the latest inflation rate changes by percentage point matters less than where it will be in a year and how confident the fed is in that forecast on that score the fed is still worried about inflation going higher though less so than a few months ago mr moskow said last week that inflation had dropped "a little bit more quickly" than expected and yesterday richard fisher president of the dallas fed said "there are some encouraging signs" on inflation "but we are not there yet " in their february forecast fed officials said they expected core inflation to end the year between and and drop into the to range by the end of core inflation rose in early mostly as companies passed higher energy costs through to consumers in the form of higher prices for goods and services and as rising home prices prompted more people to rent apartments driving up "owners equivalent rent " a proxy for the cost of homeownership the increase in housing costs has since slowed as the rising supply of vacant homes restrains rents the recent rebound in energy prices isnt expected to add much new pressure to core prices because they havent exceeded last years peaks but the fed does still see risks of higher inflation from the lack of spare capacity in the economy which means higher demand is more likely to translate into higher prices and wages despite a year of slow growth the unemployment rate at remains near a six year low global growth is robust boosting demand for u s exports in this environment the fed is still likely to express some concern that its forecast for inflation to moderate dropping below by the end of might go off track despite indications the nations economy has bounced back from a first quarter slowdown the fed for now is sticking to a forecast of modest growth this year principally because the housing market is taking longer to hit bottom than the central bank previously expected indeed the recent rise in mortgage rates modestly boosts the risks to the housing market the fed is unlikely to overhaul the structure of its end of meeting public statement until it finishes an internal debate over communications officials remain divided over the merits of an inflation target and may delay any decision on it until next year but there is less resistance to the notion of more frequent and detailed forecasts officials are likely to spend a lot of next weeks two day meeting discussing both issues a few weeks later mr bernanke will deliver updated forecasts of growth and inflation to congress providing him with an opportunity to shift the focus from todays inflation rate to next years
