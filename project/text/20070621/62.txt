just charge it to your cellphone koreas danal will pitch new way to pay to young people in u s a korean company little known in the u s is gearing up to offer a new cellphone linked payment system here joining a crowded field of companies trying to push americans to pay for more goods and services through their phones but the new service from danal co has a twist it is targeted at young people some of whom dont have credit cards and want a quick easy way to pay for low cost "digital goods" such as downloadable music video or virtual swords and guns used in computer games online in south korea danals popular service lets people charge such items as well as tangible goods like books or cosmetics directly to their mobile phone bills using an authentication code they punch into their personal computer they receive the code as a text message on their phone when they are ready to buy something online there is no need to install special software on the phones in heavily wired korea of all digital content valued at more than &# billion last year is charged directly to cellphone bills instead of traditional credit cards the company says menlo park calif investment firm morgenthaler ventures is expected to announce today that it is ponying up &# million to back danals new u s subsidiary based in san jose calif the parent which is investing &# million in the subsidiary is a publicly traded company in korea with about &# million a year in revenue ken gullicksen a morgenthaler partner calls danal a "breakout leader" in mobile payments and says the same trends that fueled the korea market including the increasing popularity of digital fare and new types of mobile services are now hitting the u s the investment highlights how far afield early stage tech oriented u s financial firms are going these days to try to snare profits as the market for venture backed companies in the u s continues to languish despite a pickup in some venture backed stock offerings this year last year u s venture capitalists sank &# million into korean firms up from &# million in but down from investment levels earlier this decade according to the national venture capital association an arlington va trade group still the morgenthaler investment is unusual because venture investors in the u s dont typically back subsidiaries of foreign outfits morgenthalers mr gullicksen says his firm holds a minority stake in the subsidiary danal inc and thinks the u s company could go public on its own eventually the deal also highlights the growing importance of smaller korean companies he says as opposed to electronics behemoths like samsung electronics co and lg electronics inc "theres nothing rocket science about it " says paul kim chief executive of danals u s subsidiary of how danals service works but not all advanced phone services pioneered in asia have been hits in the u s indeed many u s investors have gotten burned lately investing in cellphone companies trying to deliver newfangled internet services via the small screen services that are popular in countries like korea and japan where many people use souped up mobile phones in place of traditional computers in the u s "were very pc centric " says charles golvin a principal analyst at forrester research heavily promoted ampd mobile inc a service that delivers videos games and other services to young people on cellphones filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month after sucking up &# million in funding from big media and technology firms as well as venture capital outfits hearst corp and walt disney co also pulled the plug on a similar service mobile espn last year in addition danals u s operation will have to enter partnerships with powerful u s cellphone carriers and big online merchants to get up and running and possibly do battle with big payment companies like ebay inc s paypal paypal launched a service called paypal mobile last year overall global "mobile commerce" revenue is expected to soar to more than &# billion next year from &# billion in according to research firm celent llc smaller companies could also be competitors start up obopay inc based in redwood city calif which this week announced a partnership with verizon wireless has primarily focused on helping people move money to each other via their mobile phones like paying a babysitter obopay also offers a debit card that can be used for e commerce says ramy mora the companys vice president of marketing obopay could also eventually allow people to bill items to phone bills a spokesman says now consumers can download obopays software to their phones or move money using text messaging or a mobile browser another closely held san jose company paymentone corp also has a service allowing people to bill online items to their mobile bills one hurdle may be lining up enough online merchants to participate says aaron mcpherson a research director at financial insights a framingham mass research firm that is part of idc u s merchants will have to give up a small percentage of every online sale to let their customers use danals service that fee will be split between danal and the cellphone carriers the fee for credit cards is about but the fee for danal brokered transactions will likely be higher though less than so "cost wise it doesnt really work for the merchant " says mr mcpherson danals mr kim points out that around merchants are already working with danal in korea mr kim says his companys service is easier to use than those of other start ups because it doesnt have to be tied to a particular bank account or downloaded to a phone he adds that many people use danal for "impulse purchases" of less than &# and enjoy completing such transactions quickly instead of having to punch in long credit card numbers and expiration dates the service is also secure he says because it doesnt require people to give credit card information to little known web sites instead "all of your information is held by the phone carrier " he says mr kim who previously worked for samsung electronics venture capital arm says he is hiring staff for the u s business now and hopes to launch it next year
