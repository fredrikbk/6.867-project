dow jones board takes over talks on firms future deal with news corp becomes more likely fish or cut bait mood dow jones &amp co s board frustrated with the pace of the bancroft familys negotiations with news corp said it would take over talks on the future of the company the move coming after more than two weeks of little progress between the parties increases the likelihood of a deal to enable rupert murdochs media giant to buy dow jones the owner of the wall street journal the bancrofts whose far flung members have controlled dow jones for generations but arent directly involved in operating the business have been ambivalent and divided about a sale from the start when the &# billion news corp bid became public in may family members holding a majority of votes opposed the deal and didnt respond but within the family there was disagreement with some members especially younger ones arguing to consider mr murdochs offer some worried that an independent dow jones couldnt thrive on its own three weeks ago the family suddenly put out the word that dow jones might need to seek a partner and that it would consider options a signal the company was for sale soon after family members were in a face to face meeting with mr murdoch and a swift resolution seemed likely since then though family members seemed to renew their wariness and have worked through several drafts of a proposal to safeguard the editorial independence of dow jones as the family and its advisers haggled over the proposal some directors became increasingly concerned that the slow pace was endangering buyout prospects yesterday the bancrofts four board representatives finished revising the editorial proposal but decided to ask the board to review it before forwarding the document to news corp the family had previously insisted that it alone negotiate with mr murdoch about editorial independence if the sides reached an agreement the family would have then empowered the board to begin buyout talks some independent directors were opposed to this strategy because they felt negotiating editorial independence separately gave the board less leverage on price now both those components have been ceded to the board despite backing off of direct talks however the bancrofts still hold enough voting power to veto any deal the bancrofts editorial proposal calls for the establishment of a special committee to enforce a set of editorial principles news corp would be expected to adhere to according to a family spokesman it also includes protections for top editors and provisions to enforce the agreement these elements were included in earlier drafts as well and it wasnt immediately clear how the version submitted to the dow jones board had been revised while the bancrofts still control of the companys voting power surrendering control of the talks on editorial independence essentially put dow joness fate in its directors hands that may make a deal more likely because a number of independent directors are known to favor accepting mr murdochs &# a share offer whats more when the possibility of a third party bid emerged this past week it served in some ways to highlight the advantages of the murdoch offer general electric co and pearson plc have been discussing the creation of a new closely held company that would include ges cnbc cable channel and pearsons financial times to buy dow jones with a small stake reserved for bancroft family members or perhaps a third party some board members and company executives pointed out ges reputation for cost cutting which they cited as a reason to favor a murdoch offer a ge pearson tie up also might have resulted in duplication among the media companies assets some worried the financial timess priorities would trump the journals if pearson held a large measure of control moreover it is possible that the debt required to set up the new company and pay off dow jones shareholders would necessitate cost cuts a worrisome prospect for the family while the bancrofts are concerned by mr murdochs reputation for editorial meddling in his other media properties he has promised to invest in dow joness news operations even as the momentum appeared to be swinging in mr murdochs favor a number of hurdles to a news corp dow jones deal remain the familys representatives on the member board continued to express reservations about selling to mr murdoch and at least one has questioned whether the company needs to be sold at all in addition at least one prominent shareholder james h ottaway has said he would favor a deal with ge pearson over news corp ge and pearson were still haggling over terms and have yet to make an offer but yesterday another bidder myspace co founder brad greenspan sent a letter to the dow jones board seeking to pay &# a share for a noncontrolling stake in dow jones even if these factors dont scuttle mr murdochs plans they could slow the process in a statement released after the close of markets the company said the board would "take the lead in addressing all aspects of the proposal and all other strategic alternatives including remaining independent " the statement added that the family would continue to insist upon certain provisions designed to ensure "journalistic and editorial independence and integrity " dow jones publishes the wall street journal and its international and online editions barrons the far eastern economic review marketwatch dow jones indexes and the ottaway group of community newspapers dow jones owns factiva and co owns smartmoney magazine with hearst corp it also provides news content to cnbc television operations world wide and to radio stations in the u s in new york stock exchange trading dow jones shares closed at &# up more than before falling cents to &# in after hours trading a five member committee set up by the board to sort out issues related to the news corp offer met tuesday to get an update on the familys progress michael p elefante the bancrofts lead trustee updated the group on the familys efforts to create a proposal on editorial independence and said the family was close to sending something to mr murdoch according to a person familiar with the discussions but independent directors had become frustrated by the delay in sending a proposal to mr murdoch this person said after m peter mcpherson dow joness nonexecutive chairman delivered a committee progress report yesterday to the full board several directors raised questions about what would happen if mr murdoch withdrew his offer according to a person familiar with the matter these directors were concerned about their possible liability to shareholders in the event the deal fell through this person said "what happens if he takes his ball and goes home what does that mean to director liability this is our reputation and credibility " this person said the committee is made up of mr mcpherson dow jones chief executive richard f zannino harvey golub chairman of campbell soup co lewis campbell ceo of textron inc and mr elefante one person familiar with non family directors thinking suggested that some bancrofts may have been relieved by the handoff of talks the move takes the pressure off the bancrofts but also puts family members in a less powerful position and makes them more reliant on their advisers leslie hill a family member on the board had been working assiduously on editorial safeguards but had grown increasingly concerned about doing a deal with mr murdoch according to a person familiar with her thinking the move was welcomed by some directors as a way to speed negotiations with mr murdoch "i think you will see things move more expeditiously " said the person familiar with the boards deliberation "these guys pride themselves on being decision makers " this person said referring to the independent directors the overall mood on the board this person said was "fish or cut bait " a person close to news corp said the company didnt have anything to do with the decision and hadnt pressured either dow jones or the family to accelerate the process but some board members had become frustrated by the repeated assurances from family lawyers that a proposal on editorial safeguards was forthcoming last week the bancrofts lead lawyer called news corp on several occasions to announce that the proposal would be sent only to backtrack later the delays in the talks stemmed from confusion in the bancroft family concern about maintaining the editorial integrity of the wall street journal and concern about the role and motivations of the familys advisers some family members believed their may statement stating they were willing to explore a sale of dow jones would spur competing offers instead it set off a chain reaction that sent the family and dow jones on a fast track toward a deal with news corp in a whirlwind of events the family met with mr murdoch and martin lipton the bancrofts deal making lawyer to begin drafting a proposal for an editorial board that would address concerns that mr murdochs interference would tarnish the journals journalistic integrity but some family members balked at the rapid pace of developments they had expected more time to deliberate and had hoped other suitors would appear in recent weeks family members began applying the brakes first they decided they didnt feel the proposal assuring editorial independence was tough enough then after family members were unable to agree on the proposal mr lipton eventually called news corp on friday to tell them the family needed more time to work on it behind the slowdown had been a shift in the role of three family members on the dow jones board once relatively passive the three board members ms hill christopher bancroft and elizabeth steele had gone from playing a minor role in the companys deliberations about its future to asserting their power as controlling shareholders ms hill in particular took a leadership role switching from initially being open to a merger with news corp to cooling on the idea in the days after the may statement which asserted the familys commitment to the paper along with acknowledging "the evolving competitive environment in which it operates" family members speculated about what might happen next "if this is opened up more there would be interested parties coming in something will happen " one said the familys intent was to flush out alternative bids but the statement prompted the dow jones board to issue its own statement saying it would "consider strategic alternatives available to the company " that effectively was a message to wall street that the company was on the block and without any other suitors lined up would be sold quickly to news corp that interpretation came as news to some family members and representatives including christopher bancroft a year old bancroft trustee he said he hadnt been aware that such a statement could push dow jones to a quick sale with mr murdoch mr bancroft has publicly objected to selling dow jones to mr murdoch citing his worries about the journals editorial independence mr mcpherson the board chairman called mr bancroft after the statements were released and assured him the family was still in control of the process four days later however messrs lipton and elefante agreed to a meeting between the family and mr murdoch the acceleration seemed to propel the family and company closer to a sale following that meeting some family directors began hitting the brakes led by ms hill a retired airline pilot she joined the dow jones board in with a goal of gaining credibility for her family in the boardroom people close to her say ms hill has been at odds with mr lipton over what some family members view as his push to get a deal done according to a person familiar with her thinking she had been trying to regain control of the momentum of the discussions this person said meanwhile some family members privately have voiced concern about potential conflicts faced by mr lipton and their other advisers mr liptons law firm for instance in worked for news corp s independent directors as part of a &# billion plan to move the media conglomerates home base from australia to the u s and in the same year his firm was tapped as the "external legal counsel in the u s " by a special committee of news corp s nonexecutive directors to consider an acquisition some bancrofts have questioned whether the previous ties with mr murdoch would lead advisers to push for a deal with him mr lipton declined to comment in recent weeks some dow jones directors have become increasingly concerned that the family was slowing down the process one director called ms hill to urge the family to send a revised proposal to mr murdoch in order to keep the negotiations moving ms hill resisted meanwhile she has expressed a strong preference for a ge pearson tie up according to the person familiar with her thinking mr greenspan who sent the letter to the dow jones board yesterday is the former chairman and chief executive of intermix media inc the parent company of myspace when it was created after he left the company but still held a significant stake in it myspace was sold to news corp mr greenspan sued claiming the &# million deal defrauded shareholders by undervaluing the asset but in october a los angeles court rejected the legal challenge susan warren contributed to this article
