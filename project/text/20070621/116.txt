the evening wrap street justice online edition the supreme court handed down another ruling that seemed to be a major win for securities firms looking to shield themselves from investor lawsuits but the victory may not be as decisive as it appeared at first blush a cursory glance at the outcome would suggest that the high court had dealt a heavy blow to securities plaintiffs the justices in an ruling backed a tougher pleading standard for class action securities suits justice ruth bader ginsburg wrote for the court that plaintiffs lawyers must show that a company or corporate executives named in a suit had a "cogent" and "compelling" intent to commit fraud a law designed to save the securities industry the time and expense of defending itself from frivolous lawsuits says plaintiffs must produce facts that provide a "strong inference" that the defendant had acted with the intent of bilking the plaintiffs but congress never defined "strong inference" with any pinpoint precision and appeals courts have applied varying interpretations today was the first time that the supreme court declared itself on the matter the ruling overturned a th u s circuit court of appeals holding that wrongly in the justices view set a lower standard "the appeals court drew inferences favoring plaintiffs but declined to consider opposing inferences " justice ginsburg wrote "that one sided approach we hold was erroneous " business quickly embraced the ruling "this decision reinforces legislation that was originally designed to curb nuisance filings and other vexatious litigation " the securities industry and financial markets association said wall street may be forgiven if its suddenly feeling like it has some new best friends at the nations top court as a flurry of recent decisions have gone its way this week the justices handed wall street a landmark exception to antitrust rules when it tossed out an investor lawsuit claiming that brokerages had colluded to drive up the price of sought after initial public offerings during the most fevered days of the late s tech stock boom that case like todays wasnt close breaking earlier in the term the high court found no antitrust violations in a predatory bidding case and tightened standards for filing antitrust suits and a ruling last year limited class action shareholder suits on a state level skadden arps lawyer jay b kasner who argued that case on behalf of merrill lynch said todays ruling "recognizes that its important to give teeth to what congress has passed " all of which isnt to suggest that the court is completely sticking it to the little guy the court didnt go as far in todays ruling as some corporate interests had hoped justice ginsburg acknowledged as much writing that the justices had concluded that plaintiffs must show that ill intent had been "at least as likely " and not the tougher "more likely than not" required for a guilty finding at trial justices antonin scalia and samuel alito pushed for the tougher standard in their concurring opinions barbara hart an attorney at labaton sucharow &amp rudoff told dow jones newswires that plaintiffs lawyers are already meeting that test "these are the types of cases we are bringing already " she said and in any case some werent convinced that todays ruling really resolved the underlying matter william mcguinness of fried frank told wsj coms law blog that "its not clear that the new cogent and at least as compelling as any other inference standard will add any greater clarity " after early fall stocks compose themselves
