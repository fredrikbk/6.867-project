face of toyota steps up at a delicate time with likely election to board u s boss jim press will need skills of diplomat salesman at a ground breaking ceremony this year a woman who had sold toyota motor corp a chunk of land for an assembly plant near tupelo miss implored jim press to keep it free of industrial pollution the japanese auto giants north american chief hunched over listening intently and then fished a business card from his wallet "if theres something you see that doesnt seem right you tell me " he said handing her the card then with the conversation winding down mr press discovered that his new acquaintance was in the market for a car he immediately jotted down her name saying "we will be in touch with you " its that combination of diplomacy and salesmanship that has mr press on the brink of becoming the first person from outside of japan to be elected to toyotas board and if he is elected tomorrow as expected to a newly expanded member board the year old who grew up in prairie village kan will need plenty of both mr presss ascension comes at a delicate time for toyota in the january march quarter the company surpassed general motors corp in world wide vehicle sales for the first time toyota is widely expected to maintain that lead through the rest of the year already toyotas most visible executive in the u s the car makers biggest and most profitable market mr press is expected to be the main conduit between the companys toyota city headquarters about four hours west of tokyo by car and its growing global operations toyota officials are increasingly concerned that protectionist sentiment might surface in the u s just as the company becomes even more dependent on north america with persistently high gasoline prices and a growing awareness of environmental issues american consumers are embracing the companys prius hybrid and other energy efficient models now almost of toyotas sales volume and of its operating profit a measure of profitability from ongoing business activities come from north america according to analysts meanwhile japans aging society means its home market isnt growing "as we become bigger we are a bigger target " mr press said in an interview earlier this year fairly quickly mr press will have to address complaints raised by american car companies and the united auto workers that japanese auto makers are taking advantage of a weak yen to goose sales and profits in the u s politicians from manufacturing states have protested that the weak yen allows japanese auto makers to add features without increasing prices substantially the big three auto makers all of which have undergone restructurings that have cost thousands of jobs and run up huge financial losses cant match that mr press who has said his job is to be "the face of toyota" and explain the companys policies and practices to ensure it is treated fairly said the currency market is out of toyotas control he pointed out that the company "worked hard to make a profit" when the yen reached its historic high in the mid s which made japanese exports more expensive he also said that detroit is looking for a foreign villain the company has tried to combat that image by opening factories across the u s creating jobs from fremont calif to georgetown ky and aiming to produce in north america two thirds of the cars it sells on the continent but toyota has become concerned that it may have overbuilt which could complicate mr presss job of maintaining smooth relations with u s policy makers the tall trim mr press started his career at ford motor co in after graduating from a state college in pittsburg kan two years later he followed a boss to toyota and began working his way through the ranks in the u s establishing a reputation as a consummate salesman one big contribution mr press has made over the years is the strong bond he helped toyota create with its u s dealers while he was a senior executive at the companys sales unit in torrance calif his pep rally speeches in dealer meetings are legendary in one meeting with dealers in las vegas in he pressed dealerships owners and managers to upgrade and expand their showrooms "last year i urged you to use your cellphone to contact your real estate agents and begin planning your stores future growth " mr press said "many of you did that and youre to be commended for those who didnt what are you waiting for " he then tossed fake cellphones into the audience adding "here take my cellphone call your real estate broker get them motivated to help you expand " many dealers did just that an avid swimmer mr press can be seen working out at a m at the pool on the companys torrance campus in between laps he often stands in the water and reads business documents he stacks by the poolside "i used to swim in a lane farthest from him so that he wouldnt spot me " said takeshi isogaya a sales executive who worked with mr press "once he saw you jim would bombard you with questions work questions " last year he was named head of toyota motor north america inc which oversees all of the companys operations on the continent mr press has been packing his day with meetings designed to help him establish relationships or present toyotas message in a single day late last year for example he discussed corporate philanthropy with toyota honorary chairman shoichiro toyoda participated in a panel discussion on environmental sustainability and met with howard baker the former u s ambassador to japan among other meetings like most diplomats mr press is known for holding his temper and being able to deliver difficult news in a gentle manner late last year in a new york conference room mr press quietly listened to a pitch from japanese advertising agency dentsu inc for a campaign that used toyotas growing american work force as a way to deflect potential criticism over the companys strength in the u s then he politely sent the dentsu team back to the drawing board "i really appreciate your efforts " he said but "isnt diversity something you dont tout publicly but something you just carry out quietly inside the company "
