home &amp family cranky consumer they baby sit while you pump iron we try child care at health clubs various ideas of fun special to the wsj aiming to cater to moms with post pregnancy pounds to lose many health clubs around the country have seen the need to offer on site baby sitting this war on the waistline has meant that about of the international health racquet &amp sportsclub associations members offer to look after your kids while you hit the treadmill to find out if such a service is useful or just a ploy to get people to join we tested the child care services at the new york city branches of four national chains town sports international crunch equinox and the sports club la while all were convenient each places idea of fun for kids varied as did cleanliness safety is the main issue of course and we found all the gyms we tested to be safe now that we know about this service itll be harder not to renew our membership it took a couple of tries before we got confirmation that the ny sports club location we wanted to check out offered child care a quick visit elicited a "no child care" response but during a phone call the next day we heard the opposite still the ease in enrolling our toddler and the inexpensive &# per half hour fee made up for this frustration upon arriving we were directed to the second floor playroom located next to the womens locker room and far away from any exercise equipment after signing our daughter in we were reassured to see that five other children were entrusted with the baby sitter an older woman who has been baby sitting at this location for years plus the room was filled with toys and "the jungle book" was on the tv less than half an hour later when we came to pick her up our toddler didnt want to leave we just wished the toys were cleaner and the older children less rambunctious a spokeswoman for the gym chain says that the toys and furniture are wiped down every night and that toys are replaced annually crunchs play space one of the exercise studios until the new playroom is finished was larger and the toys were pretty cool but could have used a good scrubbing crunch says it has ordered new toys for all manhattan locations there was even a plastic slide for our toddler to play on as a result she had no trouble saying goodbye to us when we left for a run on a treadmill the child care service free for members but &# for two hours for nonmembers was easy to use after making a reservation two days before we signed our daughter in and obtained a green wristband from a baby sitter on duty we then comfortably left for our workout once we saw what a fun time she was having while a baby sitter stood nearby unfortunately when we came back our toddler was happily playing with one of the rooms many balls but both baby sitters werent paying attention to our child as they chatted with another co worker nearly across the room which was about the size of a studio apartment the adult to child ratio on the day we visited was two attendants for three kids nonetheless it took coaxing to get our daughter to go home equinoxs drop in baby sitting was more expensive &# for two hours for members and guests of members but it conveniently runs seven days a week as well as in the mornings and late early evening hours five of the days in addition we found the staff to be more hands on than most a good thing because our toddler was just not into the rooms many toys that day upon arrival at the club we had to fight for the attention of the check in clerk in order to purchase a baby sitting voucher but once we passed that obstacle we found the service quite user friendly we signed our daughter in and were quickly reassured by the two baby sitters warm greetings another plus some cardio equipment was close enough to the playroom that our child was able to check on us by looking out the windows when needed and yet despite the clubs poshness the playroom like the others needed washing an equinox spokeswoman says the chain integrates new toys but keeps some old toys because some kids have an attachment to them reebok sports club ny was the swankiest club we visited and the tv free child care space reflected that located on the first floor and away from gym traffic the square foot room was a childs fantasy world chock full of toys from a plastic lifesize tree she could crawl into to several craft tables for painting and drawing and the staff trained by the health club numbered nearly that day and was easily identifiable in their light blue polo shirts like their competitors reeboks child care required that we sign in and remain on the premises but unlike all the others and probably because the gym spans five floors we could request a pager needless to say our toddler
