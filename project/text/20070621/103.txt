shes hanging up her toe shoes kyra nichols farewell performance new york city ballet tomorrow new york after years in new york city ballet ballerina kyra nichols will in the parlance of ballet devotees hang up her toe shoes two thirds of the way through her specially planned farewell tomorrow night once she performs on her inherently pristine pointes for one last time with nycb as the so called waltz girl in george balanchines elegiac "serenade " and as the eternally feminine muse in white in the choreographers romantic "robert schumanns davidsbundlertanze " ms nichols will don heeled satin slippers to take her program and her incomparable career to its bittersweet close dancing at the center of the sweeping richard strauss inspired whirlwind that balanchine fashioned to crown his "vienna waltzes " just short of her th birthday ms nichols will swan off nycbs stage after an unusually long career there george balanchine the legendary balletmaster who hired the california born year old in once singled her out by remarking on the exactness of execution defining her dancing noting that such finesse was "god given " to be sure the background to ms nicholss career as one of the most glorious of ballerinas to have graced nycbs illustrious almost year history has its everyday dimensions her training began back home when as a four year old she hung on as if it were a ballet classroom barre to the pool table that took up half of the basement studio of her mother the now noted ballet teacher sally streets ms streets began teaching after her own dancing career stopped and her children were born ms nichols now has two sons of her own as with all front rank ballet dancers ms nichols embodied her art from head to toe tip in a charming interview published in allegro an annual journal put out by ms nicholss alma mater the school of american ballet the ballerina matter of factly noted to her student interviewer that shed been blessed with a strong body strong and marvelously proportioned so far as ballet is concerned her grateful audiences might add take her prehensile but pretty feet shod in shiny pink satin pointe shoes from the english maker freed ms nicholss pointes are among the most remarkable in ballet history ballets prescribed ways for taking the dancer to her toe tips variously involve either a springing flex or a more direct stepping onto the balance point either way ms nichols gets to poise on pointe without any seemingly labored or even at times visible impetus now shes off pointe now shes on how she got there went by in the blink of an eye once there her remarkable aplomb is evident in the decidedly vertical alignment of her upper body on her lower with a lodestone force emanating from the small of her back ms nichols gives the impression of breathing ether a rarified air reached only by a wizard of her art and what of her face for all her beautifully refined control of ballets various positions and moves balanchine once reduced the mechanics of ballet to the acts of opening and closing ms nichols with a delicate overbite and large front teeth cannot readily close her mouth framed by her liquid almost lavender blue eyes creamy skin and delicately boned head her usually parted lips once seemed to me perhaps a flaw then in at a wildly popular vermeer exhibit i first saw what is known familiarly as "the girl with a pearl earring " i found in the artists enigmatic portrayal of his subjects burningly blue eyes and slightly open mouth a direct reflection of the beauty revealed by ms nichols as she smiled and breathed and danced no one today knows much about or just what to make of vermeers girl painted more than years ago but she remains extra fascinating because of such unknowns likewise the mysteries evoked by ms nichols whether shes dancing in a starchy tutu a filmy dance dress or a peau de soie ballgown during the months leading up to this farewell performance there have been formal public interviews with ms nichols as well as numerous published ones she tends to speak plainly about her career without entering into in depth analytical observations about her work say with balanchine or jerome robbins for instance she noted at a symposium held by nycb that she usually had three post performance questions for her husband how was my makeup did i look too fat was i too tall for my partner now that shes ready to leave the stage her plans include ventures into coaching younger dancers one on one given ms nicholss vast repertory and the deep understanding that her performances have consistently revealed we can only hope that she will reveal to those dancers the secrets she held so fast throughout her career she may be one of a kind but theres undoubted depth behind her singularity and once ms nichols is in a studio with eager young acolytes theres no telling what truths might emerge mr greskovic covers dance for the journal
