it cost me money to work so im staying home with the kids your june editorial " marginal tax rate" caught my eye as that reality is in effect already here for us two years ago i came to the conclusion that it was actually costing me money to go to work as a two physician couple with two children we required daily child care in order for both us to work given our hectic schedules that child care can only be purchased with pre tax dollars given our dual income every dollar i earned was taxed at an effective top marginal rate of federal medicare social security and state but it only got worse as we were swept into the alternative minimum tax bracket as well living in such a high tax state as maine where property taxes and income taxes are some of the highest in the country exposed us to the amt tax as our federal tax deductions consist mostly of property tax excise tax and state income tax payments the "bush tax cut" is a myth at least for us as the amt tax is costing us more money than the small decrease in the top marginal rate returned to us the more i worked the more state taxes i paid and the higher the amt burden became as an emergency physician i found that after the state and federal governments took their share along with the amt tax i wasnt making enough money to pay our child care expenses with pre tax dollars add to that the constant threat of being sued as an emergency physician it only made economic sense for me to quit my job and take over child care responsibilities full time now i no longer work as an emergency physician or employ a child care provider and pay her employment taxes and our after tax take home pay has increased who says this isnt a great country john mcgoldrick m d brunswick maine reading yet another editorial about "tax fairness" moves me to suggest a new policy for the editorial page whenever you write something like "the wealthiest of americans already pay more than one of every three income tax dollars " why not insert a phrase saying what that groups share of income is how hard would it be to say "the wealthiest of americans who earn of the countrys taxable income pay more than one of every three income tax dollars" then at least the reader would have some idea of how tax burdens are distributed relative to income which ought to be the starting point for any discussion of income tax fairness personally im not offended by the fact that the top of all earners not the same thing as the "wealthiest " as a group pay an effective rate thats two to three times the average rate others may be but assuming you dont truly favor allocating the tax burden on a per head basis which would be beyond the pale even for the journals editorial page i think you should frame the question properly how progressive should the income tax be and give your readers the most basic facts relevant to that question h lake wise brooklyn n y see related letter "letters to the editor marginal tax rate" wsj june
