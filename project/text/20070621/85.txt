paying for vip treatment in a traffic jam more cities give drivers access to express lanes for a fee a privilege for the lexus set ann johnson used to have no idea how long it would take to get to work in downtown minneapolis on clogged interstate "i felt like a prisoner of the highways " she says that changed when state officials started in letting drivers pay tolls to use lanes previously limited to carpools buses and motorcycles the catch tolls range from cents to &# varying with the amount of congestion in order to keep drivers zipping along at close to miles an hour as a result the daily commuting grind for ms johnson a civil engineering instructor lasts just about minutes each way compared with as long as an hour each way before while she used to drive free on the regular lanes tolls now cost her &# a month but she can work later and still get home in time to take care of her two kids "the cost is minimal compared with the benefits " she says high occupancy toll or hot lanes which allow single drivers to pay to use the car pool lane have been around for about a decade starting on nightmarish roads in southern california and houston now the idea is picking up speed across the u s with plans under way in more than a dozen cities and states if all of the express lanes are built millions of american commuters could face less driving misery every day but some critics derisively refer to the express lanes as "lexus lanes" that allow drivers with deeper pockets to buy special treatment on highways built using fuel taxes collected from everyone "it would do more good for more people if those lanes were available to every motorist at all times " complains dawn duffy a spokeswoman at aaa minneapolis the trend is a sign that increasingly choked highways and tight

competing for &# billion in federal aid to fight congestion have proposed charging tolls that rise and fall based on traffic volume winners will be announced by mid august "the congestion problem is bad and getting worse and we arent in the position where we can dismiss possible solutions that involve changing the way we pay for travel " says tim lomax research engineer at the texas transportation institute of texas a&amp m university in college station charging extra to use special lanes "is democracy in transportation you get to vote every day with your pocketbook " supporters say hot lanes are a way to improve on carpool lanes which failed to catch on as much as hoped piggybacking a hot lane onto a traditional high occupancy vehicle lane can cost just a few million dollars with toll revenue typically covering the expense under federal rules single occupant vehicles may use hov lanes as long as tolls are charged meanwhile the economic principle of price elasticity that determines when tolls rise and fall for hot lanes sometimes doesnt work when every man for himself gridlock survival instincts kick in john doan former program director of the minneapolis express lanes says one commuter told him she moved into the lanes whenever tolls were at their highest the reason if so many drivers were using them then it must be a good idea hot lanes work like this
