an arab solution there is no dialogue with these murderous terrorists " thats how mahmoud abbas president of the palestinian authority characterized his attitude toward hamas after the radical islamist party seized control of the gaza strip for a holder of his office this was a first honest condemnation of behavior that everyone except palestinians themselves plus a few british news agencies know as "terrorism " that condemnation will no doubt assuage concerns within the bush administration that the tens of millions of dollars it is now releasing to mr abbass government will be money well spent it should think again mr abbas may have expelled hamas from government but the fatah party he also leads has terrorist links of its own not to mention a year reputation for corruption if "supporting fatah" is now the administrations policy we are in for rougher times ahead this isnt to say that mr abbas is himself corrupt or violent president bush was right when he recently described the palestinian as "a reasonable voice among the extremists " the problem is that mr abbass voice has been weak and his hand is now even weaker after coming to power in january on the promise of "one authority one law and one gun " mr abbas refused to disarm hamas seeking instead to engage them in negotiations a year later hamas stormed to victory in parliamentary elections nor has mr abbas done much to reform the palestinian authority or purge its most corrupt figures on the contrary most of yasser arafats old fixers unpopular figures such as mohammad dahlan and jibril rajoub continue to hold positions of power with mr abbas the bush administration nonetheless continued to funnel money to mr abbas and fatah after hamas took control of parliament yet fatahs troops were routed last week despite being better armed and far more numerous than hamas why the same recipe that failed in gaza should now work in the west bank is anyones guess as historian michael oren noted in these pages yesterday mr abbas already pays the salaries of soldiers policemen and militiamen of various types its not as if they lack money or guns the u s might be better served if instead of taking sides between unsavory factions in a palestinian civil war it began to call on its allies in the arab world to show some leadership israel has more or less managed to contain the threat from gaza for the time being but egypt gazas other neighbor also has much to fear from a terrorist movement with historic links to the muslim brotherhood and current links to iran at a minimum egyptian president hosni mubarak must finally get serious about stopping the flow of arms from the sinai to gaza something he has so far done half heartedly at best jordan which has done a creditable job of policing its border against the infiltration of terrorists might with israeli cooperation establish a security presence within the west bank possibly with a view to reasserting its sovereignty over most of its former domain the lebanese government of fuad siniora could also help by dropping economic restrictions it imposes on palestinian residents which have contributed to the radicalism and violence of its refugee camps above all the flow of saudi money to violent palestinian factions needs to be addressed and stopped all of this runs contrary to the state departments efforts to make yet another big push toward establishing a palestinian state if events of the last week demonstrate nothing else that idea has been laid to rest by the palestinians themselves whats needed here is another solution an arab solution see related letter "letters to the editor leading arab nations must recognize israel" wsj june
