and whitney balliett chronicler remembered jazz has never been defined with more instant clarity than in whitney ballietts four word overture "the sound of surprise " in his writings on the music for the new yorker for more than years he was able more than any other jazz chronicler ive read anywhere to put the music into words so that you came close to feeling its sounds rhythms and insistently individual voices whitney balliett died at in new york on feb through his hundreds of new yorker choruses including profiles of musicians he brought untold numbers of readers around the world inside jazz and the lives of the players from whom the music came unlike critics trained in music theory and techniques whitney wrote so that lay listeners including this one felt welcome on the jazz scene for example in "goodbyes and other messages a journal of jazz " oxford university press he deepened our pleasure in the sensuous intimacy of tenor saxophonist ben websters balladry "first a heavy robed statement of the melody in which he moved along behind the beat shifting a note here adding a note there a kind of combing and patting into place of the composers song then an intense one chorus improvisation which converted the melody into a grand new webster song in the late fifties and early sixties he would close certain phrase endings of ballads by allowing his vibrato to melt into pure undulating breath dramatically offering before the breath expired the ghost of his sound " i owe whitney with whom i went to concerts and other gigs over the years a great debt in he invited me to join him as a musical adviser for the live sunday afternoon "sound of jazz" part of the "seven lively arts" series on cbs tv the irrepressible independent producer robert herridge told us he wanted a "pure" jazz program without regard to whether the viewers had ever heard of some of the players so for the first and last time for most of the musicians are no longer with us there came together into american homes billie holiday count basie thelonious monk lester young ben webster pee wee russell roy eldridge henry "red" allen and other members of the pantheon of jazz thanks to whitney i can say as i often have that having been involved in that hour of glorious sounds of surprise was more important in my life than anything ive ever written whitney born in manhattan raised on long island attended phillips exeter academy where he began a lifelong fascination with the challenges of playing the drums years later in conversation he never lost the glow of wonder in talking of his idol "big sid" catlett after receiving a degree at cornell university his studies interrupted by service in the army whitney came to the new yorker following a diverse apprenticeship he was assigned a jazz column by the legendary master editor william shawn who as i found out in my years at the magazine was very hip to jazz especially the harlem stride pianists he could also tickle the ivories as they used to say whitney did not limit his listening to pure or nearly pure jazz in "goodbyes and other messages " he told of a song session with eileen farrell and mabel mercer the latter a strong influence on jazz singer frank sinatra "as they sang words and music became a continuum words were music music words " and that was often the way whitney balliett wrote about music in his many interviews whitney made the musicians feel that they were not talking to some stray reporter but to another member of the tribe and they could let themselves go on at great uninterrupted length for example i knew pee wee russell quite well his solos were so full of surprise that musicians working with him often wondered how he could ever extricate himself from them but during long conversations with russell i unlike whitney was never able to get this revelation from pee wee of how jazz improvisers not only him think "in lots of cases " pee wee told whitney in "reading jazz" panthron edited by robert gottlieb "your solo depends on who youre following the guy played a great chorus how am i going to follow that not jealousy mind you a kind of competition what the hell ill try something new all this goes through your mind in a split second you start and if it sounds good to you you keep it up and write a little tune of your own " in recent years whitney had not been in the new yorker whitney had not fallen out of fashion as some of the musicians he had written about had in their autumnal years although he still had an eager and growing audience he had fallen out of a gig in the magazine in which he had been so vital a figure for so long as terry teachout wrote in his blog "he was treated cruelly and shabbily by william shawns successors who had no understanding of the significance of his work " an exception was robert gottlieb who preceded tina brown after being utterly puzzled by his absence from that magazine i finally wrote to its editor david remnick asking how he could deprive so many of his readers not only in this country of whitneys further guidance there was no answer in a feb newsday obituary there was an enthusiastically accurate tribute to whitney "whitneys knowledge of the jazz world was encyclopedic his passion for the music unbounded and his prose as fluid and joyful as the subject he wrote about whitneys heart might have been with the golden era of jazz but he was also perfectly capable of writing with sympathy about the later innovators such as cecil taylor and ornette coleman " the source of that tribute was the very editor of the new yorker david remnick who stopped publishing him while whitney still had much more to say whitney had a wry sometimes sardonic sense of humor i can imagine his reaction to those false notes from his former editor that not even pee wee russell could have found a way of resolving interviewing whitney about "the sound of jazz" television program someone asked him how he was able to get so many jazz icons together in one production "they needed the gig " whitney said i gave exactly the same answer to the same question when "the sound of jazz" was shown years ago at new yorks museum of television and radio like the musicians in that cbs tv hour still being seen on videos around the world the music they created during their many gigs keeps being heard so too whitneys words that were part of the music will be read as long as jazz keeps quickening the lives of listeners mr hentoff writes about jazz for the journal reading whitney balliett american musicians ii seventy one portraits
