the budget battle and your wallet which bush proposals are likely to survive band aid on the amt with democrats now in control of congress many proposals president bush made yesterday affecting individuals wallets including killing the estate tax and overhauling the tax treatment of health insurance benefits appear to be heading for the cutting room floor but a few others such as giving the internal revenue service more money to pursue tax dodgers and protecting millions of people for another year from being ensnared in the alternative minimum tax could attract bipartisan support here is how the presidents proposed &# trillion budget may affect your pocketbook taxes the president is asking for nearly &# trillion in net tax cuts over the next decade mainly by extending provisions scheduled to expire in coming years for example the top rate on long term capital gains and most corporate dividends is set to expire at the end of so are todays federal income tax rates which range as high as without legislation those rates would head higher starting in dont expect congress to act soon on the presidents proposals to make those tax rates permanent lawmakers effectively have punted that issue into the elections of and beyond amid continuing concern about reining in the federal budget deficit the budget also includes a plan to prevent the rapid spread this year of the alternative minimum tax a parallel tax system designed originally to prevent a small number of wealthy people from dodging federal income taxes completely because the amt wasnt indexed for inflation its now hitting many middle income families too a treasury official said about four million taxpayers will get hit by the amt for and if congress does nothing that number will soar to about million people for some kind of amt fix is likely to win congressional approval among those already feeling the pinch of the amt are many people who live in high tax areas such as new york city new jersey and california and those with large families as expected the president reiterated his request to congress to kill the federal estate tax permanently under current law this tax will disappear in but only for that one year democrats are clear they wont go along with permanent repeal instead look for an eventual compromise that includes raising the basic exclusion from the tax and cutting the top rate thus reducing the number of people affected by it this year the basic estate tax exclusion is &# million and the top rate is some lawmakers have discussed increasing the exclusion to somewhere in the range of &# million to &# million part of the budget calls for new steps to attack the nations so called tax gap the difference between what the government collects each year and what it should be collecting irs researchers have estimated the gap is about &# billion one proposal the president wants congress to require many securities brokers mutual funds and others to report what investors pay for stocks and funds the information is relevant in figuring tax on capital gains or the profit investors make when they sell treasury says it would increase compliance on capital gains taxes the budget estimates the measure which would apply to securities acquired after would rake in about &# billion over years key details of the plan arent yet available said a treasury spokesman some democrats have already come out in favor of similar legislation this proposal is "very constructive " said a spokeswoman for the securities industry and financial markets association a trade group student financial aid president bush proposed cutting the subsidy that banks and other student lending companies receive from the federal government lenders say this would likely mean cuts in student benefits such as hour hot lines and discounts for on time payments democrats have proposed a similar move so the question will be how deep the cuts the president also proposed cutting entirely certain student aid programs including the perkins loan supplemental educational opportunity grant and leveraging educational assistance partnership grants for needy students mr bush tried and failed to eliminate some of these programs in the past and its doubtful hell succeed this year with a democratic congress the administration wants to apply the savings to other aid that affects more students including raising the annual loan limit on subsidized stafford loans by &# for third and fourth year students stafford loans which have a current limit of &# are the governments biggest student loan program the administration also proposed raising the annual limit students receive from the pell grant program which provides needy students with money that doesnt have to be repaid the limit would be increased to &# in the academic year from the current &# and ultimately to &# in pell grant recipients are likely to see some increase a democratic bill introduced last month would boost the limit by a greater amount but its uncertain what will happen with subsidized stafford loans while mr bush proposed raising loan limits democratic legislation that passed the house last month would cut interest rates health mr bush proposed requiring more higher income seniors to pay more for medicare currently about million seniors individuals with incomes above &# a year and couples with incomes above &# pay higher premiums in medicares part b which covers physician and outpatient services those income levels currently are indexed for inflation but the presidents proposal would eliminate that and expand the means testing to include the the new drug benefit part d officials expect the means testing of part d to affect more than million seniors in its not clear how this proposal will fare in the democratic controlled congress while many republicans and some democrats have supported the limited means testing in medicare that has already begun many democrats have opposed it and senior citizens groups arent likely to support expanding means testing unless the resulting savings are used to improve the program which isnt part of the bush proposal the budget also calls for major tax law changes designed to make health insurance more affordable but also threatens to raise taxes on many upper income americans but with so many competing health plans on the table there is little chance the presidents proposal will be enacted jane zhang and rob wells contributed to this article see related article "how plans to expand health coverage could affect insured" wsj feb
