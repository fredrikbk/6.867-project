health mailbox columnist tara parker pope answers readers questions q are the benefits of exercise the same if you do all your exercise at the same time or spread it out over the week for example is it the same to run three times a week four miles each time vs once a week for miles j c a in theory the answer to your question is yes if your three times a week runner clocks a nine minute mile hell burn about calories each day he runs for a total of calories during the week if he runs all miles at the same nine minute pace that minutes of exercise will also burn calories but in real life chances are the calorie expenditure is going to be slightly different in the two scenarios it all depends on what kind of condition the runner is in if he isnt used to running miles at a time his body will be less efficient and might actually burn more calories while a well conditioned athlete who is used to that level of exercise might burn slightly fewer the difference isnt particularly meaningful to overall health in terms of wear and tear on the body for most people it probably makes sense to run the shorter distances three times a week and given the fact that exercise boosts mood and reduces stress shorter regular runs is a better bet for most people however in terms of cardiovascular health research shows that it doesnt really matter if you get exercise in small spurts or all at once the surgeon generals recommendation is to get enough exercise to expend or more calories a week that is typically interpreted as minutes of moderately intense activity three or four days a week but a person weighing about pounds could also burn calories playing a minute tennis match on the weekend proof that one day a week of exercise makes a difference came from a swedish study of men over the age of the men who exercised only once a week were less likely to die during the year study period than those who did nothing information on calories and exercise can be found at www caloriecontrol org exercalc html email questions to tara parker pope at healthjournal wsj com
