enterprise small makers of childrens dvds unite to take on big rival distributor bundles products to appeal to large retail chains in his recent state of the union address president bush gave a nod to the remarkable success of a once small company called baby einstein co a maker of childrens educational dvds and videos the brainchild of small business owner julie aigner clark baby einstein was bought in by walt disney co which then built the series into a &# million powerhouse with disneys deep pockets and distribution reach most smaller rivals have been boxed out of big box retailers until now to go up against baby einstein competing baby dvd creators have banded together and are bundling their products under a single name "little steps " whats more theyve aligned with a big distributor topics entertainment which is repackaging their disparate content into boxed sets under the little steps brand and paying each producer a licensing fee started last summer the little steps dvd line retails for about half the cost of the market leader and is already at various retailers including costco best buy frys electronics borders bjs wholesale club and sams club "we just think theres room for two players in this market " says greg james chief executive officer of topics entertainment a renton wash based multimedia publishing company and distributor of special interest videos executives at baby einstein werent available to comment the decision of the small players to band together highlights a business model that is a calculated gamble and in some ways flies in the face of the entrepreneurial spirit of going it alone under the little steps deal each player traded some autonomy branding opportunity and potential revenue for the chance to get a foot in the door of chains where they had met roadblocks for producers looking to make a name for themselves the decision isnt without risks for instance while the individual producers are credited on the back or inside flap of boxes its the little steps name out front and while nothing in their topics contract precludes them from also trying to sell their dvds solo to retailers including those carrying little steps its unlikely a store with limited shelf space will stock the same content under different names but the benefits for these small players are that theyre now selling their wares on a broader basis and each are collecting some money typically to in wholesale costs or the amount it costs to produce a dvd whats more theres the hope that wider access to their content will eventually pay off for them as creators "obviously it gives them visibility and placement with a very wide footprint for their products " says david weinstein president of chicagoland entrepreneurial center a chicago based venture development firm that helps entrepreneurs with sales and financing "the downside is that you may lose some control and it might take some time to find the right distributor and structure for that arrangement " mr james of topics entertainment says he met several of the producers at the annual american international toy fair in new york about five years ago he says it was a classic case of small businesses trying to get into the major retailers with a limited product line and no networking relationship with the store buyers "you dont stand a snowballs chance in hell " he says if a product even one better than baby einstein doesnt get into big box retailers and ultimately into the hands of consumers but topics entertainment says it has the distribution experience and existing relationships with major stores to make that happen its strategy pretty up the packaging and cut prices single little steps dvds retail for &# and a complete box of three dvds sell for &# in contrast a single baby einstein baby mozart music festival dvd sells for &# one of the producers in the alliance barbara candiano marcus founder and creator of baby prodigy co of valencia calif says the topics arrangement has freed her from having to worry about distribution and focus more on content for her line of infant development videos and brand building outside of little steps when her first video came out in it was distributed among independent stores and even sold at wal mart stores inc for six months but she says she wanted her product to sell at more than one mass retailer keri mann of las vegas founded babyscapes inc in with a line of videos featuring high contrast images slowly moving and morphing to classical music despite making some inroads she says after disney bought baby einstein it became harder for babyscapes to garner entry into the major retail stores "my biggest problem was with distribution " she says "i just couldnt do it all " when scott tornek and his wife alexandra started so smart productions a west chester pa company that makes animated programs for babies toddlers and preschool kids in they had no idea how retail and distribution worked the line won numerous national awards and was even in toys "r" us inc stores but they had to deal with two sometimes three distributors to get their products into as many stores as possible when topics approached the couple they say they immediately liked the idea of bundled box sets "i thought that they understood how to market the product against stiff competition " mr tornek says "this is freeing us to make more products " but as these small producers dvds find their way into bigger chains thats putting pressure on their longstanding relationships with independent retailers whove been their bread and butter "we cant have the same products as mass markets do " says gary green owner of the toy box in asheville n c who is selling little steps single dvds in his store for &# "thats a constant problem with us we have to find a product that doesnt have a wide distribution in mass market stores in our area our sales will slow down to the point that we have to find something else "
