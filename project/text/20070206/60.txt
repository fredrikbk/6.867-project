last month when he and colleagues attended a presentation skills workshop run by second city the famous improvisational theater troupe here he figured wrong during one exercise in front of fellow participants mr bailey pretended he was a womens hair fashion expert but he clasped and unclasped his hands so often that he didnt sound authoritative excessive gestures "can be distracting " warned robyn scott a workshop facilitator "we have to be aware of the body so we can present well " mr bailey now shuns superfluous hand motions while leading workplace meetings and says he has noticed that "the audience is a lot more confident about what i am saying " ambitious managers must be deft presenters these days especially as high tech innovations expand presentation venues the skill "is really important for career success promotions and professional credibility " observes gail golden a consultant for rhr international an executive coaching firm in wood dale ill no wonder presentation skills

your boss pays plenty for presentation training however make sure it will meet your job needs you should also inquire whether you will glean tips about diction breathing relaxation building audience rapport and other important techniques i observed second citys recent session to gain insights into the pluses and minuses of a six hour program its communications division used to offer this &#

employees of more than businesses since "presentation skills training has become our most requested offering " he says taught by second city performers the jan workshop emphasized fun and feedback many participants said they came because they felt nervous spoke too fast or sounded boring during presentations "um i want to get rid of my ums " one man added "skills methods philosophy and ideas we use to create successful scenes on stage are the same skills required for successful communications in business " explained ms scott an actress and director improvisational comedy for example requires

particular color confusion reigned ms scott drew a comparison to the multiple demands placed on presenters "eye contact is huge" along with body language that shows youre focused connected to the audience and not rattled by mistakes she noted another exercise taught attendees to slow their delivery chatting in pairs each person had to begin replies with the partners last word "when were

blackberrys answered cellphones dozed or threw things lay down ground rules immediately for how you will conduct your presentation recommended lillie frances the other facilitator she and ms scott critiqued participants after each spoke extemporaneously on topics they knew nothing about like mr bailey most got gentle pointers to help them alter their nervous habits poor posture or soft voice a woman too tense to look into listeners eyes was urged to gaze at foreheads enter a room with presence rather than glance down at notes ms frances told one man speak louder than normal initially because "it gets everyone revved up " she continued several attendees besides mr bailey found the workshop valuable robyn waldman borek a chicago accounting manager at gensler an architectural concern believes she effectively led a finance class for graphic designers days later because she revamped her presentation to engage them better "i was hitting the high points about what they needed to know " she recalls on the other hand ms borek was disappointed that second city didnt videotape her mock presentations rival providers echo the criticism "for presentation training a five minute video clip
