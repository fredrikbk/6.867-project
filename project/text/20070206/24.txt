disney combines ad staff for selling kids media one stop shop for cable radio print aims to win broader customer range walt disney is merging the ad sales and promotions staffs for its media outlets targeting kids and family hoping to attract more ad dollars from a broader range of marketers walt disney will now have one ad sales force for cable networks disney channel and toon disney childrens programming on the abc broadcast network radio disney disney com and disney adventures magazine disney says the reorganization was partly a response to requests from existing advertisers and partly an effort to lure advertisers from outside the kids world such as auto makers the changes come in advance of the kids "upfront" tv market when tv outlets including disney viacoms nickelodeon and time warners cartoon network sell the bulk of their commercial time inventory for the coming programming season advertisers typically commit between &# million and &# million each year for tv programming aimed at toddlers through young teenagers but the market has been flat for the past few years and analysts expect this year to be no exception disney executives are due to make their annual kids upfront presentation to advertisers on thursday cartoon network presents feb and nickelodeon meets advertisers next month while the tv market is flat childrens marketers are putting more money into new media particularly videogames and the web those outlets "are not only taking dollars from the traditional kids marketplace but they are also taking viewers " says lee ravdin president of lake end consulting a syosset n y firm "we are obviously interested in all the media and that comes more and more into play" when it comes to ad deals he adds advertisers wanting to promote their products on different media had pressed disney to streamline its kids oriented sales efforts according to rich ross president of disney channel worldwide "they said you have to make it easier for us to buy media across platforms " he said "easy is not making four phone calls " in the u s the disney channel sells sponsorships rather than traditional second spots disney saw the potential for a combined sales team in january of last year when it struck a multimedia partnership with general mills the cereal maker got the exclusive sponsorship of "high school musical " the popular disney channel movie national print advertising in disney adventures magazine and ads on an official high school musical web site spots on radio disney drove people to the web site still media companies have had mixed results trying to get ad sales people to sell across different media time warner for instance ran into difficulties immediately after the aol merger when it promoted cross media ad selling under different management the company has revived the effort more recently at disney in the past salespeople had to be forced to collaborate according to tricia wilber who is being named to run the combined ad sales force under the new structure executives are supposed to listen more closely to what advertisers want and then devise a program that meets those needs she says formerly senior vice president of ad sales for all kids tv properties and abc family ms wilber will add oversight of radio disney disney adventures and online in charge of a strong sales force abc family is excluded from the new sales force while advertisers sometimes hope cross media sales can lead to discounts on certain outlets disney executives insist that isnt the plan "i dont foresee discounts " says mr ross "its not like we offer off to anybody who buys three platforms at once " both of disneys main rivals cartoon network and nickelodeon already are structured to sell across different media "advertisers are demanding it they are looking for one stop shopping " says david levy president of ad sales for turner entertainment which includes cartoon network a nickelodeon executive jim perry last fall was named to a new position overseeing " brand sales " to sell kids and family targeted media across a range of outlets another disney property espn reorganized its sales staff in january so that ad sales executives focused more on specific clients rather than a particular media venue ms wilber says espns foray helped inspire the reorganization of her team for disney like nickelodeon and cartoon network cross media selling is seen as a way to bring in a different kind of marketer ad executives see limited growth in advertising from the traditional base for childrens tv toy manufacturers who particularly use the kids channels ahead of the holidays food companies have also scaled back their advertising to youngsters in recent years under pressure from activist groups concerned about obesity in children but all three kids upfront players also see opportunity in advertisers who want to reach parents watching tv with their little ones and hope to lure such nontraditional kids advertisers as automotive insurance or wireless "we certainly want to diversify our client list " says mr ross of disney channel brooks barnes contributed to this article
