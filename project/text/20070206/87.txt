most powerful companies took a major step forward with a courts decision to send one of the countrys top business leaders to prison for three years following a conviction on embezzlement and fraud charges the conviction and sentencing of hyundai motor co chairman chung mong koo demonstrates that the nations courts after years of light punishments in cases of bribery and accounting fraud may be joining a recent movement of investors civic activists and some politicians in seeking better corporate governance from the executives who play a dominant role in koreas economy mr chungs sentence could still be overturned on appeal but in general said park sang il a corporate attorney in seoul the courts are "applying more and more strict principles in reviewing these cases there is increased sensitivity to corporate governance and management transparency is recognized as more and more important " still analysts and investors in south korea were cautious about whether the sentence will stick saying they would have to wait for the appeals process they pointed out that chey tae won chairman of sk corp south koreas largest energy producer was convicted in a &# billion accounting fraud in but his three year prison sentence was suspended by an appeals court last year "although mr chung was sentenced he hasnt been sent to jail and he will act normally " said thomas choi asset manager at pca investment trust management in seoul "we have seen this before we have seen cheys case at sk " mr chungs sentence brings uncertainty to the leadership of hyundai the worlds sixth largest auto maker by volume which is struggling to maintain its growth rate and cope with global competition from lower cost manufacturers from china hyundai hasnt said anything publicly about succession plans it said mr chung will appeal the ruling and in the meantime remain in control of the company since an economic crisis in south korea has been trying to push its large companies closer to international standards of governance financial disclosure and management accountability one reason banks cut back on commercial lending after the crisis forcing companies to rely more heavily on investors at home and abroad who demand efficiency and consistent improvement in operations but the change has been a struggle for koreas most successful companies including hyundai samsung electronics co and lg electronics inc which are still controlled by the children of their founders who tend to run them more as family enterprises than the public companies they are nudged in part by vocal shareholders samsung a few years ago shifted the makeup of its board so that a majority of its directors seven of are from outside the company though several do business with it lg just changed its quarterly financial reporting to consolidated instead of korea only results meanwhile last year a governance focused investment fund emerged in south korea and began buying shares in companies its managers

pardons for some convicted corporate executives analysts said mr chung may seek a pardon if his appeal fails the prison sentence for mr chung came as a surprise to many in korea who expected the court to find him guilty but suspend his sentence mr chung one of the most fabled and powerful executives in korea is the son of hyundai motors founder became its top executive in and has taken steps to pass control to his son mr chung controls hyundai motor along with some parts and distribution affiliates through complicated cross holding investments he reports to a six member board that includes himself two top executives and three outside directors with no international business or auto industry experience mr chung is rarely seen in public but hyundai has created an aura of omnipotence around him his picture appears numerous times on the companys web sites corporate brochures and annual reports while the names of other executives and directors are rarely mentioned when he went to jail for two months after his arrest last year the company halted plans for plant openings and delayed other strategic decisions within that worshipful environment the court found mr chung created a &# million fund with money skimmed from hyundai motor and affiliates that was intended to be used for political payoffs mr chung used several million dollars for himself the court found "these practices have to be stopped " seoul central court judge kim dong oh said as he read the sentence yesterday the verdict comes as hyundai after years of rapid growth in the u s and other markets around
