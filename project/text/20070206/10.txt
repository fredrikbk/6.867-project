bush budget sets stage for clashes with congress big divisions over iraq taxes are likely to limit room for compromise washington faced for the first time with a democratic majority in congress president bush put a little of everything in his budget high spending assumptions that the government will collect still higher revenues and the promise of a modest surplus in five years even if his tax cuts remain intact but no amount of optimism is expected to head off what is likely to be a continuing series of conflicts in coming months between the white house and lawmakers on priorities ranging from urban housing to farm subsidies and defense spending to investments in child health care and education democrats share the presidents goal of erasing the federal budget deficit by but would take a very different path the two biggest flash points between the white house and congress are taxes and the war in iraq conflict over these two issues alone could derail mr bushs promise of a modest surplus in five years the first since in his &# trillion budget mr bush wants to first protect his signature tax cuts and extend them beyond their scheduled expiration democrats want to scale back some of the reductions that apply to capital gains and the wealthy beyond that disagreement the two sides are split over the alternative minimum tax originally aimed only at the wealthiest americans but which is increasingly reaching into the middle class at this stage the president has committed himself to doing little beyond next year thats a major concern for democrats who have vowed to do what it takes to keep the amt from hitting tens of millions of additional families the second flash point iraq is stirring even more emotion now than the cold war debate did in the s when republicans joined democrats in trimming president reagans defense buildup to pay for domestic spending the size of mr bushs budget request for defense &# billion in new spending over the next months is "staggering " said house armed services committee chairman ike skelton d mo a strong ally of the military one reason for the big defense budget is that the president for the first time since the invasion of iraq is submitting a spending blueprint that spells out upfront defense costs but beyond sept mr bushs budget reverts to past practice and allocates only &# billion for iraq or less than half what the annual cost of the war has been so far the white house says thats because the wars cost cant be accurately predicted any further into the future still the projected cost for the next year of the war alone will spark competition between defense spending and democrats desires to fund their priorities particularly education and health for example while the defense department budget would grow by &# billion under the presidents plan for next year the education departments budget would be cut by &# billion from the joint funding resolution that passed the democratic controlled house only last week rob portman mr bushs budget director has sought to ease some of the conflicts the administration is no longer pressing for a fee on airlines to pay for security screeners in the case of medicare proposed cuts at the expense of oxygen services for the elderly set off a big fight in congress last year this time around mr portman and the administration have sought to find a formula to defuse some of the tension mr portman told reporters he was comfortable with what he described as an overall increase in domestic spending saying "its adequate to fund the nations priorities " but in a sign of the political challenges ahead mr portman overstated even this modest increase democrats have already begun revising spending for and in some cases the spending increases cited in mr bushs budget turn out to be reductions from those levels mr bushs refusal to reconsider his tax policy makes it harder to reach the compromises needed on entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid which are closely identified with democrats this tension is likely to have a ripple effect shaping the broader budget debate this year the most likely route to real progress toward a compromise would be passage of a major deficit reduction package but unless the administration is more willing to include taxes in the same package democrats would be reluctant to tackle an issue as tough as medicare instead of one battle congress faces a series of skirmishes as bills come to the floor and much will depend on new "pay go" rules that require lawmakers to offset any new spending with new revenues or savings an early test fight will come over the planned reauthorization of a popular program designed to help states extend insurance coverage to low income children the so called state childrens health insurance program established years ago for children who dont qualify for medicaid would get another &# billion over the next five years under the bush administration budget but advocates in congress believe &# billion to &# billion is needed and some democrats would like to see the figure go even higher to extend the programs coverage education is going to be similarly sensitive mr bushs "no child left behind" reforms are coming up for reauthorization in congress and democrats have long complained that more money must be provided to help local public schools meet the standards set under the law toward this end the administration proposes to provide more funding for low income public schools targeted to high schools and math and reading programs also would receive more money but a total of &# billion in other education programs would be terminated setting up conflicts with lawmakers that will make it harder to reach agreement agriculture spending will be another source of conflict as part of the farm bill debate this year the administration is seeking greater investments in renewable fuel but farm state lawmakers complain that the budget doesnt provide adequate resources senate agriculture committee chairman tom harkin d iowa said yesterday that while the administrations farm plan has "solid suggestions " the budget figures "would deny the necessary funding to reach critical objectives in energy conservation and rural economic development initiatives " the proposed budget also cuts &# million in from two conservation programs that have been a priority for the chairman even the budgets basic assumptions about spending and tax revenues will spark debate in many respects mr bushs budget has been overtaken by events including the houses passage last week of a resolution that includes increases in domestic spending for the last eight months of fiscal the association of american universities complained that the new budget for the national institutes of health proved to be a &# million cut from an nih funding resolution for this year in the case of veterans medical care funding does go up in the bush budget but the increase is about &# billion less than the administration boasted in the accompanying explanatory documents in the case of revenues the administration predicts annual government receipts will grow by to reach &# trillion in the crucial year of thats more than &# billion higher than what the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimates that same year democratic critics say the administration is using overly rosy estimates of how many more tax dollars a growing economy will generate for washington still democrats themselves are tempted to use the same kinds of numbers because they too are under pressure to show they can craft a balanced budget house budget committee chairman john spratt d s c admitted that to get an "apples and apples" comparison with the presidents numbers congress may take a second look at the white house estimates "humpty dumpty can get to balance by with these numbers the real problem is and later " said sen judd gregg r n h the former senate budget committee chairman see related letter "letters to the editor deceptive lexicon" wsj february
