sign up for the e mail here there were surely heartfelt commitments to governance yesterday amid the votes and policy proposals for iraq and federal spending but they seemed to be drowned out by a storm of political positioning that suggested any post election honeymoon of pragmatism is over the annual budget presentation to the legislators actually responsible for appropriation is almost always just the start of a nine month exercise in tough negotiations over government priorities though last year the process wasnt completed despite having a white house and congress run by the same party but the &# trillion fiscal budget sent to capitol hill by president bush with an economic emphasis on tax cuts and restraints on domestic spending to help boost funds for the war seemed to take little notice of the political realities facing a president with extremely low poll numbers and less than two years left in the oval office as the new york times reports "what hes saying is basically you can have it all you can spend the money especially on defense and the war and you can cut every tax and it all works " democratic senate budget committee chairman kent conrad tells the times "but in the real world it doesnt work out " mr bush would try to cut spending on health care education housing and other domestic democratic priorities as the washington post notes and the differences over iraq and taxes are especially glaring as the wall street journal adds mr bush wants to extend the tax cuts he was able to push through early in his presidency by agreeing to let them expire in while democrats want to cut back the reductions help the wealthy and apply to capital gains and while both sides want to do something about the alternative minimum tax aimed at the wealthiest americans but increasingly entrapping the middle class mr bush has committed to doing so only through next year while democrats say it must be fixed permanently or tens of millions of americans will suffer the sharp differences across a broad spectrum of high profile policy areas seemed to shatter what the los angeles times calls "the spirit of bipartisanship that both parties had cultivated" since the democrats won control of the house and senate in november new leaders and chairmen in both chambers complained that they saw no evidence of declining war costs and budget cuts that come at the expense of those who can least afford it mr bushs defense budget request of &# billion up from last year would raise non war defense spending to levels not seen since the reagan era as the post notes congressional democrats and republicans welcomed the fact that for the first time supplemental war funding for iraq and afghanistan &# billion for was included in the budget offering a clearer idea of the total but pentagon officials noted this doesnt include the latest plan to send more troops to iraq and the journal says the big boost in spending may not even be enough to cover increasing costs of fighting in both countries in other areas the budget would raise homeland security spending by &# billion to &# billion to help secure borders and detect nuclear materials and democrats were quick to criticize how the administration would cut billions in grants to first responders and local law enforcement the post reports democrats object to proposed cuts in funding for the state federal childrens health insurance program the post adds while an even bigger fight looms over what the journal says are &# billion in cuts to medicare including reductions in funds for hospitals hospices and nursing facilities the budget would slash subsidies for entities that make student loans american banker reports and change the way the air traffic control system is funding by shifting part of the tax burden from airlines to private aircraft according to usa today still however much the constitution gives congress the checkbook democrats may have a tough time challenging mr bush because of their own political realities "democrats know that the only way they can find the revenue to restore the administrations proposed spending cuts would be to cut back on military spending delay their stated intentions to balance the budget or rescind the bush tax cuts in future years " the n y times says "they are not especially eager to do any of these " a showdown that wasnt in the senate the long awaited era defining vote on iraq couldnt even make it to the senate floor in a procedural move senate republicans managed to block consideration of the resolution criticizing the presidents plan to send more troops to iraq suggesting the los angeles times says that the challenge to mr bush may move over to the house only two republicans norm coleman and susan collins sided with the democrats in the vote which required a three fifths majority other republicans who backed the anti bush measure stuck with their leadership which insisted pro bush resolutions on the subject should also get a vote republican leaders said the impasse would soon be broken but the white house was working hard to block action on the resolution criticizing higher troop levels the washington post reports and sen harry reid the democratic majority leader wouldnt guarantee the resolution would get another chance even as he promised more clashes over iraq the new york times reports he told republican counterparts "you can run but you cant hide " a new tack on insider trading probes u s securities regulators have opened a broad investigation aimed at determining how pervasive insider trading is on wall street and particularly whether investment bank employees are leaking information about big trades to hedge funds and other clients theyre trying to court industry executives tell the new york
