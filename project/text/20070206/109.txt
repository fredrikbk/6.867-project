compared with to of gdp in western europe "we see little penetration and pent up demand for all sorts of pension and life insurance products " mr de cock says the immense potential overrides any concerns about turkeys halting progress toward joining the european union investors say eu membership would help cement long term stability bring additional regulatory certainty and ensure that the

investment for years many turkish industrial families operated their own banks to get cheap finance for their group companies and because a lack of foreign competition made banking a lucrative industry a good example is turkeys zorlu group which was launched in as a textile producer before branching out into energy and electronics in it went into financial services by founding denizbank as but finance wasnt a core zorlu business no family members ever worked at the bank and there were few reasons not to sell it once prices for turkish banking assets rose and competition in the industry increased denizbank president and ceo hakan ates says last may the zorlu family put denizbank up for sale and mr ates says they received more than bids from western financial institutions belgiums dexia bought a stake in the bank for &# billion a price that was almost double the banks share price at the time "it was certainly a sellers market " mr ates says who says dexia will help him provide new products and services and expand the bank all told foreign investment into turkey jumped to &# billion in from only &# billion two years earlier money has gone into retail tourism telecoms and energy but the hottest sector has been banking foreign interest in turkeys economy will be tested this year while the sales of some state owned banks such as halkbank are scheduled to proceed the
