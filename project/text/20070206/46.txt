fiscal revelation politicians are typically late in picking up trends so it will be interesting to see how long it takes washington to acknowledge the big story in the fiscal budget that president bush unveiled yesterday to wit with a little spending restraint congress could balance the budget in no time you wouldnt know this from all the garment rending yesterday in response to mr bushs proposal to spend the not so meager sum of &# trillion our favorite agonist is kent conrad the senate budget committee chairman and he didnt disappoint "the presidents budget is filled with debt and deception disconnected from reality and continues to move america in the wrong direction " said the senator who was himself blocked from sneaking nearly &# billion in "emergency" farm spending into a military construction bill in the final days of the last congress the north dakotan needs to keep shouting disaster in a crowded political theater so he can justify his desire for a big tax increase the news mr conrad wont broadcast is that over the past three years the federal deficit has shrunk by the congressional budget office not the white house is estimating that the current years deficit for fiscal will fall to &# billion thats not bad given continuing katrina relief spending &# billion for homeland security and a couple hundred billion or so to fight the war on terror the white house is projecting that its new budget will eliminate the deficit by assuming mr bushs tax cuts are extended after we dont put much stock in future budget forecasts because they depend on so many variables but even cbo predicts the deficit should remain near or below of gdp for the rest of the bush presidency thats well below the year average of of gdp this also means that the federal debt burden will continue to fall alarmists point to the &# trillion rise in total federal debt from but that amount is dwarfed by the &# trillion in new household wealth created over the same period and for all the international scolding of an allegedly profligate america u s federal debt as a share of gdp is falling again at in and heading south the u s figure compares to in germany in france and in japan once again rising total "debt" is a scare word used to justify higher taxes the real game to watch isnt debt or deficits but spending here too mr bush has an improved track record in his second term from outlays ballooned by &# billion or and mr bush never did veto a spending bill by contrast on current pace his second term outlays will grow by hardly tightfisted but a third slower the other news you wont often hear concerns the soaring tax revenues in the wake of the supply side tax cuts tax collections have risen by &# billion among the largest revenue gushers in history receipts especially from high income individuals and corporations have been growing for some two years at nearly twice the rate of spending which explains the falling deficit economic growth is always the key to eliminating red ink which is why keeping this month expansion rolling needs to be the main domestic priority this requires making those lower tax rates permanent rather than letting them expire in and socking the economy with the biggest tax increase in history the more immediate budget brawl between mr bush and democrats will be how to divide that mere &# trillion between guns and butter mr bush wants &# billion more for iraq and afghanistan for and his overall pentagon request of &# billion in has been lambasted by speaker nancy pelosi as a "huge number" and democrats are moaning that their cherished social programs will suffer in fact mr bushs request would only bring defense outlays to of gdp or about of total federal spending that compares to of gdp even under jimmy carter and of gdp in at the peak of the reagan defense buildup budgets are about setting priorities and if democrats agree that defeating terrorism is vital they will put it ahead of funding the national endowment for the arts or how about capping subsidies to farmers with incomes above &# senator conrad could lead by example in accepting that white house proposal and in return zero out mr bushs &# million political sop for state and local police all in all the fiscal news is so good that the tax hike lobby has had to do a bait and switch and fret about the "long term " somehow this wasnt a priority when democrats and republicans alike were trying to kill social security reform in but all of a sudden penury is said to be right around the corner well congress could always reform those programs but dont hold your breath mr bush is proposing a very modest &# billion reduction in the growth of medicare and other entitlements over five years and democrats are already outraged the best news in yesterdays budget may be that mr bush seems to be rediscovering some fiscal nerve his proposals wont raise taxes while using the power of the market to combat problems in health care and putting a tight leash on domestic discretionary programs defense gets the bulk of spending increases as it should in a time of war maybe well finally get a debate over national spending priorities see related letter "letters
