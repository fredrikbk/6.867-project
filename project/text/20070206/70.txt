lives in jazz billy strayhorn out of ellingtons shadow well into "billy strayhorn lush life " robert levis documentary premiering tonight on the pbs series "independent lens" pbs dates and times vary check local listings comes this snippet of a late s television interview with duke ellington "that a train of yours has gone around the world " "thats billy strayhorn " ellington snaps back looking first startled then proud "billy strayhorn " "yeah but its identified with you " during his three decade association with ellington until his death in strayhorn wrote and arranged many memorable compositions including the ellington orchestras signature song "take the a train " yet his profile has long been obscured a pianist composer and arranger behind the scenes strayhorn was rarely on stage he composed for and often with ellington their relationship was collaborative in the truest sense of the word mostly out of view of course few figures in american musical history cast a shadow as long and deep as ellingtons strayhorn openly gay in an era of closeted homosexuals perhaps found a safe and liberating home in that shade mr levi was drawn to strayhorns story while creating his documentary "reminiscing in tempo " a revealing look at ellingtons career "this new film considers the same territory " he said at his downtown manhattan office "only from billys vantage point i kept collecting material telling myself someday im going to make this film it nagged at me " strayhorns distinctive achievements before during and outside his association with ellington and his singular story of pride pain and uncommon integrity require more than the common jazz history footnotes as ellingtons "arranger " "alter ego " or "right hand man " mr levis film scripts a full chapter adhering closely to the contours and touching details of david hajdus authoritative "lush life a biography of billy strayhorn" farrar straus giroux "just listen to strayhorn tunes like blood count or passion flower said mr hajdu who arrived for an interview carrying a handwritten strayhorn score to an early work "fantastic rhythm " its clearly a distinctive and important creative force i just wanted to understand the source of that power " william thomas strayhorn was born in dayton ohio in and raised near pittsburgh a piano prodigy he also displayed an early eye for sophisticated details "who was talking about waldorf salad in the s in a coal mining town " recalls his sister lillian onscreen while still in his teens he composed the achingly dark worldly wise "lush life " and "fantastic rhythm " a full length musical that featured a young billy eckstine in an impromptu backstage audition introduced a year old strayhorn to ellington who at was already the leader of a standard setting band and the author of beloved songs including "sophisticated lady" and long form works such as "creole rhapsody " still ellington craved greater productivity and a broader palette he sensed strayhorns value strayhorn quickly became an integral force within his organization as ellington entered what is widely considered his greatest creative period when a dispute over composing royalties in barred ellingtons works from radio broadcasts strayhorn and ellingtons son mercer were summoned during a week long cross country train ride strayhorn churned out a handful of classics among them "chelsea bridge " and "take the a train " which as mercer reveals strayhorn nearly tossed away as subpar mr levis film breaks no new ground yet it treads boldly upon sacred terrain for the scholars and fans who closely guard the ellington legacy in his book "something to live for the music of billy strayhorn" oxford musicologist walter van der leur who has archived and restored original strayhorn manuscripts and who appears in the film wrote "in the popular imagination heroes and role models are solitary figures so it does not come as a surprise that strayhorns contributions form an unwelcome factor in the canonization of the orchestras namesake " in a review of mr hajdus book for the new republic gerald early drew a line "ellington was a genius " he wrote "strayhorn extraordinarily talented was not a genius " mr levi presents minor flashpoints for controversy "billy was an intellectual " says pianist don shirley "duke was not" meaning strayhorns urbanity complemented ellingtons scholar of the streets air mr hajdu when considering strayhorns lack of recognition and often composing credits through much of his collaboration calls ellington "complicit" in the subordination "he didnt actively diminish strayhorn or squeeze him out " he says "but he allowed it and i think it was a big mistake by a great man capable of better " did strayhorns "perfect arrangement" hold him back or empower him through ellingtons mighty orchestra or both composer gunther schuller marvels one moment at strayhorns internalization of the ellington sound another he wonders what strayhorn might have composed had he outlived ellington "lush life" unearths fascinating images herb jeffries singing "flamingo" in a s era "soundie" home movies of strayhorn and his partner pianist aaron bridgers at their harlem home ellington reciting the lyrics to "love came" as strayhorns piano part plays on a reel to reel deft editing pays off we see and hear pianist hank jones perform "satin doll" at a recent recording session cut to the ellington orchestra circa then to nancy wilson singing the lyric without missing a beat fictional scenes in which actor dule hill portrays a young strayhorn ring false yet suggest the promise of a true biopic woven into this mix is new footage from the making of a companion blue note cd itself testimony to the vitality of strayhorns music saxophonist paul gonsalves decades ago plays the theme of "chelsea bridge" in levis film for the cd saxophonist joe lovano wrings equally urgent emotion in the here and now pianists hank jones and bill charlap together accentuate "tonk"s bounce and wit dianne reeves sings rarities such as "the flowers die of love " elvis costello traces the odd intervals of the haunting "blood count" with his own lyrics "with his languorous ballads " costello said in a phone interview "strayhorn created a new kind of art song " during mr levis film pianist billy taylor describes strayhorns innovative use of inner voicings in "chelsea bridge" historian gail buckley recalls how his inner feelings touched her mother lena horne as did no other mans "when i first met billy he was a beautiful brown boy in big horn rimmed glasses " ms horne told me during a interview "i liked him right away and i was right to because we grew to be soulmates " above all "lush life" explores the intimate connection between two composers early on dule hill as strayhorn says of first hearing ellington "he played a chord in the orchestration i couldnt figure out i had a dream that i asked him about it " near the end is a clip of ellington playing strayhorns "lotus blossom " "to the day he died " mr shirleys voice over says "duke never figured out how billy wrote that tune " somewhere in between ellingtons granddaughter mercedes explains "they had a relationship of completing each other " in his notes to " and his mother called him bill " the tender tribute recorded after strayhorns death from esophageal cancer in ellington wrote "he had no aspirations to enter into any kind of competition yet the legacy he leaves his oeuvre will never be less than the ultimate on the highest plateau of culture whether by comparison or not " this films celebration of strayhorn does not cannot diminish ellington it elevates both legacies mr blumenfeld is a katrina media fellow with the open society institute documenting
