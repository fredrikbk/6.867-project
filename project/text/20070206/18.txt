can the cbo spell ira is the share of income of the top in the united states high and rising those who say it is usually base their belief on statistics from one of two sources one a paper by thomas piketty and emmanuel saez was discussed by alan reynolds on this page on dec the other source is the congressional budget office cbo it too is wrong the cbos measure "comprehensive income " is vastly larger than our benchmark of personal income and nearly double the piketty and saez total of &# trillion for the cbo adds transfer payments but it also assigns corporate profits to households and includes the taxable portion of capital gains although that fixes a few statistical headaches it adds fatal complications the cbos allocation of most corporate profits to the top implies an average income of &# compared to an average income of &# in the most similar piketty and saez series which includes capital gains as the lower line in the nearby graph shows the cbo estimate of income among the top was just larger than the figure from piketty and saez in then larger in larger in and larger in see accompanying table wsj feb the gap widened because of the cbos flawed methodology the top line in the graph shows that the cbo assigned a high and rising share of capital ownership to the top thus lawrence mishel and jared bernstein of the economic policy institute write that this "shows that those in the top of the income scale received of all the capital income in up from in in and just in " actually it shows that if you make goofy assumptions you get goofy results those who measure wealth directly find no such growth in the share of the top at the irs statistics of income soi division barry johnson and brian raub examined estate tax returns to calculate wealth shares "in " they noted " of the u s adult population million people owned approximately of total u s individual wealth a decrease since but virtually identical to the shares of wealth held in and " federal reserve board economist arthur kennickell added the forbes list of wealthiest americans to the feds survey of consumer finances he concluded that the top s share of wealth declined slightly from in to in yet the cbo says that share rose from to in those same years the difference is huge and it has a huge effect for the cbo assigned of &# trillion in corporate profits to the top million households which added more than a half million dollars to each of their incomes that improbable figure has been rising rapidly pushing the top s share of "comprehensive" income much higher than otherwise how does the cbo get its results by assumption gary burtless of the brookings institution notes that the cbo unlike soi and fed economists does not actually look at who owns capital if your tax return shows no income from capital then according to the cbo you own no capital can the cbo spell ira a huge and growing portion of capital owners in the u s earns dividends interest and capital gains that never show up on tax returns because it is tax sheltered and the middle class owns a much higher fraction of its wealth in tax sheltered assets than does the top andrew bershadker of the treasury department and paul a smith of the fed compared the interest dividends and capital gains reported by taxpayers aged or more in and they found that "for all ages the share of taxable income arising from assets is strikingly as much as lower in the cross section than in the cross section " in short taxpayers are moving savings out of the grip of tax collectors but high income taxpayers are not allowed to contribute to an ira or tax free roth account and their contributions to other accounts are tightly limited as a result about of the top s assets are still potentially taxable and that causes the cbos method to show an increase in wealth of the top as noted direct studies of wealth show no such increase economist james poterba of mit estimated that among those with assets in a tax deferred account in the middle those in a tax bracket held nearly a third of their assets in tax deferred accounts by contrast the top of wealth holders held just of their assets in tax deferred accounts in according to federal reserve economist arthur kennickell jonathan chait of the new republic speculates that k accounts "mostly replaced defined benefit pensions" and that money from k s does appear on tax returns when the accounts are withdrawn nice try but no cigar capital income accruing inside roth ira roth k and college savings plans will never appear on tax returns nor will up to &# of capital gains on the sale of family homes since moreover few of those now retired had much opportunity to build such accounts during their prime earning years james poterba dartmouth economist steven venti and harvards david wise found that in fewer than of those aged were participating in a k plan compared with by even the who turned in cannot be compared with those in defined benefit plans since such plans would pay only of your salary after years a k invested in a mediocre mutual fund from to did much better than that those with a defined fixed pension must pay taxes at age but the rest of us delay the tax collector messrs bershadker and smith found that "roughly half the sample waits until required at age years six months to take the first withdrawal" from an ira the required distribution rises slowly to at age and so the untaxed account often keeps growing many will die before most funds are depleted leaving the balance to heirs withdrawals from tax deferred plans unlike roth and plans will eventually appear in tax return data to say such invisible income is "implicitly" included in recent tax data as messrs piketty and saez do is to admit it is explicitly excluded from such data like most other data the cbo estimates show a clear increase in income inequality between the stagflation of which depressed stocks bonds and business and the tax reform act of which encouraged reporting more income on individual tax forms however the cbo data show that the top s share of disposable income after taxes was unchanged between and that number picked up in with more dividends and capital gains being reported at the rate but defining a trend by one year is nearly as foolhardy as defining a nations income distribution by the cbo has incorrectly added a huge and rising share of corporate profits to the estimated incomes of the top without that cbo estimates of the top s share of income would have fallen substantially since if there is evidence of increased inequality since then the cbo has not presented it mr reynolds a senior fellow with the cato institute is the author of "income and wealth" greenwood press mr henderson a research fellow with the hoover institution is
