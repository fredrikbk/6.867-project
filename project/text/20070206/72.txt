market leninism mao zedong alone among major th century dictators enjoys a benign life after death taxi drivers in south china hang a mao portrait on the steering wheel to ward off accidents nightclub singers in beijing throb to lyrics from maos "quotations " urban youths relax in "cultural revolution style" cafes at rough hewn tables with mao slogans on the wall eating peasant dishes as they answer cell phones and chat about the stock market mao temples exist in some buddhist villages the altar adorned with a serene mao image as president hu jintao tries to transcend communism forward to "market leninism " mao now dead for years transcends communism backward to chinese folk history he floats into a nether zone as if hed never been a political figure at all where is mao the totalitarian tens of millions of chinese died in the forced collectivization of the great leap forward of and victims of maos utopianism and cruelty millions more died and tens of millions had their lives ruined during the cultural revolution of the s the cab drivers farmers pop singers and rural worshippers are really only echoing the chinese communist party which does not quite know how to handle maos legacy new history textbooks approved for initial use in shanghai have largely brushed mao out of chinas story can a society that lived by confucianism for two millennia and later by maos leftist political faith be content with amnesia about the mao era and the absence of a believed public philosophy to replace communism redeeming traits may help explain why mao has been treated more gently than stalin or hitler he wrote impressive essays and memorable poems he was part monkey and part tiger as he said of himself the "tiger" knew how get from point a to point b but the "monkey" felt doubt about the desirability of arriving at point b crucial however is the chinese states need for mao the ccp cannot simply denounce mao as nikita khrushchev indicted stalin in mao after all was not only chinas stalin but also its lenin and even its marx president hu is heir to the power seized by mao in maos gun is his legitimacy mao made history at the same time history made mao were the hundreds of millions of chinese who wept at the sight of him out of their minds in addition to looking at maos major failings as a human being we must look at the structures that turned maos whim into ccp tyranny at the reasons for the evaporation of his youthful idealism and exactitude at the social engineering ideas he sprayed over china "jesus was dismembered for speaking out " mao wrote to a friend at age in "he who speaks out does not necessarily transgress and even if he does transgress this is but a small matter to a wise man " yes young mao was an ardent individualist at teachers training college his credo became the self realization of the individual "wherever there is repression of the individual " he wrote in the margin of a chinese translation of friedrich paulsens "system of ethics " "wherever there are acts contrary to the nature of the individual there can be no greater crime " maos respect for individual freedom later collapsed there were four reasons one was the powerful current of nationalism in early th century china the cry to rescue the nation eclipsed individual self realization a second was the large role of war in china from the s to the s pervasive violence made political debate a luxury and favored repression a third was maos embrace of marxist ideas of class economic planning and communist party organization fourth was the hangover in maos mind and chinese society generally of an emperor mentality in the end mao facilitated by stalin built a party state that neatly combined leninism the paternalism of early chinese sage rulers and fascism chinese style he sought to craft a "new man " maos achievement was to unite china after foreign invasions and civil war and to make china after a force with which to be reckoned but his social engineering efforts were largely canceled by deng xiaoping after maos death in in subsequent years the totalitarian state became an authoritarian state today retention of ccp power moneymaking for the folks below national glory for all and a veil over the past in the name of "good feelings" are the chief priorities with maos "new" chinese man gone the "old" chinese man of family values entrepreneurial spirit and a belief in china as a religion reappears but the soft landing for mao is not the final word some say deng reversed maos revolution but it is an important distinction that deng dismantled maos thought yet retained maos state deng ism continued by president hu was a retreat from as much as possible of maoism without endangering leninist political power in late beijing jailed three intellectuals on trumped up charges behind which lie the sin of speaking indiscreet words ching cheong chief china correspondent of a singapore newspaper got five years for "spying " but really for getting a fee to speak at a seminar run by a think tank that beijing dislikes zhao yan a researcher for the new york times in beijing got three years for "fraud " but really for feeding the times information on some mild political tensions within the chinese government chen guangchen a blind self taught lawyer got months for "gathering a crowd to disrupt traffic " but really for annoying officials in shandong province by representing victims of sterilizations and forced abortions carried out contrary to beijings own regulations the intended intimidation in these three cases is an all too clear residue of the mao era when citizens never knew where they stood in relation to authority we return to the "solution" of having mao float into folklore as a modern day yellow emperor for an age of weapons in space and the wto a figure of dignity who can serve as a fashion model for green silk pajamas as i recently noticed in a shanghai department store such "maoism" is the twitching of a society whose post mao leaders have offered economic advancement but political smoke and mirrors it is easier and safer of course to domesticate mao the green silk pajamas criticize him as an evil individual as some do in private or simply draw a veil over him the ccp line than to broach the problem of the political system he introduced to china today young pro market chinese who devour hayeks "road to serfdom" and books on american business are embracing an antistate chinese tradition best known in the west through taoism they would like but will not get a china without politics a new public philosophy when it comes as it must will come from gestation below not as a diktat from a father figure or a paternalistic communist party "when societies first come to birth it is the leader who produces the institutions " wrote montesquieu in china that was the mao era "later it is the institutions which produce the leaders " the french philosopher added that is todays china with its nine man leading group all engineers later still in a democratic era it will be the voting public that chooses among clusters of policies devised by politicians allowed only the short term authority to lead mr terrill a research associate at harvards fairbank center is the author of "the new chinese empire" basic books
