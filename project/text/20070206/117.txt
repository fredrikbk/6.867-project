the bush budget on deficit cutting skeptics abound president bush often describes himself as optimistic about the nations future and he demonstrated that again with his budget request to congress in the spending and tax plan released yesterday mr bush projects the deficits that have marked his tenure will disappear by to accomplish that the white house assumes revenues will continue to pour into the treasury at near their recent rates and congress goes along with all of mr bushs domestic spending plans a scenario democrats on capitol hill promptly rejected even if the white house is able to persuade democrats to cut federal programs squeeze nonsecurity programs to a annual growth rate and make sharp cuts in medicare mr bushs projections still dont account for several big potential budget busters as budget analysts and democratic critics were quick to note yesterday all of these are short term problems that pale in comparison with the long term fiscal time bombs the nation faces with the retirement of baby boomers still the budgets perceived shortcomings are sparking a lively debate the presidents budget contains only partial projections of war related spending likely disguising what will be higher outlays the budget assumes the cost of military operations in iraq and afghanistan will total &# billion for fiscal but only &# billion in and zero after that congressional budget office figures suggest a withdrawal of large numbers of u s troops by would actually add to overall costs mr bush also hasnt addressed the likely costs of long term relief from the alternative minimum tax originally created by congress in the s to ensure ultrawealthy people didnt use credits and deductions to avoid paying any tax it is beginning to hit the middle class it isnt indexed for inflation so more earners qualify for the amt and the bush tax cuts have accelerated the expansion of its reach congress keeps passing one year patches but the cost of relief is soaring each year it would be at least &# billion through and could reach &# trillion over the next decade according to various estimates democrats are adamant about fixing the amt problem in part because it hits states they dominate such as new york new jersey and california especially hard mr bush also is projecting reductions in expenditures for agricultural subsidies as much as &# billion annually compared with last years forecast as the administration seeks to reauthorize farm economy support programs much of the change is due to strong market demand which has kept prices from falling to levels that trigger federal subsidy payments but the administrations agriculture plan also is expected to tighten up on some programs while focusing more on establishing overseas markets and putting more money into research particularly renewable fuels some of those proposals could fall short of farm state democrats expectations democrats also questioned the increases in tax collections the white house projects exceeding annual growth on average over the next six years greater than the yearly increase in projected economic growth and above the revenue growth congressional budget analysts forecast the administration also is proposing a series of fees including an increase in premiums for corporations that participate in the pension benefit guaranty corp and new fees for food inspection and enrollment in veterans programs that will be difficult to push through congress the administrations economic growth projection for is somewhat higher than others it projects real gdp growth for compared with by the congressional budget office and by the blue chip panel a group of business economists last year the administration projected real gdp growth for versus by cbo and by the blue chip cbo now projects that real gdp growth in was critics say when more realistic projections are used the small surplus forecast for is likely to melt away "while the president has endorsed the goal of balancing the budget under realistic assumptions his budget remains in deficit every year " said rep john spratt d s c chairman of the house budget committee "in some places this budget shows vision and in some places the presidents eyes are shut tight to this countrys fiscal reality " said sen max baucus d mont the chairman of the senate finance committee white house budget director rob portman termed the budget "credible " mr portman said the handling of war costs also was more transparent than in the past when requests were made off budget through "emergency" appropriations democrats vowed to counter mr bushs priorities by pushing for more help for lower income people and the middle class spending on health care programs education energy and the environment were among the most likely friction points with the white house as the two sides clash over appropriations bills still the focus by both sides on the five year window ending in masks the fiscal problems that lie after that starting in the oldest members of the baby boomer generation will begin to become eligible for medicare the government health insurance program for people and older that system is projected by its trustees to go broke by that reality sets up a much bigger debate over fiscal policy in following the presidential election in hanging in the balance will be a possible overhaul of u s health care the fate of mr bushs tax cuts and maybe social security and medicare to jump start the debate over entitlements mr bush again is urging congress to create new private accounts for future social security recipients
