can there be a liberal iraq in september mithal al alusi then a director general in iraqs de baathification commission attended a counterterrorism conference in israel upon his return to baghdad he was stripped of his job and threatened with arrest for violating a baath era law forbidding contact with the jewish state in february his two sons ayman and gamal were gunned down in plain view of their father credit for the murders was jointly claimed by the baath party and jaish ansar al sunna an al qaeda affiliate the following december mr alusi was elected to parliament as head and sole representative of the iraqi nation party mr alusi and his party stand for democracy liberalism secularism antiterrorism and national unity the question for iraq is does anyone stand with mr alusi spend an afternoon in his company and you might yet be persuaded that many iraqis do or at least might mr alusi is in washington d c to impress his views on administration officials and observe the debate in congress over additional troop commitments in iraq what does he make of that debate "to be honest we enjoy how beautiful this democratic system of yours can be and we might learn from it " he says beyond additional u s soldiers economic aid and the equipping and training of iraqs military what he most wants from america is intangible "we need to transfer the values from your society to ours " more easily said than done you might think given the general drift of iraqs politics over the past four years yet the polling data bear him out between and the number of iraqis who supported the idea of an islamic state fell to from while those agreeing that religion and politics ought to be separated rose to from according to surveys conducted by the university of michigans institute for social research even in baghdad site of so much of the sectarian killing the number of respondents who put their iraqi identity ahead of their muslim one doubled to by contrast only of cairenes saw themselves as egyptian first muslim second and of iraqis agreed that it was "very important" for iraq to be a democracy up from two years before mr alusi doesnt cite this data but he points to anecdotal indicators that give him hope one is the gradual shift in arab attitudes toward terrorism "something basic has changed " he says noting that the terrorism that once was directed against israel and the west has lost its cachet on the arab street now that muslims have become its principal victims another is the fact that iraqi soldiers many of them shiite were willing to fight and die alongside american soldiers in recent fighting against shiite militants "so the loyalty to iraqi institutions did count and the partnership between the iraqi and american armies did hold " so why havent such attitudes translated into better political realities for iraq the first leg of the problem in mr alusis view is one of salesmanship "the main mistake of liberals in the middle east is trying to speak at too high a level liberal values arent for intellectuals or for the rich theyre for the simple people " another leg is that iraqs liberal politicians he mentions ahmed chalabi and ayad allawi have spent more time jockeying for cabinet positions than proselytizing for liberal beliefs and organizing grassroots support a third leg is the media while sectarian parties such as prime minister nouri al malikis dawa control several newspapers and tv stations theres no real outlet for liberal ideas even the u s sponsored al hurra "the free one" he laments often seems little better than a facsimile of al jazeera the fourth leg is a voting system based on party lists which typically encourages sectarian voting patterns that makes it all seem as if the main thing standing between tocqueville and the tigris is a bit of message discipline electoral reform and &# million for a privately owned liberal media outlet what about terrorism mr alusi categorically rejects the idea that there is a civil war in iraq pointing out that sunni and shiite radicals such as al qaeda and the mahdi army dont actually target each other but instead bid to gain territory or simply sow chaos by terrorizing civilians much of the current violence he adds was encouraged by the u s troop drawdowns of which allowed "the terrorists and the iranians to believe their goals were within reach " restore u s forces to previous levels and deploy them more effectively he reasons and the tide may yet be turned but the key point in mr alusis view is americas willingness to confront iran "you americans are investing billions of dollars in iraq " he says "three thousand beautiful sons have been killed but the iranians are investing in parties and politicians their embassy in baghdad is larger and more active than yours their intelligence is moving on the iraqi street and theyre helping shiite and sunni terrorist gangs " mr alusis obsession with the iranian threat might be explained by the fact that he is himself a sunni except he is no less emphatic on the danger posed by the sunni terrorists who murdered his sons or hamas militants firing rockets into israel "the same terrorists who are attacking israeli society are attacking me " he says and unlike some among the u s foreign policy establishment he refuses to draw fine distinctions between sunni shiite baathist secular local or global strands of modern day terrorism instead he lumps them together as an alliance of fascists intent on using murder to impose their values which must be confronted with an equally tenacious alliance against terrorism "if america loses its will in this fight there wont be peace in the middle east for years " he warns none of this means that mr alusi and his party are going to thrive in the future iraq but it is a reminder that the cause of liberalism is not yet dead in iraq and that the transfer of values between baghdad and washington is not a one way street america went to mesopotamia to spread the gospel of democracy mr alusi has come to the u s to offer an example of courage a point worth noting amid the speeches of senators hagel warner and kerry write to
