the bush budget addressing wealth gap tax deduction for health insurance proposed in a speech last week president bush said "the fact is that income inequality is real its been rising for more than years " in his new budget yesterday mr bush proposed some modest ways to restrain the wealth gap particularly by offering new tax breaks to help the uninsured buy health insurance but did little to fundamentally strengthen existing government efforts to alter the distribution of income included in his budget also was a proposal to extend his and tax cuts which democrats say benefit the rich over everyone else chief among mr bushs plans that would over time tend to reduce inequality are his proposals to create a tax deduction for health insurance that would help lower and middle class families who dont receive insurance through their jobs to spend more on grants to low income college students and to create &# personal accounts that workers may use for education and training a proposal he has made before the president also proposed cutting grants for dislocated workers to get training and limiting eligibility for a state federal health insurance program for low income children democrats attacked the budget saying mr bush was putting the needs of the wealthy above everyone else "its priorities are disconnected from the needs of middle class americans " senate majority leader harry reid said in a statement "his budget hands out favors for the oil and gas industry while eroding health coverage for children and seniors " while the economy has expanded nearly after inflation since the last recession ended in many americans havent seen their paychecks increase fast enough to keep up with rising prices incomes at the top keep rising with the top of households claiming of all the income in up from in but median household income remains below its peak adjusted for inflation rather than using the tax code to redistribute income more than it does already mr bushs budget looks to address inequality largely by helping people afford health insurance and providing more money for education including increased pell grants for college the white house said the president while seeking to restrain overall spending identified "three key issues that are on the minds of many americans" as budget priorities "the quality and cost of their childrens education access to affordable health care and our nations dependence on foreign sources of energy from unstable parts of the world " the presidents health plan would for the first time make employer provided health insurance taxable but provide a standard tax deduction of as much as &# for families who get insurance administration officials predict that the plan would help to restrain health costs and ultimately raise wages the treasury says the proposal would "make the tax system more progressive with the benefits concentrated on low and middle income americans" those with incomes below &# a year several of mr bushs economic advisers have argued that the best response to widening income disparities particularly the widening gap between those with education and those without would be to improve k education and encourage more americans to go to college the president "felt that the way to deal with this was to make sure that everybody had the opportunity to invest in the kinds of skills necessary to advance in this economy " the chairman of his council of economic advisers edward lazear said in a c span interview to that end mr bush proposed increasing pell grants which provide needy students with money that doesnt have to be repaid to &# in the academic year from the current &# and to &# in and boosting funding for the no child left behind education law mr bushs school improvement program critics say the budget would exacerbate inequality by weakening programs that many middle and low income families rely on such as energy assistance child health care and job training "rather than lean against this trend toward increased inequality the budget would aggressively accelerate the trend " said robert greenstein executive director of the liberal center on budget and policy priorities while he said some of the presidents proposals like the pell grant increase would be modestly helpful "those proposals are dramatically outweighed by the others in the budget " for the state childrens health insurance program which helps states to cover low income children mr bush proposes an increase of about &# billion over five years much lower than advocates say is needed to keep the current enrollees in the program the budget also calls for limiting the eligibility to of the federal poverty level or &# for a family of four for at least states have expanded the eligibility to as much as of the poverty level the proposal contrasts with the idea of covering all children which is favored by many democrats and several governors mike leavitt secretary of health and human services says that while the s chip program was intended to cover children in the poorest families some states have expanded it to cover children from higher income families and even adults the presidents budget proposes cutting two labor department programs aimed at helping individuals who have lost their jobs including a cut to adult employment and training and a cut for dislocated worker and employment training those cuts would be offset with funding for "career advancement accounts " which would provide &# to individuals to be used toward school or training another program aimed at retraining workers whose jobs are eliminated because of global trade would see flat funding while cash benefits provided as part of trade adjustment assistance which provides displaced workers with unemployment benefits retraining and education would increase about to &# million as in years past several social welfare programs are slated for cuts including a cut to social service block grants which are used by states to provide child care child welfare and a variety of other services to vulnerable families the budget also proposes to eliminate funding for community services block grants down from &# million when president bush has proposed similar cuts in the past congress hasnt accepted them rep brad miller a north carolina democrat who campaigned heavily on the issue of income inequality said the budget "doesnt appear to be any great shakes for the middle class " he said democrats would undoubtedly press ahead with their own plans to help address the wage gap including more money for education and job training jane zhang contributed to this article
