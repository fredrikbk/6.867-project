county n j tomorrow new york designer alice roi who makes punk rock inspired knit dresses will host a party paid for by dow chemical co to introduce denim made with a next generation stretch fiber the tablecloths at the party will be made of the "xla" denim these varied deals were all brokered by new yorks designers management agency or dma which has positioned itself as the creative artists agency of the luxury fashion industry the emergence of dma comes at a time when fashion designers both new and established are eager to find ways to raise the profiles of their own brands and generate additional revenue amid stagnant apparel sales "the only way to be in the market is to become a celebrity yourself " ms dao says "today fashion designers have greater exposure we know more about them than just their names " says david rand executive director of interiors at general motors corp which hired new york designer dana buchman to design the interior of a prototype cadillac srx her picks snakeskin sun visors silk carpeting and quilted leather seats in the past fashion designers have struck their own bargains or gone through public relations agencies but the rising wave of options has created an opportunity for dma and agencies like it "fashion designers either dont have the business acumen or they are creative types and they dont really care to focus in on the business side of things " says dma founder marc beckman who is married to alice roi his company he says tries "to leverage that star factor they bring to the table " four year old dma was the first company created exclusively to occupy this niche but competitors have started sprouting up in september "american idol" creator simon fuller launched a talent agency in london called rm its aim is "to take fashion into new areas of pop culture " mr fuller told the british press at the time his first deal was a dress design collaboration for gap inc with british designer roland mouret who is a owner of rm

"job bank" service to help link member designers with large retailers the cfda also is a paying client of dma which organized a recent deal to produce a cfda branded coffee table book about american fashion icons with the publishing house assouline the proliferation of deals with retailers reflects a change of heart among fashion designers and luxury goods executives who once shunned the licensing business after logos for brands like gucci and yves st laurent started showing up on cheap t shirts cigarette lighters and luggage in the s and s those labels spent years buying back ill conceived licenses and repositioning themselves with expensive marketing campaigns isaac mizrahis successful collaboration with target helped change the scene when target hired the designer in critics argued that mr mizrahi who shut down his unprofitable high end label in when his backer chanel sa pulled the plug was ruining his career but the target collection caused a sensation and reinvigorated his brand fashion designers partnerships now take a variety of forms and are different from the licensing agreements of the past a designer may sign on with a retailer to make a one off collection for one season or sign a multiyear contract the design project is often for something other than clothes and a growing category is fashion entertainment bookings for fashion themed television shows or guest appearances such as one ms dao did recently for lenscrafters inc dma which has employees has a client roster that includes such apparel makers as jones apparel group inc and liz claiborne inc as well as consumer product companies like procter &amp gamble co and unilever nv companies seeking creative products are plugged into what mr beckman calls his "fashion ecosystem" of designers such as
