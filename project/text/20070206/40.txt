econoblog new takes on the new deal when it released its budget proposal monday the bush administration and its congressional critics focused anew on the countrys giant social security program treasury secretary henry paulson has said "significant political differences" will make it tough to close the gap expected to develop between contributions to social security and promised benefits the roots of those differences stretch back some years to president franklin d roosevelt who introduced social security in as a plank in his new deal economic recovery program economists have long debated how effective the new deal was now as the country again considers its fiscal priorities wsj com asked economists arnold kling an adjunct scholar with the cato institute and brad delong a professor of economics at the university of california berkeley to type out their different takes on fdrs deal what do you think share your comments on our discussion board brad delong writes imagine the press discovered and published the extent of fdrs polio injuries and details of his irregular family life herbert hoover is reelected in november and vows to "stay the course" with his first term economic policies in that alternate universe a group of harvard economists advises mr hoover on the banking crisis in the winter of they argue that banks are failing because their fundamentals are unsound and that it would be improper to rescue bankers who have run their businesses into the ground or depositors who have not been prudent enough to watch where they deposit their money they say a full fledged panic would not be a bad thing as it would purge the rottenness from the system high costs of living and high living itself will be tamed people will work harder and live cleaner values will be adjusted and enterprising people will pick up the wrecks from less the competent it wouldnt have worked people would not just work harder and live cleaner instead using ben bernankes analysis of the depression as a guide we could surmise that the depression would have gotten worse other excerpts from bernankes research under our imagined scenario more and more banks would fail and more and more of the deposits of americans would vanish the downward spiral of economic activity would have continued through and we can guess that increasing economic uncertainty would drive faster gold outflows from the u s through and the federal reserve under treasury secretary andrew mellons control would have responded by following gold standard orthodoxy which interprets the outflow of gold is a sign interest rates are too low and need to be raised rising interest rates would have further cut money supplies the falling money supply was a key way the depression spread according to milton friedman and anna schwartzs "monetary history of the united states " under our imagined scenario the depression would have been worse than it was in our actual history arnold kling writes what would have happened in the u s without the new deal my father answers with one word fascism given the climate of the time which included intense despair alongside revolutionary fervor a government that was seen as doing nothing could not have survived when it comes to perspective on the great depression i have a lot of respect for the views of people who like my father lived through it i also have a lot of respect for the views of brad delong who is an authority on macroeconomics and economic history randall parkers reflections on the great depression is based on interviews with eminent economists who lived through it as i have pointed out the consensus is that the new deal failed to restore the economy back to full health unemployment and what we would now call the "output gap" were still unusually high in after which our statistical perspective becomes distorted by the fog of war in parkers book economists tended to give mixed and sometimes surprising reviews to new deal policies milton friedman the recently deceased nobel laureate who was famous for his opposition to keynesian expansion of government and many new deal programs approved of "the series of monetary measures that roosevelt took including the bank holiday the going off gold the program to purchase gold the silver purchase program " even james tobin a leading keynesian was critical of the national recovery administration and other new deal programs that promoted cartels and restrictions on supply another useful perspective comes from the current fed chairman ben bernankes essays on the great depression which makes the point that financial intermediaries matter and that the wave of bank failures might have been a major factor in the depression this may seem obvious but bernankes views contrast with those found in the sterile models of economists where funds flow immaculately from savers to investors all of that is very interesting to professional economists but what i think is relevant to ideological debates today is this are social security farm price supports federal housing programs legalization of trade unions securities market regulation and other major legacies of the new deal necessary for macroeconomic stability what did they contribute to recovery in the s what do they contribute today over to you brad brad delong writes arnold wants to talk about the legacy of institutions created in the new deal for example do we really need a securities and exchange commission in the form it was cast in and back then everybody unfairly blamed wall street for the great depression of course there was some financial chicanery take executive albert wiggin of chase national bank who massively shorted chases stock and gave himself a financial windfall still financial markets only work well when they find and transmit information about the likely future of companies and industries and bake information into prices to do that there must be incentives for uncovering important scraps of information and clear lines between what you can and cant do that is between research and illegitimate insider trading the sec has always found it tough to draw such a clear line thats because its crisis origins have led it to focus on a different though important problem shoring up investor confidence besides transmitting information markets need to bundle great masses of savings from scattered individuals to do that investors must be confident investments can be bought and sold fairly this doesnt work if you buy a share of a company from the corporate directors cousin who happens to know the firms market share collapsed during quarter it also doesnt work if you sell a drug companys shares to someone who knows that say the latest test of a potential blockbuster treatment was extremely encouraging financial regulation is a balancing act and some worry that new deal left us with a system thats too focused on leveling the field for buyers and sellers and not focused enough on having the best informed buyers and sellers in the market that in turn might give too much power to entrenched managers and not enough power to insurgent financiers arnold kling writes the new deal is a mythical event in history just as we revere the constitution as the basis for our government and we revere abraham lincoln for ending slavery and preserving the union we are supposed to revere the new deal as somehow providing the basis for our modern prosperity yet the policies of the new deal are quite a mixed bag to say the least most were discarded by the survivors include agricultural policies that were almost certainly wrong then and are almost certainly wrong now most of the financial regulations such as interest rate ceilings on bank deposits proved unworkable by the s social security and its offspring medicare are going to be the next great financial crisis in this country i would argue that deposit insurance which was adopted nationwide in was the most constructive of all of the new deal reforms but even it was badly handled ill conceived accounting standards capital standards and supervisory rules created tremendous moral hazard in the deposit insurance system in spite of warnings from economists this barn door was not closed until the savings and loan crisis of the early s which cost taxpayers upward of &# billion social security was set up as an intergenerational transfer from those of working age to the elderly but its soundness has been undermined by improvements in longevity and reductions in fertility for a relatively nonpartisan critique see daniel shaviros new book medicare enacted in in the spirit of the new deal adopted the transfer mechanism of social security because of its sensitivity to secular trends in medical technology and the demand for medicine medicare is in even worse shape than social security just as economists knew in the s and s that deposit insurance was badly structured we know that social security and medicare constitute a fiscal time bomb however the mythical status of the new deal has handcuffed efforts at needed reforms brad delong writes i agree with arnold that deposit insurance was badly handled but even badly handled it was a big improvement over none at all in fact thats a good thumbnail summary of the entire new deal badly handled but a vast improvement that is with the exception agricultural subsidies and the national recovery administration they did little good if any at immense long run cost arnold writes "social security and its offspring medicare are going to be the next great financial crisis in this country " let me protest the phrase "its offspring medicare " medicaid and medicare are lyndon johnsons great society not fdrs new deal and lets remember that back in before bush ii the long run non health program related finances of the federal government looked to be in fine shape at least as i did the math even factoring in the recession that hit between and and the then current tax laws long run projected budget surpluses significantly outweighed the long run social security deficits its more accurate i think to say the federal government has two fiscal problems  the bush ii administration with its insistence on not paying for the spending it insists on undertaking this includes the iraq war and medicare part d  our long run health financing problem as far as health programs are concerned we could look at this not as a problem but as an opportunity if we only let medicare and medicaid beneficiaries get the levels of care they received in we wouldnt have a long run healthcare financing problem but we expect medicare and medicaid to pay for more care in the future because we expect our doctors to develop more amazing treatments we also expect these amazing treatments will be amazingly expensive and finally we expect americans will want to provide access to the amazing medical miracles of the future to more than just the rich does our general belief that medical care shouldnt be rationed according to ability to pay spring from the new deal or does it have deeper cultural roots arnold kling writes brad writes "and finally we expect americans will want to provide access to the amazing medical miracles of the future to more than just the rich " but medicare is not a transfer from the rich to the poor it is a transfer from the young to the old one legacy of the new deal is that it changed the way we think about income transfers  we now think of it as a federal responsibility first a state and local government responsibility second with private charity barely significant  most of the transfers payments are received by the middle class and the affluent and a fair amount of the taxes are levied on people at the median income or below  most of the transfers are intergenerational from people of working age to people in retirement  as individuals we no longer are incented to have children to take care of us in our old age although collectively we do  as individuals we no longer are incented to save as much for our old age although again looking at the trends in demographics and health care technology we probably need to find a way to save more in the aggregate going forward we need a frank discussion about whether or not this is good policy brad delong writes arnold thinks the partial success of the new deal taught americans bad lessons about the role of government or lessons that hurt us in the future first lets remember that the new deals partial success includes the recovery from unemployment to roughly unemployment the rebound from of industrial production to approximately of industrial production before wwii began the boom in production and employment albeit not private consumption of world war ii accompanied by total victory nevertheless arnold thinks that because of the new deal we now believe its the governments job to care for us when were sick old and when things go wrong at work or at home therefore we save too little have too few children to support us when we get old and work too little because we face substantial marginal tax rates in short we would be a better society if people knew they would be poor in their old age if they didnt save for retirement understood they would die prematurely if they didnt save for future medical care thought they would be old alone and uncared for if they didnt have dutiful children presumed they would lose their middle class status if they had a heart attack lost their job or got divorced and hadnt piled up large lumps of precautionary savings im reminded of a teachers lectures on early victorian economics to the victorians she noted private charity should be ample because that was what jesus taught and it kept the poor from starving en masse the streets but never comprehensive there should always be at least a few poor people starving in the streets to make it clear the poor couldnt count on charity it drove people to work save stay married have children and bring them up properly under this philosophy the economys purpose is to create morally prudent servants who live in the fear of the lord her students hedonists living in the california sun found it very strange the purpose of the economy is obviously to enable people to realize their human potential and to satisfy their needs wants and dreams i admit moral hazards people gaming the system and not contributing their share are a danger in all insurance programs especially social insurance but consider america is already on the libertarian end of the spectrum of advanced industrial economies further leaps in that direction would make us more the odd one out and increased savings from making the old and the sick who havent saved impoverished must be very large before i would conclude that incentives facing americans in the economy are too soft and encourage too much slacking and i havent seen that demonstrated yet arnold kling writes consider two utopias in a libertarian utopia most families take care of themselves by working saving and purchasing insurance taxes are low but charitable contributions are high and most people who cannot take care of themselves are served by charities as james bartholomew points out in "the welfare state state were in " private charities have many advantages over government programs finally if people slip through the cracks of charity government programs could be a last resort in the progressive new deal utopia we are all wards of the state clever technocrats use the coercive power of the state to put all of us into government run savings and insurance programs brad delong and others who believe in the technocratic welfare state utopia will point to europe as an example for the u s to follow however europe is in demographic decline even the clever technocrats lack a plan for dealing with the pending surge in the ratio of pensioners to workers the work ethic in europe is slowly melting away among young people the unemployment rate reaches in several countries there is something rotten in denmark and indeed in the entire concept of the technocratically run welfare state the new deal gave the american people new faith in large powerful central government however the results of the new deal did not justify that faith in the s nor do the results of the welfare state justify such faith today what do you think share your comments on our discussion board
