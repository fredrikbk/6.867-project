act one lean on me cohabitation can be a comfy upgrade from the single life but tension may build when one partner earns more without help from her boyfriend maureen brackey would still be anxiously wondering how to get out of debt ms brackey works as an assistant in a los angeles real estate firm her income barely dents her student loan and credit card bills her boyfriend cole williams paid the deposit on their apartment and plans on paying more than half the rent for a little while to help her out of debt "its part of being in a relationship " says mr williams "you just share " in our first rocky years of independence moving in together can be the first step in creating a new family away from our parents its romantic and exciting and all that jazz it can also work as a give and take arrangement that makes each member of the couple more time and cash rich certainly some young lovers cling to each other during instability only to find that later absent calamity theyre incompatible and without the legal protections of marriage these mergers can get messy but for the moment at least some find cohabitation a comfy upgrade from the single life "we kind of pick up each others slack " says mr williams "we still have our own money and our own bank accounts but what we end up picking up and how we divide stuff i dont anticipate it being very clear cut all the time " "he doesnt anticipate being very paid back is what he means " says ms brackey more and more unmarried couples are moving in together in the u s and people in their twenties make up the biggest percentage according to the u s census in more than million households were comprised of unmarried opposite sex partners in their s the total number of unmarried partner households that year was million up from about million in supportive partners may help each other accomplish daunting ambitious goals that would be financially difficult for a single person like going back to school or starting a business when stephen garrett first moved in with his girlfriend harrison parks he didnt pay rent mr garrett was a senior in college and worked part time ms parks now had already graduated from university of tennessee knoxville and was working full time in human resources at a utility company the arrangement was temporary mr garrett has since graduated and now works as an accountant so they split all the bills fifty fifty that will change again in the fall when ms parks goes to graduate school for an m b a mr garrett will support her "i definitely think theres a financial advantage " he says of their arrangement there are also serious financial downsides to living together oakland attorney frederick hertz says there are two common ways for unmarried people to get into financial trouble mr hertz the author of "living together a legal guide for unmarried couples " says he meets many clients who have had their credit damaged by jointly signing up for a lease or a new car with their partner who then shirked financial responsibility "whats really bad is the number of situations i see where one person has taken someone elses complete liability " he says "sally walks into my office saying shes got a &# credit card debt for bills business venture because bill had bad credit and sally was doing him a favor " mr hertz recommends that unmarried couples draw up a "non marital agreement" detailing monetary issues that will be considered an enforceable contract in most state courts in the case of a complicated break up just like friends with money significant others with money may want to spend it with you especially if you live together ryan vernon will likely foot the bill for two &# plane tickets to spain so he can take a vacation with his girlfriend and roommate natalie gruppuso who makes less than half the money he does but where theyll stay once they arrive has yet to be decided all mr vernon knows for now is that he doesnt want to pay for both of their accommodations "im willing to stay in hostels and live on the cheap but shes not down with that " he says right now ms gruppuso is working a few different jobs part time in a book store assisting a photographer and also doing some freelance photography "sometimes i do things that are splurging for me just so we can do things together " she says the two new yorkers live in a co op apartment owned by ms gruppusos parents he pays the rent to them and she pays the building maintenance fee which is &# a month less than rent mr vernon a product engineer says money is a big stressor in their relationship both say that their financial attitudes diverge as a result of different upbringings mr vernon admits hes a "cheapskate" who lets his clothes turn threadbare "she buys three pair of shoes for every one pair that i buy " he says still these are small gripes compared to the trials of living with indifferent roommates dragging home furniture alone to a cold house where there is no one there to greet you help carry up your load and pour you a glass of wine and the potential treachery of being hazed at a new job or in a new career can be muffled when home life is warm and supportive career transitions and temporary unemployment so common in our twenties are less likely to feel completely terrifying if someone else covers the rent and spares us from going into debt or head hung low back to the parents for cash in capitola calif john proko is helping his girlfriend liz windham who recently lost her job "hes helping me out in tight spots " she says of his financial contribution ms windham says she feels less vulnerable now "being just by myself i could not reliably count on having enough to support myself in an emergency " write to emily meehan at actone wsj com
