better to reunite than to fade away baby boomer rock bands and gen x groups re form lured by web big paydays rock guitar icon eddie van halen and his bands original lead singer david lee roth have spent the better part of years bad mouthing each over their bitter split in the mid s yet last friday the band van halen posted a message on its web site indicating that it would reunite with the flamboyant mr roth this year for a city tour the reason for letting bygones be bygones is simple economically many music acts are worth a lot more together than apart the bad blood between messrs van halen and roth will almost certainly stoke interest and that doesnt count the additional curiosity that will result from the fact that mr van halen has installed his year old son wolfgang as his new bass player executives estimate the tour based on a guaranteed fee of &# per show would likely generate sales of at least &# million that would make it a blockbuster as the concert industry revs up for the touring season some of the greatest passion among both fans and concert promoters is reserved for bands that havent been heard in live performance in years if not decades comebacks or reunions have been announced by acts as disparate as van halen rage against the machine and a slew of smaller names the police and genesis are expected to mount tours but have not yet made official announcements the hints are coming fast and furious however this weekend the police who released their last studio album in are set to perform together at the grammy awards the band is likely to tour although people close the situation said significant details have yet to be finalized a few years ago prince used the grammys to similarly preview what became a massively successful comeback tour the resurgence in old timer tours is partly a byproduct of the ongoing decline of the recorded music business as the record industry has failed to launch many big new names in recent years the concert industry has come to look to acts that are proven draws to keep their venues full with rare exceptions like the polices singer and bass player sting most members of these acts have not been as successful as solo performers as they were as part of a unit "theres a need for headliners throughout our business in a major way " says randy phillips chief executive of anschutz corp s aeg live the countrys no concert promoter "on the bands part theres a need for cash when those needs merge its a wonderful thing " in a reunion tour by s metal band motley crue took the industry by surprise and became the no grossing tour of the year taking in close to &# million in cities according pollstar which tracks concert industry data a three night stand by the blues rock band cream at madison square garden was the fourth highest grossing show the same year taking in &# million it also helped to further propel the reunion phenomenon a spokeswoman for cream frontman eric clapton says the trio has no plans for further concert or recording activity creams box office performance notwithstanding reunion shows are no longer reserved for grizzled boomer favorites the window between a bands heyday and the time a reunion becomes feasible has narrowed so much that this year bands that were together as recently as a few years ago are mounting comeback concerts and tours six years after breaking up smashing pumpkins is planning what the bands web site calls "a world tour of tears " further details werent available but two of the original members of the alternative rock quartet will not be on hand the impact of such personnel changes can be hard to gauge but a recent series of concerts by guns n roses has had mixed box office performance thanks largely to the absence of integral involvement from any original members besides lead singer axl rose unofficially kicking off this years touring season is southern californias coachella valley music &amp arts festival which in late april will feature a performance by s alternative rock icons rage against the machine thanks largely to the rage reunion festival organizers say ticket sales are at triple the level they were at this time last year with sold so far the festival is on track to sell out for the first time in its nine year history for now rage against the machine has given no indication that it will tour after coachella making the gig that much more attractive to fans coachella has in recent years served as something of a launchpad for comeback tours ever since a reunion there of the pixies a favorite of critics in the s created a strong buzz that laid the groundwork for a tour that became no in ticket sales in a major feat for a band with the pixies limited mainstream appeal the pixies tour which continued through is an object lesson in the lucrative economics of reunions the pixies tour grossed an average &# a show according pollstar the band played bigger venues to bigger audiences than it ever did during its original career as influential alternative rock pioneers in the late s by contrast in the same period a solo tour by pixies leader frank black took in just an average of &# a show the pixies success has in turn inspired a slew of much smaller names to give it another whirl this year alone marginal s acts such as chavez sebadoh and bis have either announced or staged reunions kevin french booking agent for sebadoh says that the internet has extended the shelf life of otherwise obscure bands thanks to web sites where fans too young to have seen a band the first time around can find their music and videos the fresh online attention helps spur bands to re form musicians who were in multiple bands may find themselves involved in more than one reunion sebadoh for example is an offshoot of cult favorite band dinosaur jr which had its own reunion tour last year "eventually they all do it " says mr french
