the evening wrap yen yearnings the group of seven finance ministers will hunker down in germany later this week for a broad discussion of exchange rates among other issues but its what they might say about one currency in particular the yen that will interest markets the most the japanese currency has been plummeting in recent weeks after the countrys central bank decided against raising interest rates the steep drop has alarmed europeans whose currency has surged in value relative to the yen and some have started to grumble that the bank of japan is leaving rates parked at a low level for competitive purposes currency prices tend to follow interest rates higher and japans increasingly annoyed critics in europe think that policy makers in tokyo are holding down interest rates in order to give japanese exporters a leg up in the global marketplace after an extended struggle with deflation japans central bank only just started pushing interest rates higher but the banks new stance stirred up controversy as lawmakers worried that pushing interest rates too high too fast would snuff out the economys fits and starts recovery and now european critics see political tampering at work

like where its trading but its my job to fight for open competitive markets and i believe the yen is trading in an open competitive market based on underlying economic fundamentals " the yen declined relative to the dollar after those comments hit the wire the division seems likely to leave the finance ministers staring uncomfortably into their dinner plates this weekend and could mean that any market bets on a unified message on the yen are a stretch mr paulsons comments probably arent very comforting to detroit either the big three have complained that the weakened yen makes it harder for
