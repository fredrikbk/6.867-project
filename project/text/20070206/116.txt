the budget battle and your wallet how plans to expand health coverage could affect insured new prescriptions to help the uninsured are proliferating by the day but some of the proposals would have a big impact on another group people who already have health insurance yesterday democratic presidential hopeful john edwards became the latest entrant in the health overhaul derby announcing that he would raise taxes to expand coverage his plan like those of many states working to expand coverage would require employers to "play or pay" meaning cover their workers or pay a new tax he would also require most americans to have insurance helping middle and lower income people by offering tax credits both the uninsured and those who already have insurance through work would have the option to get coverage through new public pools called health markets mr edwardss plan joins an array of proposals already being advanced by the white house several states including california massachusetts and pennsylvania members of congress and insurance and consumer groups with health care shaping up as a major issue in the elections more plans are on the way including from democratic presidential candidates hillary clinton and barack obama the blueprints aim to reduce the number of uninsured people in the u s currently at million but use different strategies two of the plans by president bush and sen ron wyden an oregon democrat have the potential to affect nearly all americans by fundamentally altering the employer sponsored system that now provides coverage to million people on the federal level the chances of any of these proposals being enacted this year are slim given that there is little consensus and little money to spend on any plan that would increase subsidies still activity in this area is building and if congress and the white house are looking to make a deal on something major they might look to health care the states have a better chance of quick action with democrats and republicans working to find consensus in massachusetts a plan has already been passed and is being implemented heres a look at how the plans work and some potential winners and losers president bushs plan under the bush plan employer provided health insurance now excluded from workers taxable income would be subject to income and payroll tax as a tradeoff all taxpayers with insurance would get a standard deduction of &# for a family and &# for an individual among the winners would be those whose coverage costs less than &# a year or about of workers who have job based insurance the white house says for example a worker with a family policy costing him and his employer &# a year would still be able to take the full deduction of &# losers would include people with family policies worth more than &# including executives with generous benefits and some union workers who have traded wage increase for better health coverage they would be taxed on the amount that exceeds the deduction but winners could turn into losers with time even people with policies under the cap could eventually hit the ceiling as health costs rise thats because the cap would be indexed to general inflation not health care inflation which has risen more rapidly in recent years clear winners would be the million people who buy insurance on the open market currently they dont get any tax break for purchasing health insurance but like any tax deduction the one for health insurance would be most valuable in dollar terms for people with high incomes who pay the most taxes low income people who dont owe any income tax wouldnt be able to use the deduction they would have their payroll taxes reduced instead but that could cause a serious unintended problem since those taxes go into the social security coffers people paying in less would get lower benefits in retirement "this could translate into a very substantial drop in retirement living standards " concluded an analysis by the tax policy center a joint venture of two liberal leaning think tanks the urban institute and the brookings institution the white house acknowledges that changing the tax treatment of insurance would reduce the number of uninsured by only three million to five million it has proposed a separate initiative that would redirect federal funds from hospitals that provide indigent care to help states expand coverage to the uninsured some experts see another potential problem if younger healthier employees use the tax deduction to buy insurance on their own rather than through their employers then employer health plans could end up with mostly older sicker workers resulting in higher premiums "its good for you if youre a healthy person who will do well on your own " says paul fronstin director of health research and education programs at the employee benefit research institute "its bad if you are not " but joseph antos a health policy expert at the conservative american enterprise institute doubts many people would jump into the open insurance market considering its so much easier to stay in an employer plan "it takes a lot to get people to move " says mr antos sen wydens proposal sen wydens plan in many ways is the most radical one on the table he would sever the link between employment and insurance altogether and require everyone to buy coverage directly from insurance companies much like people now buy auto insurance he initially would require that employers pay their workers the cash that they had been spending on health insurance he argues that employers would ultimately continue the practice even when no longer required to keep the best workers beyond that he would provide a tax break to help people pay their insurance premiums and give low income americans direct subsidies for coverage a new tax on employers would help pay for the program new rules would require insurance companies to cover anyone who applied for insurance even ones with existing medical conditions and would bar the companies from charging sick people higher premiums under this plan people with insurance will have a greater choice of health plans than most get from work today given that the market is likely to produce more options but as health costs and insurance premiums rise families would have to absorb the increase as is employers pass the cost of rising health care to their workers through higher premiums and lower wages but workers dont always feel the impact says john sheils of lewin group a health care consulting firm that helped develop the wyden plan everyone would be required to buy insurance even if they dont think they need it sen wyden describes a young healthy man he met in central oregon who told him that he didnt think he needed coverage sen wyden noted that the young man was a skier and asked him "what if you crack up on the mountain " the man replied that if he got hurt he would buy insurance then "thats not how insurance works " sen wyden says "this is going to be a huge education job " state efforts several states including massachusetts california and pennsylvania are working to expand health coverage through a combination of approaches people without insurance would be required to buy it low income families would get subsidies to do so all but the smallest employers would have to provide coverage to their workers or pay fines and states would make it easier for individuals and small businesses to buy coverage from central pools these approaches wouldnt directly affect those who already have insurance though if more healthy people were added to the insurance pool it could reduce the cost of coverage for everybody says mr fronstin of the employee benefit research institute the biggest impact would be on the low income uninsured who would be eligible for new subsidies says paul ginsburg president of the center for studying health system change a washington think tank "they are out and out winners " a coalition proposal a diverse collection of consumer business medical and insurance groups called the health coverage coalition for the uninsured is recommending another approach that tries to reduce the number of people without insurance without affecting people who already have it it suggests making it easier to enroll the million children who are eligible but not yet signed up for medicaid the state federal health program for the poor and disabled or the state childrens health insurance program which targets low income kids who dont qualify for medicaid it also recommends a new tax credit to help low income families pay for private insurance including coverage that may be offered through work if this plan became law families who earn less than of the federal poverty level could get help paying for health coverage and single adults even if they dont have kids would become eligible for medicaid if they were below the poverty line taxpayers would pick up the cost an estimated &# billion over five years while many want to expand the childrens health insurance program the bush administration wants to scale it back states have been adding children and some of their parents to the programs rolls but yesterday the administration proposed cutting enrollment of all adults as well as children in families with incomes over of the poverty level john edwardss plan former sen edwardss plan wouldnt require any changes of employees currently getting insurance on the job although employers would have to provide coverage or pay of their payroll he would use a blend of new tax increases tax breaks and subsidies to expand coverage under his proposal people who dont get insurance through work could buy into public pools called health markets with tax credits to help pay the premiums further insurance companies wouldnt be able to charge sick people extra and would be required to insure everyone who applied mr edwards also would expand medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program to cover more families and for the first time poor adults without kids once it was all in place he would require nearly all americans to get coverage one way or another the uninsured though would have a handful of new options those with particularly low incomes may become newly eligible for government programs others including families with incomes up to &# a year could get new tax breaks to buy insurance from the health markets those with insurance through work could also opt to get it from the health markets as well where there might be more choices
