baby has jaundice is that a problem mom of disabled boy pushes for tests debating risk of rare syndrome jaundice with its telltale yellow skin affects of newborn babies its almost always harmless except when it signals a dangerous buildup of toxins that can result in permanent brain damage now federal health agencies and the american academy of pediatrics are debating how worried parents should be about these rare cases sue sheridan the mother of a boy whose jaundice went untreated until it was too late has won federal support for her campaign to alert parents about the problem ms sheridan also wants all newborns to get a test that for as little as a dollar can show whether theyre at risk but the academy whose guidelines heavily influence care says recommending blanket testing goes too far and could lead to unnecessary tests and treatment it thinks ms sheridans message is too scary "we want to educate parents not alarm them " says ann stark an aap committee head and professor at baylor college of medicine in houston the debate reflects growing tensions over how to make best use of the hours a new mother and her baby typically have in the hospital before they are sent home pediatricians complain they are already overwhelmed with tests and messages to deliver to new mothers ms sheridan argues that preventable disorders even if rare deserve high priority jaundice can signal risk of a rare but irreversible neurological disorder called kernicterus once fairly common kernicterus virtually disappeared in the u s by the s only to stage a comeback over the past decade one specialist estimates there are to cases a year in the u s some say the academy of pediatrics fed the comeback with a recommendation later modified that doctors neednt be so vigilant about managing jaundice ms sheridans son cal was born healthy but ended up with kernicterus now years old cal has fine sandy blond hair a cherubic face and cerebral palsy that affects every muscle in his body his movements are jerky and uncontrollable his speech is badly impaired and he cant stop his drooling or clean himself after using the toilet "hell need assistance all his life " says ms sheridan most of the time cal doesnt sulk over his disability which appears not to have impaired his cognitive skills but once in a while reality sets in last summer at home ms sheridan recalls he said "mommy i dont want to be one of a kind anymore " ms sheridan once worked as a banker in trade finance and as an antiques importer she gave that up when cal was born in recent years she has traversed the country from her home in eagle idaho often with cal in tow drumming up support for her campaign she wants every newborn to be given a test for bilirubin a waste product of red blood cells before being discharged from the hospital elevated bilirubin causes jaundice when bilirubin builds up to toxic levels kernicterus can develop doctors say the bilirubin test could be added to standard newborn blood screens for about &# per baby ms sheridan has persuaded hca inc one of the biggest u s hospital chains to start testing all its newborns funded by the u s centers for disease control and prevention a group led by ms sheridan is rolling out a kernicterus education effort in hospitals and prenatal classes with posters showing a boy in a wheelchair the academy of pediatrics has declined to embrace the campaign calling it too alarmist its president last year said she would discourage the academys members from displaying the materials in their offices in the s and s kernicterus was a fairly common complication of excessive bilirubin but medical advances helped doctors eliminate almost all cases one common tactic is phototherapy in which babies are placed under bright lights to break down bilirubin into nontoxic components in more serious cases doctors may remove all an infants blood and transfuse new blood to eliminate the toxin one study of the world wide medical literature found only a single case of kernicterus between and in pediatricians thomas newman and m jeffrey maisels published an article in the journal pediatrics advocating "a kinder gentler approach" to treating jaundice the paper said healthy full term babies "need not be closely followed for jaundice" and too many of them were probably getting unnecessary transfusions the approach was embraced by the aap in guidelines that said bilirubin levels could safely rise to higher levels than previously thought but the guidelines came out just as more kernicterus cases were popping up one reason may be that health insurers began to cover only two days of hospital stay for new mothers instead of four or five that meant more newborns were at home unmonitored when bilirubin levels peak generally at three to five days the cdc says the government keeps no count of u s kernicterus cases a large study in britain puts the incidence there at one per live births a rate that would produce about cases a year in the u s where four million babies are born annually vinod bhutani professor of pediatrics at stanford university school of medicine who runs a voluntary registry for reporting kernicterus estimates there are to u s cases a year dr bhutani says he also believes more than newborns a year reach a bilirubin level above milligrams per deciliter of blood which doctors generally agree requires urgent treatment cal sheridan was born at st lukes regional medical center in boise idaho a scrawl on the babys medical chart noted jaundice at hours old according to nurses notes submitted as evidence in a malpractice case the sheridans later brought a doctor said cals jaundice was normal and suggested placing him in the sun while a nurse jokingly called him "canary baby " ms sheridan says no bilirubin test was administered the hospital acknowledged and the sheridans were sent home on his fourth day cal had trouble breast feeding and appeared lethargic ms sheridan called the hospital a nurse told her to tickle his feet she said he didnt respond so ms sheridan called her pediatrician she remembers him being unfazed and telling her "im more concerned about you right now than him " but ms sheridan decided to take cal in for an office visit the pediatrician who was also a defendant in the case diagnosed an ear infection and prescribed an antibiotic but no bilirubin test according to his office notes by the next day cal was back in st lukes where a blood test showed his bilirubin was ms sheridan testified in the trial that a nurse told her this was the highest level hospital staff had ever seen st lukes started phototherapy the following day cal began to show classic signs of kernicterus a high pitched cry respiratory distress and arching of his neck although she didnt know it then ms sheridan says "my son was suffering brain damage right before my eyes " after four days cal was discharged as a "well child " hospital records showed but his development was delayed at age one he couldnt sit up couldnt hold a bottle and couldnt pick up a cheerio ms sheridan says in october she traveled to a specialist in seattle who diagnosed cal with kernicterus after ms sheridans husband pat learned the news he told his wife "i dont think theres any reason to live " she says the couple sought marriage counseling and they both started taking antidepressants when the sheridans daughter mackenzie was born in she too was jaundiced but doctors quickly tested the baby and started phototherapy ms sheridan wept in the shower for an hour "i was upset because of cal " she explains "i saw how easy it could have been to help him just so easy " in the sheridans lost their malpractice case heard before a jury in state court in boise but the judge set aside the verdict citing evidence of "failures" in cals care while the sheridans prepared for a new trial pat was diagnosed with cancer he died in shortly before his wife settled cals case on undisclosed terms by that point ms sheridan was an activist after she told her story at a medical conference mothers from around the country contacted her ms sheridan and six other moms formed a nonprofit parents of infants and children with kernicterus or pick ms sheridan persuaded the joint commission a body that accredits most u s hospitals to issue an alert to hospitals notifying them that kernicterus was back in june the cdc outlined the threat of kernicterus using pick children as case studies in its widely read morbidity and mortality weekly report ms sheridans campaign made a big impact at hca the nashville tenn based hospital chain which delivers babies a year about of all u s births at a meeting of hca doctors nurses and administrators in perinatal care she showed a video of some pick children cal arching in his fathers arms krista flopping on a bed while a feeding tube is taped to her belly jess flailing wildly a sad lullaby surged at the end of the montage "there wasnt a dry eye in the house " remembers janet meyers hcas head of perinatal safety gerald bullock an obstetrician and gynecologist in conroe texas was so moved he stood up to the microphone and said "on behalf of the profession i apologize to you for what happened to your son " after the speech ms meyers says hca looked into the issue and found it had an estimated cases per year of babies with bilirubin levels over she also learned that hca had faced several kernicterus related malpractice claims starting in the late s in hca announced a new policy requiring universal bilirubin testing on all newborns before discharge and a review of bilirubin risk during a follow up appointment in two to four days ms meyers says in there were two cases of babies with bilirubin levels over but no kernicterus cases reported amid the successes the pick parents were getting impatient that the american academy of pediatrics wasnt revising its "kinder gentler" jaundice management guidelines fast enough in at a virginia gathering of families with kernicterus children one father started talking about organizing a class action lawsuit against the aap like the sheridans many of the families had already sued hospitals for malpractice ms sheridan says she persuaded them that working with the doctors would be more constructive in pick the academy health agencies and patient safety groups started organizing the kernicterus prevention partnership campaign seeking to build public awareness of the problem but the effort got off to a slow start as the aap expressed reluctance to highlight the dangers of jaundice as graphically as others wanted to members of the campaign said initially the aap opposed using the words "brain damage" in education materials "we were nervous about that " acknowledges dr maisels the co author of the paper and head of a committee at the aap writing guidelines on jaundice "you dont want to be alarmist when of the time nothing is going to happen " in a june meeting ms sheridan says she presented a mock up poster that urged parents to "ask your doctor for a bilirubin test" before leaving the hospital the aap objected to the word "for " according to ms sheridan and others after an hourlong debate the group reached a compromise ms sheridan said parents would be urged to ask their doctor "about" a bilirubin test one week later on a conference call ms sheridan says she learned the aap wouldnt endorse the word "about" either dr stark the baylor professor who heads the aaps fetus and newborn committee declined to comment on the semantic debate the next month ms sheridan received bittersweet news the aap issued new stronger guidelines on managing jaundice but they didnt call for universal bilirubin testing the guidelines compiled over three years by a panel of experts say all newborns should be assessed for their risk of developing dangerous bilirubin levels and seen by a doctor or nurse within two days of discharge the guidelines say the risk assessment should go beyond visually inspecting the baby for jaundice which can lead to mistakes and consider factors such as early birth and breast feeding some breast fed babies have trouble getting enough milk to eliminate bilirubin a bilirubin test with results interpreted according to a babys age in hours is the "best documented" method of determining risk but isnt required the guidelines say martin hatlie a lawyer who works with ms sheridan says he believes the aap guidelines indicate a fear of liability a plain recommendation for universal testing could hurt doctors in court if they failed to follow it and a baby ended up with brain damage says mr hatlie who heads a chicago company that advises hospitals on patient safety dr maisels who helped write the guidelines and is chairman of pediatrics at william beaumont hospital in royal oak mich says "nothing in these guidelines is based on the potential for malpractice or liability " the aap says there is no published research showing that blanket bilirubin testing would prevent kernicterus it also notes the potential downside added costs and unnecessary treatment for many babies labeled "at risk" who would never develop the dangerous condition also some mothers might unnecessarily avoid breast feeding and give up its health benefits dr newman the co author of the paper and a professor of epidemiology and pediatrics at university of california san francisco says "heartbreaking" anecdotes like ms sheridans shouldnt be allowed to trump the evidence "the difficult thing is to keep some perspective " he said "of the various things mothers should be paying attention to how big a deal is this one " dr maisels worries about fostering "bilirubin neurosis" in parents but at his own hospital he directs nurses to test every newborn every night for high bilirubin using a handheld noninvasive skin testing device dr maisels says his hospital has received research grants of around &# from konica minolta holdings inc which makes the device his hospital uses and more than &# in research and travel funds from the devices u s marketer another bilirubin testing device maker respironics inc contributed &# to help a public relations firm in distributing the kernicterus prevention campaign materials while the academy remains part of the kernicterus prevention campaign in name it has effectively dropped out of it in early the aaps then president eileen ouellette sent a letter to the cdc saying some of the proposed campaign materials were "alarmist" and the academy would encourage its members not to display them the academy is pursuing its own educational effort that includes information on jaundice and other issues new parents should know about in october the u s department of health and human services approved ms sheridans campaign materials paid for under a &# grant from the cdc for several kernicterus related projects the materials include a minute video in which parents are urged seven times to ask their doctor about a bilirubin test just before christmas ms sheridan traveled with cal mackenzie and a health aide to washington there she met duane alexander director of the national institute of child health and human development part of the federal governments national institutes of health dr alexander a pediatrician and aap member said he doesnt understand why the academy has "blocked" ms sheridans efforts "there are some things that need to be known whether they are alarming or not " he said over a room service dinner of calamari and fries cal described a new instant message advice column he has created with josh an online buddy with cerebral palsy smaller than his younger sister cal is the family tech support specialist and says he wants to be a "robot scientist" someday in the hotel room cal began to flail and accidentally knocked over his water his aide rushed to mop up cal will be in march "when he gets into adolescence and sees his friends with drivers licenses and girlfriends that will be one of the toughest times for me as a mom " says ms sheridan "i want cal to be loved and experience a companion and maybe a family in his future but thats not a guarantee " one night she says cal told her "when i grow up i want to be the best daddy in the world but if i have a baby im afraid ill drop it "
