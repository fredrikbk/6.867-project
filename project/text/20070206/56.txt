how to stand out in a job fair crowd college students face daunting challenges during their academic careers tough courses heavy workloads and the pressure to find time for a social schedule but attending job fairs a rite of passage for many upper classmen presents its own set of demands bob roth author of the book "the realities of success during and after college " calls the whole process of recruiting on college campuses a "negative process" because "employers are not trying to figure out how to screen you in " instead he says "they are looking for things that will screen you out so they can interview those who still remain on the list " with limited space on a recruiters roster students need to find ways to stand out from their peers "its all about preparation and passion " says mark mehler a principal at careerxroads a recruiting technology consulting firm in kendall park n j "your expression your handshake your dress your resume can make you a success or failure in seconds " to showcase your passion for a position mr mehler says students should be aggressive and ask questions "it may seem very basic but you walk up to the recruiter with a smile shake hands strongly look the recruiter in the eye " he says talk about what youve learned in your research about the company and why you really want to work there ask "how do we make this happen " he says mr roth agrees that preparation is essential and he says it should start much earlier than many students think "the senior year job search begins in your freshman year " he says when students need to start building networks and identifying potential employers students should also be aware that the types of companies a job fair will attract can vary from college to college "a school usually has a positive reputation in three or four subject areas even though they may offer or more majors " mr roth says "company recruiters gravitate to the colleges with good reputations in their particular area of interest to get ready for a job fair begin by finding out what companies will be there "understand what their mission is and what theyre looking for " says mr mehler one way to stand out "through your alumni network social network peers friends parents cat dog canary find someone you know that works in that company " that way he says "when you approach the booth and shake hands you can drop the name of the friend along with your resume which gets you an instant introduction and separates you from the pack " marie artim assistant vice president of recruiting for enterprise rent a car has been to hundreds of college career fairs "you see a big difference in the students who are confident and ready to talk about themselves " she says signing up for mock interviews at the career center and joining campus groups that offer public speaking opportunities can help you prepare to explain your skills mr mehler suggests that students have a friend videotape them interviewing "it shows what youre doing right and definitely what youre doing wrong " he says "take the tape to a career counselor and have them review it with you " he adds job fairs may be a convenient way to meet with a variety of employers in one place and within a few hours but they can be a discouraging experience jeff boyd who attended a job fair last spring before his graduation in may from purdue university in indiana says he spent most of his time standing in line to hand resumes to recruiters mr boyd who majored in aerospace engineering did get several interviews from the job fair but "not as many as i would have liked " he says he has had more success searching online and getting in touch with contacts at companies about specific job opportunities shannon thompson a freshman political science major at the university of pittsburgh attended her first job fair last week she says she found it useful because she wasnt completely certain of the type of internship or job she was looking to find "i was expecting to perhaps collect some brochures and free pencils and then leave " she says "however i was able to talk personally with a representative at each individual company " changing federal regulations about what constitutes a job applicant mean that some recruiters wont accept paper resumes at a job fair instead referring students to a web site this doesnt mean the recruiter isnt interested ms artim of enterprise says she advises students ask for a business card or a contact name and follow up with an email or phone call just "let your new contact know youre applying online " she says perhaps the best thing students can do in their quests for jobs is to stay positive keep searching and be ready and willing to do the homework required "you have to have leads a month active to get interviews to get an offer " mr mehler notes "if you get the interviews that means your resume is working if you dont it means your resume needs work if you get to the finals in the but dont get the job the candle has gone out you havent sold yourself you dont have the passion "
