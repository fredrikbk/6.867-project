new data prompt rethinking of benefits of ovary removal every year an estimated healthy women undergo a surgical procedure to lower their risk for a rare cancer but new research shows it actually increases their risk of dying from other causes the operation is for the removal of a womans ovaries called a prophylactic oophorectomy which is often recommended to women undergoing a hysterectomy the procedure is commonly recommended to women as a way to eliminate risk for ovarian cancer once child bearing is over but research shows that a woman is more likely to live longer if her ovaries are left in and taking them out boosts her risk of dying from a heart attack or hip fracture two recent papers published in two major medical journals examined the long term risks and benefits of removing a womans ovaries a report last fall in the lancet by mayo clinic researchers found that removing ovaries before the age of raises a womans risk of dying during the next years by if she doesnt use hormone replacement drugs an earlier study in obstetrics &amp gynecology showed that removing a womans ovaries later in life which is the more common practice still increases her risk of premature death in that study ovarian removal before the age of increased a womans overall risk of death before the age of by whats surprising about the data is that it directly contradicts the widely held belief in the medical community that removing a womans ovaries typically will prolong her life "we were all shocked when we saw the data showing that there was such an advantage to leaving her ovaries in for long term health " says william h parker clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at university of california los angeles school of medicine and the lead author of the obstetrics study to be sure the data arent conclusive both reports are based on observational studies which means the women werent randomized to different treatment groups and other factors may be influencing the results in the mayo clinic study young women who had ovaries removed but then took estrogen drugs were just as healthy as women who kept their ovaries but doctors say many women are frightened about the risk of hormone drugs and often dont take them after losing their ovaries most doctors practicing today were taught that the ovaries dont serve any real purpose after menopause if a woman is going to undergo a hysterectomy surgical removal of her uterus anyway doctors typically advise women to go ahead and have their ovaries removed as well while there is no question that the procedure eliminates ovarian cancer risk the fact is most women are at extremely low risk for the disease ovarian cancer accounts for of female cancer deaths but the issue of ovarian cancer is emotionally charged because there is no way to screen for it and its usually fatal because it is often detected at its late stages the problem is that removing a womans ovaries to prevent ovarian cancer appears to take a toll on other parts of her body the ovaries after menopause still produce androgens that the body converts to estrogen the continuing hormone production of post menopausal ovaries not only affects a womans sex drive and mood but it also appears to offer added protection to her bones and heart based on the obstetrics &amp gynecology report the benefit of keeping the ovaries far exceeds the risk the researchers calculated the risks and benefits among women between the ages of and who kept their ovaries compared with a similar group of women who opted to have their ovaries removed by the time they reach an additional women in the no ovary group will have died of heart attacks and another will have died from hip fracture compared with women who keep their ovaries however only women in the no ovary group would be saved from ovarian cancer women with a strong family history of ovarian cancer obviously have more to gain from ovary removal than women with a strong family history of heart disease or osteoporosis dr parker says the study isnt perfect but it should at least prompt doctors to have a more meaningful discussion with patients about the full risks and benefits involved in removing healthy ovaries from a womans body "this is at least a subject for conversation between patient and doctor " says dr parker "but that conversation often does not happen " email healthjournal wsj com
