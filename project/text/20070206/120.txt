the daily fix just won the super bowl were going to indianapolis hey indianapolis colts you just won the super bowl so what are you going to do now going to disney world in time maybe first though the colts headed home to indianapolis for a frozen celebration thousands of fans braved the elements for a parade that wound up rolling two hours late after rumors it had been canceled followed by a rally in the comfort of the rca dome if the first part of this celebration sounds horrid consider that the colts just won the super bowl the fix is betting absolutely no one in indianapolis minded in the indianapolis star bob kravitz says peyton mannings relatively quiet celebration sunday night and monday spoke volumes "when manning lifted that vince lombardi trophy we suspected he would be lifting something far weightier a lingering doubt perhaps or maybe the growing weight of unfulfilled expectations " mr kravitz writes "but there was none of that no monkey off my back steve young vintage histrionics he reacted like a guy who expects to get there again and again and maybe again even the next morning when manning seemed a little giddier with sleeplessness he was not jumping up and down talking about his own validation but reveling in the accomplishments of his team good for him what is it team president bill polian likes to say dont let others define you its one of the smartest things he says if manning had carried on sunday night and danced no not the tango it would have been tantamount to acknowledging the definition others had placed on him " in the chicago tribune rick morrissey opts for a bell the cat column when considering the defeated bears "you could have been a time zone and four states away and still have known sunday night what the reaction was going to be in chicago " he writes "you could have been in a galaxy far far away and known it the bears need a new quarterback so it might come as a surprise to some of you that the person who has been accused of being virulently anti rex that would be me a k a spawn of satan would have this reaction stay the course stick with grossman have a little faith hes going to get better provided hes willing to make some changes " an online poll on the tribunes site saw mr grossman win the backing of of voters not an impressive mandate perhaps but better than you might expect after sunday nights carnival of interceptions of course the changes mr morrissey suggests are pretty big starting with mr grossmans need to "admit what he is he is a wildly average quarterback in that his ups and downs add up to mediocre start there level him out all it would have taken sunday was for grossman to have been a caretaker quarterback sunday and the bears would have had a chance to beat the colts a caretaker quarterback doesnt fumble snaps a caretaker quarterback does not throw a risky foolish pass with his team down five points in the fourth quarter a caretaker quarterback does not have five interceptions returned for touchdowns in one season its going to take everything that grossman has to turn himself into a quarterback who is content to make a few plays a game " in the chicago sun times carol slezak offers five reasons why the bears will improve beginning with the head coach "lovie smith has improved each year on the job and he will continue to improve at the risk of pouring vinegar in your wounds ask yourself how long it took tony dungy to win his first super bowl too soon then ask yourself how long it took bill cowher to win his first super bowl " meanwhile more proof that there are no elevated expectations for athletes in new york nope none at all the back page of the new york daily news this morning a shot of giants qb eli manning and the headline super pressure a victorious peyton manning predicted multiple super bowls for his younger sibling leaving the daily newss gary myers to write that "at this point the giants would be thrilled with just one or perhaps something as simple as a playoff victory when you come from the nfls first family of quarterbacks and one of them just raised the vince lombardi trophy and the pete rozelle mvp trophy on the same night then its up to the little brother to match it or forever be the little brother " eli may still be learning his qb trade but he seems to get the gotham media as this bit from mr myers shows "for his part eli manning was oddly uncooperative sunday night when asked about his brothers accomplishment perhaps already anticipating the comparisons he offered only im not talking about him its his night i congratulated him it was a good game lets leave it at that " speaking of winners the fix welcomes five readers to the now somewhat overcrowded but still posh skybox of champions actually by now were populating the overcrowded but still posh annex to the soc but lets not split hairs leading the charge in the super bowl contest was mike costa with points also earning enshrinement were readers brett lofton robert mullarkey ward cullum and william krieger congratulations all check out carls recap of the contest here what does tennis need to force its way back into casual fans consciousness the legendary australian player rod laver tells bill dwyre of the los angeles times that a player needs to do something only five players have done before a feat laver accomplished twice and laver knows just the guy to do it "laver not only likes roger federer but says the swiss player is likely to do something this year that hasnt been done in mens tennis since when well laver did it " mr dwyre writes "matter of fact laver is rooting for it he knows that just as horse racing needed barbaro tennis now needs roger federer it needs him to deliver his sports triple crown a grand slam and with it some of the fans whose attention has wandered elsewhere " a grand slam is winning singles titles at the australian open french open wimbledon and the u s open in the same calendar year laver pulled off the trick in and in as did don budge in on the womens side maureen connelly margaret smith court and steffi graf are grand slammers "thats a big load but laver thinks federer has the shoulders " mr dwyre writes "also the game and the mind federer is one fourth there so is serena williams on the womens side but her consistency is harder to track this feels like the year for federer and the french open is his highest hurdle if he gets over that tennis will begin to reach once again the fan who went away once john mcenroe stopped throwing rackets and fits and pete sampras stopped serving mph down the middle and following it in " tiger woods wont be playing the at&amp t national pro am at pebble beach when it kicks off thursday and the san francisco chronicles gwen knapp says she understands well to a point "we get it " she writes "big fusses combined with bad weather have forced a lot of us to quit going back home every thanksgiving no offense taken but next year we want to see you youre going to be a dad if that doesnt call for a visit to the extended family i dont know what does northern california you must know has seen itself as home to tiger woods for years we realize that you spent your childhood in the southern half of the state but those years really amounted to an incubation period you were at stanford when you turned pro and you got your first u s open win at pebble beyond that there appears to be a strong emotional bond and we dont think its one sided if anyone wants to quibble lets go through the scrapbook shall we " found a good column from the
