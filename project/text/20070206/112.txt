the bush budget line items a look inside the details of the budget request for fiscal education plan may upset both teens and congress the education department already requires states to give reading and math tests to students at least once during their high school careers the presidents budget would add two more years of testing in both subjects and possibly another test of each students readiness for college teens wont like that but congress may like it even less as part of the lead up to this years congressional review of his no child left behind school overhaul plan mr bush is proposing &# million to expand high school testing no child left behind is slowly leveraging improvements in elementary and middle schools in part because new state tests have given educators the data to zero in on low performing schools and students but administration efforts to improve the high schools have faltered and colleges and employers are complaining that graduates lack basic academic skills the college readiness test would link a states curriculum with college entrance requirements and could be part of the annual reading and math tests or a stand alone exam millions of teens already take the sat and act college entrance exams but an education department spokesman says those probably wouldnt pass administration muster as a readiness exam because they arent linked to state curricula and dont set a passing grade about half the states also require teens to pass an exam to graduate but many of those are criticized as being too easy to be a useful measure of ability loading more tests on students would be hugely unpopular especially with politicians already feeling the heat from voters who complain that too much time already is spent on test preparation testing high schoolers also is notoriously complicated teens feel little motivation to do well on standardized tests if there are no penalties for failure but setting a high passing score and denying a diploma to teens who dont do well hits minority students particularly hard and could lead to higher drop out rates june kronholz more funding is sought for efforts to fight aids while many social programs can expect to see their budgets curbed if the president gets his way mr bush softened the blow by asking congress for a substantial increase in funding to fight the global aids pandemic an area where he is likely to find common ground with the new democratic majority mr bush is seeking &# billion for international aids programs including life extending antiretroviral drugs for africa if congress complies and also matches his &# billion request for the current fiscal year the president will have gone well beyond his promises and provided a total of &# billion in global aids relief over five

behind on budget requests for his signature millennium challenge foreign aid program when mr bush initially announced the program during his first term he promised to provide &# billion a year in grants for developing countries that have honest democratic market oriented leadership instead the president is asking congress for &# billion for fiscal and the millennium challenge corp s chief executive john danilovich warns that he will have to reject eligible countries if congress doesnt come through with the &# billion the president asked for "at a lower level of funding mcc will need to turn away some countries that have developed proposals designed to assist the poor such as microfinance programs that help women as well as water irrigation and transportation systems that enable farmers to participate in the local economy and get their products to market more efficiently " mr danilovich said in a statement michael m phillips statistical agencies may see needed boost to capabilities in an effort to enhance the governments data gathering and number crunching abilities president bush wants to raise the budgets of statistical agencies by at least &# million the biggest winner would be the census bureau which would get &# million in new funds to prepare for the census the agency would also get more money to beef up the american community survey which provides

changes n measure that would be of great interest to businesses when considering where to incorporate the bureau of economic analysis is slated for a modest &# million increase a portion of which would go toward measuring the impact of research and development on economic growth many economists have clamored for this measure which could help them figure out why the economy tends to expand
