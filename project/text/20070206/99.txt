politics &amp economics opening bid on health care edwardss plan for universal coverage to be matched by rivals washington john edwardss call for universal health care marks the opening volley in two debates facing democrats running for president in how to provide health coverage to some million uninsured people and what to do about president bushs tax cuts many of the partys white house hopefuls including sens hillary clinton d n y and barack obama d ill say extending coverage to all the uninsured is a priority their focus on relatively sweeping health care proposals matches escalating concern among voters and employers about medical costs and coverage so far mr edwards has provided the most detail about how he would accomplish this with the release yesterday of a plan requiring the government employers and individuals to contribute to the cost of extending coverage to the uninsured the former north carolina senator and vice presidential nominee also has stated that tax increases for upper income people would be needed to fund his plan which aims to provide universal coverage by specifically he has proposed raising taxes for households with incomes of more than &# that would essentially repeal some of the tax cuts shepherded by mr bush mr edwards also would fund some of his health care proposals by reducing the "tax gap " the amount of revenue the government is owed but doesnt collect "yes well have to raise taxes " mr edwards said sunday on nbcs "meet the press " he said it is "the only way you can pay for a health care plan" estimated to cost the government &# billion to &# billion a year it remains to be seen whether voters will accept mr edwardss vision of "shared responsibility " in which employers would have to help fund their workers coverage and individuals would be required to purchase insurance often with the help of new tax credits aimed at low income and middle class people medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program or schip would be expanded to cover more children and low income parents new regional "health markets" would offer comprehensive health insurance plans to anyone who doesnt get insurance through their jobs or a government program some democrats expressed surprise at the bluntness of mr edwardss remarks in favor of tax increases but many health policy experts believe higher taxes would be needed to fund any serious attempt at universal coverage mr edwards "realizes how unpopular anyone who says that can be " said henry simmons president of the national coalition on health care a group of employers labor unions and health care providers advocating for universal coverage "i suspect hes going to take a lot of time explaining that health care is one area where you have to invest " patrick toomey president of the republican antitax group club for growth said mr edwardss plan wouldnt sit well with most voters who he said "already think taxes are too high " the idea is "very good news for the republican candidate whoever that may be " many questions remain about mr edwardss plan in particular how much the various stakeholders would have to contribute and what the timing of the changes would be mr edwardss proposal assumes that the bush tax cuts most of which are set to expire in would be extended by congress even for the wealthiest recipients repealing the breaks for people earning more than &# would supply about &# billion a year while reducing the "tax gap" would provide another &# billion or so a year however extending the tax cuts for the people at the top of the income scale is less likely with democrats in control of congress if the tax breaks arent there to repeal mr edwards would ostensibly have to look for another funding source the other presidential candidates have commented broadly on how they would tackle the problem of the uninsured but havent laid out their specific plans or how they would fund them mr obama for example has said he would provide universal coverage by and plans to put forward more details in coming weeks in a health focused speech last month he questioned the profits made by drug makers and insurance companies and suggested that reducing paperwork and making sure all eligible children enroll in existing government programs would improve the current system "washington no longer has an excuse for caution " mr obama said "leaders no longer have a reason to be timid " mrs clinton knows better than most the political pitfalls of major health care proposals after she and her husband tried to move broad overhauls in the s but failed she recently has backed improvements in health information technology and covering all uninsured children through schip but hasnt said how she would reach the bulk of the uninsured during an appearance in davenport iowa last week a man told her that he had voted for her husband years ago largely on his promise for universal health care "with all due respect " he said "i would like to know specifically" how mrs clinton intends to provide the coverage "and how you intend to fund that " mrs clinton said it was a "fair question" but rather than giving a specific answer she said she wants to work toward a consensus she asked for a show of hands from the audience in reaction to a few methods of expanding health insurance a single payer government run system got the most hands and it was the one mrs clinton seemed to favor but she cautioned imagine the ads that would spring up in opposition to such a plan in her last attempt at health reform ads starring an older couple harry and louise suggested that the government would dictate which doctors and treatments people could get in a single payer plan "all of a sudden people get real nervous " mrs clinton said a solution has to "be politically feasible because at the end of the day weve got to get it through the congress " she said "im not ready to be specific " she went on "because i want to hear from people this time were going to build the consensus first so that when the harry and louise ad comes on youll say turn that off " jackie calmes contributed to this article
