pension act may pique interest in iras legislation makes it easier and more palatable to save in individual retirement accounts this could be a banner year for individual retirement accounts that is because the pension protection act of has made it easier and more compelling to save in an ira the legislation gives investors the opportunity in to convert typical iras into roth iras whose withdrawals are tax free without the current income limitations on roth iras it also makes permanent the higher contribution limits currently in place on typical iras and for the first time internal revenue service tax refunds can be sent directly to as many as three accounts including your ira this year "it naturally happens this time of year that people get interested in iras but the pension legislation certainly has piqued peoples interest " says catherine gordon a principal at vanguard group contributions to an ira for can be made until tax day which this year is april even if you file for an extension about &# trillion is invested in iras according to the investment company institute a mutual fund trade group nearly half of those assets are rollovers from sources such as k plans however a survey released last month by fidelity investments found that people had a lot of misconceptions about iras nearly half of those without an account thought they couldnt open an ira without making the maximum annual dollar contribution which is &# this year those and older can invest an additional &# absent the pension act those limits would have fallen to &# annually after the fidelity survey also found that consumers were confused about whether they could have both an ira and a k account "everybody can contribute to a traditional ira " says stuart ritter a financial adviser at t rowe price group inc in baltimore "the question is the deductibility" of the contribution in a typical ira the contribution is deductible if neither you nor your spouse participates in an employer sponsored retirement plan regardless of your income if you and your spouse participate in such a plan your contribution is fully deductible if your household adjusted gross income is less than &# for a family or &# for an individual it is partially deductible for incomes of &# to &# for a family or &# to &# for an individual if you are married and only one of you is covered by an employer plan the spouse who isnt covered may make a fully deductible ira contribution if family income is &# or less says alan kahn an estate and retirement planner in syosset n y different income limits apply to married couples filing separate returns another option is a roth ira both types of ira grow tax free however investors pay taxes when they withdraw money from a typical ira in a roth ira contributions arent deductible but earnings and distributions are free of federal tax if the investor is at least and the account was held for at least five years the roth ira is available to single tax filers earning as much as &# in or joint filers earning as much as &# in above those amounts the amount you can contribute is phased out until it hits zero at &# for single filers or &# for joint filers another big difference between the two types of accounts is that individuals with typical iras must start taking distributions at while there is no age at which a roth ira investor must begin taking distributions that is one reason the roth could be a good choice for investors who dont expect to need the money and who want to leave it to their heirs another reason to go with the roth is if you are young and expect your income and tax bracket to increase says richard rosso a consultant in houston for financial services firm charles schwab corp mr ritter of t rowe price recommends that people with a k available at work should first invest in that vehicle at least to the level of any company match then "you should consider a roth ira contribution because in many circumstances contributing to a roth will give you more spending in retirement than making a pretax k contribution " another advantage of investing in an ira is that you typically get more investment choices than in a k plan says john ragnoni a fidelity senior vice president fidelity and other companies allow investors to select among a full range of stock and fund investments for their iras compared to a dozen or so options available in many k plans in as a result of the pension legislation all investors will have the option to convert existing ira accounts into roth ira accounts no matter what their income people converting must pay income taxes on any contributions that were earlier made to the typical ira and deducted taxes also must be paid on any investment gains earned in the usual ira that might require some detailed calculations so plan ahead individuals will have two years to pay taxes resulting from the conversion it could be worth converting if you expect your tax rate to be the same or higher when the money is ultimately withdrawn the conversion would result in a tax bill when you move funds into the roth ira but investors could avoid future federal taxes on any subsequent roth ira earnings and withdrawals you do not need to convert the entire amount in the typical ira
