kodaks strategy for first printer cheaper cartridges in a move that could shake up the &# billion a year ink oligopoly eastman kodak co today plans to unveil its long awaited inkjet printer with ink cartridges priced far less than its competitors printer makers led by hewlett packard co have long used the razor and blade pricing model in which the hardware is sold for little or no profit they derive most of their profits from ink which is priced at more per ounce than perfume or caviar indeed annual sales of inkjet printers and multifunction devices world wide are less than one quarter the annual sales of consumable ink and paper kodak which is led by several veterans of h ps printer group plans to modify that model by making more money from hardware and accepting lower profits from the ink it says it will use a combination of new technology and alternative pricing to slash ink prices by about per page today in new york it plans to unveil three new inkjet based multifunction devices that print scan and copy documents web pages and photos the printers primarily intended for home rather than business use will be priced at &# to &# depending on whether they have color displays and slots for camera memory cards analysts said the prices are each about &# more than comparable multifunction devices now on the market each of the kodak printers will use a &# black ink cartridge and a &# color ink cartridge about half the prevailing ink prices kodak says consumers who buy high volume paper packages will be able to print inch by inch snapshots for as little as cents apiece compared with cents on typical home printers and well under common retail store prices of cents each some industry watchers who have been briefed on the products think kodaks strategy spells trouble for inkjet printer makers especially second tier vendors like epson a unit of seiko epson corp and lexmark international inc "this will be the year the razor and blade model breaks " says charles lecompte president of lyra research a newton mass market research firm he says kodaks low price strategy for ink is "such a dramatic message that someone will have to respond " the success of cartridge refill companies which cater to customers seeking cheaper ink rather than original cartridges and have grabbed about of the world wide ink market shows that consumers are likely to welcome kodaks approach he says "this is going to change the industry " predicts kodaks philip j faraci head of its digital imaging consumer group mr faraci who was once senior vice president for inkjet systems at h p says "for people who print a lot were offering a really great solution " mr faraci says kodak expects the lower price ink to be especially appealing to the top of people who print at home and buy more than the average customers cartridges per year not everyone is convinced that kodaks move will have much impact on the broad market ron glaz an analyst with market researcher idc in framingham mass says kodak will be successful in the niche of "people who want to print a lot of photos " because the companys name is associated with photography but it is only in that segment that it will "put a lot of pressure on h p and epson " karl schwenkmeyer vice president of marketing inkjet systems at h p predicts that consumers will stay with h p while ink price is an issue he says other factors such as ease of use and speed of printing are also important to buyers he says that h ps market share grew to in last years third quarter and that its ability to continue to spend more than &# billion a year on printer research and development is resulting in continuous improvement in inkjet printers he says that while photo printing is an important segment of the market close to of pages printed are other types of documents lexmark declined to comment kodaks mr faraci says that while the company expects photo printing to be a key motivator for people to buy its printers it designed the devices for general purpose home and small office printing the devices can print and copy up to pages a minute in black and white and in color and the high end model includes a fax machine he says kodaks core market is families where both parents and children are using computers kodak says its research shows that over of all families restrict their childrens printing because of the cost of ink mr faraci says that years ago most consumers didnt think about the cost of ink and looked primarily at the cost of a printer when purchasing but today kodaks research shows that lower price print cartridges are the single most cited feature that consumers are looking for "if were wildly successful we might get of the market over the course of the year " mr faraci predicts he says his goal is to have kodak printers producing of the inkjet pages printed in kodak expects to start selling the new printers in march through electronics retail chain best buy co in an exclusive retailing deal that lasts three months success of the inkjet printers is crucial to kodaks future as film photography fades away kodak has undertaken a wrenching restructuring over the past three years taking billions of dollars in losses and laying off nearly people as it cut costs in the face of plunging revenue from film and photo finishing its digital cameras are among the top three best sellers in the u s but they are consumer electronics items with low profit margins and tough competition kodak chief executive antonio perez who headed h ps inkjet printer business as an executive there in the s proclaimed two years ago that kodak would enter the inkjet market the main medium for consumer printing of digital photos if the inkjet printers prove popular they could provide the kind of high margin recurring revenue that film used to give kodak kodaks printers incorporate innovative nanotechnology in the ink and print heads squirting droplets that are only a few atoms in size from tiny nozzles one benefit to kodak of having such small nozzles on the print heads is that consumers may be reluctant to refill the cartridges with ink from other providers for fear of clogging the holes unlike most rivals kodak uses pigments rather than dyes in its ink which makes prints more resistant to fading kodak was able to hold down the cost of its cartridges by keeping all of the electronics in the printer unlike rivals who include some electronics in the cartridges
