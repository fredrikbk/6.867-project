into his ceo tenure mr zetsche is still struggling with other issues at the worlds fifth biggest auto maker "i hope i can say im never looking back and criticizing former decisions and activities but

zetsche has eliminated thousands of white collar jobs and is seeking other deep cuts from the number of different door handles on a single mercedes model to the size of its management board nine members now compared with under mr schrempp but the numerous problems are testing mr zetsches determination to wear multiple hats unlike mr schrempp who delegated much of the day to day work of running daimlerchrysler to aides as he plotted strategy and cut deals mr zetsche has split his time between being the companys ceo and leading its premium mercedes car division out of a slump caused by quality problems and losses at its smart small car unit with mercedes again posting big profits and chrysler in a downturn some analysts question mr zetsches decision to do two jobs "a ceo of a company this size should spend his time in a more balanced way on each of the divisions " says arndt ellinghorst of dresdner kleinwort wasserstein in frankfurt he adds that the companys multiple legal and political problems "obviously" detract from its effort to focus on chrysler and mercedes an engineer by training mr zetsche shows no intention of ceding his mercedes post "you can be a better ceo

is chrysler praised for rescuing the division when he was its president from until mr zetsche is seen by some as bearing part of the blame for its latest slide critics note the inventory buildup that saddled chrysler with cars its dealers didnt want began when he was still at the divisions headquarters similarly they say chryslers strategy of developing more large suvs which left the company vulnerable when gasoline prices rose also took shape on his watch there in september daimlerchrysler forecast a third quarter loss for chrysler that was roughly double what it had forecast about two months before the rapid deterioration in chryslers outlook which the company blamed partly on "continuing high fuel prices and a stronger shift in demand toward smaller vehicles" stunned investors mr zetsche has acknowledged it was "absolutely unacceptable" for the company to raise its third quarter loss estimate by more than double from just seven weeks earlier but he also has expressed optimism that the division will get back on track once it purges its system of the unsold inventory and refocuses on new models such as the hot selling dodge caliber mini wagon to help chrysler managers mr zetsche has dispatched mercedes executives from germany to help devise a restructuring neal e boudette in detroit contributed to this article
