politics &amp economics giuliani run poses conundrum washington former new york mayor rudy giuliani filed paperwork yesterday that virtually assures he will seek the republican presidential nomination begging a question can the moderate who leads in many early polls convince his own party that he deserves the job abandoning months of coyness in which he refused to declare a definitive candidacy even as he acted like a candidate mr giulianis filing with the federal election commission essentially puts him on equal footing with arizona sen john mccain and former massachusetts gov mitt romney as the three major declared candidates for the republican nomination all three men have national organizations and early name recognition all three men for different reasons are considered vulnerable to challenge particularly from the more conservative wing of the republican party but perhaps no candidate faces more trouble in gaining the nomination than mr giuliani which is ironic given his early lead in many polls his long shot status in the nomination sweepstakes is based on his well known moderate stances on litmus test social issues such positions along with his two divorces wont enamor him to social conservatives who have maintained firm control of the partys nominating levers for decades messrs mccain and romney have had their own run ins with the conservative wing of the party as well but none quite as significant as that awaiting mr giuliani these are problems that mr giulianis own campaign has publicly acknowledged much to its own embarrassment when a copy of its strategic political plan recently was leaked to the press the plan noted that a moderate republican who is viewed as liberal on abortion rights gay rights and gun control is likely to have trouble with voters in the republican primary indeed a giuliani nomination would suggest a sea change has taken place within the republican party where successful nominees traditionally have had to maintain allegiance to certain core social beliefs demanding that allegiance isnt something that powerful conservatives such as tony perkins at the family research council will likely concede without a fight "i dont see anyone getting the republican nomination who is not pro life and a staunch defender of traditional marriage " mr perkins said in a recent interview "we may not be a large enough group to elect a president but social conservatives can keep someone from getting the nomination " does a two time mayor have a shot at redefining the rules scott reed a washington republican who managed bob doles presidential campaign said he believes it possible mr giuliani starts with a measure of star power which serves any politician well he also comes to the scene in the wake of a bruising election for republicans who saw democrats sweep not only the house but also take the senate and governors offices as well the question mr reed said will be what mr giuliani does with his popularity can he step up from mayor to national political figure retaining the image of steadiness that he cultivated in the wake of the september attacks while successfully fending off any questions that might arise about his stewardship of the nations largest city "a giuliani candidacy is a chance to turn the whole nominating process on its head for the first time in years " said mr reed who added that he made an early contribution to the mayors campaign but hasnt decided to back any candidate exclusively like other candidates mr giuliani has yet to see whether his record will hold up to the scrutiny of a national political campaign as a former prosecutor and a mayor whose dirt caked image practically personified the response mr giuliani is likely to face relentless questioning from reporters and political rivals seeking to deconstruct his heroic legend potential embarrassments include his scandal plagued police chief and former business partner bernard kerik who pleaded guilty last year to improperly accepting gifts from a construction firm with mob ties mr giuliani also may face questions about his lobbying and consulting firm giuliani partners llp and his law firm bracewell &amp giuliani which have represented a number of business interests including gambling and energy companies that may not prove popular with voters but mr reed says mr giuliani has the potential to change the race even if he doesnt win the nomination simply by taking a top share of the media spotlight mr giuliani "sucks the air out of the room " mr reed said making second tier candidates compete for notice mr giulianis early test is likely to come in late march when the first campaign finance reports are due from presidential candidates getting out of the blocks later than either mr mccain or mr romney and currently operating with a thinner national staff than either man mr giuliani will have to work to maintain a campaign war chest that is on par with the front runners
