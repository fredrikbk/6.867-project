the bush budget bush proposes change in how faa is funded president bush told congress he wants to scrap the passenger ticket taxes used to help fund the air traffic control system and replace them with user fees for commercial airlines the result however will be some air travelers commercial airlines and corporate jet owners are likely to end up paying more to fly to pay for a new generation of traffic control technology if approved the proposed changes would take effect in and mark a major shift in how the federal aviation administration is funded fees would be assessed for flights depending on how much traffic controllers are used to guide them through the skies it isnt yet clear if these fees would show up on tickets the current system uses a mixture of ticket taxes fuel taxes and other add ons to pay for air traffic control business jets represent more than of all flights but they pay just of those faa fees airlines which represent some two thirds of flights but pay more than of the fees have long complained they are overpaying they see this proposal as a victory of sorts "whether there are three or passengers on an aircraft to an air traffic controller a blip is a blip on the radar screen " said james c may president of the air transport association the leading airline trade group a major obstacle to getting the plan off the ground though is that the chairman of the house transportation and infrastructure committee rep jim oberstar d minn has argued that the current tax system doesnt need changing "the proposal is pretty sketchy at this point " said mr oberstars spokesman jim berard "until they can provide convincing evidence to change the system then he isnt going to change the system " there are commercial airplanes and approximately corporate aircraft registered in the u s according to the faa while the number of corporate aircraft is higher commercial jets are used much more frequently and often fly longer distances which adds to the workload of air traffic controllers president bush says the new system will better assess costs for using the air traffic control system under the budget proposal corporate jets and perhaps private aircraft would still fund the faa through fuel taxes albeit higher ones that worries corporate fliers "we will be in overdrive" to lobby against the proposal said steve brown senior vice president of operations for the national business aviation association a washington based lobbying group "we will contact all our members and you name it we will be out there " faa administrator marion blakey demurred on details such as how much more in user fees would be generated to pay for the system she said that more details would come "as early as next week" when the bush administration plans to submit its plans for the reauthorization of faa funding due to expire later this year next week the transportation department is likely to spell out how the user fee system would work whether it would count the number of planes in the sky how long they stay in the air or landings and takeoffs what is clear though is that these proposed changes side with public commercial airliners rather than private corporate jets fliers in their debate over which is the fairer way to pay for use of the air traffic control system commercial airliners pay through ticket taxes the ones that bush proposes to eliminate and to a lesser extent fuel taxes corporate fliers pay higher fuel taxes than commercial airliners for use of the system but because corporate jets dont have ticket paying passengers they arent subject to that tax ms blakey said that there would be an increase in the fuel tax under the proposed system "i think we will see increase on the fuel tax i am talking about shifting of costs not increasing of costs" overall
