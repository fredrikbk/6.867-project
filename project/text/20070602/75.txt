skyscraper prices might start returning to earth after an unprecedented boom that saw values of skyscrapers and other commercial real estate properties double and even triple in price there are signs that investors and lenders are turning cautious is the buying frenzy nearing its peak for the better part of two years the commercial real estate market has hummed at a fevered pitch prices for single buildings began popping the &# billion mark as buyers flipped buildings and wracked up huge profits tishman speyer one of the largest landlords in new york recently sold the new york times building in midtown manhattan for &# million three times what it paid in without making any improvements to the building many transactions were done with dazzling speed in new york real estate tycoons harry macklowe and his son billy macklowe agreed in less than two weeks to pay &# billion for eight new york buildings that were "flipped " or quickly sold by blackstone group after the private equity firm bought equity office properties trust for &# billion "we do sweat details but understood the nature of this had to be based pretty much on speed " billy macklowe said at the time driving the boom were low interest rates and easy loan terms similar to the home buying boom that allowed buyers to borrow as much as of the value of the building compared with roughly historically in recent weeks lenders have become worried that prices have gotten so high that buyers wouldnt be able to raise rents high enough to pay off their loans in response the interest rates that buyers have to pay have risen and banks have demanded that buyers put up bigger portions of the purchase price the changing climate is making it difficult for some buyers to line up financing even after putting up millions in nonrefundable deposits despite the tightening prices for buildings are not falling indeed records continue to fall on may the private equity real estate arm of goldman sachs group inc agreed to sell the office portion of madison ave a new york office building to an italian firm gruppo zunino for the highest price per square foot &# ever recorded in the u s for that type of property says douglas harmon senior managing director of eastdil secured who brokered the transaction goldman sachs declined to comment but a person close to the buyer says that the contracted price of &# million is "still being negotiated " and that gruppo zunino must conclude other deals for this one to go through at the root of the buying frenzy was a change in the way investors viewed real estate in the past buying a building was like buying a bond you were purchasing a stream of income for years to come if rents or the value of the building went up that was gravy more recently investors started treating buildings like stocks betting that they could sell them later at significantly higher prices loans were being underwritten based on predictions of future cash flow "it used to be people bought for the current rents and the upside was a surprise " said cedric philipp jr managing director of commercial mortgage backed securities structured finance group for moodys investors service "now they are banking on the upside " for tenants of these buildings that means landlords will keep trying to raise rents which were up an average of at the end of the first quarter compared with last year but in some cities a building boom that has coincided with the buying boom is giving tenants alternatives even as rents in the nations office buildings increased on average for the first quarter of this year office absorption the net gain in occupied space was off compared with the same time last year according to data from reis inc a new york based real estate research firm thats a clue that landlords could have trouble pushing rents substantially higher in the next few quarters in downtown washington sales have been predicated on double digit rent growth in the next two years followed by sustained above average rent growth for several years after that "past experience tells us thats just not realistic " says thomas carr a partner at federal capital partners in washington for example sales have been based on projected rents of &# per square foot even though leases can be still signed today in high quality buildings downtown for &# per square foot and new buildings are going up across the city one reason for the boom has been the growth in the commercial mortgage backed securities market where pools of commercial loans are packaged together and sold as securities on april moodys investor service sent up a warning flare saying that lenders had gotten too aggressive and underwriting standards had become too lax that warning scared investors and forced bankers to raise yields on cmbs offerings to attract investors for example as of may a moderately risky rated baa by moodys commercial mortgage backed bond typically paid a "spread" of percentage points over the relevant borrowing rate for a commercial bank up from about two percentage points a month earlier according to credit suisse group wachovia bank one of the largest commercial real estate lenders had to pay an even larger spread percentage points to sell a recent cmbs offering "we dont make the market we find the market " says bill green managing director for wachovia now though buyers are finding it harder to purchase a building and leverage it up to such high levels for example rfr holding llc the new york based firm headed by contemporary art collector aby rosen and his partner michael fuchs is purchasing a group of buildings in stamford conn from blackstone part of its equity office assets but rfr which had planned to put about &# million in cash into the deal is now reaching out to institutional investors to raise more equity on the &# million purchase "some people are getting hit taking more of a hit than others we are not suffering as others maybe but we have to readjust a little bit " says jason brown president of rfr he says that rfr still intends to close on the deal by the end of june some in the market had questioned the economics of the stamford transaction at &# per square foot the price rfr paid dwarfed the previous record of &# paid for properties in that city on the commuter train lines northeast of new york moreover blackacre capital management a subsidiary of cerberus capital management turned down a slice of the deals debt because it believed the buildings were only worth &# per square foot demand for real estate remains strong among foreign buyers eager to take advantage of the weak dollar and among institutional investors who have roughly &# trillion as much as four years worth of money queued up ready to invest in real estate serena ng
