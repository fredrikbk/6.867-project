the week ahead our take on coming events climate change global debate is just heating up by jeffrey ball suddenly it seems everyone is talking about global warming a big worry for diplomats gathering to discuss the issue this coming week at a meeting in germany of the group of eight leading nations is that their countries may actually have to do something about it deciding how to curb the fossil fuel emissions contributing to global warming is fundamentally about deciding who foots the bill as public pressure to tackle the problem intensifies so does the jostling among big emitters to push the cost onto someone else thats why in washington in the months since democrats took over congress and pledged to force a cut in u s emissions corporate lobbyists have begun debating details of how an emissions constraint should be structured the auto industry is sparring with the utility industry over whether the regulatory hammer should fall on tailpipes or smokestacks the lobbyists tout principles like economic efficiency and economywide fairness but what they really want is to ensure that no one player and above all not their client has to cut its emissions too much the diplomats gathering at the g meeting in heiligendamm germany this coming week will be fighting the same battle but on a broader field early predictions that the meeting might produce a grand agreement on global warming crashed into the reality that europe which embraces caps and the u s which prefers technological incentives remain philosophically divided the meeting is more likely to highlight that difference than resolve it in the lead up to the conference the worlds two biggest global warming emitters the u s and china each announced thursday what they described as a new global warming policy but each countrys new policy sounded like the old one shift the onus for environmental action to the other mega emitter in an announcement widely described as a major policy switch president bush who has opposed calls for global warming caps on the u s largely because developing countries like china dont face them called for talks among the worlds economic powers to establish emission targets but the basics of the bush policy remained the same there should be no binding global caps and whatever global agreement is reached should ensure action by developing countries like china which the current kyoto protocol doesnt do china for its part said it would release a long awaited national plan on global warming but that as before it doesnt intend to take on a hard emissions cap in effect the u s says developing countries like china should pay to help tackle global warming because they are the ones responsible for most of the increase in carbon emissions going forward china says industrialized countries like the u s should pay to help tackle global warming because they are the ones responsible for most of the emissions in the past both are right and both have compelling reasons not to budge its now widely accepted however grudgingly in most boardrooms that the u s is marching toward adopting some sort of emissions cap who the cap hits and how hard is anyones guess a big determinant of how the fight plays out in washington will be how it plays out in places like heiligendamm because the fight against global warming is a zero sum game environmentally it doesnt matter whether global warming emissions are cut in boise idaho or beijing as long as they are cut somewhere economically it matters a lot health glaxo case puts fda in congressional spotlight by anna wilde mathews when california rep henry waxman zeroes in on the potential risk of the diabetes drug avandia in a hearing on wednesday the food and drug administration and maker glaxosmithkline plc will likely have a tough time but looming in the background is a broader question how congress should change the fdas handling of drug safety on may the new england journal of medicine released an analysis by cleveland clinic cardiologist steven nissen linking avandia to a potential risk of heart attacks along with a toughly worded editorial that raised questions about the fdas drug approval process the same day congress publicly unleashed a fusillade of letters signed by lawmakers including mr waxman a democrat and energy and commerce committee chairman john dingell a michigan democrat whose panel handles legislation related to the fda dr nissen is slated to be a witness on wednesday as is bruce psaty a professor at the university of washington who co wrote the editorial fda commissioner andrew von eschenbach and a glaxo official also are expected to testify as is john buse a diabetes expert who once raised heart safety questions about avandia dr buse recently said he isnt sure if the concerns he had years ago are valid in a statement mr waxman said the hearing will focus on whether the fda "is properly safeguarding the public and whether changes in the agencys authority resources or leadership might be necessary to help it better meet its mission " london based glaxo strongly disagrees with dr nissens finding which it says is contradicted by data from sources it considers stronger the publicity surrounding dr nissens analysis already has bitten into prescriptions of avandia anything that emerges from the hearing also could become fodder for plaintiff suits the fda is likely to be asked why it didnt earlier warn patients and doctors about emerging evidence of a potential heart risk tied to avandia like glaxo the agency has said those findings are contradicted by other evidence and the data so far havent been clear enough for regulatory action underlying the avandia hearing will be a more fundamental debate over how to beef up drug safety on may the senate passed a bill that would give the fda new power to restrict medications that raise safety concerns the question is whether the avandia incident will prod house leaders such as mr waxman and mr dingell to go beyond the senate approach one option might be to change the fdas internal decision making process to put more weight on consideration of a drugs risks the agencys leaders and the drug industry strongly oppose such a change so far mr waxmans bill doesnt include the change but a waxman spokeswoman says he "is considering a variety of options " politics substance amid the sound bites by jackie calmes the democrats assemble in manchester n h sunday night for their second debate to be followed there tuesday evening by the republicans third yes third face off both will be televised by co sponsor cnn from to p m the proliferation of talk fests raises the question do these debates really matter the answer is they do but not necessarily in the way intended they were supposed to provide a serious alternative to sound bite politics instead theyve provided a fertile forum for sound bites consider these memorable moments very verbose sen joe bidens answer when the democrat was asked whether he could "reassure" americans he would be verbally disciplined as president "yes " or republican mike huckabee slamming congressional republicans for spending money like well coiffed democrat john edwards "at a beauty shop " or republican front runner rudy giuliani harking to his role and challenging ron paul to "withdraw that comment" after the texas congressman said u s interventionism had provoked such acts of terrorism instead of seven point policy plans its those comments that people and pundits talk about afterward and that come to define debates and even races people still recall a new hampshire republican debate years ago only for ronald reagans feisty "i am paying for this microphone mr green " as his soon to be vanquished rival the elder george bush looked on haplessly whether spontaneous or scripted such moments can be effective in several ways as self deprecation they can blunt a candidates own vulnerabilities mr biden spoofing his loquaciousness for a dark horse they can provide a chance to grab the spotlight mr huckabee getting guffaws with his folksy humor even as he makes a serious point against spending or they can simultaneously burnish a candidates own image at the expense of a rivals reagans dramatic flair in trumping mr bush mr giulianis evocation again of his leadership role as he puts down mr paul substance also is important of course for all the emphasis to date on the war in iraq both the democratic and republican debates next week are likely to feature discussion of two domestic issues health care and illegal immigration left to themselves democrats would tend to talk of promises of universal health care coverage and avoid discussing solutions to illegal immigration while republicans would do the opposite that reflects the different priorities of their parties voters conservatives are hot over immigration liberals want to make health care more accessible and affordable for republicans whatever happens on stage the debate will be noteworthy for whos not there fred thompson the popular actor and former tennessee senator who is just now taking steps to become the races th man that means the other candidates will be striving for a moment so good that the post debate chatter is about them and less the actor looming large offstage
