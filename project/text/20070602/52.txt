pursuits books the golden gelding other racehorses get more respect this one set more records kelso by linda kennedy westholme pages &# in a thoroughbred industry poll a few years ago naming the greatest racehorses of the th century the immortal man o war emerged the runaway winner followed by two renowned holders of the triple crown secretariat and citation in fourth place came a scrawny little gelding that had more starts won more races won more money set more track records carried heavier weights and won over a greater variety of distances on dirt and grass than any of the illustrious trio of racehorses ahead of him in the voting he was kelso whose dazzling exploits won him the title horse of the year five years in succession an unprecedented feat and enshrined him as one of the enduring legends of the turf today nearly a quarter of a century after his death kelso finally has his own biography written by a fan linda kennedy who first saw kelso win the whitney stakes at saratoga in when she was it was the start of a lifelong fascination ms kennedy has captured the grandeur of the horse in a simple straightforward way that will charm and excite those like me who saw kelso run and remember his stirring deeds the book has none of the human emotion and historic setting of laura hillenbrands "seabiscuit " ms kennedy appears to have spoken to few of the principals associated with kelso most are now deceased instead quoting copiously from newspaper and magazine accounts of his career she concentrates exclusively on the horse and his long brilliant sweep across the land and the book loses nothing by it kelsos racing record through eight seasons taking on and beating the best of five generations of racehorses is simply breathtaking bred in by allaire du pont and reared on her maryland farm kelso was a most unpromising foal at birth he was "unusually small painfully thin and outwardly fragile " his handlers called him a runt worse he was downright ornery he was so intractable kicking biting and tossing his riders that the decision was made to geld him his esteemed trainer carl hanford would say later that kelso was so lightly regarded that no one bothered even to enter him in the kentucky derby or the other triple crown classics his owner wanted nothing more than to sell him but kelso quickly set them right when he was unleashed on the racetrack from his first race at atlantic city n j on sept which he won easily kelso went on a winning binge that stopped only when he was retired in in his second start as a three year old at new yorks aqueduct racetrack kelso ran the fastest mile ever recorded by a three year old in years of racing and that was only the beginning everywhere he went he seemed to set or equal track records from nine furlongs to two miles he did it on fast tracks and muddy tracks dirt and grass kelso achieved all this while carrying staggeringly high weights conceding pounds and more to some of the fastest young horses in the country horses of such memorable star quality as carry back beau purple gun bow crimson satan and never bend sometimes they beat him but most of the time he beat them ironically kelsos early triumphs were all but taken for granted he had little public acclaim or box office pull it was only later when he began to lose that the masses suddenly discovered kelsos magic and took him to their hearts so the stage was set for a showdown with gun bow a young rival already being touted as a potential super horse gun bow had beaten kelso twice in the summer of now the two horses would meet for what turned out to be the last time in the aqueduct stakes on labor day the outcome would decide horse of the year honors more than fans jammed into the old track gun bow led kelso by two lengths coming into the stretch kelso began to move up inch by inch pandemonium engulfed aqueduct as kelso now known everywhere as "kelly " gained ms kennedy writes "the throng was on its feet shrieking madly hysterically " gun bow would not crack when kelso went by him gun bow came back not once but twice at the wire it was kelso "grown men leapt up and down and pulled at their hair losing tickets flew like ticker tape it was bedlam " after that it was the same everywhere kelso went hailed and adored as a national treasure at the end eddie arcaro the prince of all american jockeys would say of him "kelso was the greatest horse i ever rode " statistics tell much of the story kelso had starts for wins seconds and thirds his record someone said "reads as if it was made up " in stakes races only one horse ever passed him in the stretch kelso was said the venerable turf columnist joe hirsch "a champion of champions " kelso died of colic on oct the day after he had paraded at belmont park with two other great geldings forego and john henry and years after his last race he was buried on mrs du ponts maryland farm on his tombstone are inscribed just six words "where he gallops the earth sings " mr kerrison is the new york posts longtime turf columnist
