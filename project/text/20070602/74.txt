scuttle diplomacy on may president bush announced vigorous support and urged the senate to ratify the law of the sea treaty mere mention of this treaty prompts a collective yawn yet herein lies a tale of dodgy diplomacy finally made right more than years ago los emerged from the dark sea onto the political horizon president reagan refused to follow the multilateral flow since he viewed its deep sea mining provisions as global socialism not knowing of any laws about any seas i got involved by chance my boss u s ambassador to the u n jeane kirkpatrick asked me to attend an early reagan national security council meeting in the white house on of all topics this secretary of state alexander haig opened by telling the new president that the treaty was nothing wed want but something weve got after all upwards of odd nations crafted the accord since the los process began in secretary haig reading rotely from his brief droned on about modifications to sundry treaty provisions each with a myriad of subsections and micro options this to put it mildly was not playing to reagans strong suit the president looked bored we all were and then puzzled finally he broke in "uh al " he asked "isnt this what the whole things all about " none of us could fathom what reagan meant mr haig asked him well mr reagan shrugged wasnt not going along with something "really stupid " just because nations had done so what the whole thing was all about our running our winning our being here our governing wasnt that what the whole thing was all about stunned mr haig closed his briefing book and muttered something about how hed be back to the president on how to get out of the treaty altogether after the usual government hiatus came another nsc meeting on the topic i modestly suggested dispatching a special los envoy to explain the presidents views directly to allied leaders these "heads of government do not know much about the los treaty " i understatedly wrote white house counselor ed meese on june "the los experts are hopeless they have been negotiating his thing for years" and are stuck in that rut another bout of government hibernation then the usual flurry the president suddenly asked ex defense secretary don rumsfeld to be his los envoy the next day the new secretary of state george shultz called to say that mr rumsfeld asked me to accompany him "since you handle this issue in the u n don thought you could add a lot to his meetings " i had to tell the secretary that while against this u n attempt at global socialism "frankly i dont know a hell of a lot more about it than don does " the phone went dead until mr shultz known for his buddha like calm finally said "in that case well have to send along a third person who knows something about the topic " l paul bremer then mr shultzs aide got us briefed and bundled off on a mile whirl to seven countries my wife dubbed the rumsfeld adelman mission "scuttle diplomacy " prime minister margaret thatcher assembled all her recondite british experts they started to cite sections of los treaty not playing to our strong suit either when mr rumsfeld stopped this lunge for the capillaries madame prime minister mr rumsfeld burst in do you really want to support international socialism to let the u n run an international cartel to enforce the mandatory transfer of technology do you do we really want a future like that lifting the level of discourse with telling arguments was all the good lady needed german chancellor helmut kohl needed only a few arguments to refute his los bureaucrats far more important he needed to know whether reagan really cared about this new in office and conservative mr kohl most wanted to get close to reagan we gave him a way in french president francois mitterrand sat immobile his knees touching one another his ankles tightly together during our entire hour meeting must have been more painful than our conversation nearly as memorable as his knees was his attitude typically french according to my draft report to the president dated dec mitterrands top aide told us "once the los process was launched in the u n its poor outcome was inevitable " obviously the outcome was poor sure the treaty was unworkable so why oppose it the french approach quite straightforward was to ingratiate itself to the third world by supporting the treaty and waiting for it to fail we had a hard time reaching and then hearing dutch prime minister rudolphus lubbers we had to walk around the red paint splattered outside his office courtesy of dutch artists whose subsidies were being trimmed while we tried to converse hundreds maybe thousands of teachers chanted loudly outside his office while walking backwards they were demonstrating against his policies pushing dutch education backwards the prime ministers mind could not be turned to deep sea mining we made our pitch in belgium which seemed to work then in japan italian prime minister giovanni spadolini admitted he was turned around during our session but he was turned out of office while we headed for the rome airport oddly four of the seven countries we visited changed leaders over those two months we briefed president reagan upon returning on dec the new york times featured on its front page "sea law signed by nations u s opposes it " nothing unexpected there but the real story was in the subtitle " other countries also refuse to back treaty " among the were germany britain japan belgium and italy except for france no country we visited which was able to do deep seabed mining signed on all these allies had once joined or even led the u n wave then the reagan administration devised a quiet and cooperative way to bring nearly all of them around back at the u n another debate over american unilateralism erupted this was echoed in the new york times lead editorial on dec blasting the administration for "betraying the bipartisan labors of previous administrations and setting back the cause of international accommodation " and for "isolation and obstruction " sound familiar i proposed a wicked one sentence amendment to the los treaty anyone with any involvement in the los negotiations would forever be barred from a paid job in any los bureaucracy established this caused a veritable tsunami in the general assembly this stroll down memory lane of a quarter century back has a purpose george w bush like ronald reagan refused to join the wave of internationalism embodied by the kyoto treaty international criminal court abm treaty and others but mr bush long lacked reagans deftness in bringing allies around to his sensible views its not that he failed he just didnt try though late he may now be adopting a better approach the los is an apt "case study" as the treaty reemerges from the deep and president bush urges senate ratification of a far better deal scraped away are virtually all the barnacles we denounced during our "scuttle diplomacy " theres no bar to private firms mining the minerals no mandatory technology transfer no decision making without u s participation indeed the u s gets a permanent seat on the decision making body and thus has veto power theres no bar to future qualified mining firms and no gigantic los institution for wannabe bureaucrats this seabed mining regime reflects free market principles it offers companies the legal certainty needed for large scale long term investments protects existing claims of u s firms and reinforces international law on territorial waterways it locks in u s off shore economic rights as it expands our rights over resources in a mile exclusive economic zone mile continental shelf and in a shelf beyond miles off alaska this los treaty a product of slow motion yet effective diplomacy was worth the wait id never thought id say it but here goes the senate should now ratify it mr adelman a u n ambassador and arms control director under president reagan now directs the arts &amp ideas
