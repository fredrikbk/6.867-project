following several seasons of billowy baby doll shapes this time as often happens when fashion trends make a comeback the look has been transformed the new shoulder lines are less severe and aggressive than in the past but still add definition they feature everything from pert puffy sleeves to pinch pleating and squared off edges it has been a good years since the heyday of the shoulder pad the often lampooned foundation of power dressing the look first appeared in the late s on the runways of french designers like claude montana and thierry mugler their black leather jackets with oversized curves and exaggerated shoulders "were not for lay people " says cameron silver owner of decades a vintage designer boutique in los angeles the look had staying power in part because when it crossed the atlantic in the mid s it coincided with the entrance of women en masse into the work force the masculine broad shouldered suits helped women cut an imposing figure in the workplace mirroring the red suspender "master of the universe" style then popular with men shoulder pads "gave women a sense of authority a new sense of confidence " says designer donna karan who rose to prominence in the power dressing era by the trend was in full swing it was then that mr montana announced at a runway show "shoulders forever " in movies and tv the wider the shoulders the stronger the woman sigourney weaver sported them as a domineering executive in "working girl " as did diane keaton as a high powered management consultant in "baby boom " costume designer bob mackie remembers the comical effect

dresses designers and retailers are hoping women will view bold shoulders as a sexy look this time around not as a power statement the designs dont always involve an actual pad but rather fabric that allows for a less rigid construction for his fall collection of retro looking suits and coats marc jacobs used layers of fabric to sharpen the line of the shoulders istvan francer design director of the sportswear label theory says hes squaring off the shoulders in some blazers for fall "to emphasize fine tailoring " for anne nicholas weiss shoulder pads bring back memories of seventh grade when her mother tried to stuff foam pads into her blazers "perfect for taking a nap while standing up " says the year old construction manager in nashville still "if designers could make it look sleek it
