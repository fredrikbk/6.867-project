pursuits leisure &amp arts an idea whose time has come the model for art ownership protection real estate title insurance in a celebrated case reported at length in this newspaper a norman rockwell painting that had been hanging in the home of movie mogul steven spielberg turned out to be stolen and the hollywood tycoon pledged to return the "russian schoolroom" painting to its rightful owner done by rockwell on a trip to russia the canvas shows a group of russian schoolchildren contemplating a white bust of soviet leader vladimir lenin mr spielbergs promise has become embroiled in a legal battle between two claimants to the work with the federal bureau of investigation caught in the middle between these two parties and mr spielberg who is holding the painting in the meantime what isnt so well known is that if mr spielberg had been able to purchase something called "art title insurance " his defenses would be in a lot better shape than they are now art title insurance is an old notion says richard gray co owner of richard gray gallery in new york and chicago and the unofficial dean of american gallerists but only with the rise of attention generated by art stolen during the holocaust and quite recently reclaimed as well as the surge of disputes surrounding looted antiquities not to mention the booming art market in general has this concept sprung to life in new forms for example one potential dispute that was amicably resolved led to the recent return of j m w turners painting "glaucus and scylla" by the kimbell art museum in fort worth texas to the heirs of john and anna jaffe this occurred after an investigation into the provenance of the painting which had been in the museums collection since revealed that it had been seized by the pro nazi vichy regime in france in not long ago john singleton copleys portrait of william posonby second earl of bessborough was returned to harvard university more than years after it was reported missing the painting belonged to the estate of private collector william m v kingsland who died in march this too could have been a source of dispute but was resolved when alexander acevedo an art dealer bought the painting from the estate and gave it to harvard art title insurance functions in a fashion similar to real estate title insurance protecting a policyholders right to title though not guaranteeing the authenticity of a work of art title is title but a "monet" could be by monet himself or by a knock off artist why didnt the idea of art title insurance stick until recently the short answer is that there has never been enough demand "there isnt enough volume for art title and authenticity insurance since demand is so low you dont get enough premium to offset a potential loss so you have to charge a lot of money and that charge is almost unaffordable to the majority of people who would rather self insure the risk " says leconte moore managing director and fine arts specialist at new york based dewitt stern group "i will say though " notes mr moore one of the top fine arts brokers in the world "that there is much more renewed interest in this insurance today because paintings and photographs have escalated in value far beyond what anybody imagined so there are a lot of people concerned about it and questioning whether they should buy the insurance " somebody who tried and failed to promote a form of art title insurance was lloyd goldenberg an attorney with bryne goldenberg &amp hamilton in washington in the late s a group mr goldenberg was a member of tried to sell a service to bank trust departments that made multiple inquiries into the marketplace value of a work of art and then proposed to issue a certificate of title based on those findings but the marketplace wasnt ready says mr goldenberg "the marketplace and these are sophisticated people just doesnt treat art this type of asset the same way they treat all other types of assets they seem to treat it as art first and an asset second living in this never never land in which theyre going to trust their reputable dealers and auction houses above all else the dealers and auction houses might be reputable but they dont guarantee title " yet another firm that tried to promote the notion of art title insurance was mighty hiscox a syndicate of lloyds of london and perhaps the premier name in art insurance in the world hiscoxs downfall was that given the nature of its business it had to renew art title contracts on an annual basis and most customers were looking for the life of ownership protection that comes with owning title to a home in the u s so what has changed a fledgling but well backed insurer called aris corp entered the market last june to date it has not signed up any clients though some major candidates are pending but it has attracted plenty of support including at hiscox which is serving as its reinsurer "ive always felt theres a market there" for insuring against defective title says robert read fine art underwriter at hiscox and arguably the most influential arts insurance practitioner in the world "its a real issue and we like the product aris has put together they spent an enormous amount of time with their due diligence " aris is the result of the brother and sister collaboration of its chairman lawrence shindell and president judith pearson the heart of what the two are offering is title protection research and vetting services and payment of all the expenses of a legal defense should one become necessary differing from hiscoxs former method of operation an aris policy covers the full lifetime ownership of a work if a work of art is proved to have bad title and must be returned aris will pay for its full value as would have been the case in the spielberg instance with all the disputed art claims around maybe this is the time that art title insurance will catch on mr yahn is an art and media critic based in croton on hudson n y he was recently named
