in los angeles you say hola i say ahn nyung many koreans hispanics swap native tongues a route to better business los angeles at the galleria a large korean supermarket here store manager yoonah yoon greets hispanic cashiers and bag boys each morning with a hearty "buenos dias" "good morning" in spanish the latino workers who make up more than half the stores employees answer him with the equivalent greeting in korean "ahn nyung hah seh yo " these days english isnt the second language of choice anymore for some immigrants settling in the u s in the city that is home to the countrys largest foreign born population many spanish and korean speaking immigrants are choosing to learn each others language before they tackle english the interconnection between the two groups is evident throughout koreatown the l a district of approximately square miles that became a gateway to the u s for thousands of korean newcomers in the s and s since the s the number of latinos residing here has exploded while many prosperous korean families have moved to the suburbs still koreatown whose population of roughly doubles during work hours remains the hub for korean cultural social and business life in los angeles in this bustling community many grocery stores banks hardware shops and travel agencies carry signage in both korean and spanish to meet soaring demand for spanish proficiency korean churches community centers and language schools are offering both introductory and advanced classes usually for a nominal fee korean language newspapers also carry ads for spanish language classes and tutors by the dozens "grow your business " says one pitch "free introductory spanish class " promises another one ad mentions that korean children are welcome too more than a courtesy the language exchange is born out of economic necessity korean immigrants here often open liquor stores garment factories and other small businesses that dont necessarily require english language skills to run them their employees by and large consist of another group of recent immigrants who dont speak english mostly mexicans and central americans the upshot many korean business owners figure its more urgent to learn spanish than it is to master english in the basement of the korea daily headquarters immigrants gathered on a recent tuesday evening for classes sponsored by the papers education and culture center students like han san lee spent more than two hours enunciating "uno dos tres " and other spanish words and phrases beamed on a screen from the instructors laptop as the manager of a garment factory in l a s fashion district mr lee says hes too busy to study english since moving here from korea seven months ago "almost all the workers at the factory are latino " said mr lee speaking in korean through an interpreter during a break "if i learn spanish i can more easily explain things to them " mr lee was joined by other koreans many of them barely able to speak english attending their first day of spanish class only one student said she was there to learn the new language for the fun of it peter lee another korean immigrant and no relation to hee san lee carefully repeated "buenos dias" and "como esta" after the teacher a korean named kevin choi who learned spanish when he lived in argentina mr lee is an acupuncturist whose clientele is increasingly hispanic many of them are construction workers suffering from back pain "for better communication with them i decided to learn spanish " said mr lee who has been in the u s for about two decades and already speaks english typically koreans who enroll in language classes are interested in learning conversational spanish relevant to their trade hispanics generally pick up korean whose characters and grammar are especially tough to master on the job even so latino workers here have come to see the benefits of tackling the language among the mexican workers at the galleria grocery is ruben hernandez in three years he has risen from an apron wearing bag boy to a necktie sporting front manager thanks to picking up korean informally from his colleagues and friends the year old immigrant also speaks english but because he spends the day dealing with koreans "i think i speak korean just as well as english now " he says many korean customers particularly elderly women like soo park seek out mr hernandez who always greets her in korean as he breaks into a wide grin that exposes his metal braces the other day mrs park approached the mexican employee to double check the price she had paid for a bundle of large deep green sesame leaves after their exchange in korean she noted in broken english "i like him he helps me with everything he gives me good service " at a checkout line aron hernandez no relation to the other mr hernandez recited in korean the name of each item he shoved into plastic bags cabbage "bae chu" strawberries "dahlkee" rice "sahl" when a customer asked him a question in korean he approached a supervisor and asked her to "please check the receipt" in korean since he both lives and works in koreatown he says "i couldnt help but learn some korean " as for english he says he could do with more practice though he repeats the phrase "please check the receipt " this time in english to prove he has mastered some phrases in the tongue of his adopted country even for korean entrepreneurs who speak english learning spanish has become essential to expanding their businesses peter lee can vouch for that the acupuncturist counts high powered korean executives as patients but the large banner hanging outside his clinic reflects a new reality to which he is adjusting in spanish it says "acupuncture pain control free consultation " these days he says roughly a third of mr lees patients are hispanic learning spanish he says will be a passport to providing better care and attracting more customers after his first class at the korea daily headquarters the acupuncturist was bullish about his prospects "for koreans it is easier to enunciate words like casa house " than to pronounce words in english he said korean owned garment factories fill a drab skyscraper called anjac fashion building on the edge of downtown l a in the lobby a glass encased bulletin board advertises dozens of sewing jobs virtually all of them in spanish in a vast room where sewing machines clatter away korean owner ricardo ahn is surrounded by hispanics working to make tube top dresses and other items since coming to los angeles years ago from sao paulo brazil mr ahn says he has shifted from speaking portuguese to spanish "i only talk to my hispanic employees so i dont learn english " he says see related letter "letters to the editor you say hidey and i say something totally foreign" wsj june
