eurolinks daily view u s chinese moves improve prospects for global warming online edition thursdays dramatic policy shift by the white house on climate change calling on the worlds top economic powers to negotiate long term goals to reduce greenhouse gases significantly improves the outlook for future international agreements to address global warming improving the outlook even further china which is set to surpass the u s as the worlds top emitter of greenhouse gases this year said it is about to release its long awaited strategic plan on addressing its own emissions problems though the new u s initiative may draw criticism from environmentalists who worry that a separate dialogue will undermine broader united nations negotiations that are just getting under way the white house argues that the dialogue mr bush envisions will actually strengthen the formal u n discussions it will do so as our reporters write by solving the biggest impediments to a deal namely the lack of participation by emerging giants like china and india which were exempted from making emissions cuts under the landmark kyoto accord in mr bush proposes to convene a series of meetings starting this fall among the countries with the biggest emissions with the aim of producing a global emissions reduction goal by the end of around the close of his term his shift comes in the wake of growing criticism at home and abroad that the u s the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases isnt doing enough to address global warming and its accompanying risks including melting polar ice rising sea level and more destructive storms and drought an increasing number of republicans and business leaders have joined democrats to call for more action on the issue especially after democrats took over congress in the elections international criticism was expected to reach a crescendo at next weeks meeting of the group of eight industrial national in germany where worries about climate change run high european leaders including german chancellor angela merkel are calling on china and other nations to accept limits on the amount of greenhouse gases they emit european officials also are calling for the u s to play a leading role on climate change even though the u s so far has firmly rejected hard and fast targets on reducing the emissions that scientists believe contribute to global warming

regulators could move to revoke a production permit is that russian licensing authorities accuse a company controlled by bps owned russian venture tnk bp ltd of failing to meet production targets at the giant field as gregory l white and guy chazan report tnk bp admits its producing far less gas than the license mandates however it blames that on its inability to get government approval for an export pipeline to energy hungry china without that pipeline it argues there isnt enough demand to warrant more production tnk bps appeals to amend the license to reduce production targets have been rejected one must ask if the kremlins left hand doesnt know what its right hand is doing industry officials and analysts suspect the regulatory pressure is a negotiating tactic on behalf of gazprom which has been talking for months with tnk bp about joining the project publicly however gazprom officials say they arent interested in kovykta because of the vast investment required and questions about whether theres enough demand for the gas if the russian authorities revoke the license gazprom would be able to bid for it at a future auction while tnk bp could be barred by legal restrictions now under consideration but gazprom might later invite bp in as a minority partner in the project some analysts have speculated that the kremlin might be pushing for a deal ahead of next weeks summit
