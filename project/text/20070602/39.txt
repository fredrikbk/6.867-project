inside irans holy money machine bigger than the vatican awash in cash how a shrine built a business empire and wields power mashhad iran the shrine of imam reza a sumptuous parade of mosques minarets and marble courtyards is vaster than vatican city it draws more muslim pilgrims than even mecca birthplace of the prophet muhammad in saudi arabia each year more than million iranians iraqis and other shiite muslims journey to the shrine here in northeast iran to pay homage to imam reza a revered ninth century martyr all come to pray before his tomb and many to stuff bank notes in a gold and silver cage that protects his ancient bones the shrine has for centuries intermingled faith and money collecting donations of cash land jewelry and works of art from the devout today it is not only irans most sacred religious site but also by some reckonings the islamic republics biggest and richest business empire companies in its corporate portfolio make everything from city buses to pizza strudels to growth hormones for caviar producing sturgeon at the same time it operates an islamic studies center and boasts a huge collection of qurans no smoking signs at its sanctuary read "this is the flight zone of angels dont pollute it with smoke " "we are an islamic conglomerate " says mehdi azizian business adviser and brother in law of ayatollah abbas vaez tabasi the shrines year old chief "we dont expect anyone to understand everything we do because it is so big " the dual role of the imam reza shrine helps explain how the power of irans aging clerical elite endures nearly three decades after the islamic revolution "money is power and the mullahs dominate some important parts of the iranian economy " says thierry coville a french expert on irans economy and author of a recent book on iran the imam reza shrine is part of a cluster of bonyads nominally charitable foundations with huge holdings acquired through generations of donations or confiscated after the revolution they publish no accounts and in most cases answer only to irans supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei this status gives bonyads an independent authority outside irans formal state bureaucracy and checks the power of elected officials whether western minded reformers or populist zealots like the current president mahmoud ahmadinejad while westerners often picture internal battles in iran as pitting orthodox muslims against secular oriented liberals some of the most significant conflicts pivot around cash not ideology mr ahmadinejad has favored the islamic revolutionary guard corps a paramilitary force with business interests that sometimes compete with the shrine foundations the imam reza shrine known in farsi as astan e quds e razavi or the holy gateway of reza owns mines textile factories a bus factory a pharmaceutical plant an engineering company a bakery a sugar refinery dairy farms cattle and camel ranches orchards and dozens of other properties it owns around three quarters of the land in mashhad irans second biggest city and vast tracts elsewhere it has laid water pipes in lebanon built a bridge between iraq and syria and sought road building contracts in algeria "we are involved in every industry " says mr azizian an energetic civil engineer who headed the shrines business side for years and now oversees its massive reconstruction program in defiance of irans establishment dress code which frowns on foreign styles he has a taste for blue jeans striped shirts and well cut business suits driving through mashhad recently in his nissan explorer he asked a visitor about the dow jones industrial average and pitched the shrine as a reliable partner for foreign investors an iranian business newspaper sarmayeh last year ranked the imam reza shrine foundation as the biggest of irans bonyads the paper said the foundations business ventures account for of irans gross domestic product which was &# billion in the latest fiscal year according to the international monetary fund iranian and foreign economists consider this figure much too high they add that bonyads have trouble managing their diverse interests efficiently and sometimes hang onto poor performers to protect jobs and political influence all agree however that the shrine is a serious power in the land saeed laylaz a prominent economist who studied in mashhad compares irans situation to that of medieval europe where the wealth of the roman catholic church and its claim to speak for god allowed popes and cardinals to rival and often eclipse kings "religion and economics are always together everywhere " says mr laylaz without cash he says clerics "just become mystics " according to a report by the official iran statistical center all but a handful of irans mosques shrines and other religious institutions have endowments which usually include land this matches the pattern in premodern europe where churches and monasteries had big property portfolios before leaders such as englands henry viii grabbed them the shrine of imam reza is by far the largest landowner in iran apart from the state economists say mashhads biggest hotels and many of its factories and farms sit on shrine land and pay rent to the bonyad a free trade zone along irans border with turkmenistan is on shrine land and is served by an airport built by the shrines construction division mohammad noory the british educated head of the shrines overseas development unit estimates that the shrine has title to around a quarter of all the private land in iran it isnt just wealth that makes the shrine so potent also critical is its independence from government supervision neither parliamentary nor state auditors review the shrines books the shrines overseer the supreme leader ayatollah khamenei is himself from mashhad the mix of power centers in iran has confounded u s efforts to decipher tehrans intentions u s officials have struggled for example to figure out whether the tehran leadership has sanctioned the supply of iranian weapons used by shiite militias in iraq iran has shrouded its nuclear program too in a mist of confusion saying it wants to negotiate with the international community one day and then stalking away in high dudgeon the next the mashhad shrines ambiguous relationship to state power was highlighted after the war in lebanon last year during which israel waged a failed campaign to destroy the shiite militia hezbollah after the conflict scores of millions of dollars appeared mysteriously to fund home reconstruction and relief work by hezbollah in an interview in beirut last year hezbollahs senior financial adviser hussein al shami said the imam reza shrine provided the cash mr azizian denies this and says hezbollah and other shiite groups merely want to cloak themselves in the sanctity of imam reza the shrine he says funds charity and development projects inside iran these include lavish reconstruction work at the imam reza shrine that last year alone ate up more than &# million another recipient is mashhads reza hospital a state of the art facility that cost &# million and is equipped with scanners and other equipment from among others general electric co and siemens ag of germany the shrines leader ayatollah vaez tabasi is one of irans most influential clerics he has been quoted as calling for "perpetual holy war" and describing american singer michael jackson as an envoy of satan but mr azizian whose sister is married to the ayatollah says that mr vaez tabasi while "very religious " is open to new ideas and the outside world the ayatollah has a web site that features sophisticated graphics and a video re enactment of his time in jail under the shah he declined to be interviewed over the years irans state bureaucracy has tried to assert its authority over bonyads and other power centers but made only fitful headway "the fundamental aspect is this nobody can bully the shrine of imam reza " says mr azizian tension between political and religious authority goes back to the early days of islam and the mysterious death in of imam reza the shrines namesake and a descendant of the prophet muhammad shiites believe he was fed poisonous grapes by the then leader of the muslim world who was sunni imam reza was buried in sanabad then a small village which became known as mashhad "place of martyrdom " in the th century irans safavid dynasty adopted shiite islam as a state creed sharply boosting the status and wealth of mashhad safavid rulers sought to centralize control of religious endowments but conceded the independence of the powerful shrine in mashhad the th century brought grave challenges to the clergys autonomy reza pahlavi a former soldier who was the shah of iran from until was a largely secular modernizer in worshippers in mashhad protested a dress code that demanded western style brimmed hats which hampered praying a riot broke out and troops opened fire some accounts say the head of the imam reza shrine was executed in the shahs son mohammad reza pahlavi took power after an american orchestrated coup and set about uprooting clerical authority the state began supervising religious endowments and appointed a general as custodian of the imam reza shrine at the time mr vaez tabasi the cleric now running the shrine was a young religious student the son of a respected cleric he began delivering antigovernment speeches and was imprisoned five times he became good friends with another dissident mr khamenei now supreme leader when the shah was overthrown in revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini immediately appointed mr vaez tabasi chief custodian of the imam reza shrine restoring clerical authority over the site and its holdings the islamic government expropriated the assets of the shah and his supporters and turned the riches over to new islamic bonyads the biggest of these was bonyad mostazafan or the oppressed foundation which took charge of welfare work and became a massive corporation among assets grabbed by mostazafan were the bottling plant of pepsis iranian partner tehrans then hilton hotel and a sprawling sports club in dubai a group calling itself the mostazafan foundation of new york took control of a manhattan office tower built in the s by the deposed shah the new york foundation which later changed its name is still majority owner of the fifth avenue tower but denies any ties to tehran alarmed by the power of bonyads was irans first postrevolution president abdolhassan banisadr who now lives in exile near paris he says he complained to ayatollah khomeini in about rampant corruption in the bonyads which were exempted from taxes and urged that they be brought under formal government control the regime never undertook a serious housecleaning he says speaking recently at his ramshackle villa in versailles he says the free rein given to bonyads allowed "the mullahs to set up a parallel state " islam as a galvanizing force "finished a long time ago " he says "now it is all about money " mr azizian in mashhad dismisses mr banisadr as a has been and a traitor irans war with iraq gave a big boost to the bonyads pushing them into the front line of relief and reconstruction work companies owned by imam reza shrine helped rebuild towns destroyed by iraq and provided food to iranian forces following the death of ayatollah khomeini in however pressure slowly began to build for more control over the bonyads after the election as president of the relatively liberal mohammad khatami in parliament passed a law stipulating that foundations were under the "supervision of the president and the auspices of the supreme leader " the brother of the head of the oppressed foundation was convicted of embezzlement the imam reza shrine also came under attack some media began to publish allegations of corruption against ayatollah vaez tabasis oldest son nasser who was running a shrine controlled free trade zone near turkmenistan accusations against him ranged from crooked energy deals to embezzlement involving a dubai trading company an investigation fizzled mr azizian nassers uncle dismisses the corruption claims as an attempt by radical secularists to undermine ayatollah vaez tabasi the clerical establishment and the islamic republic itself "if you attack the toe you attack the whole body " he says the shrine meanwhile flexed its own muscle it took legal action to assert a claim to contested land in wealthy districts of tehran mr azizian says the shrine didnt intend to seize properties but merely to remind tehran residents that "you are living on imam rezas land " shortly before the end of president khatamis second term in and the election of mr ahmadinejad parliament finally ordered that foundations start paying at least some taxes but several religious bonyads were exempted including the imam reza shrine how much the shrine makes a year from its ventures is unclear mr azizian says the figure is at least &# million but there are no public consolidated accounts iranian scholars several years ago estimated the shrines total annual budget at around &# billion much of its income comes from rent on land willed to the shrine in centuries past land donations have declined but pilgrims still leave bank notes at the imams tomb "we believe that whatever we have is from imam reza " says gholamali azimi a year old medical center worker who donates his spare time to help the shrine with crowd control "giving something back is the least i can do " he says the shrine says it has a waiting list of people eager to work as volunteer ushers sweepers and guards on the premises irans current president mr ahmadinejad is more in tune with the conservative outlook of many clerics than his predecessor but he too has clashed with the religious establishment last year a senior adviser to mr ahmadinejad scoffed at the imam reza shrines involvement in "skyscraper building and auto manufacturing" and said such activities should be left to others mr ahmadinejads hard line government has favored the economic interests of its own supporters outside the clerical elite a big beneficiary the revolutionary guard corps business units of the paramilitary force have won contracts to run the new tehran airport develop gas fields and handle big civil engineering projects an area in which the imam reza shrine also competes mr azizian who has worked for the shrine since joining its finance department in says hes not worried political leaders come and go but all including mr ahmadinejad are "the servant of imam reza and must obey the imam " he says the shrine is now looking to expand abroad and is keen on finding foreign investors for joint ventures "lets go to dubai and create a company to canada to singapore even to afghanistan we are ready " he says noting that the shrines status offers potential investors " protection " in mashhad the shrine is working to set up a new cement factory to take advantage of a construction boom its bakery reza bread co has installed new german equipment to produce fruit and pizza strudels mainly for export it gets its yeast from reza yeast co its sugar from reza sugar co and its apples and other fruit from shrine owned orchards a big customer is the reza hospital shrine owned companies says the bakerys managing director ghasemiyan moghadam pay market prices for each others goods but "work together like the organs of a body " ownership by the shrine he says also eases labor relations "when you are working for imam reza why would you ever strike " he asks the bakery made a &# million profit last year he says down the road at the samen pharmaceutical factory the shrine has just boosted its ownership stake to from after buying out the share of a state holding company because of the shuffle explains general manager saeed ahmed kakhki the plant now has to pay taxes on only of its profit working for imam reza is "an honor " says mr kakhki who has a black spot on his forehead from banging his head while praying not all the businesses are doing so well the shrine recently sold its stake in a troubled trucking company and its big bus making plant in tehran has a reputation for inefficiency but says mr azizian the shrines commercial future is secure "when we have imam reza we dont have fear " he says "we feel very protected we have god "
