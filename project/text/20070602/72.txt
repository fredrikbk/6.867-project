remembrances preston martin outspoken as fed official he also forged freddie mac preston martin fell short of his ambition to be federal reserve board chairman but his outspoken views helped shape the nations financial policy and create the now booming secondary market for home mortgages as president ronald reagans first appointment to the fed and its vice chairman from to he led a challenge to then chairman paul volckers tight money policy intended to prevent a return to the inflationary late s but which often ran counter to the reagan administrations efforts to spur economic growth those clashes contributed to mr martins resignation as vice chairman ushering in the alan greenspan era as fed chairman when mr volcker decided not to seek another term as chairman in earlier as then california gov reagans savings and loan regulator he was an early advocate of adjustable rate mortgages that job led to his later appointment as chairman of the federal home loan bank board where mr martin helped spearhead the creation of freddie mac which became one of the largest providers of funding for home mortgages "he was an unusual person to find in public service in that he was capable and innovative " says paul craig roberts a former wall street journal editorial page columnist who later was an assistant treasury secretary in the reagan administration and author of "the supply side revolution " he adds "preston should have been chairman of the federal reserve " there was little doubt that mr martin aspired to the top job a profile of him in fortune magazine was headlined "the man who would be volcker " asked whether he hoped to return as fed chairman after his resignation as vice chairman in mr martin replied "all im saying is im not going to mars " the resignation came at a ticklish moment in mr volckers tenure just a month earlier mr martin and three other reagan administration appointees had overridden mr volcker to cut the discount rate it was the latest shot in what one economist told the journal was "civil war at the central bank" over whether to keep money tight to fight inflation or increase liquidity mr martin who died may in san francisco at age grew up in southern california and helped his mother struggle to make ends meet after his father died when mr martin was as a professor at the university of southern california mr martin began consulting with local s&amp ls on expansion plans as reagans california commissioner of s&amp ls starting in he pushed for expanded banking regulations to allow s&amp ls to offer certificates of deposit and short term consumer loans ideas that eventually were adopted two years later when a newly elected president richard nixon appointed him chairman of the federal home loan bank board mr martin campaigned for freddie mac as a way of pumping liquidity into housing markets at the time another government sponsored company fannie mae was regarded as primarily serving mortgage banks by buying loans they originated s&amp ls wanted their own government backed entity to purchase their loans and turn them into securities for sale to other investors but wall street was cold to his entreaties that it invest in a new form of security mr martin said in a interview with national mortgage news ultimately though salomon brothers and a bond trader there named william simon a future treasury secretary under presidents nixon and ford showed interest and a new mortgage backed securities market was born what mr martin may not have anticipated was how long fannie and freddie would retain their quasi government status which gives them a huge advantage over purely private sector companies in borrowing money on the global bond markets "he thought they were only temporary in nature " needed to create an efficient market for mortgage backed securities says james e murray a former president of fannie mae who knew mr martin "but thats not the way it worked out " mr martin left government in to found the pmi investment co which helped customers obtain mortgages with less money down than the industry standard he sold the company to allstate insurance co the next year and stayed on as chief executive until after president reagan summoned him to become fed vice chairman mr martin quickly gained a reputation for favoring a looser monetary policy but he claimed his focus was on growth whatever his ambitions mr martin was a rare central banker who spoke his mind in public in he held a meeting with reporters and called for more "innovative" approaches to international debtors such as capping interest rates at the time mr volcker was in japan discussing problems of international debtors he issued a statement labeling mr martins comments "incomprehensible" and "unrealistic " after the flap mr martin said "i slipped a little here i dont mind admitting that " "my whole thrust at the fed was to develop the federal reserve institutions themselves and to get economic growth rather than disinflation as the major goal " he told the associated press in he also complained in a new york times interview the same year about "almost an obsession with reinflation here " of his conflicts with mr volcker he said "i respect paul and i think it was terrific to get to work with him we just disagreed on half a dozen major policy issues " when he came home after resigning "his first words were free at last " says mr martins wife genevieve after leaving the fed mr martin spent a few years rescuing failing s&amp ls in partnership with mr simon he then switched focus to fostering affordable urban housing helping found two nonprofits neighborhood housing services of america and the social compact described as "a bit of a ham" by his wife mr martin became a regular economics
