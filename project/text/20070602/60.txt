pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece white hot jazz ballad the haunting singin the blues changed american music anatomy of a classic eighty years ago seven young white jazz musicians led by a year old saxophonist from illinois named frankie trumbauer and including the year old iowa born cornet player bix beiderbecke made a recording in new york of a tune called "singin the blues " no one had heard anything quite like this disc in the years since "the first jazz record" had been made also in new york by the original dixieland jass band a group of white players from new orleans "singin the blues" had a subtle swing and a lyrical quality that seemed a world apart from the odjbs raucous uproar though it was that same bands pianist j russel robinson who co wrote "singin the blues" trumbauer and beiderbeckes nearly three minute platter would be called "the first jazz ballad " and its haunting sound would forever affect the course of americas indigenous music "singin the blues" starts off at a midtempo foot tapping pace that suggests a very brisk walk along a country lane after a four bar ensemble intro trumbauer takes the opening chorus playing c melody saxophone a now obsolete instrument a cross between alto and tenor his improvised paraphrases and loping commentary on the melody played over the impeccably fingered lines of year old acoustic guitarist eddie lang seem at once exuberant and thoughtful rhythmic and ruminative bars that mix the inevitability of art with the ease of conversation the second chorus belongs to beiderbecke a young man with a horn playing on and around and in between the beat in poignant phrases that hit with force but leave a wistful echo some describe beiderbeckes tone as silvery others golden but the strong shimmering personal sound of bix always seems to stir the memory and touch the heart the songs final seconds after a tentative eight bar clarinet solo by a year old jimmy dorsey are played by the ensemble but beiderbeckes cornet is front and center shouting and strutting with authority leading the way right up to drummer chauncey morehouses last emphatic foot cymbal chomp by both beiderbecke and trumbauer were already well known to other white players of "hot" jazz after "singin the blues " they became known to black players as well "singin the blues " billed on its black and gold okeh label as by "frankie trumbauer &amp his orchestra with bix and lang " rolled into all corners of a segregated america in the winter of in a hotel in bismarck n d a teenage saxophonist named lester young heard a record being played in the room of fellow traveling musician eddie barefield and knocked on the door to ask what it was "singin the blues " young who would become one of the most important figures in jazz a primal influence on at least two generations of saxophonists both black and white is said to have carried a copy of that okeh in his tenor saxophone case for years those who listened could often hear whimsical traces of trumbauer and little bursts of bix in youngs driving ethereal playing what players such as young responded to in "singin the blues" was the way both bix and "tram" constructed their solos not out of disconnected "hot licks" and tricky s gimmicks but with thoughtful balanced phrases that "said" something "trumbauer always told a little story " lester young observed in a year old artie shaw said "listen to trumbauers solo on singin the blues its like a poem " musicians all over the country learned to play those beiderbecke and trumbauer solos note for note fletcher henderson the celebrated african american orchestra leader had caucasian arranger and beiderbecke disciple bill challis score "singin the blues" for his band with trams chorus written out for the whole reed section and when henderson recorded it he asked his own cornet star rex stewart to emulate bixs solo benny carter plays trumpet on a lionel hampton small group recording of "singin the blues " though carter was better known as an alto saxophonist late in life carter recalled with pleasure to writer don heckman how he and the italian american tenor saxophonist flip phillips once warmed up before a s concert by playing trams "singin the blues" solo in unison from memory modern era clarinetist kenny davern told jazz scholar dick sudhalter of having once witnessed two black tenor men swing to bebop master don byas and the veteran eddie barefield yes the same man on whose door lester young once knocked take out their horns during a chance encounter in the s and spontaneously run through trumbauers chorus from "singin the blues " they told an astonished davern "everybody knew that chorus " frankie trumbauer whose birthday was may lived until but his style of playing was edged aside before the swing era a longtime amateur pilot in he joined the civil aeronautics authority maybe he like others later discerned beguiling wisps of his and bixs s lyricism floating throughout the s "cool school" of jazz bix beiderbecke a compulsive drinker died in new york in at the age of ten years later when bill challis whod done much to preserve and perpetuate beiderbeckes music brought some bix evoking arrangements to glenn miller the popular bandleader rejected challiss charts he said people didnt know or care about beiderbecke anymore but some did some still do mr nolan is editor of "the archer files the complete short stories of lew archer private investigator by ross macdonald " forthcoming from crippen &amp landru
