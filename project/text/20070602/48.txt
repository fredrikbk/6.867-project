a way to spread freedom it also has opened a door for washington lobbyists who have profited by helping shape the process as it has unfolded as nato has worked to integrate former soviet republics and client states with the west those nations have sought influential middlemen with the contacts and know how to pull it off the stakes are huge offering not just military but diplomatic and economic opportunity none of the lobbyists are household names but for washington insiders european officials and businesses seeking access to natos new members they have become prized contacts while carving out a lucrative niche one of the most prominent is sally painter a former official in the clinton commerce department who since leaving government in the mid s has become a key representative for natos new and aspiring members just last month ms painter signed contracts totaling more than &# from seven of the new nato countries including latvia that are seeking to waive visa requirements for citizens traveling to the u s ms painter also is a key figure in organizing conferences at natos annual summits which have grown in recent years into lavish events at which foreign policy mavens and government leaders mingle with big corporate donors since former soviet orbit countries have joined the western alliance three have been selected to host a nato summit ms painter organized nato summit events in washington in prague in and here in the latvian capital last fall before president bush and other nato leaders gathered in rigas cobblestoned old town she helped corral &# plus donations

says valdis birkavs a former latvian prime minister other well known lobbyists who have worked with new members of nato include randy scheunemann now foreign policy director for arizona republican sen john mccains presidential campaign and paige reffe a former aide in the clinton administration mr scheunemann worked on nato issues as a senate aide and joined the nato expansion committee after he left capitol hill in to lobby his clients included latvia georgia macedonia and romania mr reffe snagged lobbying contracts with lithuania and slovakia after leaving the clinton administration the lobbyists work doesnt violate ethics rules and is fairly common in washington but it does open a little noticed window on the close interplay between the public and private sectors in washington and how that process is spreading from domestic policymaking to the newly open eastern european countries their efforts also show how the expansion of nato first formed in as a western military alliance to counter the soviets has been influenced by washington insiders well after they have left their government roles even as its original military purpose has broadened several nato lobbyists have played key roles as well on other issues such as winning support from aspiring members for the u s led iraq invasion in ms painter says her public and private roles have complemented each other "to join nato these countries had to make a lot of reforms " she says "their economies grew and theres naturally been heightened interest from global corporations " after leaving the commerce department

successful nato bid in february as the administration sought european allies to back an invasion of iraq two of ms painters republican allies from the committee to expand nato helped circulate a letter from latvia and other aspiring members declaring their support for toppling saddam hussein in turn the bush administration began pushing hard within nato to elevate their interests most of the nations that signed the letter were current past or future clients of ms painter and messrs reffe and scheunemann popular in washington nato expansion has proved to be an issue that cuts across party lines ms painter was slammed by congressional republicans while in the commerce department for placing big democratic donors on overseas u s trade missions led by her then boss the late commerce secretary ron brown even so ms painter has emerged as one of the rare former clinton administration officials able to open doors in the bush white house "weve had a great esprit de corps " she says of the republicans including stephen hadley now national security adviser who worked with her on the committee "thats because it was really all about the public policy not the partisanship " ms painter and her colleagues also have taken on as clients some businesses and officials from the new nato countries she signed up a latvian bank parex bank as which treasury department officials suspected was being used by some of its russian clients for money laundering one of ms painters tasks was to help convince u s officials the bank was working to stop illegal activities parex says it wasnt able to control what its clients did but now is working with the u s to report and detect suspicious activity and shut it down in ms painter took her services and clients to the lobbying powerhouse dutko
