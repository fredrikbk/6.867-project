pursuits books writers block in pursuit of lifes unchanging essence consequences by penelope lively viking pages &# in oleander jacaranda her memoir of growing up in england and egypt the novelist penelope lively related a life transforming moment during world war ii when she was shown a bit of roman wall in an area of london flattened by german bombs "what i do remember " she wrote "with a clarity that is still exhilarating is the sudden sense of relevances and connections which were mysterious and intriguing and could perhaps be exposed " ms lively has made such relevances and connections the stuff of her fiction her central characters tend to be reflective intellectuals who share her own concern with history and the transitory nature of experience a paleontologist for example "cleopatras sister" a historian "the photograph " "moon tiger" an anthropologist "spiderweb" "choice and contingency form a delicate partnership " she has written a subject she explored in the antimemoir "making it up" in which ms lively pondered the routes her life might have taken if she had made different decisions in the nonfiction work "a house unlocked" she gained a new understanding of her familys history as she dismantled the family house after an aunts death "from each object there spun a shining thread of reference if you knew how to follow it " in each of ms livelys novels the past haunts the present which is in turn encroached upon by the future even the most resolutely modern scene is invested with prospective nostalgia as in this excerpt from her wonderful new novel "consequences" "she serves soup and ciabatta bread machines churn hum beep wink green eyes off stage a phone rings a fax grinds this is a heartland of the late twentieth century abreast of everything and its own obsolescence ordained its tastes and technologies doomed she has always been aware of the long view perhaps uncomfortably so " "consequences" is the story of three generations of women any such tale is inevitably dubbed "a sweeping saga" in the publishers promotional material and viking has indeed described "consequences" in such a way but the tag does little justice to this novels intensely personal private tone rather than a saga it seems like three distinct novellas in lorna a young girl from a sheltered haut bourgeois background meets a gifted young wood engraver named matt and her world changes up until that time she had lived "the mandatory life structure centered upon a good income and a handsome house " while being vaguely aware that "there was another way of living out there in the grown up world a way that did not require shopping in knightsbridge and dressmakers and enrolment in the line up as wife material " in the face of her parents rigid disapproval of artists and bohemianism lorna marries matt and the two move to a cottage in rural somerset a primitive place that is nevertheless a kind of paradise they have a little daughter molly and enjoy a prelapsarian existence until the war disrupts their idyll as matt remarks "nobodys exempt from history " the postwar world in which molly grows to womanhood is entirely different before the war things were "cut and dried people were clear who they were and where they belonged everyone assessed everyone else and placed them within or without their own sphere this was a world divided into us and them with many subtle and significant sub divisions " england in the late s and s is far more fluid to the point that a girl like molly feels that she belongs nowhere and wonders whether in this uncertain new social order it is even necessary to belong anywhere in particular her daughter ruth born in the s is a part of the rootless technocratic culture of the turn of the millennium ruths ultimate emotional evolution includes a recoil from her husband a real child of his era and a reconnection with the past as her grandmother lorna once reflected "it is always like that and always will be you are forever standing on the brink in a place where you cannot see ahead there is nothing of which to be certain except what lies behind this should be terrifying but somehow it is not " the span of time covered in "consequences" is that of ms livelys own life she was born in and in her matchlessly spare prose she anatomizes the epochal changes that have transformed the english landscape and culture in those odd years her greatest gift though is her ability to see beyond mere cultural ephemera and grasp the unchanging essences of life happiness for her as for her novels most sympathetic characters does not consist in some wishful contemplation of heaven but "is the real world the physical world " her work is permeated with a sort of religion but it is the religion of the agnostic intellectual it is all tied up with her passion for history knowledge for her is a step toward communion as claudia hampton in ms livelys booker prize winning "moon tiger " reflects "unless i am a part of everything i am nothing " penelope lively has worked within the tradition of humane realistic cultivated women writers who flourished in england in the second half of the th century she might be classed with jane gardam penelope fitzgerald margaret drabble pat barker barbara pym novelists who have combined a close attention to characterization and psychological nuance with an underlying humor and sense of proportion it is a dwindling tradition sadly which makes a writer like ms lively all the more worth treasuring ms allen is the author of "moral minority our skeptical founding fathers "
