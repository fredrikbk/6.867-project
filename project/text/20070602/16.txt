merger with banking giant wachovia corp a deal that may force them to change the way they manage their money the &# billion merger announced thursday will test how well the two firms handle the problems of integrating brokerage firms brokers sometimes walk out the door looking for new jobs for instance last year at piper jaffray cos some of brokers departed after the firms brokerage arm was bought by ubs ag the two firms say that the deal will provide clients of a g edwards a regional brokerage firm based in st louis an array of new services and products "we will now be able to provide mortgages auto loans checking accounts credit card services and a better investment banking product " robert bagby chief executive of a g edwards said in a conference call indeed the combination of the two firms could create the countrys second largest brokerage firm as measured by the size of its brokerage staff after merrill lynch &amp co but many a g edwards clients may end up paying higher account fees as the companies integrate their operations a g edwards customers also could earn smaller returns on their cash holdings the firm has about million brokerage clients the deal reflects the changes transforming the brokerage industry heated competition among firms is steadily driving commissions lower in the traditional brokerage business as a result big firms have been trying to shift clients into so called managed accounts which charge clients a percentage of their assets typically to annually in exchange for unlimited trades and comprehensive advice wachovia the charlotte n c bank has a large business in managed accounts and is expected to encourage a g edwards clients the bulk of whom are in traditional brokerage accounts to switch in a conference call with wall street analysts on thursday wachovia executive david carroll noted that managed accounts are considerably more profitable than traditional accounts adding "we think we can accelerate a g edwardss profit growth here " managed accounts make up of the companys brokerage assets he said mr carroll said he expects wachovias financial planning tool envision will help its advisers create investment plans for clients and potentially shift them into managed accounts for investors with modest portfolios or who dont make a lot of trades a brokerage relationship based on commissions may be cheaper than paying fees tied to assets even for customers who stay with a traditional brokerage account there could be additional restrictions a g edwards for instance requires a minimum investment of &# for its basic cash management brokerage program which has check writing privileges a similar cash management account at wachovia has a &# minimum a g edwards customers also could see yields fall on their idle cash which brokers park in so called sweep accounts a g edwards currently sweeps most customers cash into money market funds yielding close to by contrast wachovias own cash sweep product pays or less on cash balances in accounts with household assets under &# to get the top rate of wachovia investors need at least &# million a spokesman for wachovia said it would be "premature" to conclude that a g edwardss customers will be moved into wachovias cash sweep product "products are obviously an area that will get a lot of careful analysis " tony mattera responded in an email customers arent likely to see many changes for a while wachovia doesnt expect the acquisition to close until this years fourth quarter integration of the two brokerage operations wont wrap up until early over the short term the impact on clients will depend on wachovias success in retaining a g edwardss best brokers wachovia says it expects to lose of brokers but some observers say the numbers could be higher longer term a g edwardss customers will get access to an expanded menu of mutual funds wachovia securities offers products from more than mutual fund families including its large evergreen family of funds as well as managed portfolios of funds a g edwards which has no in house or proprietary funds offers products from about fund families wachovia also offers a greater selection of alternative investments such as hedge funds and structured products although evergreen offers some strong performers such as its municipal bond fund and its large cap equity fund the funds have been plagued by high manager turnover making for a "mixed bag " said andrew gogerty a mutual fund analyst at morningstar inc wachovia says there are no financial incentives in place that would encourage its advisers to sell in house products rather than say the mutual funds or other investments of other firms but alois pirker a senior analyst at aite group llc said a greater familiarity with wachovias own offerings could make advisers more inclined to offer clients proprietary funds over third party products some a g edwards customers also may find advantages to having an account at a firm with both banking and brokerage operations in an effort to get more of their clients business many firms will dangle higher rates on bank deposits or other perks based on the size and breadth of a customers "relationship" across the firm wells fargo &amp co for example offers free trades to customers who have at least &# across the firm "there will be teaser deals " says richard bove an analyst at punk ziegel &amp co a g edwards customers "will be given all sorts of new products that are more attractively priced at least initially because of the need to keep customers in place " he said technological snafus are also common when financial services companies merge their back office systems but wachovia says it expects minimal if any disruptions because both companies use the same technology system run by the thomson financial unit of thomson corp "disruption should be absent " said mr mattera at wachovia randall smith contributed to this article how a brokerage merger affects you wachovias latest deal will give a g edwardss clients access to new products and services although it may result in higher fees and lower returns for some here are some potential pros and cons potential pros access to wachovias banking products such as checking accounts mortgages and trusts help with financial planning with more managed accounts including portfolios of separately managed accounts mutual funds and exchange traded funds access to more alternative investments such as hedge funds and structured products potential cons rates on idle cash in brokerage accounts could be swept to wachovias insured
