the weekend interview with boone pickens energy independent palm springs calif when you sit down to chat with boone pickens the oil man from oklahoma who is now invested in everything from natural gas to groundwater rights to wildlife preserves you cant help but be impressed by the numbers last year mr pickens earned &# billion from his stake in dallas based bp capital which runs two huge hedge funds that heavily invest in energy his bet that natural gas prices would fall paid off as bp capitals commodity fund returned a whopping after fees when i met him earlier this year near his part time home here mr pickens made clear that at age he is just hitting his stride he introduced me to his wife madeleine who was born in kirkuk iraq and has her own fascinating stories to tell mr pickens was in palm springs in part to speak on philanthropy to a meeting of business leaders run by his fellow oil man charles koch who is a free market advocate like him mr pickens doesnt have to mention he has a lot to give away even after the government gets its share he proudly notes that his accountant has told him he has paid of all the taxes he has ever given to the government since he turned he credits his recent gilded earning years to the fact that while many of his contemporaries are playing a lot of golf he is "still in the game studying the fundamentals you are talking to a geologist who since has drilled more dry holes than anyone as well as the other kind " his research convinces him that the price of oil will average close to &# a barrel this year "youll not see oil below &# again except for very short spikes " the basic reason is that the difference between the worlds daily production of oil and current world wide demand is so tight "eighty five million barrels a day is all the globe can do the demand is right on million barrels a day its quite unusual but it means prices stay high " oil sand deposits from canada will help but mr pickens is increasingly keen on alternative energy sources he views the current ethanol craze as at least partially political "bob dole once told me that there are senators from farm states and that pretty much means the government is going to be into ethanol" given that the product has a btu content thats less than gasoline and analysts often dont factor in the cost of the energy and water needed to grow the corn that goes into it mr pickens is much higher on solar power which he says is "getting in range" to be viable along with natural gas which he touts as a cleaner transportation fuel however last week his ipo for a company planning to use natural gas in bus fleets underperformed when investors snapped up only half the offered shares so mr pickenss enthusiasm may be premature on energy mr pickens quickly dismisses two criticisms frequently lodged against him that he is a speculator whose plays are driving up the price of oil and that he doesnt share the goal of u s energy independence "there isnt anybody who can talk a commodity market up more than three or four minutes the fundamentals will take over at some point " he says bluntly on energy independence he scoffs at congressmen hes talked to who talk up the idea while at the same time they dont want any more drilling onshore or offshore in the u s he thinks he has "had some influence" on president bushs position "he says we are going to become less dependent on middle east oil but he doesnt say were going to be energy independent " mr pickens himself is all about independence born in the small oklahoma town of holdenville he worked for phillips petroleum for only three years after college before he started mesa petroleum with zero reserves and a &# stake he became one of the first independent oilmen to grow his company through acquisitions rather than just exploration in the s he made solicited and unsolicited buyout bids for a passel of oil companies and hit the cover of time magazine his experience studying takeovers convinced him corporate america must put more control in the hands of company shareholders "shareholders should have more seats on corporate boards rather than just have management select them " he says he notes that motorola recently turned down financier carl icahn for a seat on its board on the grounds he wasnt qualified "well if he isnt who do they think is " for his part mr pickenss departure from his own mesa petroleum a decade ago has freed him up to enjoy a second love charitable giving the chronicle of philanthropy listed mr pickens as the fifth largest charitable giver in having given away &# million that year his first passion may be his alma mater oklahoma state to whom he has given nearly &# million over the years much of it to the creation of an athletic village that will make the school competitive in football "im tired of going to homecoming and getting our ass beat " he told me but mr pickens has given away a fortune to other causes including the scottish rite hospital for children in his hometown of dallas &# million the ut southwestern medical center &# million and the american red cross where his &# million gift to aid katrina victims was the largest individual donation in the groups history in public policy mr pickens has supported texans for lawsuit reform run by developer dick weekley "hes the guy that turned the tort problem around for us in texas " mr pickens enthuses nothing that the state no longer has a reputation as a trial lawyer heaven he has also helped fund school choice programs a campaign by americans for prosperity to expose congressional earmark abuse and the media research center which combats liberal media bias he shares with his friend charles koch a belief in a form of performance based philanthropy which concentrates on helping nonprofits that deliver measurable results "i dont want to get into these issues enough that im distracted from what im supposed to be doing " he smiles "i listen to people till i understand what they want to do then i ante up and leave them alone so then i see them every once in a while hear what it is theyre doing if things are looking good and they want more money and i have money i give it it really is about that simple " but whats not simple is the way he is trying to retool how philanthropy is conducted his goal is to use his donations as leverage to encourage his favored causes to try new ways to bring in even more money to that end last year he gave oklahoma state &# million with the proviso that they would find alumni between the ages of and who would agree to have the school take out a &# million life insurance policy for them with the school as the ultimate beneficiary the school promptly found such participants and the first policies went into force this february the specially designed insurance product the school bought has two death benefits the face value of &# million and a second benefit equal to the sum of the premiums that will be paid mr pickens says the program doesnt cost the person whose name its in a dime and the nonprofit school or group will either raise or borrow the funds to buy the policies the insurance company makes its profit by adjusting the premiums so they can make money from the money they bring in while the beneficiary is alive dubbed the "pickens plan " some schools and institutions are working on introducing their own versions mr pickens is clearly excited about changing the face of philanthropy and he aims to do so quickly last december he started a new personal foundation with a &# million gift and made certain it was sunsetted to go out of business upon his death he notes that "all of us have seen foundations that were started with one idea and you couldnt even find that idea in them" after the original founder passed on "ace greenburg the long time ceo of insurance giant aig has said to donors you should give the way boone pickens does give it now see what happens enjoy the results instead of dying and letting it go some place you never see what happened to it i agree with that i cant wait to see what we accomplish " mr pickens is also passionately interested in politics and what kind of leadership the country will have in his life he says hes met only two people "i fully jumped in the boat with" when they were preparing to run for president ronald reagan and rudy giuliani for whom he has become the second biggest fundraiser "he has the kind of tough resolve we need in a crisis " he avers although he makes clear he would enthusiastically back any of the other major republicans should they get the nomination as for reagan whom mr pickens knew well he believes his success was rooted in the fact that people believed he was speaking what he believed to be the truth at the same time reagan had the quality of being very approachable "people thought if they could get minutes with him they could change his mind wrong he gave that appearance not dishonestly but he was really a velvet glove with an iron fist underneath you didnt budge him on core beliefs " nor is mr pickens about to retreat from his views even if they sometimes clash with a few of his free market friends "im an environmentalist because caring for what we have is a reality that is going to be on page one a long time we have got to pay for that and i think we can do that without damaging our economy " mr pickens looks at his watch ive distracted him enough from what hes supposed to be doing making money so he can give more of it away after he leaves the golf course clubhouse where weve had breakfast i calculate that if his hedge fund profits hold up this year he earns &# every hour of a typical business day with the markets now open back east for several hours already it wouldnt surprise me if he now feels he has to make up for lost time mr fund is a columnist for opinionjournal com correction according to boone pickens former bear stearns chairman alan "ace" greenberg once said that donors "should give the way boone pickens does give it now see what happens enjoy the results instead of dying and letting it go some place you never see what happened to it " in the june weekend interview with mr pickens the quote was mistakenly attributed to former chairman of aig maurice "hank" greenberg wsj june
