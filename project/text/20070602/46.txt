pursuits books blessed with a genius for publicity aimee semple mcpherson and the resurrection of christian america by matthew avery sutton harvard pages &# within hours of the rev jerry falwells death in early may the media had mobilized to produce obituaries reflections and not a few angry rants about the founder of the moral majority sometimes treating him as if he were a rare and revolutionary figure but it is fair to say that mr falwell was only the latest of a long line of pulpit borne celebrities eager to re moralize a sinful society in "aimee semple mcpherson and the resurrection of christian america " matthew avery sutton tells the story of one of mr falwells more flamboyant forerunners aimee semple mcpherson or "sister aimee " as she was known was the doyenne of the angelus temple a spiritual palace that opened in in the echo park neighborhood of los angeles for years she witnessed to a crowded flock staging "illustrated sermons" complete with props and costumes her trademark white dress and flowing white cape lent to her sermons a florence nightingale air not to mention a bit of p t barnum she frequently spoke of her devotion to christ as that of a bride to a bridegroom despite having a "high pitched nasal singsong voice " mr sutton writes mcpherson became "the first religious celebrity of the mass media era " embracing "print radio and film for use in her evangelical mission " the mission involved an amalgam of bible based fundamentalism and pentecostal fervor emphasizing christs role in mr suttons summary as "savior baptizer with the holy spirit healer and coming king " sister aimee was an enthusiastic tongues speaker and faith healer she was also a friend of william jennings bryan and foe of evolutionary theory particularly during the scopes trial of she sometimes used her tongue to lash nonspiritual pieties that will feel familiar today one of her sermons in was titled "trial of the modern liberal college professor versus the lord jesus christ " in which she lamented the secular takeover of universities such as princeton and yale when herbert hoover then secretary of commerce cracked down on mcphersons radio station in the s for straying from its designated frequency she sent him a telegram "please order your minions of satan to leave my station alone you cannot expect the almighty to abide by your wave length nonsense " mcpherson has been the subject of other biographies mr sutton has wisely decided not to write another strictly speaking instead he gives an account of mcphersons life within the cultural currents of her time he argues that she had an almost preternatural ability to tap her audiences social fears about immigration for instance or the changing role of women and offer reassurance in the form of simple spiritual storytelling he also portrays her less persuasively as a brave transgressor of gender norms true years before betty friedan published "the feminine mystique " mcpherson cast aside her apron and rid herself of a pesky second husband to pursue her calling "god she believed wanted her to exchange domestic life for the pulpit " mr sutton writes but she also deployed traditional feminine wiles exploiting personal details to win public approval broadcasting live from her nuptial boudoir just a day after marrying her third husband for example she treated radio listeners to the sound of their enthusiastic kisses when the marriage failed she churned out "sacred operas" whose lyrics read like lachrymose sympathy cards "do you live in a castle of broken dreams where giant despair and his dark horde teems " mcphersons life story tells us less about flouting gender norms than about navigating celebritys treacherous terrain as mr sutton demonstrates mass circulation newspapers and magazines helped to make mcpherson famous and to disseminate her message but their appetite for sensationalism also worked against her not that she didnt give them help in sister aimee disappeared from a beach in venice calif igniting a media frenzy when she turned up a month later in a mexican border town with a fantastic story of abduction and escape not everyone believed her an attempt to try her for criminal conspiracy floundered and officials eventually dropped all charges but the whiff of scandal remained afterward mr sutton writes mcpherson "seemed to lose focus on the mission of returning the united states to its christian foundations " she pursued instead "stardom and self fulfillment " according to her disgruntled mother she also pursued a face lift her activities in later life fumbling forays into state politics and passionate patriotism during world war ii she died in never overshadowed her early image as a flashy promoter of the old time religion mcpherson was a compelling spiritual leader to be sure but she was a sorceress when it came to publicity and image management she offered a kind of hollywood religion that traded on spectacle and self made celebrity she did not quite transform conservative protestantism or resurrect christian america but as mr suttons fine book shows she proved to be an emblem of things to come ms rosen the author of "my fundamentalist education a memoir of a divine girlhood " is a fellow at the ethics &amp public policy center in washington
