the gift of a fat wallet a look at pay perks of managing directors feeding the office pac new york early this year a number of recently minted credit suisse group managing directors on wall street got a letter from the firm soliciting donations to its political action committee the recipients were familiar with the pitch which arrives every winter during bonus season but this time around there was a twist the suggested contribution had risen exponentially to &# from the &# requested in prior years the higher target befits an old saying on wall street you pay for your promotion managing director is a coveted title in investment banking which usually follows years of hard work and brings perks like special access to private dining rooms seat upgrades on long flights and envied parking spots but eight years after goldman sachs group inc became the last major street partnership to sell shares to the public securities industry mds are grumbling that what was once the brass ring of promotions has been compromised by rapid growth and corporate belt tightening in most industries cutbacks are serious business jobs are lost and plants are closed but these are the best of times on wall street goldman alone posted a record profit in fiscal of close to &# billion after doling out a record &# billion in compensation and benefits and managing directors who typically make anywhere from &# million to as much as &# million a year can certainly afford to spring for first class airfare themselves "nobody is going to give up being a managing director because the burden of these petty things is too heavy " says roy smith a finance professor at new york universitys stern school of business and a former goldman partner so while this is hardly a sympathetic group everything it would appear is relative life was much cushier for mds before the street was hit with a wave of expansion and public offerings in the s and s and a round of fat trimming after the technology stock bubble burst in for instance early in the s at morgan stanleys offices on lower broadway a cart serving afternoon tea in china cups circulated around four oclock in the afternoon similarly in the years before goldmans ipo the firm handled its partners complex annual tax returns at no charge and each was guaranteed an office after retirement at the time partners were the equivalent of mds these days at goldman mds can still hire tax accountants on the firm but the retiree offices have vanished the more an employee makes the more he or she pays for membership at the firms downtown manhattan gym where monthly fees range from &# for lowly associates to &# for mds and the price didnt go down last year when the firm ended the clubs exclusivity by allowing residents of the apartments upstairs to join corporate retreats that might once have been funded by the firm are now out of pocket expenses in many cases goldmans technology media and telecommunications banking group is now used to footing the bill for its annual ski retreat in park city utah according to past participants which sets mds back &# and more senior "partner" mds back &# for airfare hotel lodging and food for the whole team of roughly but the group throws its senior ranks a bone says one participant by letting them defray the payments by &# in exchange for enough frequent flier miles to purchase a round trip fare at credit suisse the investment banking arm of the zurich bank mds in the london office at canary wharf pay more than twice as much as the gbp or about &# a month that more junior employees are charged for parking at lehman brothers holdings inc mds can fly first class on business trips but only if they are traveling internationally on a red eye and heading straight to the office stopping for a shower is permitted new mds may also find that traditional perks are scarce this years md class at j p morgan chase &amp co named in early april found that the old gym had been shuttered some time ago by company chief executive james dimon in an attempt to cut costs at the same time the th floor "partners" dining room which sports a simple style but panoramic views had just come under renovation exiling mds to a more institutional th floor lunchroom with a view of neighboring bear stearns cos in either location mds must pay &# to &# per person per meal in meal taxes some firms have further diluted the titles meaning at bear stearns there are about "senior" managing directors compared with about plain vanilla mds who can make considerably less likewise at goldman the regular mds are known as "md lite" because the bigger goal is to become a "partner" managing director one of about people who are part of the firms most elite ranks at bear last december the new senior managing directors received a bottle of champagne from firm president warren spector who made &# million last year and are now entitled to free lunch at an exclusive dining room and access to a series of presentations by u s presidential candidates because of a company policy mandating that smds give of their total annual compensation to charity some of them also received a round of email solicitations from organizations like meals on wheels and the autism society of america at the smd level philanthropic giving is "something youre going to have to do " says danielle schaefer who became an smd in december and sees the policy as a way for employees who werent previously involved with charities to step up employees receive tax deductions for their giving but the firm itself gets no direct benefit says a spokeswoman bear executive committee member alan "ace" greenberg who ran the firm for decades put the policy in place in the late s "i just thought it would be setting a good example for the people that worked here " he says he estimates that smds give an average of &# to &# to charity each year others share his view in morgan stanley president john mack who made md along with eight or nine others in and is now the firms ceo raised a total of &# million for a new childrens hospital in manhattan partly by cajoling the firms senior executives into donating these days mr mack remains involved with the facility the morgan stanley childrens hospital and volunteered for a spot in the dunking booth at the firms carnival fund raiser last fall
