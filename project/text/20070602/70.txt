pursuits travel asia a return to china amid a tide of homecomings a granddaughter visits the land her family left in my grandfather happily announced to the crowded train in china that he was taking me to our "lao jia " or our familys original hometown in shandong province china "she wants to get in touch with her roots " he said "she was born and raised in the u s you know " another passenger our "lao xiang " or countryman also from shandong turned to me and nodded knowingly "then you must know for chinese people the blood that binds us is thicker than any body of water that separates us " i was on my way for the first time to my grandfather tim chaos hometown a city called dezhou to meet a part of my family i had known only through photographs and stories told over the dinner table at home in new york where i was born my grandfather along with two million others during the chinese civil war had left china and his family in to begin a life in taipei taiwan then the u s while our family in mainland china lived isolated under communist rule and then through the cultural revolution for over three decades while these trips follow in the long u s tradition of immigrants returning to their roots its particularly acute for me my grandfathers journey is coming full circle this past year i spent four months working in the beijing bureau of the wall street journal where i hope to return this summer dezhou a relatively poor but improving city about a hour train ride from beijing is a very different place from what my grandfather remembers he speaks wistfully about the sweet watermelon fresh dates and "jian bing " or paper thin circular sheets made from corn meal he recalls from childhood these days jian bing is considered tasteless "old fashioned" food by his grand nieces my cousins but the most striking difference and perhaps the most painful for my grandfather is the difference between him and his year old brother zhao dongfeng who has spent his life in china my grandfathers english family name is spelled chao because he moved to taiwan where the chinese to english spelling system is different my grandfather and dongfeng had similar childhoods in dezhou they were both considered to be tall at the time my grandfather at feet inches and my great uncle at feet inches both played basketball and both became teachers as the older son my grandfather went to college first at beijing normal university he was in beijing until dec less than two months before the day the kuomintang party surrendered the city to communist troops without a fight during the chinese civil war on the night of dec the day my grandfather turned down an offer to leave mainland china with his cousin my great grandfather showed up at my grandfathers door to persuade him to seize the opportunity to go to taiwan the family wanted him to take every opportunity he could as a young man not knowing what was going to happen in china or when hed see his family again my grandfather reluctantly boarded a ship he left with no time to go home to say goodbye to dongfeng or his younger sister zhao jianxin and cousins it was the first time he had ever seen the ocean and the last time he would ever see his father he was the same age i am now no one knew when my grandfather would be able to return but escaping the chaos and uncertainty at home seemed like a chance worth taking in soon after he left china became isolated under communist rule and his family had to sever all ties with him and anyone from outside of the country for fear of persecution he lost touch with his entire family for years as news of mao zedongs death in and later the beginning of chinas economic reform under deng xiaoping spread around the world my grandfather wrote a letter to the chinese embassy in pleading for help in finding his family he told them who he was and where he once lived and less than six weeks later they sent him his brothers and sisters addresses his father had died years earlier and his mother had just passed away my grandfather flew back to china for the first time in october and had a tearful reunion the next month with his siblings in beijing the three squeezed into one bed in a rented room toured the city together for the very first time and took several photographs under maos portrait above tiananmen square the family reunions for people like my grandfather are enough of a phenomenon that some china focused travel agents devote a significant part of their business to them at cnc travel express a travel agency in flushing queens a neighborhood that is considered to be a satellite chinatown in new york travelers who were separated as a result of the revolution make up about half of its reunion trip business in million people visited friends and relatives in china according to market researcher euromonitor international up since a figure thats expected to grow again next year when china hosts the olympics since that first trip my grandfather has returned times each trip has been more emotional than the previous one because of his age and his brothers deteriorating health now at pounds and looking at least years younger than his years my grandfather weighs almost twice as much as his cheerful but frail brother whose leathery skin gives away the years of hardship he endured before and during the cultural revolution including a stomach problem that was never properly cared for he had hoped to submit applications to bring the two and their families to new york to stay with him but he was never able to bring his brother sister and their families altogether a group of people to the u s because there simply wasnt a way to uproot and support so many people who speak no english his brothers and sisters children grew up in impoverished conditions in a poor province during the communist era but their grandchildren now live happily without memories of the difficulty their parents and grandparents underwent during chinas transformations they were born in the mid to late s after chinas economic reform began sitting at a lively dinner table with people laughing and drinking together it was almost easy to forget we had any differences at all to celebrate our homecoming which both my grandfather and i were a little jittery about when we pulled into dezhou station my relatives made at least a dozen dishes for every meal cracked open at least half a dozen bottles of "bai jiu " or a popular alcoholic drink in china made from rice and made hundreds of steamy dumplings from scratch just the way my grandfather remembers them from his childhood they told me they werent allowed to host dinner parties under maos leadership they showed me photos of the family taken since the early s and a book of wedding photos my great aunt took with her husband when they were already married over years they never got to take any when they were actually married we sang karaoke i sang some older taiwanese pop songs theyd never heard of and they sang revolutionary songs from the cultural revolution each of my aunts uncles and cousins say they want to meet my parents who have been to to china but never to my grandfathers hometown and my grandmother who has returned to china only once since leaving for taiwan in "i know that some of our relatives arent ready to meet us " said zhao xin my great uncles second daughter "but were ready to meet them we understand that we have different cultures and weve come to accept it " i agreed with her but we both knew it was unlikely that everyone in my family in the u s would be convinced to visit them some feel disconnected and others might feel the meeting would be too uncomfortable despite the differences between my grandfather and his brother the two mens faces light up every time they see each other again before we left they embraced and then held on briefly in silence there is no way to know whether my grandfather will have enough energy to return again this year the two made uncertain promises to meet again soon and reluctantly said goodbye
