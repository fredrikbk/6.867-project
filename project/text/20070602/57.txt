pursuits food &amp drink wine notes in the years we have been writing our tastings column which appears on fridays we have received thousands of questions about wine from readers in this column we answer some questions that touch on common themes we have edited the questions for space if you have a question drop us a note at wine wsj com be sure to include your full name city and state storing screw tops i just bought a case of australian shiraz the bottles have screw tops of which i certainly approve and i stored the wine in a cool place by placing the case on its side i later thought that was stupid with screw tops it should not matter if the bottles are on their side or straight up am i missing something ed morsman deephaven minn the reason to lay wine on its side is to keep the cork moist that prevents the cork from shrinking and letting air seep in and ruin the wine because this would not seem to be an issue with screw tops we wouldnt think it would matter but since most racks are made for laying down wines wed probably lay the wines on their side anyway david adelsheim of oregons adelsheim vineyard who uses screw tops on some of his wines agrees and sees no reason to keep a screw top wine on its side "there is nothing that can absorb the wine which is why you store wines with corks on their side to make a seal " he told us "because there is no cork there is not something that needs to be wet to be the seal even if you had a red wine and you were going to store it for a long time youd still store it vertically you would want all the sediment on the bottom of the bottle " but we happened to be talking with genevieve janssens director of winemaking at robert mondavi winery so we asked what she thought and her viewpoint was different "it depends on the selection of the screw cap closure and how the cases have been handled during bottling storing and shipping " she told us "the integrity of the screw cap closure is very sensitive to how the cases have been stacked during bottling storing and shipping it is easy to damage the seal of the screw cap if there is too much weight on it we assume that the screw cap has not lost its integrity if the screw cap has an impermeable liner the way it is stored does not matter the wine wont age any more in the bottle and storing the wine closure up wont affect the ageability if the wine has been closed with a screw cap with permeable liner the wine will be oxidized slowly over the years and the bottle should be aged on its side " because the liquid will help to create a seal because its hard to know which bottles have a permeable seal shed recommend keeping all screw top bottles on their side she added "overall we dont really know the potential future of this closure and at robert mondavi winery the screw cap closure is on observation i am not yet convinced of the virtue " more and more good wines are being bottled with screw tops these days and pretty much everything about screw tops especially their effect on aging is the subject of heated debate at the moment so there are many opinions on this
