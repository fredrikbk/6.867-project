pursuits books two lives entwined love and its costs necessary sins by lynn darling dial pages &# i met lee lescaze by telex in october i had just started a junior job in the washington posts london office and had been sent to do a story for mondays paper about that years winner of the &# enrico fermi award it must have been a slow news day overnight i received a message from lescaze an assistant foreign editor it made an indelible impression because it was about my first byline in the paper "fronted your fermi " the note said "rejiggered to make less dry if not more wet " what that meant was that my story was on page one but rewritten from top to bottom to make it more interesting i was both thrilled and chagrined well you have to start somewhere and i couldnt have started with a better rewrite man that lee lescaze over time my relationship with lee evolved we became colleagues as reporters and editors in washington in war ravaged indochina and later in new york we were also close friends lee died of cancer in july with "necessary sins " lees widow lynn darling has chronicled their life together and the events from joyous to unbearably sad that surrounded their relationship in her acknowledgments my wife and i are thanked for our friendship and for being as ms darling puts it "an inestimable link to someone we all hold dear " i am clearly in no position to write a conventional review of "necessary sins " but the book does allow me to reflect on lees life and to praise without any claim to objectivity the poignant honesty of ms darlings account lee lescaze was the son of a celebrated swiss born architect of the bauhaus period who had come to live in the u s lee himself grew up in a townhouse in midtown manhattan eventually attending a new england prep school and harvard by the mid s he was launched as a reporter and editor at the washington post and soon enough to use the old phrase as a foreign correspondent his dispatches from vietnam especially during the bloody tet offensive of were notable for their emotional toughness and writing flair he was dashing and dapper with a droll wit that could turn biting after a few drinks he had a serious interest in art and literature combined with a newsmans fascination with war politics and poker the story of lee and lynn begins around a heady time at the post it was still the era of ben bradlee the charismatic editor and of katharine graham the legendary publisher the newspaper had emerged triumphant from the watergate years and now vibrated with ambition and energy as its circulation and status rose lee was then the posts white house correspondent lynn years his junior was a dazzling feature writer in the papers style department ms darling describes how a flirtation with lee then a married man with three children turned into an affair it is clear from her account that both were quickly aware of the dangers of what they were doing they obviously felt intoxicated by the good fortune of their having found each other and thrilled by their new found love but the stakes were high within the rapture and fresh sense of possibility there was to judge by ms darlings telling an intimation of ordeal an awareness of the pain they were causing others and inevitably themselves the scenes of ms darlings first difficult attempts to get to know lees young children are especially vivid when lee was named assistant managing editor in charge of style their relationship became known to the rest of the post newsroom and naturally occasioned a certain amount of clucking more important katharine graham it was believed did not approve lee and lynn realized that their days at the post were numbered now officially a couple they married in they left the post and moved to new york lynn worked for newsday and later esquire and harpers bazaar lee went to the wall street journal where among other things he served as foreign editor and was instrumental in developing the journals weekend section eventually launched in they settled in a downtown loft and began a new life together then in lees year old son adrien was killed in a washington car accident a tragedy so profound that it subsumed all that preceded it the birth of a daughter zoe revived their lives until the summer of when lee was diagnosed with the vengeful cancer that killed him months later the loft became a bunker in which lee and lynn together with zoe fought the waves of pain and despair lees illness was an inexorable and harrowing assault but until the last days i can personally testify he remained a suave and engaged companion i cant imagine that lees first family is entirely comfortable with seeing this story told in such a public way his first wife becky now happily remarried and his two daughters with families of their own have no particular reason to share what happened with the rest of us but the books justifying purpose is as a testament to humanity in all its confusion hurt love and resilience at lees last birthday party there were eight of us at the apartment including becky "necessary sins" is literally a labor of love it is moving without being maudlin unsparing without being unkind at many points the people it portrays might have done things differently but life seems to run that way such qualities help to make "necessary sins" something of a universal story i came away persuaded that you do not have to know these people or the glamorous milieu in which they lived and worked to care about them deeply as you would the characters in a fine novel mr osnos is the founder and editor at large of publicaffairs books
