european consumers lift spending london europes economic upswing could spread to consumer spending in coming months making it less dependent on export growth and business investment if the trend in recent data is maintained surveys released friday showed consumer spending in the euro currency zone has rebounded after a weak start to the year while the manufacturing sector isnt growing quite as fast as in recent months overall growth in the european economy is unlikely to slow greatly before the year ends making it increasingly likely the european central bank will raise interest rates again after a widely expected increase this coming week a survey of purchasing managers at manufacturers across the euro zone showed growth in may was its slowest in months though still remaining strong that appears to reflect the combined effects of higher interest rates a stronger euro and a sharper than expected slowdown in the u s gross domestic product figures for the first quarter showed that trade was a drag on growth reversing the situation in the final quarter of last year when exports made a big contribution but the slowdown in the manufacturing sector may not spell the end of the euro zone growth story consumer spending fell in the first quarter but appears to have started the second quarter with a bang as german retail sales posted a monthly gain in april some of that may be a short lived catch up with consumers having stayed on the sidelines during the first three months of the year after a german sales tax increase in january but the euro zones unemployment rate fell to in april the lowest in a quarter century and with confidence increasing the pickup in consumer spending is likely to prove durable
