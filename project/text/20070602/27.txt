family dynamics behind the bancrofts shift at dow jones mounting pressure from dissident wing raises odds of a sale when members of dow jones &amp co s controlling bancroft family gathered days ago for a meeting at a boston hotel they expected a fight some wanted to entertain a &# billion bid for the company by rupert murdochs news corp but michael elefante a powerful dow jones director and family trustee had opposed it instead of a rebuff the family members got a huge surprise mr elefante had switched sides mr elefante a partner at a law firm that had represented the family for decades told the group that for dow jones to remain competitive he now believed the family needed to explore a sale to mr murdoch or another bidder according to people familiar with the presentation a look inside the familys deliberation shows four crucial factors laid the groundwork for the bancrofts dramatic change of position one was the shift by mr elefante a boston lawyer who oversees the familys trusts a rift in the member family widened as an increasingly noisy wing especially those in the younger generation agitated for mr murdochs offer to be considered in a presentation to the board weeks earlier about the deals pros and cons dow jones chief executive richard zannino had starkly laid out to the family the downside of shutting the door finally competition was getting fiercer than ever with business information providers reuters group plc and thomson corp announcing merger plans all this made it harder for the family to resist the rich premium of mr murdochs offer on thursday evening the new stance surfaced at a special dow jones board meeting the bancroft family said in a statement that it wants to meet mr murdoch to discuss his bid and it will consider other bidders as well the family which controls of dow joness voting power cautioned that a sale isnt a certainty but it said the "mission of dow jones may be better accomplished in combination or collaboration with another organization which may include news corp " on friday investors bid up shares of dow jones which owns the wall street journal by nearly to &# in new york stock exchange p m composite trading that was above mr murdochs &# a share offer in an interview friday mr murdoch said "everybody thinks &# is a terrific offer we dont have any secret plans to pay more " the family is planning to meet with mr murdoch on monday according to people familiar with the matter peter mcpherson the chairman of the dow jones board will join them these people say in the month since mr murdochs offer became public the family has experienced conflict and turmoil family members have switched sides sniped at each other in emails and fought about meetings two important family members didnt even attend the pivotal may meeting where mr elefante announced his change of heart in a lengthy email to family members sent thursday william cox iii a longtime family dissident complained that he had been excluded from decision making by his relatives and that they didnt have "the foggiest idea about what is going on " looming over all the discussion is the big premium mr murdoch is offering for dow jones shares which is more than the companys stock price before the offer became public the bancrofts have prized their role as protectors of the journals journalistic integrity for years a number of them distrust mr murdochs media conglomerate and have worried he would subordinate the journals independence to his own business and political interests in recent years however a slowdown in advertising has squeezed the newspaper business and dow joness stock price lagged mr murdoch and others contend that dow joness generous dividend on which bancroft family members rely for income hinders the company from investing in new initiatives the predicament has created a set of conflicts for the bancrofts including the pull of family pride against a duty to all shareholders and the split of older family members who hold more power and younger ones who have less in his email thursday mr cox presented his case for why the company should be sold "murdoch is someone who knows the industry and sees the future " he wrote just two weeks ago mr coxs father william cox jr said publicly that dow jones would be "ruined" if it were sold to mr murdoch mr murdochs representatives spent months laying the groundwork for an offer in late september the younger mr cox was approached in rome where he lives by a murdoch representative people familiar with the situation say during a meeting at an outside cafe the murdoch representative said news corp would be willing to bid just under &# a share for dow jones but that it would be several months before it could formally make the offer because of other ongoing transactions these people say at the bancroft family annual meeting in boston in october mr cox told other family members and trustees of the offer the people said some in the family didnt take the approach seriously because it wasnt formal mr murdoch confirmed friday that the contacts had been made in the ensuing months the murdoch representatives continued their contact with family members gauging sentiment and advising them that an offer would be coming soon according to people familiar with the matter mr murdoch broached the idea to mr zannino the dow jones ceo at a breakfast march mr zannino passed word to the board the company and the bancrofts privately received mr murdochs offer in mid april their first instinct was to explore it but two members changed their minds according to people familiar with the situation that shifted the vote to a solid "no " the bid was made public may and dow jones announced the same day that of the companys voting power was opposed to considering a deal almost immediately some family members began to worry whether they had acted too hastily leslie hill a dow jones director confided to family members and others that she didnt feel comfortable with her vote according to people familiar with the matter ms hill a retired american airlines pilot didnt return calls seeking comment however it took time to reverse course partly because the family lacks a leader it primarily has relied on its advisers for guidance in particular mr elefante the lawyer who serves as a trustee dow jones director and personal attorney for some bancrofts enjoys the confidence of some in the family others say mr elefante is conflicted in his multiple roles as a dow jones director he is obligated to look after the interests of all shareholders as a trustee he must protect the interests of the full bancroft family and as a personal lawyer he represents his clients interests a person close to mr elefante says the interests of his various constituencies related to dow jones are almost always in alignment and he takes pains to avoid any conflicts the family also needed time to adjust to the relatively new chief executive mr zannino he had risen to the job in february and impressed family members with his business judgment but as a financial executive he differed in tone and style from the journalists who had previously run dow jones at a special board meeting on may mr zannino laid out the opportunities a news corp tie up might present such as better marketing and distribution of the journal he said that if the offer were turned down directors might face pressure from holders of class a dow jones shares which have only one tenth the voting power of the class b shares mostly held by the bancrofts and their trusts mr zannino wanted bancroft family members to understand that when they turned down &# a share "they were turning it down for a long time " says a person who saw the presentation mr zannino who has repeatedly said he isnt taking a position on the offer also outlined the advantages of rebuffing mr murdoch he said that would protect dow joness journalistic independence later some family members would say that mr zanninos presentation helped plant the seeds of the idea that the status quo at dow jones was no longer acceptable at the time however there was something of a backlash against the presentation several directors felt that the way mr zannino lined up the pluses and minuses suggested he favored the deal according to three people familiar with board discussions if the ceo were taking a position he would be thrusting himself into a decision that family members felt rightly belonged to themselves in a later discussion of the offer two dow jones directors voiced concern about mr zanninos presentation ms hill and harvey golub chairman of campbell soup co and former american express co chief mr mcpherson nonexecutive chairman of the dow jones board and president of the national association of state universities and land grant colleges said he would relay the concerns to mr zannino according to a person familiar with the discussion after learning of the directors impressions of his presentation mr zannino sent an email to the board with an attached letter dated may "im writing to follow up on my comments at last wednesdays board meeting " he wrote "my sole intention in making these comments was to summarize the pros and cons of selling or not selling dow jones " mr zannino stressed his commitment to the company whether or not it remained a stand alone entity "as ceo im totally committed to doing everything in my power to help dow joness continued success " he wrote he said he appreciated "the confidence of the bancroft family in this great company " on friday mr zannino reiterated "i have not advocated any position on the offer and am focused on running the business " soon bancroft family members in favor of exploring a sale began to mobilize leading this group were a number of the hill siblings they are grandchildren of jessie bancroft cox the feisty matriarch of the clan who together with her sister had safeguarded dow joness independence for decades in the initial vote taken by mr elefante the hills mother jane macelree had voted against opening negotiations family members say she was swayed by her older brother the elder mr cox who worked as a dow jones employee for many years but many of her seven children believed she and others had acted rashly while the family traditionally entrusted dow jones to "the professionals " the hills had concluded that the familys passive stewardship was hurting the companys competitiveness they had also become frustrated with mr elefantes initial position opposing the murdoch bid and were skeptical about whether he was serving the familys best interests after mr murdochs private approach mr elefante solicited opinions only from trustees of bancroft family trusts that hold dow jones shares and from individual bancrofts who directly own the super voting class b shares though mr elefante wasnt compelled to ask all family members some of those who didnt get advance word of the murdoch offer were upset that anger gave new currency to longstanding complaints that the trustees favored the older generation of bancrofts in challenging mr elefante the hills had two ready family allies elisabeth goth chelberg and the younger mr cox in the late s the pair drew the ire of the other family members by raising questions about managements strategy they focused on the companys purchase of telerate a provider of market data the deal ultimately led to losses of more than &# billion for dow jones back then many relatives were bitter that the pair went public with their criticism the two continued to have concerns about the companys future and like the hills they didnt believe the family should dismiss mr murdochs bid out of hand in a flurry of telephone calls and email messages the hills sought to win other cousins over to their camp they argued that planned merger of reuters and thomson would threaten dow jones newswires which competes with the two companies in providing business information they warned that the "status quo" wasnt tenable dow jones they believed was simply too small and starved of cash on may the hills got new ammunition for their case a personal letter from mr murdoch in which he repeated his promise to protect the journals editorial ideals and asked for a meeting the next day hemenway &amp barnes mr elefantes firm organized a conference call with family members to discuss the letter and other recent developments the call consisted mainly of a presentation by the familys bankers and lawyers once again the challenges posed by the reuters thomson tie up were dissected as were the broader challenges faced by the newspaper industry the bankers arguments left many in the family doubting whether dow jones could survive as an independent company some participants wanted to discuss how to proceed but when one family member tried to solicit the familys opinion on the situation he was cut off according to two people on the call frustrated that the advisers were stifling debate the hills and their allies began trying to set up a family meeting to discuss how to proceed according to attendees some of the older family members were opposed preferring to let hemenway &amp barnes continue manage the situation tensions rose when christopher bancroft a dow jones board member who lives in texas said he wouldnt attend the meeting the younger mr cox blasted him in an email forwarded to entire family "you are representing the interests of the entire bancroft family outside shareholders and professional trustees " mr cox wrote on may "you not being present shows a total disregard for every group you represent in matters that confront all concerned " mr bancroft retorted that "if there is a real need for my company i will be there " mr bancroft didnt attend the may meeting neither did the elder mr cox who said he "could care less" what was discussed it turned out to be an important moment the meeting convened shortly after a m at the bostonian across the street from the offices of hemenway &amp barnes representatives of each of the familys three branches attended concerned about leaks some participants suggested the family members sign nondisclosure agreements and they did the hill siblings were ready to confront mr elefante it soon became clear that would hardly be necessary the lawyer spoke for just five minutes at the beginning of the meeting he said he had changed his position he mentioned the reuters thomson deal and said dow jones was in a tight situation competitively it was time to explore a sale he said while adding that he didnt necessarily advocate it then he turned to the family and asked its views ms macelree listened in silence according to a person familiar with the matter another family member elizabeth steele who is also on the dow jones board said her branch of the family had concluded it lacked the "appetite for risk" involved in having dow jones go it alone in such a competitive environment this person says but ms steele didnt say whether she and her family were willing to push to explore alternatives there was some acrimony even among those who were generally on the same side ms hill accused the younger mr cox of leaking information about the familys deliberations a charge he denied according to people familiar with the matter on the whole though those present agreed that the family needed to push for some kind of action these people says afterward family members filed outside the meeting room for a lunch of sandwiches and salad updating each other on their children and lives people present say then they reassembled in the meeting room where mr elefante said he and the other trustees would give due consideration to their view that it was time to change the status quo and get back to them this person says family advisers began drafting a news release that would summarize the familys new view to outward appearances the family was still solidly against accepting mr murdochs overture in an interview with the journal that appeared a day after the familys boston meeting mr bancroft indicated his lack of interest in the news corp bid "im open to any situation that benefits the wall street journal and dow jones and its shareholders " he said "at the moment i dont see anything that would do that " some bancrofts worried that his comments would scare off other potential suitors something mr bancroft hadnt intended even relatives who share his views said they were surprised that he said it publicly early this past week mr elefante told mr mcpherson he wanted arrange a telephone board meeting to update the board on the familys position the dow jones board arranged to meet by phone at p m thursday mr elefante kept the details of the familys views a secret until less than an hour before it started he began by reading the familys news release the companys directors peppered him with questions trying to understand the implications of the statement attendees say did the family intend to put the company in play mr elefante did most of the talking for the family attendees say the three other family representatives on the dow jones board mrs hill mrs steele and mr bancroft said little mr mcpherson suggested that the four directors representing the family drop off the call to allow the companys nonfamily directors to discuss the statement mr elefante suggested that if the remaining directors agreed the family could stay on the line and join the discussion after consulting with richard i beattie a lawyer at simpson thacher &amp bartlett representing the board mr mcpherson went back on the call and told the family representatives they should drop off the remaining directors discussed what to do mr golub the campbell soup chairman suggested directors might not need to put out a release about "exploration of alternatives " a signal the company was for sale attendees say lewis campbell the chairman of the boards governance committee retorted "we have a knife to our throats " according to attendees "we have no choice " when the family members rejoined the call mr mcpherson informed them that the board had decided to release its own statement saying that the board would explore strategic options attendees say mr bancroft interjected "wait a minute " he said according to attendees "my family didnt understand that this meant we were for sale " mr beattie the boards lawyer responded by saying that key parts of the familys statement which he read aloud strongly suggested that notion mr bancroft then asked mrs steele if she understood the implication of the familys statement attendees say she said she did ms hill also said she understood the implications according to the attendees a participant asked mr elefante if he could say where the family stood on the murdoch offer attendees say mr elefante responded only that there was "consensus" among family members in support of their statement attendees say "is it too late for us to withdraw our statement " mr bancroft asked mr beattie responded by saying he was logged onto the internet and the wall street journal had just posted the statement on its web site minutes later the statement was formally released a person close to the family expressed some displeasure with the boards statement saying it went beyond what the family had hoped "we were not asking the board to put the company on the block " this person said ultimately he said the family will make the decision
