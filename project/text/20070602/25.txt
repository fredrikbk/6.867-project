high gas prices expose demagoguery and ignorance of economics why should big oil be exempt from the wrath of our "representatives " "pains at the pump " review &amp outlook may i worry that a growing share of this country led by politicians who practice class warfare to advance their own standing is being reduced to its least common denominator "i want what you have and i dont want to work for it " it goes like this gas prices are too high well forget about the fact that my car gets lousy mileage i am a victim of big oil social security medicare is a mess and im not sure if i will get benefits well obviously the rich people in this country are not paying their fair share i bought a house i can no longer afford must be wrongdoing on the part of my real estate agent or maybe my banker how did we get to the point where our elected officials as you said in the editorial "who elected these guys " appeal to basic instincts like envy they tell "us" what we want to hear knowing full well that there is no free lunch once of the people realizes they can vote themselves a raise at the expense of the other where will it end i would like to think america had a reputation as an entrepreneurial market driven environment where hard work pays off you point out that the government bears some of the blame for the situation we find ourselves in with gas prices if congress were a company it would be under assault from the shareholders my worry is that the politicians might wreak the same havoc on all that has been built over the past years i pray that i am wrong but i cant remember the last time i was positively surprised by washington d c bill dierker columbus ohio your editorial rightfully condemned the congressional pandering behind the house legislation on gasoline "price gouging " winston churchill recognized the inherent demagoguery in such activities as conveyed in this quote from world war ii "the multitudes remained plunged in ignorance of the simplest economic facts and their leaders seeking their votes did not dare to undeceive them " however evidently churchill believed that those governing actually had a basic knowledge of economics a very doubtful assumption when applied to todays elected representatives it is appalling that a legislator in the modern era can be functionally ignorant of basic economics roger w cohen durango colo u s gasoline imports plus u s gasoline production thus far in have been a bit above million gallons per day gasoline consumption has hovered just under million gallons per day gasoline inventories have been fairly steady at billion gallons sounds pretty balanced if statistics are not good enough perhaps anecdotal evidence would be useful when was the last time you saw a sign at a gas station saying "out of gas" so perhaps "pains at the pump" could be rewritten along a slightly different line of logic gasoline supply demand and inventories are reasonably balanced so why have prices doubled in just a few years and why do retail prices continue to climb while the congressional move to outlaw price gouging is not brilliant even a legislator can see that there is a problem with the gasoline market pricing mechanism jeff green colonial heights va see related letter "letters to the editor gasoline market pricing are mechanisms needed " wsj june
