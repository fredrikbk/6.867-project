pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink cool punch for a hot day when i heard that a friend of mine jan boyer was flying to visit his mother josefina clara alberti in her native spain i asked him to bring me back something from his trip his mothers recipe for sangria jan soon sent me an email from his moms house where a heated debate on the merits of competing recipes had just ended also visiting jans octogenarian mother was an old friend of hers from mexico where sangria is a quite different concoction than it is in spain the recipe championed by ms alberti was solidly in the spanish tradition wine brandy assorted sweet fruits sugar and soda her friend susana manterola insisted on wine lime and sugar who was right well see a few weeks ago i talked about how that singular yankee invention the cocktail made its way to europe via the great paris exposition of iced mixed drinks were featured in the fairs american restaurant and soon were all the rage on the continent europe returned the favor almost exactly a century later the spanish pavilion at the new york worlds fair featured impressive works of art old and new paintings by el greco goya and velazquez competed with a trio of picassos a pair of dalis and a miro but what really drew crowds was the sangria the spanish drink and the entrees too were so successful that when the fair was over one of the restaurant managers alberto heras stayed on in new york and opened a restaurant called "the spanish pavilion " it was a hit and sangria enjoyed a brief burst of fashionability in a article on "whats in " time magazine declared that classic cocktails had been shown the door "old fashioneds these days are oldfashioned manhattan has become a tight little island without manhattans " vodka drinks were all the rage it seems and "sangria a spanish punch combining red or white wine with fruit syrup and seltzer has made a host of converts " but by the s sangria had developed a reputation as the sort of drink favored by impoverished grad students a way to make plonk palatable when frank schoonmaker in his "encyclopedia of wine " wanted to describe the sad state of a spanish wine called priorat he dismissed it as being "often used in sangria and other wine punches " priorat has now improved so dramatically that the journals wine columnists dorothy gaiter and john brecher declare "today anyone who used priorat in sangria would be subject to arrest in states plus the district of columbia " they certainly have a point about priorat a good bottle of which goes for &# to &# but that doesnt mean one has to resort to two buck chuck or its spanish equivalent a chef friend long ago told me that when making coq au vin and other grapey recipes there was one simple rule dont cook with any wine you wouldnt drink that goes double for making any wine based cup if its not good enough to drink alone its not good enough to put in a drink though ill admit that vincent astor who inherited some &# million when his father went down with the titanic took the principle a bit too far in the s well before most americans had ever heard of sangria astor had developed a taste for the stuff according to biographer john gates though astor was a generous philanthropist in his personal life he could be "remarkably stingy " but one place he didnt pinch pennies was in making sangria astor was known to astonish waiters by asking for a bottle of dom perignon a bottle of la tache one of the great vintages of that fine burgundy and then instructing them to mix the wines together with cucumbers and plenty of fruit to make the most aristocratic of sangrias if not grand bourgogne and not box wine what should one buy for sangria david bueno the sommelier at taberna del alabardero a haut spanish restaurant that is one of my favorite places to eat in washington recommends a modest but perfectly pleasant spanish grenache such as the fruity vina borgia which i was able to find for about &# a bottle and indeed it made for excellent sangria but there would be nothing criminal about putting a slightly more refined grenache such as el chaparral in the pitcher the recipe that was used by the restaurants of the spanish pavilion at the worlds fair makes for a very dry and elegant sangria to one bottle of red spanish wine was added a couple of ounces each of spanish brandy which is fuller and nuttier than cognac and cointreau one lemon and half an orange cut into slices a couple of dozen ice cubes ounces of club soda and only two tablespoons of sugar but a slightly sweeter and fruitier sangria is more satisfying and thats the sort i got when i mixed up the recipes given to me by jan boyers mother and the taberna del alabarderos mr bueno both call for using a sweet lemony soda like up instead of club soda both call for more fruit diced peaches apples and oranges and mr buenos version adds a couple of ounces of peach liqueur the result is an absolutely delicious summer cooler what of ms manterolas mexican sangria recipe which is also common to the west indies i have to admit i was leery oranges peaches apples even lemons all those fruits i could imagine harmonizing with the grape but for whatever reason the thought of lime juice in wine made my mouth reflexively pucker i tried it anyway and my instincts proved decidedly wrong though i prefer the sort of sangria made by taberna del alabardero and jan boyers mother the simple wine lime and sugar version from mexico is a worthy alternative email me at eric felten wsj com sangria adapted from taberna del alabardero and josefina
