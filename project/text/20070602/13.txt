cross country downsizing government harrisburg pa two years ago lawmakers in this city learned how costly a raise can be voters reacted to a pay hike rushed through the legislature in the dead of night with a backlash at the ballot box in the two election cycles that followed republicans lost control of the state house two incumbent state senators went down in defeat and even state supreme court justice russell nigro was turned out of office the lesson is simple act in accordance to the peoples wishes or be held accountable on election day thats why this year i am again proposing to target the very size of state legislature which has grown too comfortable in the use of power by cutting the number of seats in both the house and senate ive introduced legislation that would reduce the number of senate seats to from and shrink the house to seats from i also want the general assembly to slice its &# million budget which pays for staff office supplies and other items by a corresponding a smaller government should be a less expensive government shrinking the size of the general assembly is not something that can be done lightly and one concern ive heard is that fewer legislative seats will force elected officials to lose touch with constituents its a legitimate concern but if we compare pennsylvania to the other three states with full time legislatures california michigan and new york the change isnt overly drastic pennsylvania now has senatorial districts that roughly contain residents and house districts that contain about in california senatorial districts have people and house districts with in michigan the numbers are and and in new york senators represent while the house covers under my proposal pennsylvanias state senators would represent approximately and state representatives would have about constituents even cutting the size of our legislature pennsylvanians will have smaller districts than any other state with a full time legislative body with the exception of the michigan senate opponents say larger districts would mean less interaction between legislators and average citizens but new technologies make it much easier to stay in touch with voters than in when the current size of the legislature was set email alone has made it infinitely easier to communicate teleconferencing also allows lawmakers to hear from constituents without having to travel great distances simply put increasing the size of house and senate districts is no excuse for falling out of touch it might even cut the other way with larger more diverse districts officials will have to tune into the concerns of a wider range of voters new districts will likely contain a better mixture of rural suburban and urban voters one benefit of a smaller general assembly would be a streamlined legislative process and one that off the top would save taxpayers &# million but cost savings are less important than making the legislature more accountable and thanks to the rebellion over the pay increase substantial reforms are not only politically feasible but are already being implemented the general assembly now posts the salaries of all legislative employees online the senate recently passed a bill increasing fines for violating the states sunshine law and will soon take up legislation to strengthen the states open records act the senate has also adopted new rules that eliminate the late night votes that were often used to evade public scrutiny all floor and committee votes are now posted online along with lists of registered lobbyists and the clients and interests they represent weve also put in place a mandatory waiting period call it a "cooling off period" for new laws after a bill is introduced and before it can come up for a final vote this will allow lawmakers and the general public to actually read proposed laws before senators vote on them the house has adopted similar reforms my proposal to reduce the size of the general assembly was approved recently by the senate state government committee another reform voted out of that committee would put an end to lame duck sessions legislative sessions that occur after a november general election and before a new legislature is seated in january in the past controversial bills have been pushed through during these sessions that should stop several reforms including a reduction in the size of the legislature require amending the state constitution and for that reason there is serious bipartisan discussion of convening a constitutional convention a historical rarity pennsylvania has only held two full conventions since our nations founding one was held in and the other in both increased the size of the legislature its time to pare back adopted in the pennsylvania constitution is treated with great reverence it is more than simply the blueprint for rights and responsibilities in the keystone state it acted as a framework for the u s constitution which was hammered out by the founders meeting in philadelphia in the summer of yet the fact that another convention is being considered is itself an indicator of how strong the winds of change are blowing in harrisburg any changes to our states founding document requires serious consideration and debate but equally serious is the message now coming from pennsylvanias voters that they no longer accept business as usual in the capitol the interior of the capitol dome features these words of our commonwealths founder william penn "and my god will make it the seed of a nation that we may do the thing that is truly wise and just " i submit that "the thing that is truly wise and just" is to reduce the number of members of the general assembly increase our accountability and thereby restore the confidence voters have in their legislature mr pippy is a republican senator representing parts of suburban pittsburgh allegheny and washington counties
