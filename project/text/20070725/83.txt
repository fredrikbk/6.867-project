older adults seek good fit to volunteer more than half of adults and older express some interest in volunteering but many have trouble finding a good fit according to a new report professionals and women ages to are especially keen on donating their time and skills to one or more charitable organizations but finding the right opportunity has proved difficult for many according to a five part study from volunteermatch a free san francisco based nonprofit online service showcasing national volunteer opportunities many baby boomers the million americans born between and who are part of a large demographic shift are defying the stereotype of being the "me" generation said greg baldwin president of volunteermatch "boomers are far more interested in volunteering than theyre given credit for " mr baldwin said "theyre far more interested in using their career and noncareer related skills they have higher expectations for their volunteer experiences than some of the younger users were sampling " but many cant find an outfit that engages the full range of their interests skills and life experience he said as more boomers enter retirement age that could bode poorly for nonprofits unless they learn how to provide opportunities that pay off in high volunteer satisfaction among volunteermatch users those and older volunteered more hours than any other age group putting in an average of hours a year the study found "theres a tremendous reservoir of skill and talent out there and we want to empower the nonprofit world to take advantage of this tremendous opportunity " mr baldwin said of older nonvolunteers who were very or fairly interested in pursuing volunteer work said they hadnt found the right opportunity excluding lack of time health and physical limitations made up the second most common obstacle with reporting health concerns as their major barrier more than one in four said they didnt find anything well suited to their skills and cited a preference for giving back in other ways financial resources proved another sticking point with saying they couldnt afford to volunteer thirteen percent didnt know where to begin and said they had had a previous volunteer experience that was less than positive only of nonvolunteers age to said they tried to find a volunteer role in the past year some would be volunteers also may be reluctant to start for fear they would have a hard time quitting if their needs or desires changed nonprofits can ease such transitions by setting clear expectations about the time frames involved offering projects with a beginning middle and end and establishing measures of success "so volunteers feel like they succeeded in something " mr baldwin said "theres nothing worse than being in a nonprofit organization where you dont want to leave on bad terms but if theres no opportunity for you to end your service and move on it can be an awkward situation " he said thriving volunteer programs tend to help people grow in their pursuits while offering ample opportunities to make a graceful exit such breaks are built into the six month projects offered by the san francisco based taproot foundation a national volunteer driven organization that builds capacity for nonprofits volunteers participate in five person teams filling well defined roles such as web developer graphic designer and marketing manager for nonprofits in need of infrastructure support said matt ogrady regional director for the west coast each volunteer puts in about hours of pro bono work and each team contributes professional services valued at &# on average he said the role of account director which requires senior level experience is composed mostly of baby boomers for a variety of reasons volunteers sometimes need to withdraw from a project mr ogrady said "we can anticipate that and can accommodate that fairly readily we have other volunteers with the same skill set we can replace them with " when necessary substitutions keep the projects moving forward he said "it also gives the volunteers a greater sense of confidence that they can take on this commitment without making what they might feel is a lifetime commitment " junior achievement which works with teachers to deliver programs on financial literacy entrepreneurship and work readiness to students in kindergarten through th grade relies on volunteers going into schools said geoff wilson vice president of volunteer initiatives for ja worldwide in colorado springs colo most ja volunteers range in age from to when many also are struggling to climb the career ladder and raise families scheduling conflicts are the main reason volunteers drop out mr wilson said the group has nearly volunteers who make as little as five classroom visits to a whole semesters worth depending on their preferences he said after brief training they help teachers present activity based programs that reflect state curriculum standards reaching million elementary school students and million middle and high school students junior achievement hasnt made a concerted effort to court the baby boom generation but that will likely change mr wilson said "our goal is to reach more students we need to recruit more volunteers so well definitely be looking at the statistics in the volunteermatch study and looking at how we can strategize around it " the majority of nonprofits surveyed said they are actively seeking more information about potential volunteer recruits seven in said they would like to have more skilled volunteers at their disposal volunteering is the latest arena to benefit from an explosion of choices and information delivered online said volunteermatchs mr baldwin "were trying to do for volunteering what ebay did for garage sales make it easier to find what youre looking for " all nonprofits surveyed in the report used volunteermatch to locate volunteers but some also tapped local volunteer centers web sites about of nonprofits said craigslist org was useful in their recruiting efforts and named idealist org smaller portions cited volunteer org volunteersolutions org handson network and servenet org the study conducted by peter d hart research associates included registered volunteermatch volunteer users staff members of nonprofit organizations and a telephone survey of adults not currently volunteering it was sponsored by the atlantic philanthropies with additional funding from the metlife foundation
