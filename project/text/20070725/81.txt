nbas stern calls referee case isolated league may have missed signs of possible issues over betting behavior facing what he said was the biggest crisis during his year tenure as commissioner of the national basketball association david stern said his league had been "betrayed" by a referee who is under federal investigation for gambling on games mr stern said he believed it was an "isolated" occurrence but the affair almost certainly isnt over betting on games by officials cuts to the heart of the credibility of any sport and raises the issue that the outcome of games could have been affected it also evokes the uncomfortable reality for sports organizations that a good portion of their popularity stems from gambling on games while basketball attracts a fraction of the wagers both legal and illegal that football does it is no exception questions linger about how the nbas extensive system of evaluating referees performance and background checks on off the court behavior could have failed to ring warning bells the referee in question tim donaghy had what some felt was a record of erratic calls during games the league also heard allegations about his gambling habits but didnt come up with any evidence and allowed mr donaghy to continue to work games the federal bureau of investigation told the league it was looking into mr donaghy on june just after the season ended according to mr stern he said it was his understanding that mr donaghy bet on games he officiated as well as perhaps some he didnt and passed on information to others to bet on games over the past two seasons mr donaghy who resigned july from a job that paid him &# last season has yet to be charged with a crime though mr stern said mr donaghys lawyer john lauro told him mr donaghy is considering entering into a plea agreement he is expected to turn himself in to authorities by next week mr lauro declined to comment thomas seigel assistant u s attorney in brooklyn declined to comment mr stern said the league implemented an extra layer of checks to audit the calling of games last season so "the system was as good as it could be " but he stressed that its primary purpose was to improve referees accuracy not screen for criminal activity the results show that out of referees mr donaghy was at the top this season and near the top last season in the number of fouls called in the last few days the internet is replete with video clips of supposedly suspect calls by mr donaghy but he apparently tripped no wires in the league office he was rewarded with assignments in the first two rounds of the nbas playoffs in the spring a current nba referee who has worked several games with mr donaghy says that the way mr donaghy made calls changed over the past two seasons prompting complaints from other referees a league spokesman declined to comment mr stern says mr donaghy ranked in the top tier among league officials as for mr donaghys off court behavior mr stern said the nba investigated allegations in that mr donaghy violated league rules by gambling at the borgata a casino in atlantic city n j but mr stern said mr donaghy denied the allegations and private investigators found no evidence of him gambling in any atlantic city or las vegas casinos the nba has intensified its background checks of referees in the past two seasons searching for warning signs such as criminal behavior or debt that could make an official more susceptible to gambling elements that policy change occurred not long after one official troy raymond lied on his resume for his profile in the referees media guide mr raymond had written that he attended the university of colorado and played on the schools national champion football team neither of which is true since then all current and potential nba referees have had to complete an annual background check and resume verification forms as well as give the league permission to check bank accounts debt information and credit ratings mr raymond who couldnt be reached for comment left the nba in shortly after that discovery one constituency that is especially irritated about the matter is the legal gambling industry which depends on the perception that games are on the up and up to make money "the nba has to be held accountable they cant be passing the buck " said christopher costigan publisher of gambling com a gambling news and information web site tamara audi and paul davies contributed to this article
