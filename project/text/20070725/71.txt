intel scores speed breakthrough inexpensive components are employed to achieve superfast data transfers intel corp researchers say they have reached a new milestone on the way to developing computers that use inexpensive optical components to achieve massive increases in communication speeds the company said it has fabricated the first modulator made from silicon that can encode data onto a beam of light at a rate of billion bits per second or gigabits modulators are key components in using lasers to send data down fiber optic cable such speeds roughly times faster than the most sophisticated corporate data networks now require expensive materials a factor that helps push the cost of existing gigabit modulators into the thousands of dollars intel which boasts the biggest revenue among companies that make silicon chips wants to use that material to create much less expensive communication components an effort it calls "silicon photonics " intel has been creating a series of silicon based laser components including a gigabit modulator in and a gigabit modulator in "its been a phenomenal ride in terms of the rate of advancement in silicon photonics " said mario paniccia who directs intels photonics technology lab and also holds the title of fellow mr paniccia envisions packing together of the gigabit communications lasers on a single chip which could send data between computers or between circuit boards in a single system at one trillion bits per second or a terabit while such capabilities are beyond the needs of todays systems intel and others are racing to pack the equivalent of hundreds of electronic brains on a single microprocessor chip rapidly expanding the needs for faster data highways among the components exactly when the company may offer such components and how much they will cost hasnt been determined but mr paniccia says the company is committed to commercializing silicon photonics technology in some fashion by the end of the decade he adds that such laser components need to cost in the neighborhood of &# each to be commercially viable intel isnt alone in the silicon laser race luxtera inc a start up in carlsbad calif is planning to enter the market in the fourth quarter with chips that include the equivalent of four lasers each of them able to send gigabits of data a second alex dickinson luxteras chief executive said intels development is interesting from a scientific point of view but he argues that luxteras approach can bring practical benefits sooner for applications such as connecting together servers to create a supercomputer from a practical point of view mr dickinson said he doesnt think intels announcement "moves the ball forward "
