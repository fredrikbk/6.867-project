the big catch could have a big catch as san francisco giants slugger barry bonds closes in on hank aarons career home run record a thorny question looms if youre the lucky fan who catches the record breaking home run ball what are the tax consequences the short answer find a very smart accountant and if you dont like the answer try someone else "everyones sure they know the right answer but theres very little agreement" on what it is says phillip mann a tax lawyer at miller &amp chevalier in washington and a former head of the american bar association tax section mr bonds who turned yesterday hit his nd and rd homers last thursday leaving him only three away from eclipsing mr aarons record of last night the giants played the atlanta braves at home in san francisco common sense might suggest the answer is simple the lucky fan who catches the historic ball shouldnt owe tax until he or she sells it but relying on common sense to interpret tax laws can often lead to trouble asked whether any fan who has ever caught a valuable home run ball has had to pay tax on it before selling it an irs official declines comment some professors such as alice abreu of temple law school feel strongly the answer is clear "its taxable income" to the fan the instant that person catches the ball prof abreu replies how come "its accession to wealth " and nothing in the tax code specifically exempts from taxation a barry bonds propelled baseball lawyers say this view logically stems from cases saying that someone who finds a "treasure trove" owes tax on it right away but other lawyers disagree they also say its highly unlikely that the irs would be willing to risk the wrath of a baseball loving nation by taxing the fan right away yale law school prof michael graetz a former treasury department official and co author of a leading course book on federal income taxation says that the bonds issue "would make a great law school exam question " actually theres way more than one question will the internal revenue service require the fan to pay tax immediately based upon the balls estimated fair market value or only after the fan sells the ball will the fan have to pay tax based on regular federal income tax rates which range up to or if the fan waits to sell the ball for more than a year after catching it would any profit qualify as a long term capital gain taxed at the maximum rate of on collectibles if the prize catch does qualify as a long term capital gain what would the fans cost be for tax purposes zero the price of the ticket the ticket price plus the value of a new baseball what if the fan purchased a season ticket could he or she consider the cost of the entire season package as the cost basis would it make any difference if the person who catches the ball isnt a fan but rather a player standing in the bullpen or a groundskeeper these are just some of the curveballs that irs officials dont want to try hitting the irss expert is don korb who not only is chief counsel but also the agencys resident baseball fanatic his office is filled with sports memorabilia especially those related to his beloved cleveland indians including two home run balls he personally caught in cleveland last summer he gave a speech at the hall of fame where he discussed "the most significant tax events in the history of baseball " if anyone knows the answer it should be mr korb when asked mr korb hides his head in his hands and replies "please whatever you do dont ask me that question " a senior irs official says to the best of his recollection the issues involving milestone home run balls havent been addressed in any formal irs guidance yet the irs did offer its thinking on one aspect of the subject back in and the story behind that pronouncement helps explain why irs umpires are so reticent to discuss the subject today in the summer of a tax tempest flared up when st louis cardinals slugger mark mcgwire was on the verge of smashing roger mariss single season record of homers at the time a reporter asked an irs spokesman what might happen if the fan who caught the record breaking ball gave it back to mr mcgwire as a gift the irs spokesman replied that the fan could get hit with a hefty gift tax that response produced howls of protest from the halls of congress as then irs commissioner charles rossotti recalls vividly "more than innocent spouse cases more than small business owners losing their businesses more than irs modernization failures the prospect of the irs taxing this hypothetical good hearted fan unleashed the fury of the american people not to mention their representatives in congress " mr rossotti wrote in his memoir "many unhappy returns " the irs quickly reversed itself mr rossotti issued a statement saying that if a fan caught the ball and gave it back to mr mcgwire the fan wouldnt be taxed "sometimes pieces of the tax code can be as hard to understand as the infield fly rule " mr rossotti explained "all i know is that the fan who gives back the home run ball deserves a round of applause not a big tax bill " that witty response drew its own round of applause and relief within the irs but it seems unlikely that the fan who catches the barry bonds ball will give it back to the slugger as a gift for one thing the ball probably will be worth a considerable amount of money "probably somewhere in the half million range four or five hundred thousand" dollars says dan imler managing director of scp auctions in mission viejo calif mr bondss th home run ball was sold through scp in for &# mr imler says his estimate is based on such factors as "what other milestone home run balls have sold for recently the mixed public opinion about barry bonds and the record and market conditions in general " mike heffner president of lelands com a sports memorabilia auction firm thinks the price could be higher "in my estimation its a half a million dollar baseball but it could sell for more at an auction " he says "sometimes people get crazy at auctions strange things do happen " in may heritage auction galleries offered &# million to buy the ball that mr bonds hits when he breaks the record says chris ivy director of sports auctions for the dallas based auction house but heritage recently withdrew its offer because of what it referred to as "concerns about the safety of fans in the stadium and potential legal liability " prices for historic baseballs have swung widely over the past several decades when mark mcgwire hit home runs in breaking the single season record the ball was sold at auction for about &# million since then prices for home run balls havent come close partly because historic records have been falling more frequently and because of suspicion that some players including mr bonds have used steroids to enhance their performance mr bonds has denied using steroids yale law prof graetz helped advise the irs on the mark mcgwire flap in before mr rossotti issued his statement resolving the issue in return the grateful mr rossotti sent prof graetz a baseball signed by mr rossotti saying "thank you for saving us from a strikeout on national tv " so did prof graetz declare the rossotti ball on his tax return as income no prof graetz replies with a chuckle explaining "i dont think it has a lot of value to anyone but me " some states plan sales tax holidays next month at least states plan to waive their sales and use taxes for limited periods on certain items according to a survey to be released today by cch a riverwoods ill unit of wolters kluwer typically these tax holidays include back to school items such as clothing footwear school supplies and computers details vary from state to state also local sales taxes may continue to be
