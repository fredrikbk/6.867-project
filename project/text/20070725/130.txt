where bankruptcies stay high almost two years after lawmakers amended the u s bankruptcy code to reduce filing rates several regions in the southeast continue to see elevated numbers of consumer bankruptcy cases a phenomenon some experts attribute in part to local culture bankruptcy numbers over the past few months appear to be slowing down or leveling in many regions bankruptcy filings fell from may to june in more than of the nations federal court districts according to jupiter esources a company that tracks bankruptcy data but bankruptcies continue to rise or remain elevated in the three highest filing states tennessee georgia and alabama in tennessee residents per file for bankruptcy on an annual basis compared with the national average of per in georgia and alabama the rates are and respectively some experts say the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of may have little effect on filing rates in states with chronically high bankruptcy rates economic and social factors such as low paying jobs and high divorce rates often lead to financial hardship but local bankruptcy experts say the sheer frequency of filings may also be whittling down the social stigma of filing "if your neighbor does it its more likely you will do it " said dena k wise a family economics specialist at the university of tennessee "it may be that bankruptcy has become something common among some certain neighborhoods " economic conditions play an important role in bankruptcy filings but economics alone dont explain the high rates in some southern states mississippi and louisiana for example have the nations highest poverty rates yet the rate of consumer bankruptcy filings in those states is lower than in georgia tennessee and alabama mississippis rate is filings per people louisianas is per accordingly bankruptcy scholars offer two alternative explanations the declining social stigma of filing for bankruptcy in some areas and the habits of local lawyers bankruptcy expert robert lawless a law professor at the university of illinois said many local lawyers tend to adhere to filing traditions and may not consider options no matter how poor an area is mr lawless said lawyers are most often the figures guiding financially distressed residents through legal options the recommendation for clients in financial distress is often chapter bankruptcy which allows people to gradually pay off their debts "i think its a professional culture for the amount of times chapter is used especially in alabama and tennessee " mr lawless said "chapter drives the professional culture " financial experts such as former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan have suspected for years that declining social stigma is a cause of rising bankruptcy rates during his testimony over bankruptcy code amendments which began in mr greenspan told congress "personal bankruptcies are soaring because americans have lost their sense of shame " there is no direct way to measure stigma but its presence can be calculated through other social behavior according to scientists a study by the federal reserve bank of kansas city found certain social characteristics including divorce rates poverty and even religion can affect the stigma a population attaches to filing tennessee georgia and alabama have divorce rates between and higher than the national average according to the u s census bureau all three states are among the poorest in the nation as much as of the state population lives in poverty almost four percentage points above the national average annual income rates in some areas are as much as &# below the &# national average those characteristics suggest bankruptcys stigma may be dwindling in these high filing states some experts say "in memphis there is a high population making lower wages " said ms wise "a lot of people have probably already filed for bankruptcy so there isnt as much social stigma attached " the federal reserve study found that access to legalized gambling is also an important determinant of bankruptcy filings the farther a county is from a casino the lower its personal bankruptcy filing rate is likely to be gambling isnt legal in tennessee but its residents do trek to casinos just south of memphis on the mississippi border shelby county home to memphis has the highest bankruptcy rate of any county in the country according to tennessee officials in georgia riverboat casinos have gained popularity over the past few years and alabama boasts several indian casinos and horse tracks some states that are not struggling with poverty may be struggling with high numbers of residents without health insurance nevada which ranks among the states with the highest bankruptcy filing rates has a much lower rate of poverty than the national average however according to the kaiser family foundation more than of its residents are uninsured three percentage points above the national average many bankruptcy experts suggest the choice to file bankruptcy may have significant religious undertones in bible belt states the most popular filing choice chapter gives debtors a chance to repay creditors a characteristic in line with the biblical teaching concerning responsibility and forgiveness experts say in tennessees shelby county ms wise helps chapter trustees train volunteers to become financial coaches for struggling local families many of the recruits are neighborhood ministers she says both alabama and tennessee played leading roles in the development of chapter bankruptcy which was widely encouraged by prominent state politicians according to southern bankruptcy lawyers coaching clients to file for bankruptcy has been ingrained in the legal culture for decades chapter was established with the chandler act of named for rep walter "clift" chandler a former memphis mayor and staunch bankruptcy advocate "it was viewed as a way to get bills paid " said ben sissman a memphis bankruptcy attorney "tennessee lawyers got interested judges got interested and bankruptcy became more practical for people " like tennessee alabama also had an aggressive introduction of chapter by lawyers in s according to gene marsh a university of alabama law professor "chapter was always seen as a custom a way for people to get out of trouble " mr marsh said "so its not a surprise the bankruptcy rate is where it is folks have always been fairly comfortable with it because everyone else uses chapter " and the state has seen an even bigger rise in filings since the subprime mortgage crisis erupted late last year "alabama has always been gung ho in the subprime lending area " mr marsh said "we like our grits our collared greens and our subprime lending add in chapter and youve got trouble in river city " in georgia state laws regarding mortgage defaults have contributed to high foreclosure and bankruptcy rates according to experts state laws give homeowners who default on their mortgages less than one month after receiving a foreclosure notice to stop the liquidation of their home sending defaulters scrambling to file for chapter protection
