the security thing the democratic partys hopes of winning back the presidency in and building a sustainable governing majority will ultimately ride on a single subject national security as of now security is the only substantive issue on which the party could lose next years election it is also an issue with unequalled capacity to overwhelm all others while the alleged conspiracy to blow up fuel tanks at new yorks john f kennedy international airport went nowhere and car bomb plots in london and glasgow caused little more than inconvenience and fiery footage such incidents show that angry men still target the cities of the west americans understand this and they will insist on a president who shares that understanding unless the democratic party can throw off its longstanding reputation for weakness on security matters it will squander its present advantages and risk renewing the republican lease on the white house for the foreseeable future it is tempting to dismiss the republican national security edge as a thing of the past certainly president george w bushs disastrous conduct of the iraq war has eroded his partys credibility on defense and foreign policy matters last years congressional elections showed deep public discontent with the gops war leadership and some polls suggest that democrats may be closing the security gap however just because voters put democrats in charge of congress does not mean they are bound to install one in the white house on matters of security the public knows that its the executive not the legislature that matters most as for the polls it is still not hard to find misgivings about democrats ability to keep the country safe especially among swing voters a recent survey of political independents by the washington post the kaiser family foundation and harvard university found preferences for democrats on one topic after another except for the "campaign against terrorism " where republicans held a nine point advantage in a rasmussen reports survey released this month unaffiliated voters favored republicans on national security by seven points we live in dangerous times and in dangerous times voters have shown a clear sustained preference for republican presidential candidates ever since when the democratic party tore itself apart over the vietnam war and voters decided to entrust their security to richard nixon americans have chosen republican presidents in times of perceived peril and democrats only when no such peril seems to exist of the presidential elections dating back to democrats have won the popular vote four times in and three of these elections took place during the pause between the end of the cold war and when the electorate cared little about national security issues the lone exception amply proves the rule in a post watergate contest that should have been a cinch for democrats jimmy carter barely staved off gerald ford four years later motivated in no small part by the iranian hostage crisis the soviet invasion of afghanistan and a general sense that american interests were under increasing threat world wide voters eagerly handed the reins back to the gop and wouldnt let a democrat touch them again until the communist threat was vanquished this republican advantage is no cold war relic it has already had an enormous impact on our post presidential politics in the first general election following the attacks president bush won despite the errors of his first term this time with popular as well as electoral majorities exit polls showed bush with leads of nearly over democratic challenger john kerry on the question of which candidate would do a better job of protecting the nation against terrorist attack once again americans showed they prefer a republican in the white house when the nations security is at stake such a durable presumption for one party in times of trouble is unhealthy for our democracy in essence the security issue has given republicans a pass as long as it is a predominant concern gop candidates can afford to support domestic agendas that run counter to most americans preferences on issues ranging from economic fairness to environmental protection and still win the presidency and for the better part of four decades democrats have let them get away with it by failing to adopt a compelling national security vision democrats have routinely chased a decisive share of the electorate into the republican presidential column when confronted with the threat of mass violence whether in the form of a soviet missile or a terrorist bomb americans have shown they will vote for the party that seems more willing and able to confront that threat even if it means stifling their preferences on other issues the democratic party must devote this campaign to one overriding purpose convincing the american voter that a democrat can serve effectively as commander in chief in the st century the party should use every speech every debate and every town hall meeting to make this essential argument and to hammer away at what remains of the republican security advantage so far though this isnt the campaign democrats are waging they seem primarily interested in battling each other over who offered the purest opposition to the iraq war five years ago and who would most rapidly remove american forces now the party is furious about the war and that fury is guiding much of the discourse among democrats from the netroots to the presidential candidates themselves this is understandable the bush administrations war policy has managed to blend ruthless duplicity and appalling incompetence america has suffered great harm as a result outrage is a legitimate even patriotic response to such a wanton lack of presidential vision decency or skill but anger indulged too long can easily occlude constructive thinking and common sense this is particularly true in american electoral politics where anger is a notoriously poor sell the people of this country to their credit tend to punish resentment and reward optimism democrats need to remember this collect themselves and focus on presenting a positive program for defending the lives and interests of the american people this is a timely moment for such a presentation the republican mismanagement of the war has made americans more receptive to a democratic national security message than theyve been in many years democrats must seize this moment to make the case for a national security policy that will strengthen the countrys frayed military and make far better use of diplomatic economic and cultural power to safeguard the nation and restore its credibility worldwide but democrats cannot win elections by simply detailing policies and programs no people are looking for something else here they want to know or perhaps more to the point they want to feel that the party truly understands the gravity of the threats we face and has what it takes to defeat them some democrats seem convinced that their party is poised to win in if it will only heed the perceived mandate for immediate and total withdrawal from iraq this would be a mistake democrats must make clear that their main interest in iraq is winding down the american troop presence in a manner consistent with protecting our nations security interests in the region including the eradication of terrorist strongholds the deterrence of a broader war and the prevention of genocide tone matters here if democrats dont handle the rhetoric of withdrawal properly if they seem too eager to get out at all costs or too insouciant about the consequences of immediate departure they will reawaken the partys image as a feckless faction unfit to lead in times of hazard that is not an identity the party can afford at this moment in history the republicans now seeking to perpetuate their partys hold on the white house will try to distance themselves from the current administrations blunders while fully embracing the gops identity as the security party that could well prove to be the winning strategy in unless democrats learn from the past and make national security their top priority mr ribbing is the director of policy development at the progressive policy institute in washington d c
