hide the button steve jobs has his finger on it apple ceo never liked the physical doodads not even on his shirts the iphone is steve jobss attempt to crack a juicy new market for apple inc but its also part of a decades long campaign by mr jobs against a much broader target buttons the new apple cellphone famously does without the keypads that adorn its rivals instead it offers a touch sensing screen for making phone calls and tapping out emails the resulting look is one of the sparest ever for apple a company known for minimalist gadgets while many technology companies load their products up with buttons mr jobs treats them as blemishes that add complexity to electronics products and hinder their clean aesthetics buttons have long been a hot button issue for apples ceo bruce tognazzini a former user interface expert at apple who joined the company in says mr jobs was adamant that the keyboard for the original macintosh not include "up " "down " "right" and "left" keys that allow users to move the cursor around their computer screens giving it a sleeker appearance than other personal computers have mr jobss reasoning says mr tognazzini omitting the cursor keys would force independent software developers to create programs that used the macs mouse a novel technology at the time "he wanted the thing to look nonintimidating " mr tognazzini says mr tognazzini says the strategy worked but he adds that many users still craved cursor keys and other buttons missing from the original mac just days after mr jobs resigned from apple in mr tognazzini proposed a new keyboard that ended up nearly doubling the key count of the original mac keyboard earning it the code name uss enterprise for its girth customers snapped it up when it went on sale in the spirit of simplicity extends even to apple retail stores the elevator in apples popular tokyo store for instance has no floor buttons it stops on every floor of the four story building "i got used to this " said hiroshi kawano year old employee of a printing firm on a recent visit to the store "its simple and i like it " at an apple event two years ago mr jobs mocked the complexity of traditional remote controls for consumer electronics products including "media center" computers designed by microsoft corp and its partners he showed an image comparing media center remotes that had more than buttons each next to a new apple remote control for playing movies and music on macs the apple remote had just six buttons "i dont know that theres ever been a slide that captures what apples about as much as this one " he said mr jobs was wearing the button free long sleeve black shirt that has been his trademark at public appearances a microsoft spokeswoman said the company declines to comment on the button issue roger kay a technology consultant who does work for microsoft says theres legitimacy to both the microsoft and apple camps differing approaches to buttons "if youre a wonk and you want lots of controls and features microsoft is right for you " mr kay says "if you want a simple experience and youre not tech savvy then youll probably do better with apple " in apple introduced the power mac g cube a computer that replaced the traditional mechanical power buttons of most computers with a touch sensitive on off switch that blended inconspicuously with the machines eye catching plastic case unfortunately the switch proved too sensitive for many users who found it easy to accidentally turn the computer off with a casual stroke of the hand apple discontinued the g cube a year later in the s apple computer scientist larry tesler recommended that the company offer a computer mouse with a single button on it reasoning that it would be less confusing for users years later after mr jobs returned to apple and much of the personal computing world was making the switch to more versatile multibutton mice mr jobs resisted the idea that computer mice should have more than one button a former apple executive says the executive says he suggested to mr jobs about four years ago that it was time to finally offer a multibutton mouse mr jobs strongly rebuffed the idea criticizing the multibutton mouse as "inelegant " the executive says apple finally relented two years ago and it began selling a multibutton mouse "when steve hits on something important to him for either a personal reason or a design reason he sticks with it for pretty much his whole life until someone can absolutely prove him wrong " says steve wozniak a co founder with mr jobs of apple an apple spokesman declined to comment or to make mr jobs available for this story when it comes to product design mr jobs functions like an exacting editor challenging hardware engineers and industrial designers to trim unnecessary features that dont add value to a product says one former apple executive colleagues who share his sense of aesthetics like jonathan ive apples senior vice president of industrial design tend to have the most successful careers at the company several former executives say apples designers and engineers are often "more royalist than the king " says jean louis gassee an apple executive during the s "they know the pain if they dont" fall in sync with mr jobs mr gassee adds users often seem to quickly adapt to quirks in apples designs when the company introduced the ipod in late the most common calls to apples technical support lines for a time were about how to turn the device which lacked a clearly defined power button off and on says a former apple executive eventually the confusion ebbed as users become more fluent with the ipod this executive says with the iphone mr jobs is making a similar gamble that users will quickly familiarize themselves with typing text and phone numbers on the devices "virtual" keyboard a set of "buttons" simulated by software rather than etched in plastic keys on the front of the device mr jobs has said the decision to omit physical buttons from the front of the iphone was driven by functional not aesthetic considerations since a virtual keyboard can be hidden when users want more screen space to view a map or watch a movie when asked on stage at a recent conference sponsored by the wall street journal whether there was any debate internally about the decision to include a virtual keyboard with the iphone instead of a physical one mr jobs had a suitably minimalist answer "none " he said miho inada in tokyo contributed to this article
