the afternoon report housing still hurting online edition a day after mortgage provider countrywide stirred concerns over credit quality fresh data showed the nations housing blues continue and left analysts still searching for the markets bottom existing home sales continued on their dismal downward trajectory according to numbers from national association of realtors home sales fell a more than expected in june to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of million units the lowest level since november bear stearns analysts noted there were some numbers that didnt look quite so bleak for instance the median home price crept up from june to &# the median home price was &# in may this year but economists didnt find much solace in the price rise saying the median price might be skewed by strength in sales of higher priced homes another apparent positive was housing inventory which shrank during june to million but even these numbers couldnt buck up some economists "this probably does not signify a meaningful step toward stability instead it could indicate the discouragement of potential sellers who have withdrawn homes from the market in the face of price weakness and higher mortgage rates " wrote nomura researchers likewise unimpressed were morgan stanley economists saying in a note that "even with a significant decline in the supply of homes available for sale the drop in the sales pace was big enough to keep the months supply of unsold homes at a fifteen year high " also today the mortgage bankers association reported that its weekly measure of mortgage application volume fell a seasonally adjusted from the prior week as applications to refinance existing mortgages and new home loan activity slipped and lehman brothers economists suggested the falloff may be worse saying the survey doesnt include wholesale brokers "as such we believe mortgage applications have overstated activity over the past few months we continue to expect home sales to fall modestly in response to tighter lending standards higher mortgage rates and rising inventory " lehmans michelle meyer wrote so does home sales data offer any sign of light at the end of the housing tunnel not in analysts eyes it seems "recovery remains years not months away for the housing market " wrote richard iley of bnp paribas nomura researchers expressed similar pessimism saying the report "offered little to support hopes that the bottom of the housing slump has been reached " and the read from ms meyer at lehman "the housing recession looks far from over " stocks rebound on boeing amazon stocks
