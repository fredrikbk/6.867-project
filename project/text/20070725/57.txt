fortune as fate the story of two poetry magazines it is neither the best of times nor the worst of times for poetry but for poetry the times could hardly be better founded in by harriet monroe this chicago based magazine has chugged along gamely through thick and thin a publishing venue for the unknown and the celebrated and most notably the unknown who then become the celebrated poetry published some of the first poems of ezra pound wallace stevens william carlos williams its most famous early entry was a strange monologue spoken by a timid sex obsessed j alfred prufrock and written by the young unknown t s eliot four years ago christian wiman then took over as the magazines new editor and helped to give the grand old lady a bit of a makeover putting color on its cover while retaining the attractive pocket book format if anything the magazines prestige as the place everyone wants to be in has increased poetry receives submissions annually and prints of them under mr wimans leadership subscriptions have skyrocketed from already an impressive number to this is of course modest compared with the numbers at people but virtually unheard of in the rarefied realm of the little magazine everyone in the literary world and many people out of it know the reason for poetrys almost blinding visibility money in ruth lilly the reclusive heir to the lilly pharmaceutical fortune gave &# million with no strings attached to the poetry foundation the parent of the magazine suddenly poetry and poetry were front page news as wallace stevens insurance man and poet extraordinaire once said "money is a kind of poetry " times are flush the foundation and the magazine now occupy temporary quarters on michigan avenue while waiting for bigger and fancier new ones to be designed for them the office is sleek airy austere and most unusual uncluttered this tale of two cities of two magazines and foundations moves east to manhattan where herbert leibowitz literary critic and former college professor he retired from the city university of new york in has thrown in the towel on parnassus the journal he founded in volume the big last issue will come out later this year it says something about the uncertainty of small literary ventures that in years there have been only volumes "when it comes to deadlines im a powder puff " says mr leibowitz with charming insouciance the reason naturally is money not too much but too little the history of his magazine is full of innocence serendipity and grit the kind that inspired mickey rooney and judy garland in "babes in arms" to say "hey kids lets put on our show right here " the late stanley lewis owned a small used bookstore of the sort now all but vanished from manhattan and everywhere else across the street from the leibowitz apartment on broadway he also published a few books himself and when one of them a volume of poems failed to gather any notices he suggested that someone should devote a magazine to poetry reviewing "whos going to buy it " asked mr leibowitz skeptically mr lewis persuaded mr leibowitz to sign on as editor with himself as publisher after three years mr lewis went bankrupt but by then mr leibowitz was hooked he persuaded a lawyer friend to set up the poetry in review foundation which has served the magazine ever since unlike poetry parnassus is a small magazine in all ways but size in some years it has published two issues in most merely one each volume is a hefty and handsome page book beautifully printed and chock full of goodies most print runs have been of about copies a number called "women in poetry" sold out its copy run and the final issue will top the charts with poetry started out devoted to poems and now includes reviews and other lively commentary at parnassus its the other way around intelligent commentary is the magazines bread and butter but beginning in volume it introduced poems themselves into the mix what has distinguished parnassus has been a commitment to intelligence and beautiful writing prose designed not for academics or even for poets but for the mythical common reader beloved of samuel johnson and virginia woolf at a time when the world of poetry is full of coteries back slapping and back stabbing friends reviewing and awarding prizes to friends mr leibowitz and his young co editor ben downing who came to the magazine after a stint at columbias mfa program insist upon passion honesty and clarity like all good editors they are curators assembling things and people they like into interesting groupings issues on poetry and the movies or words and music for instance nobel laureates joseph brodsky seamus heaney and derek wolcott as well as major academics and poets adrienne rich helen vendler richard wilbur appear alongside unexpected visitors like the late virgil thomson and the british tenor ian bostridge who will appear in the final issue unlike poetry parnassus occupies predictably cramped quarters some decades back the entire office doubled as the bedroom of mr leibowitzs infant son several years ago mr leibowitz purchased the small apartment next to his the two editors plus assorted assistants and work study students occupy the square foot living room books tumble from shelves and stand in piles on the floor and funding poetrys annual budget is about &# million that of the poor cousin &# poetry pays &# per line of verse contributors to parnassus may get nugatory unpredictable honoraria if everything is going smoothly after the poetry in review foundation got started the magazine survived on modest grants from the new york state council on the arts and the cuny research foundation as well as on the kindness of strangers an art auction netted &# several years ago a fairy godmother arrived a reclusive woman like ruth lilly who offered her benefactions increasing them to &# a year "we are pure and poor " mr leibowitz allows suddenly for unclear reasons she bowed out letters and phone calls were not returned exit the fairy godmother another one appeared at the th hour delivering a matching grant of &# that enabled the magazine to publish volume and volume mr leibowitz has managed with smoke and mirrors scotch tape and staples small savings stashed away to cough up enough dough for one final issue literary magazines come and go none lasts forever parnassus will be honored on dec in a program at the poetry center of the nd street y on a separate note the poetry foundation is giving its newly minted &# randall jarrell award in criticism named for the th centurys most prescient critic of poetry whose essays and reviews are still models of clarity wit and intelligence as well as of good writing to herb leibowitz for his own writing and his stewardship of parnassus auden once said that "poetry makes nothing happen " likewise money may not always make the right things happen but in this case it certainly can bring honor to the right people mr spiegelman hughes professor of english at southern methodist university has been a contributor to parnassus for the past years
