why bankruptcy judges face financial dilemma u s bankruptcy judges are abandoning the bench in a steady trickle to seek alternative careers as their pay remains stagnant for the th year in a row according to judicial experts bankruptcy judges receive an annual salary of &# a figure that hasnt changed since the governments last batch of raises took effect in the pay problem is shared with district judges who make &# a year but also havent seen a raise the administrative office of the u s courts doesnt track departures of bankruptcy judges a spokesman said but their pay has attracted attention at the highest levels of the judiciary supreme court justice samuel alito recently told a congressional committee that the pay of bankruptcy court clerks and their deputies "now exceeds the salary of bankruptcy and magistrate judges" in some parts of the country concerned with the welfare of their families and the rising cost of living some bankruptcy judges have opted to pursue new careers in private practice in march melanie cyganowski quit her job as chief bankruptcy judge for the eastern district of new york after her aging mother moved into her home and her husband faced a potential layoff at work the decision to leave what she had expected to be a lifelong career was gut wrenching "it was a heartbreaker " said ms cyganowski who now leads a team of restructuring consultants at greenberg traurig llp in new york "but it was increasingly difficult to have a year old looking at college my husbands job in jeopardy and my mother living with us while considering her health care as she ages all these financial issues were part of my decision " "no one goes on the bench to make money " ms cyganowski said "its out of a desire to do public service i was content with that but disappointed that the pay eroded " in judge ronald barliant of the u s bankruptcy court in chicago was granted a second year term as judge but he said his dwindling finances forced him to quit nine months into the new term after putting two children through private school and private colleges mr barliant said he had emptied his savings account and borrowed against his retirement "i did not have a lot of money saved when i took the bench and i didnt really anticipate what the expenses were going to be " said mr barliant who is now a partner at the law firm goldberg ltd in chicago "maybe it was poor planning on my part but i didnt expect to never receive a raise " between and the average u s workers salary increased while the inflation adjusted pay of bankruptcy judges has dropped by about according to the social security administration if bankruptcy judges were afforded the same raise as the average worker their current salary would be &# according to the administrative office district judges would make &# government authorized cost of living adjustments which are paired with adjustments given to members of congress have been sporadic for judges judges received only nine adjustments in the past years ranging from to according to the american bar association in four of the years members of congress elected to forgo their entitled adjustments forcing judges to forgo theirs as well experts warn that shrinking salaries could discourage would be judicial candidates from applying which could reduce applicant pools and seat less qualified candidates on the bench several high ranking judges including justice alito have urged congress to revive the salaries "im afraid that todays eroding federal judicial salaries will lead sooner or later to less capable judges and ultimately to inferior adjudication " justice alito said while testifying before the house judiciary committee in april "if this comes to pass the function of our courts as guardians of the rule of law will be undermined " as judges salaries have decreased in inflation adjusted terms salaries of partners at law firms have grown dramatically according to data from american lawyer magazine partners in the nations largest law firms made an average of &# million in more than seven times the salary of bankruptcy judges the difference is making it harder to attract top notch judicial candidates and easier to lure current judges away from the gavel between and march of the federal district and appellate judges who left the bench went into private practice according to the administrative office "i can understand why people across the aisle say they cant live on &# " said ms cyganowski "in the legal field thats what first year associates make " mr barliant calls the difference a year "economic penalty" he paid for being a judge a sacrifice many are still willing to make but fewer are able to afford "i loved being a judge " mr barliant said "i wouldnt have traded a minute of it but it gets to be a big burden to bear there are record numbers of judges leaving the bench now and that never used to happen " some bankruptcy judges say they remain unwilling to trade a seat on the bench for a fatter wallet judge richard schmidt of the u s bankruptcy court in corpus christi texas said "im not unhappy i like my job and im not complaining i have a child in college and its difficult but you have to do your best " a few bankruptcy lawyers disagree that judicial pay is too low "i have got to admit that i am not too sympathetic " chuck newton a bankruptcy lawyer wrote on his spare room tycoon blog recently "i have heard judges complaining from the bench and at legal seminars about the fact they only make &# per year it is a travesty " newton has argued that judicial pay should be relevant to the districts regional cost of living rather than providing a flat rate that would allow a brooklyn based judge like ms cyganowski to earn more than a judge based in rural texas several roadblocks in congress have delayed increases in judges salaries the ethics reform act of separated the salaries of federal employees from those of federal judges giving rank and file workers the ability to earn more than judges judges salaries along with the wages of executives and other employees in the legislative and judicial branches of government currently are capped at &# "it is not uncommon now to find federal employees in the executive branch as well as the banking and financial agencies who are paid significantly more than supreme court justices and judges of the federal courts " justice alito said in his testimony to the house judiciary committee justice alito cited a recent job posting for the securities and exchange commission that indicated a trial attorney could command &# a year and an attorney adviser could make &# salaries that exceed circuit judges &# a year wages many chief bankruptcy judges who appoint new judges report no noticeable drop in judicial applicants but some experts worry that the pay discrepancy will threaten diversity on the bench limiting candidates to older and independently wealthy lawyers most judges rise to the bench in their mid fifties a peak earning time for many legal professionals with many top notch law schools like new york university charging more than &# a year for combined tuition room and board experts fear that law graduates will have no interest in becoming judges because their salaries wont be enough to repay their student loans which could take some candidates until their mid thirties to pay off as bankruptcy filing rates rise the already heavy workload for bankruptcy judges is predicted to increase new procedural requirements put in place by the bankruptcy laws have put additional strain on judges and courthouse staff according statistics from the administrative office the u s bankruptcy court in rhode island showed an increase in the ratio of motions to filings and a increase in the ratio of orders to filings since the laws took effect according to the administrative office many bankruptcy judges contend that restructuring cases have become increasingly complicated in the past decade as corporate bankruptcies like enron can put billions of dollars at stake and require endless hours of preparatory work as the trend continues some judges say it is sometimes almost painful to approve young attorneys ever growing bankruptcy fees which are often in the millions "i try to assure myself theyve earned them " said mr schmidt of the u s bankruptcy court in corpus christi "but if i was interested in money i wouldnt be a judge id be in private practice too "
