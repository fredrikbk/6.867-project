before going back to class study up on the strains achieving a healthy balance between time at work and home is undoubtedly a challenge for many employees but when adults add course work to their daily loads the balancing act becomes even more intense whether the goal is a masters of business administration or a bachelors degree that will assist in a career change going back to school as an adult is often a lesson in time management and prioritizing sacrifice is another common word you hear among those brave enough to hit the books again whether they are giving up time with friends or missing their childs little league games according to the u s census there are a large number of these nontraditional students out there thirty seven percent of college students were or older in october percent of those students went to school part time the census bureau recently reported while evening and online courses can help students sandwich in the extra work mastering the art of juggling multiple responsibilities often takes time jim vidmar for example finished his undergraduate degree in advertising design in and years later returned to school for a masters degree in administrative leadership while working at the university of oklahoma despite the fact that the courses were entirely online he quickly learned he couldnt breeze through them like he anticipated "i naively went into it thinking it wasnt going to be that much work " said mr vidmar years old "it was a lot more work than the undergraduate degree for sure " even getting reacquainted with the art of studying can take some time said janet rice a year old music instructor who recently returned to school with the goal of getting a masters in music therapy at maryville university in st louis "in that first month you dont remember how you thought that way before " she said "youre relearning how to learn once youre in the rhythm of it then its fine " those who are preparing to hit the books this school year fear not with focus and planning experts say students can minimize the stress of fitting study time into their daily juggle of responsibilities below are some tips for those getting ready to head back to school the second time around sacrifice is a given when it comes to balancing a job a family and school although the adjustments are temporary career experts suggest that students keep at the front of their minds exactly why they are putting themselves and their family through this extra stress "so many people go back to school because they think its a good idea or it will make them more competitive nothing really specific " said andrea kay a cincinnati based career consultant and author but it is important for students to have distinct reasons why they are pursuing a degree whether it is for a career change to earn more money or another reason she said in fact write down that goal and post it so it can be regularly revisited she suggested as students progress through a program it is also important to take a step back at times to reassess whether their goals are being met and they can achieve the life balance they had anticipated said rebecca "kiki" weingarten co founder of and a career coach with new york based daily life consulting she has worked with some clients who simply werent able to handle demands of both work and school and had to readjust their plans as ms rice learned moving back into the rigors of academia isnt always the simplest of transitions so dont load up with more than one or two classes at first ms kay said rather "dip your toe into the water" by taking a light load at the beginning "im really a big promoter of testing the waters before you give up a job full time or commit to classes and money " she said make sure that the work is interesting enough or that reading a book or taking some seminars wouldnt work just as well plus adjusting to a larger workload and adapting to the academic mind set is a big change added ms weingarten at work students likely feel proficient and accomplished in class they are back in learning mode and take the role of a novice again she said prepare for the shift and realize it might take some time to get used to the new circumstances students should bring the good work habits they have acquired in their professional lives to their academic ones said rob ryan assistant dean and director of the part time m b a program at depaul university in chicago he is talking about preparation and diligence both of which are extremely important to the success of adult students throughout the duration of their studies students should expect to live by a daily planner "the best thing a student can do is look at each day start to finish and plan for things as much as they can in advance " said nancy bolsen director of adult student services at kansas state university in manhattan kan that means blocking out regular time to study while remaining flexible and ready to take advantage of any extra free time that might arise it also isnt a bad idea to consider what activities including committee or volunteer work could be pared back temporarily during the time it takes to complete the schoolwork just to "cut down on the frenzy " ms kay said it isnt only the adult student who is learning to sacrifice while keeping up in school less attention might cause young children to act up in school or be clingy during family time while a spouse can become jealous of the time an adult student sets aside to study ms weingarten said even friends might be envious of the classmates who now get more face time with their longtime buddy it is important to explain and reiterate to loved ones that "life is going to be different" for a while ms bolsen said stress the importance of the goal and that the scheduling is temporary and keep them in the loop about study plans so visiting time can be planned for "if the people who are in your life dont believe in or support what youre doing theres going to be a heap of trouble on top of what is already there with this process " said joseph barker who recently worked with ms kay on his career transition the former it consultant quit his job to take culinary classes with the financial support of his wife he is now studying for a certificate in dietetics from the university of cincinnati while working part time as a personal chef it is important that students dont allow the demands of school to affect performance at work ms weingarten said students should keep school materials and books out of sight at work she said dont even stay at your desk if your plan is to study during the lunch hour she added "that sends the message that you are not here whether or not that is true "
