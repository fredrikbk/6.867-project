relative uncertainty as sale decision nears family split persists murdoch deal pits heirs against parents call for a leap of faith jane cox macelree an influential member of the family that has controlled the wall street journal for more than a century forced back tears as she invoked the memory of a murdered journal reporter at a family gathering monday the year old ms macelree cited daniel pearls death at the hands of kidnappers in in voicing her opposition to a bid by rupert murdochs news corp to buy dow jones &amp co publisher of the journal according to participants "he put his life on the line for the paper " ms macelree said stopping to regain her composure according to participants ms macelree whose late mother jessie bancroft cox was the matriarch of the bancroft family shares voting control over stock representing of dow joness total votes her seven children are divided over whether to sell to the media mogul but she argued that the deal could compromise the journals independence some family members applauded the scene highlights the difficulty of the decision now faced by the bancroft family which has held a controlling interest in dow jones since at the meeting at a hilton hotel in boston family members were briefed in person or by phone on the details of a &# billion news corp offer that the dow jones board approved last week family advisers have called on the bancrofts to make a decision by early next week although some family members are bristling at the notion of a deadline interviews with more than a dozen family members outside advisers lawyers and others involved in the process suggest that the outcome remains too close to call what has seemed to many analysts like a logical move accepting a &# a share bid for a company whose shares previously had been trading in the mid s is still in question amid the deep emotions the bid has stirred participants said more doubts about a news corp deal were apparent at the end of the six hour session than at the beginning however it will still be difficult to block the transaction given that it would take only a few key players to deliver a deal to mr murdoch the family controls of dow joness voting power the companys advisers reckon that family owned shares representing of dow joness overall voting power must be voted in favor of the news corp transaction for it to go through the calculation assumes that nonfamily shareholders would overwhelmingly back the transaction michael elefante a major family trustee and dow jones director has told board members that he believes family support has reached this critical level in recent days investors have become less confident that a deal will occur in p m trading on the new york stock exchange dow jones shares stood at &# down &# or thats well below a recent high of &# in early june the bancrofts predicament has become a wrenching test of loyalties including parents choices among children and the upholding of tradition against obligation to future generations now the family could be splintered by the company that once brought it together of the familys three main branches the cox branch which includes ms macelree is perhaps the most divided two of ms macelrees sons favor a sale to mr murdoch while the third is leaning against say people familiar with their thinking her four daughters mostly are aligned with their mother against the deal according to people who have talked to them one son favoring a deal thomas hill said monday that the family has done a poor job overseeing dow jones and it would be better off as part of a bigger company participants say another murdoch supporter crawford hill phoning in to the meeting from a vacation in spain called it "ironic" that "all these years we havent done enough to question management " participants say he added "it seems like bad timing to start now " ms macelrees biggest support on monday came from her daughter leslie hill a dow jones director and former airline pilot ms hill walked to the front of the room and stopped "i have two speeches i could give " she said according to participants "but i cant give either one of them " instead she waved a quarter inch thick manila envelope filled with letters from journal reporters and editors who protested a deal with news corp she said it was their voices that mattered in a halting speech she was on the verge of tears as she talked about the reporters dedication to their jobs and told family members they owed it to the journals rank and file not to sell the paper according to participants some family members believe ms hills opposition helped shape the decision of her mother ms macelree ms macelree travels routinely to ms hills house to take care of ms hills children and ms hill has helped ms macelree with financial aspects of her farm in pennsylvania ms hill couldnt be reached for comment ms hill initially was open to exploring a deal with mr murdoch but that changed when she and other family directors sat down with him in a face to face meeting on june she asked mr murdoch how he would handle the journals coverage of china given his reputation for avoiding negative coverage of the chinese government she told several people afterwards that she didnt trust his answer these people say mr murdoch said in an interview yesterday he had heard that ms hill didnt think he answered some of her questions he said he had subsequently sent her several messages through intermediaries offering to talk further but had not received a response on monday ms hill concluded by saying she believed the family should take the "leap of faith" that something good will emerge if the family turns down mr murdochs offer ms macelrees decision is particularly knotty because much of her voting control comes not from direct ownership of dow jones shares but from her role as trustee for trusts in which her cousins martha robes jean stevenson and elizabeth steele are the beneficiaries more than trusts hold the bancrofts dow jones stake in a twist those three sisters once viewed among family members as the most fervent believers in maintaining dow joness independence now are among the most committed supporters of a deal with mr murdoch indeed ms macelree was countered on monday by ms steele a dow jones board member who delivered a thorough review of the pros and cons of a news corp transaction while she said she wasnt overly excited by a pairing with mr murdoch ms steele concluded that the company would be better served in partnership with a broader media organization in an increasingly competitive marketplace participants say given the environment ms steele said it "will be irresponsible to walk away from this deal " according to participants ms steele declined to comment earlier in the meeting a presentation by bankers from family adviser merrill lynch &amp co concluded that there was no other way to get the companys stock price to &# a share in the short to medium term participants say the bankers stopped short of giving advice on whether to sell the company among the key swing votes is mr elefante a partner at hemenway &amp barnes and the familys major trustee the boston law firm has overseen the bancroft trusts for decades his influence is enormous because trustees have leeway to vote in what they believe is the best interests of the beneficiaries some of the trusts require a unanimous vote others require a majority the trustees decisions could be legally perilous beneficiaries in the family who dont agree with how the trusts are voted could sue the trustees mr elefante spoke first he stood at a podium in the front of a cramped and windowless by foot conference room to rows of family members seated on upholstered gold patterned chairs though he has taken a neutral stance publicly he delivered a defense of a deal with news corp according to participants mr elefante plans to begin canvassing the family and trustees later this week by phone if they signal they favor the deal he will then ask them to sign a document committing their support a family vote against the deal would probably cause dow joness stock price to fall sharply but it may not go as far as &# the level at which it was trading before news of the offer became public if investors believe the company is still in play continued deterioration in advertising means theres no guarantee another buyer would come forward last week dow jones reported that ad revenue at the u s print edition of the wall street journal fell in the second quarter if the deal falls through dow jones might be more aggressive in cutting costs and looking for acquisitions or joint ventures one person familiar with the situation said however dow jones director lewis b campbell who is chairman of the boards governance committee and chief executive of textron inc told the bancroft family meeting on monday that dow jones as it stands doesnt have sufficient capital to compete for acquisitions he noted that the company lost out in the auction of the web site business com at the meeting among those arguing against the deal was another important trustee christopher bancroft also a dow jones director mr bancroft said he saw no need to sell the company he said dow jones was worth more than &# a share pacing as he spoke he told the group that "were not broken " participants say he said selling to mr murdoch was a bad deal and the family was about to "sell the milk cow for beef " mr bancroft consistently has opposed a murdoch bid at the meeting he said "im going to vote no for the family shares i control and im going to take the advice of my legal counsel for my votes as a trustee " according to participants some family members suggested this was a hint that mr bancroft could split his votes making a symbolic protest while ultimately acquiescing to the murdoch deal but a person familiar with his thinking said he doesnt have any intention of voting yes to the current murdoch proposal even as a trustee his comment was intended to emphasize that he understood his different roles and that his vote has been vetted by legal counsel this person said mr bancroft conceded to the group that he enjoyed news corp s media outlets which include fox news channel as a consumer participants said but he said he believed a more suitable owner for dow jones would jump in if the group turned the deal down mr bancroft and ms hill in recent weeks have tried separately to drum up alternatives to a deal with news corp mr bancroft who emerged from the meeting shortly before p m wearing a baseball cap embroidered with a picture of fishing lure and the line "bite me" said it was still unclear whether the family would support the bid mr bancroft also faces internecine dilemmas if he votes his voting power against a deal as expected it would run counter to the wishes of his brother hugh bancroft iii who favors a sale to mr murdoch mr bancrofts sister kathryn bancroft kavadas is said by other family members to oppose a deal ms kavadas couldnt be reached for comment in william cox jr s branch of the family the situation is in flux mr cox spoke in opposition to the sale monday but late yesterday he appeared to waver saying "im leaning toward a sale im not overly fond of rupert but theres no one else whos going to do anything with it i doubt wed ever get anything else like this again " soon after following a conversation with a family member who opposes the deal mr cox told a reporter "i want to eradicate that " mr coxs son william cox iii was a vocal critic of dow jones management in and now favors a sale to mr murdoch another potential swing vote is the stake controlled by denver law firm holme roberts &amp owen the firm which manages trusts that control about of the overall vote is generally in favor of the deal according to people familiar with the matter but wants more money on monday lynn hendrix the firms lead trustee argued in a presentation that mr murdoch should pay &# to &# a share at least to holders of supervoting class b shares according to these people "we are worth more and we should be able to get more " mr hendrix told the group according to a participant he added that he had been talking to m peter mcpherson dow joness chairman about that view mr mcpherson interrupted him to say that the board concluded it wouldnt recommend the deal to shareholders unless all shareholders get the same price according to the person who was there the trusts managed by the denver firm were set up by hugh bancroft jr father of christopher bancroft and hugh bancroft iii they benefit those two sons as well as two daughters unlike the trusts managed by hemenway &amp barnes which hold most of the bancrofts shares the holme roberts &amp owen trusts allow the beneficiaries limited influence these people say mr murdoch has said he doesnt intend to raise his price potentially setting up a game of chicken as the bancrofts enter the final days of deliberation one person close to news corp discussed the outcome of a failed deal wondering whether the denver trustees would prefer to hold a &# stock or a &# one a spokesman for news corp said the company will continue to be patient over the next few days much of the discussion monday centered on an agreement between mr murdoch and dow jones seeking to assure the independence of the journal the pact was designed to preserve a measure of autonomy for the newspaper and other dow jones publications by shielding top editors from corporate meddling several elder members of the bancroft family were skeptical about whether the editorial board would adequately protect the journals independence following a presentation on the issue by michael puzo another partner at hemenway &amp barnes william cox jr asked sharply according to participants "how can you stop rupert from interfering " ms macelree chimed in participants say "why would you sell a company to an owner where you need this kind of protection " mr puzo replied that senior journal editors felt the structure had "teeth " those who were there say but he also stressed that there were limits to what the family could demand and that while he felt the agreement was solid it wasnt bulletproof by p m monday after four hours of discussion family members were so hungry that they made do with a tray of stale danishes family members were free to get up and leave the room but on bathroom breaks they were accompanied by security guards ostensibly to shield them from reporters the meeting broke up about p m in her presentation ms macelree summed up the dilemma the family faced she told a story of a man she had met at a harvard business school course in the s for family run businesses the man said he felt the weight of his grandfather on one shoulder and the weight of his great grandfather on the other she said "i feel the same weight of the past on me now "
