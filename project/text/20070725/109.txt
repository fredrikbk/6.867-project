sec proxy plan may spur debate agency takes up issues of shareholders access directors accountability after months of delay the securities and exchange commission is expected to vote today on two alternatives to deal with the controversial issue of giving shareholders a greater say in electing board members but the two proposals which are on opposite ends of the spectrum will likely further fuel the debate at issue is whether shareholders can change company bylaws to allow them to nominate their own slate of directors on corporate ballots since the sec has allowed companies to exclude such proposals a federal appeals court in september said the sec erred in its interpretation putting the controversial issue back at the forefront the issue gets to the heart of a central question being raised by the increasingly active investors how much power should shareholders have in the running of a corporation in the past few years shareholders have been empowered as vote tallies have narrowed and more companies have adopted majority voting standards now many are pushing for a greater voice in how directors are elected business groups oppose the move saying that allowing shareholders to put their director nominations on corporate ballots will be expensive and distract from the running of the business the sec has been split on the "proxy access" question with some of its five commissioners opposing any access others said it will lead to greater director accountability it isnt clear if the commissioners will vote to release one or both of the proposals for public comment the next step in the process sec chairman christopher cox has previously said he is in favor of giving shareholders a greater voice he has tried to bridge gaps between commissioners differing opinions but he has also said he is willing to move ahead with a split vote "shareholders have every right to bring their proposals in whatever ways the law allows and we just need to make clear what the rules are so we intend to do that " said mr cox in testimony before a house committee last month one proposal under consideration is to go back to the approach and disallow election related proposals business groups have been lobbying for this approach the second proposal is to permit shareholders with a equity stake in the company to propose changes to election related bylaws it also would allow for the disclosure of shareholders who fit into that category the sec said the proposals could be crafted any way the shareholders want so long as it comports with what is permissible under state law in addition the sec says it will encourage companies and shareholder to engage in online forums investor groups said a barrier is too severe and will make it all but impossible for institutional investors to participate some said it favors hedge funds and other groups that buy large blocks of stock compared with other large investors such as pension funds which may have restrictions on the stakes they can take missing from the proposals are any changes to how nonbinding shareholder proposals are treated business groups wanted the sec to raise the bar for shareholders who wanted to raise issues through these advisory proposals investor groups opposed any changes saying nonbinding proposals are an effective way of engaging with management over issues including social concerns in addition to the proxy proposal the sec also is expected to vote on whether to issue a release asking for comment on whether u s companies can report financial results in accordance with international accounting standards currently u s companies use the u s accounting standard of generally accepted accounting principles or gaap last month the sec took the first step toward allowing non u s companies to file financial reports according to international standards and said it would consider allowing u s companies to do the same
