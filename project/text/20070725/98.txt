politics &amp economics health care plans set to collide in congress washington private health insurers and the tobacco industry would take the biggest hit under a house plan to spend about &# billion over five years to fund health coverage for low income children and boost medicare payments to physicians the democratic proposal which provides &# billion in part through a tobacco tax increase to help states fund coverage under the childrens health insurance program puts the house on a collision course with the senates narrower bipartisan package and with president bush the senate plan would spend &# billion on chip and doesnt include the increase in payments to physicians or cuts to health insurers president bush has threatened a veto of the senate bill and likely will oppose the house proposal as well the issue to be debated in both chambers in coming weeks serves as a warm up for a future debate on how best to revamp the entire u s health care system provide coverage to more than million uninsured people and rein in climbing medical costs republicans plan to offer alternative health proposals including a more limited chip bill and already are arguing that the democrats effort to increase childrens health coverage is a first step toward increasing government control and financing of all health care democrats and some senate republicans dispute that view the house bill would help states fund coverage for a total of million children including about six million already enrolled and five million who are eligible for chip or the medicaid program but arent signed up the house package shows how difficult it can be to make any changes to health programs as powerful industries lobby hard for payment increases or to ward off big cuts budget rules that require new spending be offset with program cuts or tax increases prompted further juggling house democrats had to reduce the packages size from about &# billion over five years in part because some democrats insisted on a lower tobacco tax increase other democrats objected to cuts in medicare advantage an alternative to medicare in which private health insurers offer coverage top democrats said last night that the legislation calls for a reduction beginning in of &# billion to &# billion over five years in government payments to private health insurers that operate in medicare advantage supporters of the change said it would equalize government spending on the plans with what is spent in regular medicare "these are not cuts they are quite frankly reductions in completely unjustified overpayments " said michigan rep john dingell the chairman of the energy and commerce committee which is set to consider the bill today the house legislation also calls for about &# billion over five years in increased tobacco taxes which translates to a cent increase per pack of cigarettes leaders still were working to gain support for this in the democratic caucus it is set to be voted on in the house ways and means committee tomorrow physicians who are scheduled to have their medicare payments cut in and would instead see increases worth about &# billion over five years rural doctors and hospitals would get a boost other health care providers would see their medicare payments frozen to help offset the rest of the bills cost drug makers also would help pay the costs of the house bill through a increase in the rebates they pay the federal government under the medicaid program for the poor sen charles grassley of iowa who helped craft the senate finance committees &# billion chip bill said that amount is the limit on what republicans in the closely divided senate are willing to spend on the program democrats "might want something bigger but i think we went as far as we can as republicans " mr grassley said the senate relies completely on tobacco taxes for its bill but includes a bigger increase cents a pack raising the total to &# than the house is proposing but rep pete stark who heads a health subcommittee that helped put together the house package was undeterred by the differences with the senate or mr bushs veto threat "if he wants to veto health care for kids historians can deal with that " the california democrat said
