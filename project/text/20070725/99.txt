politics &amp economics trichet girds for french power play ecb president aims to repel sarkozy bid for more influence frankfurt frances bid for influence over decisions of the european central bank has put bank president jean claude trichet in the hot seat as rarely before economists and central bankers say he is well equipped to defend the banks independence nearly halfway through his eight year tenure running monetary policy for the &# trillion euro zone the year old mr trichet has already proved he has the political skills needed to battle nicolas sarkozy frances barn storming new president he has also shown he is willing to tough out top level criticism of the inflation focused monetary policy for the ecb a mining engineer and economist by training mr trichet has squelched public revelations of dissent on policy from within the ecbs governing board since he took over as president in the board includes national central bank chiefs from the countries that share the euro from slow growing italy to booming ireland since mr sarkozys election in may he has badgered the ecb over the euros strength and insisted euro zone governments should have more sway over the blocs exchange rate policy other french officials have called for a say in setting interest rates for the zone mr sarkozy the leader of the euro zones second biggest economy and riding the wave of an electoral mandate has found little backing elsewhere in europe but his demands were well heard mr trichet holds a lot of cards in his defense of the ecbs independence his tight focus on inflation is supported by most euro zone countries including the blocs biggest economy germany and he is backed by hard to change treaties that give the ecb more political independence than the federal reserve mr trichet is also riding high on the back of the euro zones economic recovery growth in gross domestic product this year is on track to rival s a six year high inflation has been in the ecbs preferred range of just less than for months as governor of the french central bank in the s mr trichet faced down attacks by political leaders including former president jacques chirac on his anti inflation policies he even commissioned opinion polls to show he had public support when the ecb raised interest rates in december from euro zone politicians and international institutions including the international monetary fund howled that the bank risked squelching the blocs nascent recovery "we have been fully vindicated " mr trichet said last month "i think hes been very successful " says princeton university economics professor alan blinder a former vice chairman of the federal reserves board of governors mr blinder noted the ecbs achievements have come despite surging oil prices a u s slowdown and a german tax increase all of which were expected to throw off the euro zone recovery neither a larger than life presence like former fed chairman alan greenspan nor a professorial economist who leads the technical debate like ben bernanke mr trichet has a reputation for guiding decisions through diplomacy he seeks out consensus and has kept a firm grip on the ecbs governing board still mr trichet faces a formidable opponent and some genuine concerns mr sarkozy has shown he is determined to make his mark in europe after seeing his call for greater government influence on the ecb rebuffed by mr trichet and germany mr trichet called frances demands "unacceptable" mr sarkozy may now try a different approach pushing for europes governments and the ecb to take a tougher line on chinas undervalued currency he said last week he would like to discuss the currency with chinese authorities and his aides have signalled he will ask other euro zone officials to join the push many economists expect the euro which yesterday hit record highs above &# to continue rising as the ecb increases interest rates and euro zone economic growth outpaces that of the u s mr trichet signaled in june the ecb is likely to lift its key lending rate a further quarter point to in september currencies tend to become more attractive to investors when interest rates rise mr sarkozy has complained the euros current strength hurts french exports and while many economists say frances troubles have more to do with foot dragging on structural changes such as labor market overhaul some believe the new french president has a point a strengthening currency already works to brake growth and squelch inflation so the ecb should leave rates where they are argues jurgen michels senior european economist at citigroup in london he worries the ecbs eight interest rate increases since december may not have fully worked their way through the economy others say the ecb should be more transparent the federal reserve is accountable to congress while the bank of england has its inflation target set by the british government both publish minutes of their meetings and the breakdown of votes on each interest rate decision helping markets understand the central bankers thinking the ecbs mandate by contrast specifies that it should avoid all political influence while its rate setting decisions are taken by consensus and no minutes are published the outside world has little insight into differing analyses within the board mr trichet also often uses code words such as "strong vigilance " which lets markets know a rate rise is coming in a month as a result the market tends to watch only mr trichets language rather than focusing on the banks economic analysis mr trichet says the banks postdecision news conferences make it transparent defenders also say the lack of minutes and vote tallies protects national central bank governors from political pressure at home while mr sarkozy is unlikely to dent the ecbs independence some observers say he does in fact have a shot at giving politicians more say in euro zone exchange rate policy because of the wording of the treaty that established the ecbs independence "the treaty is ambiguous about who determines the exchange rate " says jacques cailloux euro zone economist with the royal bank of scotland in london using this loophole mr sarkozy is expected to try to get euro zone politicians unified around a common currency policy and at a group of eight meeting of finance ministers in october he could aim for a statement calling on china to let its currency appreciate that is unlikely to sit well with mr trichet who has called himself "mr euro "
