business bookshelf a slackers guide to fun and profit the hour workweek by timothy ferriss crown pages &# in timothy ferriss then in his teens landed his first job cleaning an ice cream shop despite his inexperience he figured out a way to finish the chores of his eight hour shift in one hour which enabled him to spend the rest of his time "reading kung fu magazines and practicing karate kicks outside " he writes in "the hour workweek " his boss inexplicably underwhelmed by the performance of the magazine reading high kicking one hour wonder fired mr ferriss after three days telling him "maybe someday youll understand the value of hard work " sixteen years later mr ferriss writes with pride "i still dont " the "about the author" page in "the hour workweek" describes mr ferriss as a "serial entrepreneur and ultravagabond" who "runs a multinational firm from wireless locations worldwide and has been a world record holder in tango a national champion in chinese kickboxing and an actor on a hit television series in hong kong " it appears that the grown up mr ferriss has compiled quite a colorful resume still "the hour workweek" seems rooted in the daydreams of a reluctant teenage floor mopper mr ferriss wisely couches his valentine to remunerative work shirking in the how to prescriptiveness of the typical business book making it seem as if any reader can share in the benefits of his sloth for profit theories the book is of course massively popular "the hour workweek" has been a steady presence on business and nonfiction best seller lists since its publication in may it is somehow appropriate that the business mr ferriss runs is a company that sells nutritional supplements with "the hour workweek" he is selling a sort of occupational supplement a formula for bulking up readers bank accounts even as their leisure time increases enabling them to join "the new rich " who are they folks "who abandon the deferred life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the new rich time and mobility " as is apparently compulsory with business books nowadays mr ferriss has tailored each step in his method so that the whole can be expressed as an upbeat acronym in this case deal which stands for definition elimination automation and liberation examining the particulars of deal would appear to promise about as much reward as studying say the ingredients of a nutritional supplement but here goes the "definition" section asks readers to rethink their careers working toward a comfortable retirement is pursuing "fools gold " mr ferriss advises better to aspire instead to the "mini retirements" enjoyed by the new rich also learn how to "dreamline" by identifying four dreams of different types "having" buying a house for instance "being" learning to speak chinese fluently or "doing" visiting thailand then calculate the "target monthly income" needed to achieve them over the course of six or months "elimination" requires stripping life of nonessential time wasting activities check email only twice a day mr ferriss claims that when he once restricted himself to one hour once a week on this chore thus removing himself as a "bottleneck " his companys profits increased dont bother reading newspapers or watching television news youll learn all you need to know by approaching others and saying "tell me whats new in the world " elimination also means showing up for work intending to complete two and only two "mission critical items" each day "believe it or not " mr ferriss writes "it is not only possible to accomplish more by doing less it is mandatory " put us down for a believe it not sadly office life is awash in non mission critical duties mr ferriss recommends acquiring a personal assistant in india to handle them "the indian outsourcers cost between &# u s per hour " he writes in his "automation" section income can also be automated he says by reselling licensing or creating a product it helps if you can present yourself as an expert on whatever that product happens to be not an expert no problem "expert in the context of selling product means that you know more about the topic than the purchaser " mr ferriss provides a useful guide to acquiring "expert status" in four weeks step one "join two or three related trade organizations with official sounding names " once your work life and income have been fully automated indian assistant doing the scut work income steadily flowing in then comes the "l" in deal "liberation" quit your day job and start traveling alas readers who are not already entrepreneurs will be tied to a job that makes the automation business difficult mr ferriss acknowledges this awkward truth recommending that most people practice liberation before automation although that produces the less marketable acronym dela he might emphasize how much more money readers will make by following his advice but mr ferriss also provides tips on how to live abroad "like a rock star" while spending less than the cost of staying home he itemizes his own expenditures for low cost luxury on a trip overseas but readers might want to take a little extra cash in case it turns out that "four and five star restaurants" in berlin havent actually offered two meals a day for &# since oh as with any meretricious but successful book or movie or television show its tempting to despair over what the popularity of "the hour workweek" might say about americans for instance are we becoming french in truth though even if the book sells a million copies that means of the population has taken no notice and likely remains as secure as any ice cream shop owner in its understanding of the value of hard work mr lasswell is the journals deputy books editor
