liffe overhaul plan puts tiny big traders at odds london liffe the futures exchange owned by nyse euronext plans to overhaul its interest rate trading protocols after small independent traders complained of a market increasingly dominated by automated trading systems now some of those big automated traders are pushing back rsj invest which says it is one of liffes largest trading members and which uses an automated system to trade hundreds of thousands of contracts each day believes the proposed change will discourage high volume traders and cut into the exchanges trading volume "we might stop trading except for small trades " says karel janecek partner at czech based rsj invest which says it trades about of the volume in short term interest rate futures on the exchange he says liffes proposed system change "discourages people from placing single large orders which contradicts the exchanges goal of promoting liquidity on its market " if rsj scales back its trading it could knock more than or several million lots per month off the exchanges total trading volumes and dent the revenue it gets from trading fees liffe says rsj is a substantial player in its short term interest rate futures markets but wont say where any of its members rank in trading volumes independent traders who would benefit from the changes say any drop in algorithmic volumes would likely be offset by an increase in independent trading and some algorithmic traders say they will adapt their own strategies and channel their business through liffe in a different way liffe told its members at the end of june that it plans to introduce a new trade matching algorithm for its interest rate futures to increase trading opportunities for liquidity providers such as independent traders known as locals it said the new algorithm would be introduced for its short sterling futures contract aug and on sept for its flagship european interbank offered rate contract and its euroswiss future locals who account for to of the volume traded in liffes short term interest rate contracts are important for futures markets because they are willing to take the opposite side of trades entered by investors such as hedge funds liffe says it has consulted with many of its customers on the new algorithm and has received overwhelmingly positive feedback "the order book will be more rich and stable which will generate more business not less " the exchange said in answer to a set of emailed questions "feedback also suggests that the new added dimension to the algorithm will attract more traders to the market " the exchange currently operates a matching algorithm to allocate incoming business to orders that have been placed on the exchange this system slants allocations of that business to larger trades in an effort to spread business across all the orders at a particular price an increasing number of automated model trading systems have exploited the algorithm over the past couple of years by entering very large orders to get the best allocation of incoming business before using their speed to instantaneously pull the rest of the order this means they get a big portion of the trading activity at the best price which is crucial when they are trying to make money by buying at the bid price and selling at the offer price to take advantage of what is known as the bid offer spread the exchange hasnt banned the models from doing this because the traders could be hit for the full order that they put into the market but it does create a false impression of the interest to buy and sell in the market and leaves independent traders who tend to enter smaller orders with only part of their trades completed even if they entered them before those from the model trading systems completed theirs some locals complained to liffe this year that it has become difficult for them to get business done and some have already switched to trading on other exchanges or retired from the business locals say the exchanges solution has been to develop a new algorithm called time pro rata which incorporates a time element that rewards traders who put in the first orders at a certain price and keep them there until they are filled the system works by giving higher allocation points to orders at the front of the queue "i think this will be good for locals because it means you get a better slice of the fill whereas at the moment its all down to size " said todd van hees a local at futures spread trading ltd a company that provides services for independent traders known as a trading arcade the large order flow from the automated model trading systems has helped liffe increase volumes and contributed significantly to liffes revenue the exchange says algorithmic trading is becoming an increasingly important part of the exchanges business rsj says it enters large orders to ensure the best allocation on trades but that it usually wants to wait until after other liffe members enter orders to ensure support for certain contract prices but using this strategy rsj says it will never get the best allocation on trades under the new algorithm because its orders wont be near the front of the order queue the company presented the exchange with an alternative algorithm that mr janecek believes meets the exchanges desire to incorporate a time element but doesnt penalize large traders rsj says the exchange rejected it as not being "sufficiently interesting " liffe declined to comment
