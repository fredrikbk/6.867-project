the spitzer method the media are doing their best claude rains act over the revelation that the office of new york governor eliot spitzer orchestrated a smear campaign against state senate majority leader joe bruno but far from being a unique out of character event the episode is a classic example of the spitzer political method nasty and exaggerated accusations fed by selective politically motivated news leaks the difference is that this time his targets could fight back on monday the office of democratic attorney general andrew cuomo released a page report on mr brunos use of state helicopters allegedly for personal political purposes the investigation had been prompted by the governors office after mr spitzers communications aide and hatchet man darren dopp saw to it that allegations of impropriety against mr bruno had found their way into the hands of gullible pliant reporters only now it is mr dopp who is in hot water having been suspended without pay for his role in ginning up a non scandal about the republican majority leader the ag cleared mr bruno of any wrongdoing but in the process uncovered mr dopps unseemly little scheme to plant the story and then use that as a pretext to call for the investigation in dry clinical language the ags report details how mr dopp arranged the collection of detailed travel information about mr bruno and fed that information to the albany times union when questioned about it mr dopp told two different contradictory stories to explain why the state police started tracking mr brunos movements both of which as the report details were false this is hardly unprecedented behavior by mr dopp in december john c whitehead the former chairman of goldman sachs recounted on these pages a phone call he received from mr spitzer in response to an earlier op ed mr whitehead had published in the journal the future governor told mr whitehead "i will be coming after you you will pay the price " mr dopp declared mr whiteheads account "a complete fabrication " someone threw in for good measure the suggestion that mr whiteheads original piece a defense of former aig ceo maurice "hank" greenberg against mr spitzers public slander had been written in return for a sizable donation from mr greenberg to the world trade center memorial foundation of which mr whitehead was a director that smear was duly reported in accounts of the contretemps although mr spitzer later all but admitted during his best behavior period while running for governor that he had become too heated on the phone with mr whitehead there are many similar cases the difference this time is that mr spitzer faced a political opponent who isnt as vulnerable to intimidation as the private companies and executives he preyed upon as attorney general he also ran into journalists at the new york post who decided to dig beneath the spin coming out of mr spitzers office and broke the story in the past the press corps refused to challenge mr spitzers claims for fear of incurring mr dopps wrath and being cut off from future leaks this is how the modern political journalism game too often works so now albany knows how mr spitzers past victims feel and mr dopps thuggish tactics have received a long overdue public airing from a democratic attorney general no less but what we dont yet know is to borrow a phrase what mr spitzer knew and when he knew it the ags report is silent on the question and mr spitzers current spin is that mr dopp was running this opposition research operation on his own at a minimum however it seems implausible that mr dopp the governors close adviser and communications director would undertake a campaign to destroy the leader of the political opposition without his bosss tacit support mr spitzers role needs to be more fully investigated and aired and who knows maybe even reporters other than those at the new york post will follow the story
