billboards and loopholes demand for space is rising but so are city restrictions how one company copes new york local laws here generally ban billboards in residential areas but that hasnt stopped an outdoor advertising company called van wagner from plastering hip neighborhoods like chelsea soho and the meatpacking district with bare chested pitchmen for abercrombie &amp fitch dancing ipod users and other immense ads the catch a loophole in the law that allows billboards in areas once zoned for manufacturing even though the factories are long gone "there are lots of gray areas " says a new york city spokeswoman about billboard laws taking advantage of such loopholes has helped van wagner build itself from scratch over the last decade into the nations fourth biggest billboard business in many big cities the company has found legal wiggle room to expand a business that some civic leaders have been trying to tamp down for decades in new york for example where billboards are largely restricted to commercial and manufacturing districts van wagner now owns more than large format displays intended for viewing from a distance of feet or more that kind of presence gives its nearest competitors including cbs corp s cbs outdoor and clear channel communications inc a run for their money the space is increasingly precious outdoor advertising a &# billion industry in will hit nearly &# billion this year it is growing faster than any other advertising category besides the internet advertisers like billboards because consumers are spending more time on the roads and billboards are hard to avoid theres no way to turn the page or fast forward through them with cities increasingly passing restrictions the number of large format billboards nationwide last year isnt keeping up with demand as a result rents are rising a large billboard on the bruckner expressway in the bronx or on tenth avenue in manhattan might go for around &# a month today compared with about &# years ago with economics like that richard schaps van wagners chairman and chief executive couldnt resist getting back into the business a wily former taxi driver with a tattered hack license to prove it mr schaps had made a name for himself thinking up innovative ways to carve new advertising space from the urban landscape he founded an earlier outdoor advertising company also named van wagner which pioneered much of the iconic advertising in new yorks times square such as nissins long gone steaming cup of noodles in he sold that company for &# million to outdoor systems now part of cbs outdoor but instead of retiring to the golf course mr schaps promptly started building a new outdoor business with the same name from scratch to rebuild his company and tap into the boom mr schaps had to think creatively when new york city relaxed its rules for curbside phone kiosks at one time dominated by verizon predecessor nynex mr schaps jumped in he worked with independent phone companies like telebeam telecommunications inc financing their phone kiosks so he could sell the advertising on the sides he eventually got the verizon contract and now controls some manhattan phone kiosks mr schaps also hustled for spaces that other companies had overlooked federal government buildings for example often are exempt from many city restrictions on billboards so mr schaps now has a feet by feet billboard on a post office on ninth avenue that rents for about &# a month van wagner which also operates in a handful of other cities including los angeles and washington d c says it gets calls almost daily from landlords eager to make extra money by renting out billboard space on their buildings the vast majority of the time it doesnt work out says mark johnston the companys chief operating officer because of intricate city rules on which districts may sport billboards and how far they must stand from parks arterial highways and other sensitive spots when the company thinks it has a likely spot staffers experts comb through rules and maps to make sure the board will work then negotiate with landlords for a billboard lease last they apply for a city permit to put up the board outdoor advertising companies frequently play cat and mouse games with city officials in california for example a state law allows illegally erected billboards that manage to avoid citation for five years or more to stay up unless challenged by state officials in a lengthy bureaucratic process legislation introduced in april is trying to close this loophole in los angeles some city officials believe that many boards either lack permits or have expanded beyond what their permit allows for example standing taller wider or having two or three faces instead of just one the citys building and safety department is taking inventory one los angeles based company regency repeatedly lands in hot water on new years eve a deputy manager for the city of west hollywood caught company officials led by co owner brian kennedy installing a large unpermitted billboard on the sunset strip mr kennedy says the new billboard with sturdy steel underpinnings replaced an older smaller one that had aging supports separately a former employee testified in court that executives had bragged about poisoning and hacking down trees that blocked views of its boards at los angeles international airport mr kennedy says a city report exonerated regency for responsibility over the dead and disfigured trees mr schaps says his company goes out of the way to work within the law fearing tactics that are too aggressive would sully the reputation of the industry and potentially scare away clients "its not the way we should be acting " he says of the industry at van wagner "were almost entirely legal " still the company isnt free from controversy a new york judge recently issued a temporary restraining order against van wagner preventing an ad for a bidet style contraption that featured bare buttocks from going up near a church and van wagners signs arent universally loved by neighbors residents of the meatpacking district have picketed and restaurants have organized a boycott of the hotel gansevoort for renting out space to van wagner even refusing to take reservations from the hotels concierge andrew berman director of the greenwich village society for historic preservation says he cringes every time he walks by them because they are so out of character with the neighborhood "theyre the size and scale you would see on the new jersey turnpike " he says van wagner says the two boards currently advertising jaguar xl and peroni the italian beer are " legal " to help lure in customers mr schaps invites potential clients into a black mercedes for a drive that takes in his advertising properties around manhattan a tour he calls "riding the boards " ever the cabbie he sometimes drives himself last year the company won a &# million year contract to manage new york city transit authority billboard displays on properties such as train overpasses and underpasses the prior year van wagner lost out to spanish company cemusa inc which won a &# billion contract to manage city bus shelter advertising " i dont think ive ever tried harder for anything in my life " says mr schaps the revamped van wagner has revenue of around &# million annually these days as cities close loopholes and tighten regulations van wagner executives say its getting harder to find good spots thats particularly true in new york where several billboard companies but not van wagner are in a protracted court battle with the city over its enforcement of billboard laws a few years ago the company put up to new boards each year in manhattan these days its lucky to find one per year "we used to say we are looking for needles in a haystack " says van wagners mr johnston "now we say there are no needles in the haystack "
