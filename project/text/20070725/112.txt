the daily fix entire sports world grapples with unsettling ref scandal online edition yesterday as his leagues nightmare scenario continued to unfold nba commissioner david stern stepped in front of a microphone to explain what he could tim donaghy a ref for years has resigned and is under investigation by the fbi for allegedly betting on games including ones in which he officiated that casts doubt on pro basketballs very foundation by suggesting some games were not played on the level "everyone and everything that was in place to prevent this very thing from happening broke down " david aldridge writes in the philadelphia inquirer "and that has taken the leagues integrity down a sinkhole just as the point shaving scandals of the s and s destroyed some college basketball programs in the northeast for a generation stern gotham raised and bred who fought as a young lawyer to keep connie hawkins out of the nba after hawkins was tied to gamblers such as jack molinas knows that history as well as anyone " on espn com marc stein attempts to answer some pressing questions about the donaghy case including "what is the best case scenario for the league at this point " mr stern gave every indication he doesnt expect mr donaghy to be cleared after years in which the commish dismissed any accusations of referee malfeasance "the inevitability now however is that donaghys alleged actions even though they dont come close to fitting the above profiles have invigorated and validated all those conspiracy theorists stern has been scoffing at for years " mr stein writes for the phoenix suns who lost a crucial playoff game in may that was officiated by mr donaghy the news adds to the franchises pile of hard luck tales "its enough missed shots and misfortune to make one think the suns are the cursed outfit in town not the wile e coyotes or the hard luck cardinals " dan bickley writes in the arizona republic mr bickley adds "sterns image never will be the same among the skeptics the ones that believe he fixes draft lotteries and failing franchises that he favors superstars and television ratings and no place will be more dangerous for stern than here in phoenix the pound for pound champion of conspiracy theorists a region that already carried great mistrust of the commissioner and his merry band of zebras " other regions are competing today for the title of conspiracy theory champ notably kentucky where two columnists say any doubts for any sport now become credible the lexington herald leaders john clay ticks off the greatest hits of questionable sec calls meanwhile louisville courier journal columnist eric crawford writes "we all know of course that not every call is prompted by the mob but second guessing officials is a cherished right held by every sports fan second only to obsessively following recruiting so lets have a show of hands please for those who believe that these organized crime types who got to donaghy have no interest in other sports does anyone honestly believe that this hasnt happened before beneath the radar anyone " toronto star columnist dave feschuk says that not only whistle blowers are vulnerable to greed and gambling "donaghys is a rare case that will likely only illustrate how easy it is to earn large sums of money with the power of a whistle " mr feschuk writes "the truth is many athletes and coaches are possessed of similar powers of influence over any given game people say salaries are too large for todays athletes to risk their livelihoods by laying bets and someone at yesterdays press conference asked stern if the referees might be due raises to reduce the incentive to bet stern pointed out that donaghy made &# u s last season and you only have to look at the gambling habits of wealthy athletes many engage in it and often to understand its not necessarily about needing the money they crave action and its not difficult to foresee for those most susceptible to bad decisions how the debts might mount up how the lines might become blurred how the life wrecking mistakes might get made " but its as wrong as it is easy to blame all of gambling for mr donaghys alleged crime sam borden writes in the florida times union mr donaghy doesnt deserve "to be the face of sports betting just like late st louis cardinals pitcher josh hancock doesnt deserve to be the face of beer drinking " mr borden writes "hancock was killed in a car crash three months ago and was found to be excessively intoxicated at the time since hancock reportedly had been drinking beers following the cardinals game earlier that evening there was a knee jerk reaction and several major league teams banned alcohol from their clubhouses entirely an incredibly tidy solution that completely ignored the idea that personal responsibility not the mere presence of alcohol was the main factor tragic as hancocks death was it wasnt a case of beer in the clubhouse that led to it it was a series of poor decisions a similar premise applies to donaghy " other refs have been neither accused nor entirely cleared but seattle times columnist jerry brewer worries about the fate of the innocent ones "the donaghy scandal has humanized referees in a most unappealing manner " mr brewer writes "if they are capable of getting mixed up with the mob couldnt they come to the game unnecessarily cranky because of an argument at home couldnt they have vendettas against players or coaches couldnt they miss a call while ogling someone in the stands the conspiracy theorists cant lose the officials cant win " the best antidote to the lingering doubts will be full transparency dave hyde prescribes in the south florida sun sentinel "opening the process reviewing the machine letting people behind the curtain thats the first step for all sports now " mr hyde writes "it wouldnt catch a donaghy but it will allow sports fans to hear why certain calls are made better inspect the process dismiss some conspiracy theories and have a better basis for considering if everythings authentic " amid this grim news los angeles times columnist bill dwyre seeks a happy sports story to relate he finds one in former nfl offensive lineman bruce matthews once "big tough and indestructible " who came to town last week ahead of his induction into pro footballs hall of fame he inspired current players on his alma maters team with a brief but powerful speech then hosted a dinner to raise money for the special olympics as the bronx was burning in july chicago was gearing up for an anticipated intra city world series never mind that the cubs and white sox eventually faded from first place "were approaching the th anniversary of one four day stretch from july when the town erupted in one giant celebration of baseball " paul sullivan writes in the chicago tribune "a memorable cubs reds slugfest at wrigley field on a thursday afternoon was followed by a frenzied four game series between the sox and royals at old comiskey park " mr sullivan recaps those four days of hope and excitement tip of the fix cap to readers christopher dickson and don hartline found a good column from the world of sports dont
