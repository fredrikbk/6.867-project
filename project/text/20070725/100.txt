private equity public benefits why does congress think that sharply boosting taxes on private equity companies will do anything other than stall or disrupt what is clearly a thriving american economy make no mistake the baucus grassley legislation in the senate and the levin bill in the house to hike levies on private equity and overhaul the taxation of publicly traded partnerships are dangerous they will inevitably harm american investors and our overall investment climate congress long ago recognized that innovation and risk taking are the driving forces behind our economic system and thats why our system is designed to encourage these activities contrary to the rhetoric thats precisely what private equity does between and private equity firms world wide created more than &# billion in net value for investors which include universities charitable organizations and pension plans covering tens of millions of americans thus the superior investments of private equity firms translate into stronger pension plans more financial aid and scholarships at public and private colleges and more funds for research to cure or treat diseases private equity firms re found companies improving the performance and increasing the value of the companies in which they invest successful private equity investments do this by focusing on longer term growth i know from personal experience elevation partners an equity fund has a minority stake in forbes that their time horizon goes well beyond wall streets obsession with quarterly results for example businesses backed by private equity funds typically see increased r&amp d spending and investments in capital projects expenses that many publicly traded companies often dont undertake because the short term pressures of the financial markets discourage long term sustained investments raising taxes on private equity doesnt just harm fund managers or investors it also harms the companies that need private equity investments to bring their innovations to market which in turn makes our entire economy less competitive such a tax hike would also raise americas overall effective corporate tax rate and while many believe that corporate taxes in the u s are low the surprising truth is that we have the second highest corporate tax rate in the world and the baucus grassley and levin proposals will raise those rates even further so what happens if we single out private equity partnerships and their managers and raise their taxes in most cases doubling the amount they pay as rep levin suggests or tripling the amount they pay as sens grassley and baucus propose to do those who think that they are only taking a shot at a small section of elite wealthy private equity managers are wrong private equity firms are the fiduciaries for teachers students police officers firefighters and many others across the u s in the largest pension funds by membership invested in private equity represented million retirees including plans from california new york texas florida new jersey ohio pennsylvania and michigan their collective private equity investment &# billion its also worth noting that several states have been able to avoid budget cuts or tax increases that would have been required to meet their legally mandated pension obligations to retirees who have devoted their careers to public service corporate pension funds also count on private equity to help meet their financial obligations to retired workers the largest corporate pension plans in including at&amp t general electric daimlerchrysler boeing and tiaa cref representing million members have &# billion invested in private equity funds charitable and philanthropic groups such as the salvation army the presbyterian church usa and the hess foundation use returns on private equity investments to perform a wide range of community betterment services ranging from providing medical care for the homeless to funding environmental organizations and childrens advocacy groups students at public and private universities get tuition assistance from the return on these investments and their educational institutions also use investment income to hire faculty construct buildings and fund programs the university of california the university of minnesota cornell pepperdine and emory are just some of the many institutions of higher learning that rely on private equity investment returns to bolster the educational experience they provide their students opening up the tax code for special treatment tinkering isnt a game and it shouldnt be treated like one if congress is serious about closing perceived loopholes or bringing more fairness to the tax system then its time to look at overall reform like a flat tax and not just an easy target but as it stands now raising taxes on private equity firms will have unintended consequences it is an ill conceived idea that will ultimately affect all of us and not for the better mr forbes is president &amp
