unlikely allies to check syria u s explores bond with muslim brothers activist group provides link to syrian islamists seeking womens rights washington on a humid afternoon in late may about supporters of syrias largest exile opposition group the national salvation front gathered outside damascuss embassy here to protest syrian president bashar assads rule the participants shouted anti assad slogans and raised banners proclaiming "change the regime now " the nsf unites liberal democrats kurds marxists and former syrian officials in an effort to transform president assads despotic regime but the washington protest also connected a pair of more unlikely players the u s government and the muslim brotherhood one of the nsfs most influential members is the syrian branch of the muslim brotherhood the decades old political movement active across the middle east whose leaders have inspired the terrorist groups hamas and al qaeda its syrian offshoot says it has renounced armed struggle in favor of democratic reform in the months leading up to the may rally the nsf held a string of meetings with officials from the state department and the national security council they discussed media and political strategies and the administration dispatched a camera crew from the u s government funded al hurra television station to beam scenes of the rally across the arab world how bush hard liners and the brotherhoods syrian branch came together is a tale of desperation to keep up the pressure on mr assad whose regime has weathered all attempts by the u s to cripple it in recent years the unusual relationship is also a measure of the evolving strategies on both sides as they seek ways to counter the syrian government the white house views syria along with its allies iran and militant groups hezbollah and hamas as a main threat to stability in the middle east so it is exploring the potential benefits of engaging with the brotherhood despite its checkered record the sunni group could provide a counterweight against the rising influence of shiite political power in the region it could also the reasoning goes emerge as a force for democratic change the u s has traditionally avoided contact with the brotherhood across the middle east but now the state department and national security council have begun to hold regular strategy sessions on syria policy with the nsf and is funding an organization linked to it senior officials from the state department and the national security council confirm the meetings the u s has also discussed with the nsf and linked groups ways to monitor elections and promote civil society in syria deputy assistant secretary of state scott carpenter says the u s talks "with everyone in the syrian opposition" to understand what is happening in the country and hasnt bestowed the nsf with special status the front "is the largest coalition of groups that have come together" to promote democratic change mr carpenter adds "its begun to have its own gravitational pull " u s diplomats and politicians have also met with legislators from parties connected to the muslim brotherhood in jordan egypt and iraq in recent months to hear their views on democratic reforms in the middle east u s officials say last month the state departments intelligence unit organized a conference of middle east experts to examine the merits of engagement with the brotherhood particularly in egypt and syria a syrian embassy spokesman in washington ahmed salkini described the nsf as "an insignificant force " and said damascus is aware of the nsfs activities and its meetings with the bush administration "its a coalition that lacks any form of legitimacy inside or outside syria " he said set up in the s by an egyptian schoolteacher amid the collapse of the ottoman empire the muslim brotherhoods leaders argued that only a society governed by islamic law could buttress the muslim world against foreign aggression and internal corruption a principal credo of founder hassan al banna states "the prophet is our leader quran is our law " branches spread across the arab world including syria jordan and iraq though ideologically linked to the egyptian group they were largely autonomous in the palestinian territories muslim brothers established hamas in as a militant response to israels occupation the organization seized control of the gaza strip this june the u s europe and israel designate hamas as a terrorist organization for its use of suicide attacks today the brotherhoods relationship to islamist militancy and al qaeda in particular is the source of much debate osama bin laden and other al qaeda leaders cite the works of the brotherhoods late intellectual sayyid qutb as an inspiration for their crusade against the west and arab dictators members of egyptian and syrian brotherhood arms have also gone on to take senior roles in mr bin ladens movement al qaedas leadership however has also criticized brotherhood branches recently for their embrace of democratic elections and dialogue with western powers the brotherhoods modern leadership has renounced al qaedas use of violence the brotherhoods syrian branch was established in the s and won seats in early parliamentary elections and government cabinets in the s the baath party and the assad family seized power ushering in a violent chapter in syrian history arms of the brotherhood assassinated senior military and baath party officials in the s syria made membership in the brotherhood a capital offense in in the regime killed up to civilians in the city of hama a brotherhood stronghold driving many of its leaders into exile syria currently has mixed relations with islamist groups damascus supports the brotherhood inspired hamas as well as hezbollah in their fight against israels presence in the region the u s charges syria with facilitating the entrance of al qaeda fighters into iraq a charge syria denies but the staunchly secular regime represses these or other islamist groups seeking political change within the country among the syrian exiles pressing for regime change is ali sadreddin al bayanouni a lawyer and former bodyguard to brotherhood officials mr bayanouni fled to jordan in and eventually took over as president of the brotherhoods syrian arm in amman expelled him to appease damascus and mr bayanouni settled in london fit and energetic despite his years he personifies to many the new moderate leadership of the brotherhood though his son in law was executed during the crackdown mr bayanouni says he rules out armed struggle as a way to change syria he advocates the rights of women and ethnic minorities and envisions a government based on "pluralism and power sharing " "the brotherhood has a very moderate understanding of islam that needs to be taken into account " he says the seeds of the nsf were planted four years ago by abdul halim khaddam who was among the longest serving senior baath party officials under late president hafez assad president assad died in replaced by his son bashar by mr khaddam says he believed one party rule was fueling corruption and wrecking syrias economy mr khaddam then syrias vice president secretly contacted mr bayanouni to discuss a rapprochement through a third party mr khaddam says he conveyed his belief that syria could progress only if the muslim brotherhood was brought inside the political system in mr khaddam resigned and fled to paris messrs khaddam and bayanouni formed the nsf in february the marriage of the muslim brothers and breakaway baathists shocked many in the arab world the pair also reached out to the bush administration hoping a partnership with the u s could increase pressure on president assad instead of requesting military aid or financing the group is seeking washingtons help in focusing on syrias human rights record it is pressing for more financial sanctions on president assads family the u s already has some sanctions on syria including on senior government officials the nsf also wants washington to give up its historical bias against islamists in government saying the brotherhood could help moderate damascuss behavior "we dont want to see the u s give the regime a way out from its violations " mr khaddam says an initial contact between the white house and nsf was forged by najib ghadbian a university of arkansas political scientist in mr ghadbian and other syrian americans had set up the syrian national council in a bid to influence the u s policy debate meeting that fall with a senior state department official he suggested the u s work with his group and its contacts including the brotherhood u s officials confirm they were initially resistant to talking with syrian groups tied to the brotherhood syrian americans were also divided at a january conference of syrian american activists in washington participants debated whether to align with the nsf the syrian reform party a group of pro democracy activists close to the bush national security team declined to attend "we cant trust our future to islamists " says its president farid ghadry a regular visitor at the white house "the brotherhood will never moderate itself " mr ghadbians group however decided to join the nsf syrian american activists he explained "wouldnt be taken seriously" in the arab world without ties to arguably the largest group opposing president assad as progressed washington became increasingly concerned about syrias military alliance with iran and the threat it posed to u s interests in the region damascus and tehran backed hezbollah which fought israel to a virtual draw that summer the white house also worried about the threat syria posed to lebanons pro western government by early summer the stance of key administration officials including the white houses chief middle east adviser elliott abrams began to shift say u s diplomats and nsf members the white houses national security council quietly vetted messrs bayanouni and khaddam through retired diplomats and syrian american activists participants in the process say u s officials sought assurance that the syrian brotherhood was committed to democracy and had renounced violence they also hoped mr khaddam could provide information on the inner workings of the assad regime during syrian exile and democracy activist ammar abdulhamid emerged as one of the nsfs main liaisons with senior white house officials in the weeks surrounding the lebanon war which began in july messrs abdulhamid and ghadbian and other syrian americans met with mr abramss deputies in the old executive office building next to the white house through these intermediaries the white house exhorted the nsf to build a wide coalition of opposition groups and to run it in a transparent and democratic manner participants say the two sides began discussing ways to highlight the problems of syrias parliamentary and presidential elections approaching in the baathists allowed no candidates from other parties to run in the may presidential poll in the weeks before the presidential election the state departments middle east partnership initiative which promotes regional democracy and nsf members met to talk about publicizing syrias lack of democracy and low voter turnout participants say a washington based consulting firm c&amp o resources inc assisted the nsf in its planning for the may anti assad rally at the syrian embassy providing media and political contacts state department officials stress they provided no financial or technical support to the protestors turnout for the may rally in washington was smaller than expected from behind the windows of syrias colonial style embassy building officials snapped photos of the crowd some protesters worried they could be linked with family members back in syria covered their faces with scarves the cooperation has come at a price for both sides the bush administration has come under fire from critics who point to the brotherhoods ties to hamas and al qaeda they also argue that any u s partnership with the group could destabilize governments in jordan and egypt two u s allies where the brotherhood is a growing opposition force the u s says it is committed to opening political processes across the middle east meanwhile mr bayanouni and the syrian brothers have drawn criticism from some brotherhood leaders in the middle east who say contacts with the u s discredits their movement and inside syria courts have ordered long prison sentences for three prominent democracy activists in recent weeks one of whom visited the white house last year senior state department and national security council officials say they havent ruled out meeting with mr bayanouni and other brotherhood leaders in the future mr bayanouni says the cooperation through the nsf is merely a good start "in the absence of direct dialogue" between the u s and the syrian brothers he says "we believe the american image of the brotherhood will always remain vague " unlikely relationship key players in bringing closer the white house and syrias branch of the muslim brotherhood abdul halim khaddam syrias vice president until when he expressed distaste for president bashar assads rule and fled to paris helped form national salvation front a political alliance with
