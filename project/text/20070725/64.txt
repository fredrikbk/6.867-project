how upgrading memory can hit the bottom line more memory may mean more headaches for handset makers the increasing reliance on cellphones to store video music and digital photos best illustrated by apple inc s iphone has consumers clamoring for more memory storage but the rising demand and price for flash the term for chips that can store data even if a device is off may also put handset manufacturers in a bind as they struggle to keep costs down and profitability up "in the near term youll see trimming of profit margins squeezing of components " said mike sadler who heads up world wide sales for memory chip maker micron technology inc flash is a popular option for handset makers because its thin profile and low power consumption make it ideal for increasingly smaller phone designs the demand for more memory however leaves handset makers a few unsavory options such as eating the costs raising the products price or making consumers buy their own removable flash cards "if we have to put in more memory you have more cost " said muzib khan who heads up product management and engineering at samsung electronics co s u s telecommunications unit "that has to be translated into the price if you cant it hits your bottom line " to keep costs down handset makers have gone with the third option of making consumers buy their own removable flash cards the companies argue the external memory is more flexible because users can swap out cards with different data it is also at the behest of u s carriers which are sensitive to the prices that their subscribers have to pay for phones it is a similar model to how digital cameras are marketed the device is sold with a small amount of flash memory and consumers are expected to buy their own larger cards "i still believe external memory is the right option for a majority of the users " mr khan said others however disagree "the problem is the model doesnt work " said avi greengart an analyst at research firm current analysis he argued that phones should be sold through a digital music player model where memory capacity is one of the chief selling points excluding a flash card artificially lowers the price of the phone he said consumers are increasingly looking for a complete product mr greengart said and some believe the popularity of the iphone which has four to eight gigabytes of memory embedded in the device will cause a shift in how carriers and handset makers approach memory in the phone according to isuppli a market analysis company the amount of available memory in cellphones is expected to surge tenfold in the next two years much of the jump in memory capacity will occur toward higher end phones where handset makers can charge more and actually widen their margins the dilemma lies in how the handset makers will be able to boost the memory capacity in mass market phones and absorb the higher cost of memory nokia corp spokesman keith novak argued the increased efficiencies derived from mass production would keep costs under control many handset makers meanwhile have chosen to work on devices that combine some internal memory with an external slot mr novak added that in the long run nokia will be able to cram more gigabytes into the phone at the same or a cheaper price but in the near term the price of a certain kind of flash memory called nand looks to be on the rise prices for flash jumped since may it has benefited samsung among the worlds largest providers of flash memory another alternative for handset makers is to raise the average selling price for their products that use flash in effect making consumers pick up the slack other consumer electronic device makers have been wrestling with the problem but most manufacturing executives say for now that is out of the question given consumer expectations about their electronics "when is the last time you saw an electronics company raise prices " said greg shoemaker who heads up procurement for hewlett packard co which uses flash memory in its cameras and usb based data storage devices "electronics consumers dont expect to pay more for performance they expect to pay less " he added flash based device makers say they can still digest the increased costs of the chips with little impact on margins profit or what they charge consumers for what they make the question is just how long they can hold out the demand is pushing flash to a make or break moment in its history in effect while flash has never been more popular one of the main reasons for its popularity its cost is slowly eroding ultimately the next few product manufacturing cycles could weigh heavily on whether flash continues its rapid adoption or falls back into relative obscurity say manufacturing executives the present day conundrum follows the rapid rise in flash adoption as a cost effective alternative to using more bulky and expensive solid state drives just like other drives flash memory can be erased and used again with ease but it could be done much cheaper and without sacrificing much processing prowess
