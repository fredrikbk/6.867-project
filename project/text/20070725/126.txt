web radio battles efforts to expand royalties for music even president bushs toughest critics would forgive him his confusion when at a forum in nashville tenn last week he was asked if he would support the payment of "a statutory royalty to the performing artists for radio and television airplay " in the process "changing our laws to align with the rest of the world " "help " the president gulped to abundant laughter "i have no earthly idea what youre talking about " neither do most citizens who arent employed in the entertainment broadcasting or digital media industries the manner in which music gets licensed in this country the topic of the above question is almost as complicated as the technology used to send that music over the internet as music has spilled out onto the web so have disagreements about how to license it the latest of what may be many such disputes took place last month when an estimated internet radio stations held a "day of silence " they were protesting new royalty rates proposed by the copyright review board a panel of three judges charged by congress with settling on rates that would be fair to both sides the standoff involves proposed royalties to music labels and musicians smaller web companies say the new rates would put them out of business the talks now under way involve only labels and musicians composers and songwriters along with the publishers who represent them get paid via an entirely separate royalty system next year they will get their turn to have new web royalty rates determined by the copyright board we may see a rerun of the current controversy and a day of silence by a slightly different cast of characters yet another standoff is in the cards involving satellite radio which has its own set of agreements between the labels and musicians that issue goes before the copyright board as soon as the current web radio impasse is resolved every piece of recorded music is covered by two separate copyrights the first involves the musical composition itself and is usually handled by music publishers on behalf of composers and songwriters the other is for a specific recording of the song which is owned by record labels and musicians those two copyrights are nearly as old as recorded music itself they have spawned huge organizations to represent the various parties including the recording industry association of america which speaks for record labels and ascap and bmi which are music publishers that represent songwriters web radio companies including big internet broadcasters such as yahoo are banded together through the digital media association often interests on the content creation side of the music business are aligned as when they join forces to fight music piracy but record labels and musicians typically can negotiate royalties while songwriters and composers are usually forced to take a fixed amount one established via a legal proceeding set up by congress the publishers representing the songwriters one day would like to change that to gain flexibility in negotiations the more immediate prospective change involves the issue with which mr bush was confronted it involves whether record labels and performers should be paid a royalty whenever their songs are aired on the radio in the u s unlike most of the world they arent songwriters however are the exemption is decades old and has saved radio stations billions of dollars in royalty payments over the years its existence is generally credited to the clout of the u s broadcasting industry as music attorney chris castle says "every congressional district has a radio station but only three of them have record labels " the broadcasters have justified the exemption by saying radio play increases sales labels and musicians respond that the internet is changing all of the old rules about the economic realities of music and they have begun a push to abolish the exemption the question to president bush was part of the new pr offensive music fans on the web are at the forefront of the disputes over digital rights for example a music sale via a service like itunes is considered the same as the sale of a physical cd in terms of royalties but when you stream a piece of music that is considered a "performance" of the song and an entirely distinct set of royalties kicks in this distinction works to the disadvantage of songwriters who are fighting to get music downloads categorized as performances and not sales court rulings though have so far been against them most lay people surveying this terrain quickly conclude that it would be more efficient to have everyone involved in music creation be they record labels or songwriters aligned on one side and negotiating together with the same occurring across the table with music users be they radio stations or web broadcasters but there is little chance of that happening the legal financial and institutional interests all diverge the best any music fan can do as future disputes crop up and they will is to keep score of who is negotiating with whom and over what and hope for the best email me at lee gomes wsj com corrections &amp amplifications ascap and bmi are music royalty collection services not music publishers as erroneously described in wednesdays portals column also the copyright for music performances originated in rather than far earlier as the column incorrectly indicated wsj july
