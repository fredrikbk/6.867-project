common sense american home mortgage plunge is portfolio management lesson smartmoney what do you do when a stock you own takes a hit regular readers of this column are familiar with my strategy for buying lower selling higher using targets on a broad market index like the nasdaq recently ive been deluged with emails and calls asking whether i use the same strategy for individual stocks the short answer is "no " before elaborating let me explain that the reason for all these inquiries is the precipitous decline in shares of american home mortgage investment a mortgage real estate investment trust that i have recommended i bought shares myself thinking that the carnage in the subprime mortgage market should be reflected in its share price especially since ahm has almost no direct exposure to the subprime market my reasoning turned out to be wrong to put it mildly last thursday ahm shares lost more than of their already diminished value tumbling to less than &# a share yesterday shares were down cents or to &# at p m buying a stock that has already plunged in value may turn out to be a shrewd contrarian investment or it may turn out to be throwing good money after bad in either case it isnt the equivalent of using broad moves in the market to identify opportunities to buy and sell stocks you can lose your entire investment betting on one stock thursdays selloff was evidently triggered by speculation the company was being denied access to short term lines of credit the lifeblood of a mortgage lender when i contacted ahm a spokeswoman said no credit line had been pulled apart from the speculation theres little to explain why ahm stock has been punished so severely some bargain hunters stepped in friday and on the face of it the stock screams "buy " the dividend yield is and the p e is ahm has very little exposure to subprime mortgages but ahm does have exposure to so called alt prime mortgages which are just one step up the food chain it also marketed option mortgages which allow qualifying buyers to choose their mortgage payment and like other mortgage issuers it sold many variable rate mortgages with rates that are now being reset or will be soon at higher rates in the current atmosphere all of these products have made investors jittery in june ahm forecast a second quarter loss and withdrew guidance for the year but reaffirmed its dividend of cents a share it attributed the shortfall to rising delinquencies on mortgages it issued a reduced demand for the mortgages it packages and sells to investors and losses on loans it had to buy back under warranties extended to buyers but it said these trends were stabilizing and had shown some improvement the ahm spokeswoman told me she cant make any further comment until the company announces results for the quarter ended june ahm hasnt yet said when it will announce those results but i consider it prudent to wait my initial recommendation was based on the good reputation of the companys management its excellent liquidity and its lack of exposure to the subprime crisis none of that has changed but what started as a subprime mortgage crisis is working its way through the financial system in some unexpected and unpredictable ways the current level of uncertainty is simply too great for any but the most risk tolerant investors i plan to hold my ahm position at least until i have a chance to assess its latest earnings fortunately ahm represents a tiny fraction of my portfolio if i couldnt afford to lose the entire investment in which case i wouldnt have bought in the first place id sell ahm and take the tax loss i also plan to hold my other mortgage reits which are newcastle investment and thornburg mortgage neither of which has fared so badly because the mortgage crisis is unfolding in what seems like slow motion i dont expect much more visibility for the sector until late this year at the earliest james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
