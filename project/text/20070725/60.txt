full disclosure in a couple of months my genome my answers to a substantial health questionnaire and my medical records as many of them as i can collect anyway will be posted on the internet for all to see im one of members of harvard geneticist george churchs personal genome project we all come to this with slightly different motivations histories and medical records but we share in theory the equivalent of a masters degree in genetics an age between and and a willingness to come to boston to give blood get our faces professionally photographed and sit down with one another to discuss strategy what are my motives first i want to show that theres nothing especially magical about my genome it doesnt hold secret knowledge that will allow others to harm me as they might by sticking pins into a voodoo doll in fact i feel more trepidation about releasing other information that is more personal because it will reflect my behavior yes i inhaled but not a lot the fact that i saw a shrink but not for long and so on i dont have any deep secrets or vulnerabilities that would embarrass or create risks for myself or for relatives who share my genes i dont have an employer who could fire me for black marks on my health record and i have health insurance for the next three years anyway which will cover me for whatever ensues from the pre cancerous colon polyp that was discovered and removed a couple of years ago but what about the people who are less fortunate than me i want to push questions about those less lucky to the fore and get us all to think about them its not just who gets health care and how it gets paid for or whether employers can discriminate against people with certain conditions or just a greater than average propensity for them what of someone who has a particular susceptibility to say alcohol does he pay an extra tax on booze or does he get a tax credit for behaving well while a less susceptible person is denied the opportunity to benefit by behaving "properly" subsidies and penalties cut both ways should people have the right to refuse subsidized medical care and live as they wish these questions may sound far fetched but they wont be once society knows enough information to start asking them furthermore i believe that the broader spread of this kind of medical and personal information is inevitable for most people this kind of information wont be easily accessible on the internet to strangers but it will be discoverable by employers insurers law enforcement and probably by anyone with the inclination and resources to hunt for it aggressively greater knowledge implies greater responsibility in so many spheres its fine not to take actions when you dont know the consequences but when you do know the consequences both action and inaction are a decision so why dont we just close the lid on all this knowledge and continue in blissful ignorance avoiding responsibility for policies that inevitably pit the interests of some against those of others and that may be intrusive because the information were gaining whether from this project or from many other studies with less public data has the power to be tremendously useful not just in predicting who is likely not guaranteed to face certain conditions but also for whom certain drugs therapies and foods will be helpful and for whom they may be useless or harmful pretty soon says ryan phelan of dna direct "you would no more take a drug without knowing the relevant data from your genome than you would get a blood transfusion without knowing your blood type " the of us are just the beginning project leader church wants to scale up to people im skeptical if only because i have a healthy respect for the challenges of scaling from managing quality to managing any kind of interaction with thousands of people especially around an unfamiliar topic as for competition these businesses will be competing primarily on the value added in terms of management and interpretation of information not on the mere sequencing of the genomes and here we get to the interesting part the of us are fairly well informed and we know whom to turn to for help if we get an anomalous result but what if the th person has something alarming in his medical records this is a research project we will be careful not to give clinical advice or diagnoses which could subject us to additional regulation but if someone has a marker indicating a possibility not a certainty of some condition what should the project do most likely it will produce some kind of carefully hedged statement "you have a marker that you may want to discuss with a doctor or a genetic counselor heres a link to further medical information " thats pretty lame but its all a research project can or should do we may well decide to change our approach before that point or at least to form partnerships with clinical providers whose business it is to provide personal medical advice the project will be providing data for others to use whether in research personal medical care or commerce after all its public anyone is free to use the data in research to explore correlations visualize statistics or propound theories no doubt each of us will be getting incredibly well informed advice from leading researchers in many fields and well intentioned advice from others or not it may well be that the worst result of all this is spam directed at the posters "hey esther dyson we see youve got gene our new patented whizzo with extra nutrients is designed just for you order your free one month trial now and renew for only &# a month " so how to separate the wheat from the chaff doctors and others who undertake to meet the criteria to qualify as trusted advisors in conjunction with researchers ready to criticize others work a savvy press and vigilant regulators will work that out as they do today for better or worse no one said it would be easy but the knowledge from our project and with luck from many others will ultimately lead to better information that will be there for anyone to use and finally well also find out that genes are not necessarily destiny even a chance of developing something is an chance against it ms dyson is an investor in a number of health care related start ups including and me patientslikeme and ovusoft and is a director of andme see related letter
