union doozy it isnt every day you can observe in broad daylight congressional democrats mugging state budgets to benefit special interests but thats precisely what is happening in a provision of the farm bill now making its way through congress at the behest of the association of federal state county and municipal employees afscme the huge public employee union house democrats are pushing a measure that would undermine state efforts to improve food stamp and welfare programs across the country sponsored by california democrat joe baca the provision effectively bans states from working with private companies to improve the administration of these antipoverty programs for the gory details see indiana which has undertaken a major reorganization of food stamps and welfare the state has joined with a group of companies led by ibm to modernize a system that was by all measures one of the countrys worst leading the nation in child deaths and last in moving people from welfare to work indianas goal is to deliver welfare benefits more efficiently to those who qualify for them its reform aims to save &# million over years by moving some government jobs to the private sector which afscme likes to call "domestic oursourcing " but while this could mean fewer dues paying union members the state contract with ibm specifically requires that all current employees be offered work on the new system and what do you know more than chose the private sector adding call centers and online resources will also help reduce welfare fraud in december a federal state investigation found more than ineligible drug felons collecting welfare in marion county alone but no effort to make government more accountable goes unpunished under the house provision the hoosier state would be forced to cancel the &# billion year deal with ibm while taxpayers would have to shoulder the more than &# million in additional costs to bring the operation back into the bureaucracy worse the money to make up the shortfall would likely come out of the same purse thats been funding an increasing number of child welfare caseworkers which was another goal of reform this problem isnt lost on two of indianas own democratic congressmen joe donnelly and brad ellsworth earlier this week they offered an amendment to create a carve out for the state by proposing periodic evaluations to prove whether the new system was better and more efficient forget it the unions helped roll them in committee taking pleasure in sticking it to gop governor mitch daniels who famously cancelled all union contracts with state employees on his first day in office he also once advised a pioneering privatizer of city services former indianapolis mayor stephen goldsmith so this is double union payback in the process however democrats are also harming other states that have privatized administration of their food stamp programs to some extent and five more that are considering it already governors from minnesota florida texas washington connecticut and rhode island have objected to the provision theyll get no hearing from beltway democrats whose preoccupation is getting out the union vote in next years election speaking to the afscme leadership forum last week democratic hopefuls took turns giving hosannas new mexico governor bill richardson pledged to nominate a "union person" to be secretary of labor hillary clinton called that a "great idea " no word on what they think of this welfare reform rollback but we can guess the good news is that the white house has some leverage over the farm bill because many democratic freshmen are from rural districts and want to see it pass this union doozy deserves to be prime veto bait see related letter "letters to the editor sticking it to indianas food stamp program" wsj july
