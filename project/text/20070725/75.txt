living life like eloise more hotels add condos just north of downtown dallas crescent real estate equities co is building a room ritz carlton hotel designed by star architect robert a m stern when it opens next month guests will be able to get a facial or a massage at the spa or get room service from celebrity chef dean fearings new spot downstairs but the new property isnt just for tourists or businesspeople it will come with ritz carlton brand condos and four lavishly appointed homes the developers call "freestanding manors " condo residents will be able to enjoy the hotels spa room service and other amenities crescent is including the condos because the amount the ritz carlton will charge for visitors about &# a room isnt enough for the company to make money "to build a luxury hotel today you really have to look at some component that helps underwrite the cost " says bill mabus vice president of development for crescent based in fort worth texas had it not been for the condos it is unlikely that this hotel or for that matter most luxury hotels under construction across the u s would ever have gotten the green light to be built that is because the cost of land and construction along with the expense of plush amenities and services needed to be a luxury hotel such as twice a day maid service have risen faster than the price much of the public is willing to pay for a room as a result the only way most developers can afford to build luxury hotels is if they are part of broader development projects that typically include a residential component "it makes projects viable that werent viable " says laurence geller chief executive of chicago based strategic hotels and resorts inc which is planning a four seasons near mexico city with a condominium component and which has hotel condominium developments in san diego and chicago hotel developers are guided by a basic rule of thumb to be profitable a hotel should be able to charge at least one dollar in room rate for every &# it costs to build a room in the mid s it cost as little as &# a room to build a luxury hotel such as a four seasons mandarin oriental or ritz carlton meaning those hotels needed to be able to charge at least &# a night to be profitable but today it costs &# a room on average but most consumers even wealthy ones wont pay upwards of &# a night for a hotel room the average room rate for a four seasons in the u s for example was &# in the fourth quarter of the last publicly available numbers lodging econometrics a consulting firm in portsmouth n h estimates that of the luxury hotels and resorts in development in the u s are being built as part of larger real estate projects up from or so in the s typically the revenue from the nonhotel portion of the project subsidizes the hotel rooms and in most cases the additional revenue stream comes from sales of condominiums sometimes the additional revenue comes from high end retail space or office space "this is radically different " says patrick ford president of lodging econometrics "it wasnt always this way " fortunately for hoteliers the growing class of wealthy people embracing hotel living means that sales of these hotel condos have remained solid even as the broader housing market in many cities is slumping the business executives law partners and other highly paid professionals who are typical buyers boast income that is soaring as globalization helps wealth flow to the top at the same time these people are working more hours traveling frequently and want their limited free time at home to be free of the nuisances of daily life and homeownership "our customers own multiple homes says mike minchin director of planning and residential marketing with four seasons hotels &amp resorts inc based in toronto "our clients dont want to deal with the headaches of mowing the lawn or maintenance issues and they dont want to manage a staff of butlers they want to make sure thats all handled by the four seasons theres very strong demand for that " it was once fairly standard in the early part of the th century for hotels to have full time residents though they were typically renters not owners think of the childrens book character eloise living at the "tippy top floor" of the plaza hotel in manhattan today that property is converting much of its space to luxury condos as part of a thorough renovation by its new owner four seasons first residential development was in houston in it has operating now with nine in sales and an unspecified number in the pipeline mr minchin says william rich vice president of delta associates an alexandria va based real estate research firm says hotel branded condos are performing better than the overall housing market because "if you can afford a &# million condo you can afford that in good times and bad " and developers have found they can charge a hefty premium for condos associated with luxury hotel brands in seattle for example the room four seasons hotel and private residences under construction will offer its homeowners access to all hotel services including the spa pool room service personal shopping valet and hour concierge service for those services buyers are paying between &# million and &# million for apartments that range from square feet for a one bedroom to square feet for a customizable floor plan despite being next door to the lusty lady strip club pike place market and the seattle art museum are also nearby the four seasons condos are getting more than a premium over comparable apartments that arent part of a luxury hotel says matthew gardner a principal with gardner johnson a real estate advisory firm "the synergies are fantastic " says john oppenheimer managing partner of seattle hotel group llc the &# million projects developer a story four seasons hotel under construction in denver the citys first five star hotel will have hotel rooms along with condos that the developer says are being sold at a premium because of the brand name and services the homes start at &# and top out at &# million in two weeks palladian development will break ground on a story mandarin oriental tower with hotel rooms and condos overlooking millennium park in chicago prices start at &# and top out at the penthouse at &# million and more than half have sold "people really like the fact that they can take the elevator down to the spa in the morning and pop by to eat or order room service at night " says chris kenny palladians chief financial officer the trend isnt limited to luxury hotels although luxury hotels make up the lions share of the market according to lodging econometrics of all hotel rooms in development in the u s are part of a residential mixed use project many of which include so called condo hotels not pure residences most residential units for sale in luxury hotels are intended for the exclusive use of the owner who pays an annual maintenance and services fee with condo hotels though developers sell hotel rooms to individuals who typically can stay in the units as many as days a year the rest of the time the unit is rented out nightly like a regular hotel room with the hotel management and the room owner splitting the revenue hoteliers sell timeshares or vacation clubs as well how far luxury hoteliers will push into residences is hard to determine even the two biggest names in luxury four seasons and the ritz dont see eye to eye on the subject mr minchin says four seasons wont build a purely residential tower because the company believes it cant provide its customary level of service without the critical mass the hotel provides but ritz carlton is pushing into branded residential with nine projects that bear its famous name sans the hotel the most ambitious test is near scottsdale ariz where developers are building the first master planned ritz carlton community at a cost of &# billion residents will have access to room service housekeeping and other hotel amenities
