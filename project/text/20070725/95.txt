politics &amp economics u s iran talks on iraq yield little tension from other issues makes it difficult to reach consensus on security washington after meeting with iranian officials twice in recent months the bush administration faces a basic question is there any room for cooperation between washington and tehran at least when it comes to curbing the violence in iraq the answer for the moment appears to be just barely following their first session in may the u s ambassador to iraq ryan crocker had a much longer and testier session yesterday in baghdad with his iranian counterpart ambassador hassan kazemi qomi the two sides had "several heated exchanges " mr crocker said on a conference call over u s accusations that iran continues to increase aid to radical groups that are attacking u s forces and iraqi civilians the u s warned that any members of irans elite quds force found in iraq "are not going to be safe " but in the end hoping to point to some positive outcome the u s iran and iraq agreed "in principle" to set up a security subcommittee to continue security talks at a less formal level the bush administration has tiptoed into these talks with iran the first of their kind in years hesitantly and with only moderate expectations after the first session in may mr crocker said both sides had the same aim "a secure stable democratic federal iraq in control of its own security at peace with its neighbors " yet yesterdays round illustrated how tough it is for the two antagonists to meet on just one subject iraq while they are bedeviled by so many other grievances these range from irans nuclear program to tehrans accusations that the u s is bent on regime change in iran one outburst yesterday came when iran tried to broaden the discussion to talk about other concerns beyond iraq mr crocker said he cut off mr qomi by noting "that a broad discussion would certainly need to take up issues such as their support for terrorism throughout the region including hezbollah and hamas " critics in the u s and abroad have urged the bush administration to sit down with iran on those issues arguing that the tensions between the two countries are a major contributor to instability in the region but the administration says it will talk to iran on broader concerns only when tehran suspends its uranium enrichment work a move iran says it wont make under any circumstances mr crocker told reporters after the seven hour session that since the two parties met last the u s has seen "an increase not a decrease of iranian activities in support of radical militia elements" in iraq he noted increasing shelling of baghdads green zone which includes the u s embassy and many iraqi ministries from shiite held areas of the city supported by iranian forces in washington the administration went after iran in another way yesterday imposing an asset freeze on an iran based group the martyrs foundation and a u s offshoot both of which the treasury department said were helping to support the radical lebanese group hezbollah which the u s considers a terrorist organization after the baghdad session mr qomi responded to u s accusations that it was fueling violence in iraq by saying it was actually trying to help the country cope with "terror and the presence of foreign forces " the talks he said were a step forward "its now up to the americans to rectify their mistakes " he said mr crocker did note a positive twist "the iranians " he said "did at one point say that it was not their policy or their intention to defeat the u s in iraq "
