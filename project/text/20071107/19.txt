bancrofts bicker miss a deadline lose board choice the bancroft family is sending one of its own to serve on news corp s board but only after internal discussions almost as rancorous as family members endured while deciding whether to sell dow jones &amp co so unruly were the talks that the family missed an initial day deadline under which it was permitted to nominate its own candidate for news corp s approval thereby contractually ceding the choice to dow joness prospective owner news corp chairman rupert murdoch the bancrofts then continued to argue over their choice while mr murdoch didnt impose a choice on the family he eventually did limit whom he would consider vetoing one candidate and deflecting another by asking that the bancrofts choose a woman the end result has brought no more harmony to the family instead of the seasoned newspaper veteran some family members and many journalists had hoped for the familys representative will be natalie bancroft a year old opera singer living in europe who by her own admission is a relative neophyte to the worlds of both journalism and commerce "i dont think weve distinguished ourselves in how weve handled this " said the familys lawyer michael elefante in a recent interview for many in the bancroft family sending a representative to news corp s board was a way of easing the pain in deciding to sell dow jones and the wall street journal a custodianship that had been the wellspring of their wealth and pride for generations some within the family were embarrassed that they had appeared indecisive and fractious during the acquisition process and wanted to send a message by making a choice that indicated their respect for journalistic ideals instead their deliberations misfired "this entire sad and pathetic final episode is a fiasco " family member crawford hill said in a recent email to his relatives "no wonder we lost dow jones " under dow joness merger agreement with news corp mr elefante and bancroft family member elizabeth steele were given days from the date of the aug merger agreement to settle on a representative to join news corp s board of directors whose members include jose maria aznar the former president of spain and legendary investor thomas j perkins the early preferred candidate among some family members was former journal managing editor paul e steiger mr murdoch signaled he was amenable but mr steiger on aug declined to be considered because he is launching a nonprofit investigative journalism enterprise and felt he shouldnt sit on any individual company boards he said in an interview more than three weeks later the deadline passed it was a time when all the parties involved in the merger negotiations were exhausted after three months of drama many went on vacation on aug family member thomas hill sent an email to mr elefante urging that they deal with the board decision and nominating mr steiger who had turned down the job two days before many in the family werent aware of the deadline in a note to the family on sept christopher bancroft who is on the dow jones board said mr elefante and ms steele told him that "they were not aware of these timing details " a person familiar with the situation said that mr elefante was aware of the deadline but didnt learn of mr steigers decision until late august this person also said mr murdoch was pursuing ms steele for the post in august accounting for more delays unaware the deadline had passed crawford hill put forth john carroll the former editor of the los angeles times who left his job in protest over disagreements with the papers owner tribune co the family approached him informally said mr carroll "i said it was fine to take it to the next step but i didnt want to be occupying a meaningless chair on the board " news corp rejected mr carroll indicating to mr elefante that it wanted a candidate from the family mr elefante passed this on setting a deadline of sept within hours ms bancroft threw her hat in the ring as did other family members in a short email to mr elefante and ms steele ms bancroft wrote that while it might seem "far fetched " she believed the board seat was something she had "the capacity to handle " her father hugh bancroft iii followed up with a note endorsing his daughters bid "although she does not puff up her chest when talking about herself which is part of natalies character she is direct and to the point " he wrote on sept mr elefante revealed the familys choice mike hill an environmental scientist in boston and brother to both crawford and thomas mr hill had pushed the family to meet mr murdoch and was known as an aggressive critic of the companys former management but news corp wasnt comfortable with his activism say people familiar with the situation mr murdochs camp also signaled that it would prefer a woman there are no women on the news corp board mr murdoch had hoped ms steele a supporter of the takeover would accept the seat but she declined telling people she wanted to "move on " she wouldnt comment another potential candidate was elisabeth goth chelberg a champion equestrian who had angered the family a decade ago by criticizing dow jones management and was a proponent of the news corp deal but after deliberating for weeks mr murdoch settled on ms bancroft an associate had interviewed her in london and mr murdoch later spoke to her directly mike hill said in an interview "now i know what al gore feels like " mr elefante and ms steele unenthusiastically communicated the decision to the family "while news corp is aware that other members of the family received more support from within the family news corp has interviewed natalie and elected to nominate her " they wrote in ms bancroft mr murdoch has selected a family member who had deep reservations about selling the family business to him in a letter to her family on july ms bancroft wrote that she opposed the sale because she believed mr murdoch was "not the right person to own this paper but on the other hand as protective as we are and with much of the false pride many of us have do we deserve to own this paper any longer " ms bancroft has spent most of her life in europe a budding mezzo soprano opera singer and formula one car racing fan she studied music at a private conservatory in lausanne she hasnt been an active player in her familys stewardship of dow jones and didnt directly participate in any of the family meetings about the sale instead she phoned from europe when the familys final vote was under way in late july she was sailing off the coast of corsica ms bancroft must be approved by the other directors a vote is unlikely before news corp s takeover of dow jones is finalized the deal is expected to close shortly after a shareholder vote on dec corrections &amp amplifications spains prime minister is officially known as the "president of the government " a nov marketplace article about news corp s board incompletely gave the official title of jose maria aznar as former president of spain wsj nov
