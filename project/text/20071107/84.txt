ntsb weighs measures to improve air safety los angeles transportation safety watchdogs when they update their annual list of "most wanted" improvements later this week are likely to add recommendations aimed at preventing airliners from careening off runways during takeoffs or landings according to people familiar with the details the national transportation safety board is leaning toward expanding the "most wanted" list for aviation these people said by calling for stepped up efforts against such runway excursions or overruns the board is expected to discuss expanding the current language on runway safety which focuses on stopping runway incursions instances when two aircraft or an aircraft and an airport vehicle mistakenly end up simultaneously on the same runway at its meeting tomorrow in washington the safety board also is expected to consider a proposal to expand another of its top aviation safety categories dealing with fatigue related hazards the board is mulling adding air traffic controllers to its "most wanted" recommendation calling for reducing "accidents and incidents caused by human fatigue " the current ntsb aviation safety priorities call for revising working hour limits for cockpit crews and mechanics based on the latest research on fatigue and rest requirements a safety board spokesman declined to comment on the "most wanted" list before the five member board votes on the issues the anticipated changes come in the wake of public debate over both issues as well as a string of runway overrun accidents in recent years those crashes include a southwest airlines co jet that landed too fast and slid off a slushy runway at midway airport in chicago in december and the crash of a tam linhas aereas sa jetliner that sped off the end of the strip in sao paulo brazil in july killing more than people until now the boards "most wanted" list of aviation safety improvements has called for equipment able to "give immediate warnings of probable runway collision incursion directly" to pilots likewise the federal aviation administration has focused on measures both in the cockpit and by air traffic controllers to maintain the required safe distance between planes on the ground the agency for example has made it easier for carriers to install onboard moving map displays alerting pilots of an impending runway collision but according to global analyses of aviation safety hazards by jet maker boeing co and other groups runway overruns since have resulted in many more accidents and claimed more lives than runway incursions over the same period boeings latest safety data for instance show runway overruns as the fourth largest cause of airliner fatalities world wide between and resulting in more than fatalities runway incursions by contrast are ranked no claiming fatalities in the world wide commercial jet fleet over that decade the faa isnt required to follow the recommendations but issues on the safety boards "most wanted" list tend to have a high profile with the public and the agency the anticipated changes by the ntsb also follow calls by independent safety experts including william voss president of the flight safety foundation an alexandria va aviation safety group to broaden the emphasis on runway safety measures "while there have been relatively few fatalities associated with runway incursions " mr voss told a house transportation subcommittee in june "it is impossible to ignore the number of incidents that have been reported " but he said "runway incursions are a subset of the larger problem of runway safety "
