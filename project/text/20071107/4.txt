air traffic heist the clock is ticking on the tax year and ticking along with it is the political bomb known as the alternative minimum tax that will explode on million middle income taxpayers if congress fails to pass relief soon trouble is democrats need &# billion to do it thanks to the "pay as you go" budget rules they imposed on themselves earlier this year "paygo " as it is known requires that any tax cut be offset by other tax increases or entitlement spending cuts take a few seconds to guess how democrats are now moving to escape this self imposed straitjacket if you answered "fiscal trickery " perhaps you once worked on capitol hill and this example is a doozy were told that senior democrats are preparing a raid on the federal aviation administration faa trust fund to offset the amt assault on the middle class airline excise taxes on tickets and fuel among other things raise about &# billion a year multiply that by the five years in the paygo budget window and you happen to hit that &# billion amt target even better for democrats this would mean they dont have to take the political heat for raising taxes on anybody else to offset the amt they could thus avoid taxing new york senator chuck schumers private equity pals who are donating so much money this year so mr schumer can elect more senate democrats next year the big problem here is that the aviation excise tax is supposed to be dedicated to aviation this includes funding faa operations as well as modernizing the air traffic control system which certainly needs it conveniently the airline tax expires in mid november which means congress can use the taxs renewal under its budget rules to apply that &# billion to offset amt relief so amid growing airline flight delays and congestion congress may pilfer that airline money and use it instead to solve a political problem of its own making congress will have to come up with some other cash to fund the faa of course and the house is moving to do precisely that this week it plans to allow general tax revenue to be spent to operate the faa as of mid november since the airline tax wont yet have been reauthorized thats a very large hint that the faa ploy will in fact eventually be used as the amt offset the larger point here concerns truth in budgeting democrats campaigned on paygo last year as a tool of fiscal discipline but the airline ruse shows that it is really a driver of fiscal chicanery its main goal is to make it all but impossible to cut taxes thus dooming the bush tax cuts when they are set to expire after but in the short term before the election paygo is forcing democrats to resort to all kinds of budget contortions to disguise their real tax and spending intentions theyve already included one budget gimmick to evade paygo while they try to expand health care spending as part of the schip bill and this week they are working to shift payment dates by a few weeks in the farm bill so that &# billion of farm aid magically doesnt show up in the paygo budget window remarkably many journalists still treat paygo as if its a serious policy rather than a political con as for the democrats theyd be better off if they junked paygo this year and passed amt relief without raising taxes then they wouldnt have to punish anyone else to avoid raising taxes on their middle class blue state voters and they wouldnt have to resort to such fiscal dishonesty as this aviation heist
