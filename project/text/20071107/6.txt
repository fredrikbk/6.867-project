to be run he told cadbury schweppes plc it should separate its chocolate business from up and dr pepper he has pressed kraft foods inc to spin off units such as post cereals and maxwell house coffee as for h j heinz co he felt the company should sponsor a hot dog eating contest and why he asked couldnt heinz find a neater way to dispense single serve ketchup than those messy packets pressing demands that are both global and granular the activist investor has turned himself into one of the food sectors most influential players affecting how millions of people eat each day through his holding company triarc companies inc mr peltz has long owned arbys the no restaurant chain in the u s by sales in the past two years he has used a separate vehicle a hedge fund to amass shares in some of the industrys biggest companies and push for changes his trian fund management lp holds of wendys international inc the no restaurant chain in the u s it owns about of cadbury schweppes and of heinz those familiar with trian say the fund has also accumulated roughly of kraft foods inc the worlds no food company by revenues a position currently worth about &# billion analysts expect mr peltz to make his plan for kraft public any day now ahead of a nov deadline for kraft stockholders to submit proposals for the proxy statement mr peltz a college dropout in the s who got his start loading peaches and strawberries onto trucks for his familys food distribution company has exercised his influence boldly calling executives regularly to seek updates or float ideas "there are weeks i speak to him two or three times " says heinz ceo william johnson "including on weekends and late at night " executives ignore those calls at their peril unlike other activist investors who may write letters to ceos and then file copies with the securities and exchange commission mr peltz is known for sending long position statements straight to the sec these "white papers " as he calls them include plans for cutting costs retooling marketing and selling units so a company can focus on its strongest brands as a recent case at cadbury demonstrates some executives have come to dread such public battles in mr peltz gained notice for paying &# million to buy the snapple beverage business from quaker oats co with fresh marketing and new products he and colleagues revived snapple and sold it three years later to cadbury along with several additional brands for &# billion in early march mr peltz looped back to cadbury flying to london to meet with ceo todd stitzer whom he knew from the snapple deal over lunch at cadbury headquarters both sides confirm mr peltz told mr stitzer that his hedge fund now owned cadbury shares he asked the ceo to split the companys drinks and candy businesses in two mr stitzer asked mr peltz to lie low until he could discuss the plan with his board "he said no white paper please " mr peltz recalls a few days later cadbury announced it would pursue a breakup of the company last month it said it would spin off its drinks unit mr peltzs moves could cascade through the long underperforming food industry and put several companies in play analysts say with cadbury set to focus on candy it could become a powerful acquirer or generate a bidding war involving hershey co and wm wrigley jr co following mr peltzs activism heinz has gone on a sales tear and is building cash reserves it could use for acquisitions as mr peltz turns his attention to kraft he is said to be pushing the company to slim down and focus on its strongest brands that in turn could spark consolidation among global food companies mr peltz has drawn criticism at triarc the arbys holding company for his large pay package and for the stocks lackluster performance and more broadly he is exposed to risk because much of his money is in the &# trillion global packaged food sector traditionally slow growing the industry faces current challenges that include tight credit and pressure to make healthier products production expenses have gone up too as shipping costs have increased and grain prices have soared as crops are used for biofuel production the investor says he likes the industry in good times and bad "food companies tend to have brands that produce significant cash flow even when they are neglected or undermanaged or the economy is weak " mr peltz says he sees a future in which these companies increasingly specialize and he has pushed companies in his portfolio to focus on what they do best in daily affairs as in business the year old mr peltz makes his preferences known when he arrived for a recent lunch at patroon a wood paneled restaurant near his manhattan office a glass of orange iced tea waited at his place a packet of splenda already stirred in heinz ketchup stood on the table the restaurant says it puts a bottle there when he comes other customers get condiments in little dishes mr peltz who has been married three times has children ages to he says he works out five times a week and attends his kids hockey games the resident of bedford n y has gained local attention both for the nhl size hockey rink at his estate and for the helicopter that once ferried him to manhattan after neighbors complained the town prohibited him from landing the chopper in his yard back in mr peltz was a longhaired year old who had just dropped out of the undergraduate business program at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school he decided he would rather move to mount hood ore to teach skiing to save money for the move he planned to work for a few weeks for the brooklyn business his grandfather founded a peltz &amp sons which sold produce and frozen food to new york city hospitals restaurants and bakeries "i found out early on that business is just common sense " he says "its about getting sales up and expenses down " he never made it to oregon beginning in mr peltz helped his father acquire food distribution businesses in boston baltimore and philadelphia he visited the companies weekly helping managers to develop products and marketing plans in about a year after his father died mr peltz sold the business over the next two decades mr peltz and his partner peter may a former accountant who had also worked at the peltz family business gained a reputation as corporate raiders who strengthened companies before cashing out in the pair acquired a distressed conglomerate that included propane and textile businesses as well as royal crown cola and the arbys restaurant chain they shed everything but the cola and restaurants renaming the business triarc cos two years later they bought the mistic beverage brand and tapped beverage industry insider michael weinstein to run the brand mr weinstein recalls that on his first morning on the job mr peltz telephoned to ask how business was that afternoon mr peltz dialed him again to ask what was new since they last spoke "he called me all the time " says mr weinstein now chairman of inov beverage co and a heinz board member "it made you stay on top of your business " lately triarcs performance has been lackluster shares in the holding company which includes arbys as well as deerfield &amp co llc an asset management firm have fallen almost in the past months compared with growth for the broader restaurant and bars industry triarc has tried to turn itself into a pure play restaurant company by selling its stake in deerfield so far without success mr peltz has also come under scrutiny for his compensation at triarc in he was paid &# million which proxy governance inc an investment advisory firm called "out of line" with his peers compensation and company performance mr peltzs triarc compensation totaled about &# million in in july he stepped down as triarcs chairman and ceo to become nonexecutive chairman triarcs board is paying him &# million as part of the termination deal mr peltz declined to comment on his pay but says he believes the market is discounting triarc in part because of uncertainty over its plans to sell its deerfield stake "over the long term we have created a lot of value which we dont believe has been fully reflected in triarcs recent stock price " he says lately mr peltz has focused on reforming companies through trian the hedge fund he and the year old mr may launched in november it targets large but underperforming companies with good cash flow they say messrs peltz and may declined to disclose how much the fund has raised or its rate of return investors are required to commit &# million or more for at least three years from trians st floor park avenue offices its analysts lawyers and accountants maintain a watch list of about companies coffee mugs bear the inscriptions "sales up expenses down" on one side and "cash is king" on the other once trian invests in a company mr peltz and his allies say they try to work with executives to improve operations "we always tell management and board members were not here to embarrass you or take your job " says edward garden mr peltzs son in law and the third trian founder but it isnt always friendly in early december trian had built its first big position accumulating of wendys shares mr peltz began calling then ceo jack schuessler to discuss how to improve margins mr peltz says he believed the company was distracted by other businesses including its tim hortons doughnut chain mr peltz says he was told the executive was too busy to meet out came mr peltzs first white paper in pages filed directly to the sec he called the companys decision to sell only a small part of the tim hortons chain "an attempt to avoid shining the spotlight on the poor financial performance of wendys " he urged a full spinoff and pushed the company to sell its baja fresh and cafe express chains if wendys failed to adopt the measures the white paper said trian would seek to nominate one or more persons to its board of directors mr peltz got his meeting in february over two hours on a saturday he and messrs may and garden met wendys brass at the companys dublin ohio headquarters mr schuessler told them wendys couldnt spin off all of tim hortons without taking a big tax hit mr peltz recalls he says his team demonstrated how wendys could do a tax free spinoff and pushed them to do it by the end of mr schuessler no longer ceo declined to comment as did a wendys spokesman in early march as its annual meeting approached the fast food companys bankers called trian wendys offered to invite three peltz allies onto the board as long as trian would vote its shares in favor of wendys other directors the company agreed to spin off tim hortons by the end of explore strategic alternatives for baja fresh and focus on improving wendys profit margins mr peltz agreed trian now owns of wendys it also has the rights to vote another stake held by another hedge fund firm sandell asset management corp of new york giving trian a vote on nearly of wendys shares wendys has increased its same store sales but mr peltz sees room for improvement in april he told the companys chairman that he would take significant action if he didnt see better results from wendys the companys board decided to move first offering the company for sale mr peltz said triarc the arbys holding company would be willing to offer as much as &# per share well above the low to mid &# s where the stock had been trading more than a dozen parties have expressed interest in participating in the sale for the chain but tight credit markets have slowed the process also in mr peltz began an acrimonious battle to remake heinz trian accumulated about of heinzs shares and in march mr peltz invited heinzs ceo mr johnson to dinner in west palm beach fla over steaks at mortons mr peltz says he told the ceo that he wanted seats on the board mr peltz also believed that heinz was paying supermarkets too much to promote its products and provide good shelf placement he said heinz should seek visibility in other ways like sponsoring the hot dog eating contest held each independence day at new yorks coney island the activist shareholder also took issue with the billion single serve ketchup packets heinz sold each year to fast food chains schools and sports venues calling them messy his suggestion sell ketchup in dip cups like those used for barbeque sauce later that month mr johnson and other heinz officials presented to trian their own plans to boost marketing and cut expenses they were similar to those floated by mr peltz but less aggressive heinz rebuffed trians plea for board seats in may mr peltz filed an page white paper heinz stock shot up nearly on the news for the next few months as mr peltz waged a proxy fight for five heinz board seats he and the company exchanged barbs via sec filings heinz called him "self interested and divisive " suggesting he wanted to profit and run mr peltz countered that during mr johnsons tenure heinz investors "would have been better off financially keeping their &# in a piggybank " by august heinz had started cutting costs and adjusting its marketing saying the moves were in the works before mr peltz came along but a senior heinz employee who asked not to be named credits mr peltz as a catalyst "it gave bill johnson a kick in the pants to do it not just talk about it " this person said messrs peltz and johnson say theyve made amends sales and profits at heinz are up this past julys hot dog eating contest in coney island was festooned with inflatable heinz ketchup bottles as for messy ketchup packaging heinz says that apparently unbeknownst to mr peltz it had already been selling tens of millions of dip cups annually "he said why dont we have dip cups " the senior heinz employee recalls "we do have dip cups " the company is currently developing larger dip cups it says trian currently owns of heinz shares now mr peltzs fund is building a stake in its biggest target yet this summer it is believed to have accumulated about of kraft the worlds second largest packaged food company with &# billion in sales people familiar with the matter say trian wants the northfield ill food giant to focus on core products including digiorno pizza and macaroni and cheese while freeing up cash to expand overseas in february kraft ceo irene rosenfeld surprised investors with a strategic plan that didnt include divestitures but lately kraft appears to have moved in a peltz friendly direction in august just weeks after she met with mr peltz ms rosenfeld told investors kraft would part with brands that dont contribute to its growth last month kraft announced it would sell its veryfine and fruito drinks brands people familiar with the matter say kraft is close to signing a deal to sell post cereals to st louis food manufacturer ralcorp holdings inc ms rosenfeld declined to comment mr peltz says he doesnt look to get credit from companies for his ideas "one of the sayings we have around here is that wed rather be rich than right " he says "well give credit to anyone who makes us money " janet adamy contributed to this article
