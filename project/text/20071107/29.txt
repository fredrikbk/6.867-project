cinderella in a fairy tale s cendrillon new york city oprea through nov www nycopera com macbeth metropolitan opera through jan then may and www metopera org new york updating can work nicely in opera provided that pieces of the concept look organic rather than imposed throughout the work new york city operas new production of massenets "cendrillon" an enchanting version of the cinderella story that deserves to be heard more frequently was pretty wild but it met the test director and choreographer renaud doucet set and costume designer andre barbet and lighting designer guy simard paid homage to the opera comique roots of "cendrillon" by setting the show in a witty fairy tale version of the s the scenes featured a kitchen with enormous pink appliances cendrillon wearing rubber gloves made her first appearance inside the vast oven which she was cleaning a drive in showing a film of the marriage of prince rainier and grace kelly a suburban bungalow with pink flamingos and a fancy supper club "le palace" in which the five beauty contestant princesses vying for the princes attention hilariously displayed their "talents" in acrobatics juggling and child care miss america style fortunately the production team knew when to back off and let tenderness and melody take center stage when soprano cassandre berthon cendrillon and tenor frederic antoun prince charmant a role actually written for soprano but never mind came together at the act ii ball and later in the woods the drive in the antics stopped and we heard only the warmth and melting loveliness of their voices the only miscalculation was the showing of another wedding film during la fees the fairy godmothers act iii aria it upstaged katherine jollys mysterious sparkling coloratura other standouts in the excellent cast included joyce castle as the vain and egomaniacal wicked stepmother lielle berman and rebecca ringle as her hapless giggly daughters and eugene brancoveanu as cendrillons henpecked father pandolfe conductor george manahan deftly captured the scores french spirit adrian noble who directed the metropolitan operas new production of verdis "macbeth" revised also did some updating to a "non specific post world war ii scotland " the period was suggested with a few prop and costume details power lines in the background a jeep for macduff and most dramatically a cackling coven of witches dressed like tough cockney housewives in shapeless coats white ankle socks squashed hats and enormous purses that when opened threw eerie light onto their faces mark thompson designed the sets and costumes jean kalman the lighting by using a dark palette a lot of empty space and moveable black columns to suggest different locales the team evoked a bleak atmosphere of lawless uncertainty more like a future dystopia than any recognizable place or time this subtle atmospheric unease might have worked better with the shakespeare version which mr noble a year veteran of the royal shakespeare company has directed twice however the opera is full of grand gestures and the musical and the theatrical performances were one dimensional and oversize making for cartoon evil the opera needs a seething complex lady macbeth instead we got maria guleghina a soprano whose principal gift is steely volume which she deployed without mercy or rhythmic security lady macbeths bloody minded lust for power clearly has a sexual component which ms guleghina expressed by writhing around on a bed and on the floor in low cut costumes that left little to the imagination she didnt even get dressed until the banquet scene in act iii in one amusing moment she and macbeth up to their elbows in "blood" after the murder of duncan seemed to be moving carefully to keep the red paint from dripping onto their white outfits at the banquet as she performed a drinking song to divert the guests from macbeths hallucination of the murdered banquo she resembled a demented girl scout leader zeljco lucics lyric baritone made macbeth seem softer than he should be but at least he wasnt deafening john relyea was an oddly dull banquo macduff gets a single lovely aria the lament for his murdered family and tenor dimitri pittas delivered it eloquently russell thomas was also effective in the small role of malcolm duncans son the chorus was solid whether celebrating a black mass or mourning its despoiled country as refugees in act iv to make the point about the macbeths childlessness mr noble used a lot of children there were a number of small witches one of the refugees cradled a dead child macduff carried photos of his "pretty ones " and the opera ended with fleance banquos son and sire of the line of future kings front and center it was a nice repeated detail but one forgot about details when the orchestra chorus and soloists egged on by james levine blasted the music as if they were hoping to be heard in scotland top notch musical performances rather than production values were the point in the semistaged "il santalessio" presented by les arts florissants led by william christie at the rose theater this beautiful little known opera by stefano landi with a libretto by giulio rospigliosi later pope clement ix brought monteverdis new genre to rome with a deeply christian subject the story of st alexis a roman patrician who gave up his wealth to become a hermit and died unrecognized as a beggar in his fathers house alessio is tempted to reveal himself to his grieving family his struggles and theirs make for a work that is rich in plaintive laments powerful ensembles and even comic relief mr christie fielded a superlative period instrument ensemble and male chorus including the excellent boys choir la maitrise de caen and a stunning array of solo singers to reflect the all male casting of landis time the castrato roles were taken by countertenors offering a remarkable glimpse of the range in this type of voice today there were nine countertenors in the cast though one of them ryland angel sang in the tenor range as alessios friend adrasto in the title role philippe jaroussky displayed an uncanny purity of sound like a boy soprano with power xavier sabata as his mother had a smoky darker vocal color max emanuel cencic as his abandoned wife had a warmer vibrating quality and a mesmerizing presence reminiscent of kabuki performers who play women jose lemos and damien guillon were delightfully lively as a pair of comic servants who mock everyone but finally repent and pascal bertin was wonderful in the evangelist style narrative of alessios death for contrast there were basses alain buet as eufemiano the grieving father and luigi de donato the demonic tempter with amazing low notes to balance alessios saintly
