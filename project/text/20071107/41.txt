drug approvals hit hurdles in a sign of continuing trouble for the pharmaceutical industry is shaping up to be a slow year for new drug launches some industry players say u s regulators are holding back on new drug approvals due to a greater emphasis on safety concerns mainly since merck &amp co withdrew its vioxx pain drug after it was linked to increased risk of heart attacks in but the food and drug administration says there have been no systematic changes in how it evaluates new drug applications and some experts say the industry itself simply has failed to come up with enough innovative new products despite billions of dollars spent on research no matter the cause some drug makers are taking steps to increase the chances experimental therapies will get the fda green light they are shifting the focus of research efforts to diseases that are difficult to treat such as cancer and alzheimers and running longer trials to more fully vet potential side effects of drugs "its harder and harder to bring a new product to the market " said kenneth kaitin director of the tufts center for the study of drug development in boston not only has the drug industrys r&amp d productivity decreased but the fda also "has adopted a more risk averse cautious approach to drug approvals " he said the numbers seem to bear this out from the beginning of this year through oct the fda had approved drugs classified as "new molecular entities " which means the active ingredient hadnt been used before in an fda approved therapy if that pace continues the full year tally would be about new drugs approved the figures dont include vaccines or existing drugs approved for new uses the fda still has nearly two months to act on pending drug applications before the final tally for is known but it might be tough to match the new drugs approved last year or the approved in the number of annual new drug approvals has varied widely this decade ranging from in to in among the new drugs approved this year are two new hiv treatments mercks isentress and pfizer inc s selzentry and three new cancer drugs wyeths torisel glaxosmithkline plcs tykerb and novartis ags tasigna but some companies have hit fda roadblocks for drugs once viewed as potential blockbusters including novartiss diabetes drug galvus and sanofi aventiss diet drug rimonabant due to safety concerns smaller drug developers also have been caught off guard by what they perceive to be a shifting fda stance which can strain their already limited resources if they are asked to perform more clinical trials industry insiders say the fda is under heavy political pressure from members of congress and watchdogs to be more vigilant about drug safety "it just indicates to you that when bureaucrats come under pressure they tend to choose the path of asking for more data as opposed to approving the drug " schering plough corp chief executive fred hassan said in an interview the pressure on the fda picked up after vioxxs withdrawal in but it has intensified over the past year amid more drug safety issues such as those surrounding anti anemia drugs marketed by amgen inc and johnson &amp johnson as well as glaxos avandia diabetes drug also the fda has had its eye on the congressional debate over new drug safety legislation which was recently enacted if an experimental drug treats a condition for which there are already good treatment options the fda seems to have raised the bar some believe for example wyeth has applied for approval of a drug called pristiq as a treatment for both depression and menopausal symptoms conditions with existing options including those sold by wyeth itself but the agency delayed approval for both uses of pristiq and in the case of the menopausal symptom application the fda has asked for more data on the potential for cardiovascular and liver related side effects some analysts have called pristiq a "me too" drug with little significant benefit over existing therapies "in categories where there are choices the agency is making more demands for approval " joseph mahady a wyeth senior vice president said in an interview "its across the board everybodys got to adjust to that " but the fda says its standards havent changed substantially "there have been no systematic changes in how fda is approaching the approval standards for new drug applications " said spokeswoman sandy walsh "each application is reviewed on its own merit and judgments are made by the signatory authority as to whether the application meets the statutory standards " the fda also disputes that one can point to a pattern of decelerating or accelerating approvals since the early s some experts concur and shift the blame to the industry itself "i dont see a greater focus on risk" at the fda said sheila weiss smith a professor at the university of maryland school of medicine who has served on fda advisory committees and has received grant support from the drug industry she noted that the agency approved pfizers selzentry which is intended for hiv patients who have failed existing therapies despite concerns about potentially serious side effects jerry avorn a professor at harvard medical school who studies drug evaluation says the fda has speeded up its approval process in recent years and is eager to approve deserving drugs he is critical of the drug makers "this continuing poor track record of innovation even in the face of huge revenue inflows seems to indicate that many of them are far better at creative marketing than they are at creating useful new drugs " mr avorn said ironically the company responsible for vioxx has had a relatively good fda approval record over the past two years in addition to isentress merck has received fda approval for its januvia diabetes drug and three new vaccines merck chief executive richard clark said the newly approved products have addressed unmet medical needs and merck has submitted "thorough regulatory packages" to the fda some companies have restructured their r&amp d efforts including glaxo and wyeth but industry watchers say more change is needed and it could be years before its known whether the changes were the right ones "what were going to see is potentially longer clinical trials to get more data in terms of safety " said edward jones analyst linda bannister she predicts companies will invest more in areas with unmet medical needs rather than adding more "me too" drugs to lessen the financial impact of these changes companies increasingly will outsource the management of clinical trials and conduct them in less expensive places like china and india said deutsche bank analyst barbara ryan
