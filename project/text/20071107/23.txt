business bookshelf the fresh roasted smell of success starbucked by taylor clark little brown &amp co pages &# starbucks the onion once reported "continued its rapid expansion tuesday opening its newest location in the mens room of an existing starbucks " in real life it hasnt come to that yet but starbucks has seemingly caffeinated the u s and the world there are now stores spread across north america more than in manhattan alone and an additional in more than countries stretching from bahrain to brazil starbucks stores have become a retail icon a daily habit and a late night punchline "the only way the oil companies could make more money " jay leno quipped a couple of years ago "would be if they were drilling for oil and struck starbucks coffee " in "starbucked " taylor clark sets out to explain such scorching success he offers along the way an entertaining instructive and refreshingly even handed account of the companys life so far the first starbucks was the brainchild of a seattle based writer gordon bowker who in was making monthly treks to vancouver miles round trip to buy quality beans for his own coffee drinking pleasure he eventually persuaded two friends jerry baldwin and zev siegl to join him in opening a gourmet coffee shop which started doing business in seattle in march three more stores opened over the next decade they in turn caught the attention of howard schultz who at the time was a kitchenware salesman he fell in love with the shops and their coffee and persuaded mr baldwin to let him join the small business messrs bowker and siegl had moved on mr schultz had visions of an ambitious expansion from the very beginning when he eventually assumed the top job in the multiplying began new stores in in in and in the growth only accelerated and hasnt stopped since under mr schultzs guidance starbucks never lost sight of its core product coffee as obvious as such a focus may seem it proved revolutionary if only by contrast with the companys competitors the big mid century brands like folgers and maxwell house had long since fallen into lackluster bean buying habits mostly to keep costs down meanwhile annual coffee consumption in the u s primarily a kitchen table ritual declined starbucks stepped into the breach in particular mr schultz recruited mary williams a veteran coffee buyer to purchase beans directly from leading growers in guatemala and elsewhere and he initially positioned the starbucks "brand" in retail stores rather than on grocery shelves mr schultz had fallen in love with italian coffee bars and thought rightly as it turned out that a version of them could be a success in america it helped of course that starbucks was serving quality coffee and not the swill that poured from the overheated urns in so called coffee shops and diners a major part of the starbucks story has to do with real estate since the company obviously favors a kind of neighborhood saturation "through a combination of cunning store placement strategy and ruthlessness with competitors " mr clark writes "the company attempted to make it so customers couldnt help but go to starbucks " one starbucks real estate dealmaker who was turned down for an attractive commercial space discovered that the refusing landlord was a doctor she made an appointment to see him pretending to be a patient and repeated her pitch at his office he caved in and starbucks got the space as for what space is best starbucks prefers to be near dry cleaners and video stores because they require two visits for dropping off and picking up the company has been no less relentless about its image the high prices signal not just quality but luxury and the specialized vocabulary "venti " "doppio" and the like elevates a mundane form of consumption into the realm of cosmopolitan taste in the same vein mr schultz strives to make each starbucks a "third place" between work and home "were not in the coffee business serving people " he likes to say "were in the people business serving coffee " it helps that the people doing the serving are well treated staff turnover is lower at starbucks than at similar establishments not least because the company provides full health benefits for even part time workers in fact it spends more on health care than on coffee one wonders what might happen to such generous benefits if starbucks profits ever fall below the high levels they have achieved for so long for now though things are brewing along nicely starbucks is times bigger than its closest competitor caribou coffee the stores have been a smashing success in unlikely places such as tea drinking nations britain japan and others with their own distinctive cafe cultures france the companys stock price has also skyrocketed since debuting in the story of the stocks movements incidentally is dissected in exquisite detail by karen blumenthal a former wall street journal reporter in her recent "grande expectations a year in the life of starbucks stock" crown business perhaps the best evidence of starbucks hallowed place in the american landscape is the effort that starbucks free communities make to attract a store alhambra calif according to mr clark devoted &# in public development funds to the purpose when a starbucks opened in muskegon mich the president of the local chamber of commerce declared it nothing less than "a symbol that we are a community of the future " naturally there has been a backlash with critics seeing starbucks as a kind of liquid wal mart mr clark expresses some unease about the proliferation of starbucks stores but his research leads him to dismiss familiar complaints independent coffeehouses he says far from being killed off by starbucks are thriving their numbers grew from to and the coffee retail experts ive spoken to advise independents not to open a store until there is a starbucks in town since starbucks is likely to create a clientele for coffee that otherwise wouldnt exist can starbucks continue its meteoric growth without sacrificing its quality or compromising its image in an internal memo that later became public mr schultz conceded earlier this year that there had been a "watering down of the starbucks experience and what some might call the commoditization of our brand " still starbucks share of the u s coffee market is only about and it has announced plans to open new stores world wide over the next four years maybe the onion wasnt so far from the truth mr rees is a senior director at the white house writers group a washington consulting firm see related letter "letters to the editor john wayne wouldnt have ordered a latte" wsj nov
