business world im lovin gm ten years ago we quoted a famed short seller from the s who in a casual meeting at a dinner shared the insight that made him rich "people always underestimate how bad things can get " our subject at the time was mcdonalds since then the worlds biggest restaurant chain has committed one of the great turnaround stories of the business world with most of the gains coming in a u s market saturated with competitors everyone from subway to starbucks well save the burger by burger account for another day if mcdonalds can do it so can the detroit based auto industry when large established businesses go bad look at internal incentives mcdonalds operated for decades under a royalty system that rewarded the company for opening more and more stores this approach worked for years until the new stores began cannibalizing the old ones and antagonized the existing franchisees who tried to keep their heads above water by cutting back on service cleanliness and quality eventually the stock market had its way and a new leadership took up the chant "better not bigger " mcdonalds realized an additional dollar of sales from an existing store could be more profitable than a dollar from a new store it rediscovered its customers they were getting up earlier for breakfast so mcd started opening earlier they were big fans of mcd coffee now coffee became a major marketing point the chain concentrated on making mcdonalds again an appealing place to come and spend money on food yet the bad news continued for a while the company reported its first ever quarterly loss in it took major pr hits from the book "fast food nation" and the movie "super size me " but the public was already being won back the news out of the big three has not been pretty in the past week chrysler announced another layoffs and five factory closings especially sad was its dumping of three models the dodge magnum and chrysler crossfire and pacifica that had shown exceptional promise but came up short because of insufficient investment a failure that occurred under daimlerchrysler which ought to dispel any notion that daimler was underpaid for giving up control to the new majority owner cerberus capital look past the headlines however and the big three have just engineered a sweeping overhaul of internal incentives out goes the uaws ability to dictate headcount wages and benefits out therefore goes the financial imperative that for decades kept the big three churning out unprofitable cars to cover a "fixed" labor bill lets admit the truth detroit designed many of its cars to be sold at a loss the change is already visible gm is now free to protect the desirability and profitability of its hot selling new buick enclave by not overproducing them chrysler is free to protect the image of its future designs by pulling the plug on poorly performing existing models rather than keeping its factories humming and dumping the output on rental fleets and unhappy dealers not all mcdonalds franchisees were up to spiffing up their stores likewise the big three have design engineering and marketing departments that are used to pushing out low cost fodder for volume sales theyll need a new mindset to go with the new economics aiming for designs that stand a real chance of becoming winners in their categories theres another similarity mcdonalds bears a special curse as the most visible of the fast feeders hence its moves to festoon its menu with salads and "healthier" foods even though these account for less than of sales an unusually candid analyst david kolpak of victory capital once explained that mcdonalds invests heavily to put such items on the menu "because theyre an effective shield from a pr standpoint and maybe down the road from a legal liability standpoint i dont think ceo jim skinner is all that concerned with how these products actually sell " yet the healthier fare also helps bring the moms back and encourages better feelings about the chain even among customers who order the same old delicious big mac and fries auto makers face their own curse theyre congresss main target for empty gestures on global warming hence the billions the auto makers are spending to develop hybrids diesels and electric vehicles in hopes of preserving their regulatory freedom to sell the large powerful pickups suvs and crossovers that americans actually want they also hope a green halo will help solve a tough marketing problem they face a sizeable contingent of u s car buyers simply wont consider a u s branded car believing them to be inferior and declasse cadillac which has a new bob dylan commercial out has led the way in trying to overturn the "import bigot" syndrome in a niche where the formidable competitors are mercedes lexus and bmw the results so far have been so so though the cars are excellent unlike volkswagen or bmw or toyota the u s big three have been singularly unsuccessful in creating a central branding image to let customers know what a gm or chrysler or ford vehicle is all about mcdonalds got back in touch with the idea that a trip to the golden arches was a treat with its "im lovin it" campaign it will take better marketing brains than ours to solve this problem for the big three but well offer one prediction look for gm to show the way as it has at every other stage of detroits epochal effort to right itself see related letter "letters to the editor design flaw gms biggest problem isnt labor costs" wsj nov
