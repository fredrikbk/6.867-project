for studios weeks of cushion strike may not inflict financial pain for awhile given the tight ad market as striking screenwriters continued attempts to close down film and tv production television networks and media companies are calculating they can contain the damage so long as the strike doesnt last much beyond january the television networks are seen as the most vulnerable to a strike initially because they rely heavily on members of the writers guild of america for scripted programming but a tight advertising market is expected to provide some cushion with advertisers seemingly reluctant to make any rash moves at a time when advertising prices are so high if the strike runs for several months the picture could change dramatically "it could be a downward spiral for the networks if it drags on into the first quarter " says steve kalb director of broadcast media at mediahub a unit of interpublic groups mullen members of the writers guild of america went on strike monday after failing to agree to a new contract with film and television producers over the weekend the two sides are still simmering in the wake of the negotiations collapse late sunday and no new talks are scheduled picketers continued efforts to interrupt production of shows with some success most tv situation comedies which require last minute script revisions had been shut down but many tv dramas and feature films continued as scheduled " a new paramount pictures "star trek" movie in fact began shooting monday yesterday morning a group of writers marched from the warner bros lot in burbank calif to a nearby house where abcs "desperate housewives" was shooting on location by a m local time nearly writers and supporters including actress julia louis dreyfus had surrounded the site they referenced the shows stars in chanting "we write the story a for eva longoria " and "we write the laughter for teri hatcher " later ms longoria addressed the strikers on the picket line producers still managed to shoot almost all planned scenes in part by stretching a green screen outside the house to obscure strikers on the street according to charissa gilmore an abc studios spokeswoman fears swept through the television industry this week that networks and studios may use the distraction of the strike as an opportunity to cut jobs cbs corp s cbs paramount network television on monday sent out suspension letters to some people who have "term deals" or "overall deals" that provide them with money for salaries office space and other overhead costs according to two sources other studios were preparing and sending out those letters yesterday media companies have so far played down the potential impact of the strike on their bottom line in a research report fitch ratings said the major media conglomerates are protected by being so diversified adding that "cbs has the most exposure of all of the major conglomerates to the strike but not enough to cause a concern from a credit perspective " in a filing this week cbs said it didnt expect "a significant effect" on its earnings for the remainder of although it warned a strike could ultimately "have an adverse effect" on its results depending on the duration viacom inc which owns a movie studio and a suite of cable channels including mtv said it expected "very little to no impact " eyes will be on time warner inc today for any strike update in its earnings announcement walt disney co which owns the abc tv network is slated to report earnings tomorrow media buyers and some marketers say they arent pulling business yet because the fallout from the strike has so far been limited to late night talk shows such as cbss "late show with david letterman " general electric co s "the tonight show with jay leno" on nbc universal and viacoms "the daily show with jon stewart" and "the colbert report " both on comedy central moreover it is too early for ratings to have been hurt "people wont move until they see a definite impact " says jason maltby president and co executive director of national broadcast at mindshare a media buying unit of wpp group lisa cochrane vice president of integrated marketing communications at insurance giant allstate corp adds "we have ratings guarantees so we know we will reach who we need to reach " like most major marketers allstate buys a large portion of its advertising time at "upfront " the annual selling event in may when networks sell about of their ad inventory for the new fall season as part of those deals advertisers are given guarantees on reaching a certain number of eyeballs for a show if the show doesnt reach that number the networks are forced to give the advertisers additional commercials to cover the shortfall a practice known as "make goods " marketers are leery about pulling dollars out of an already hot tv marketplace the inventory of the tv networks is currently tight due in part to the new way advertising time was bought this season deals have for the large part been based on commercial ratings rather than on program ratings which had been the standard for decades that change caused marketers to overspend in the upfront because they feared the new ratings system could cause problems later on in the season and buying in the upfront gave them ratings guarantees the tight marketplace has had the ripple effect of pushing prices higher prices in the "scatter" market ad time bought closer to air date are up in some cases to over upfront pricing according to media buyers if the strike drags on for months it will have huge ramifications say media buyers "at that point we may see money shifting to cable or to the internet " added mr maltby the tv networks sold more inventory than they typically do during this years upfront and they could likely run out of ad time to give marketers make goods if ratings significantly sink according to buyers if scatter inventory dries up that money will likely move online adds mr kalb another big fear haunting madison avenue is the strikes aftermath many are worried that when programs return from a big hiatus there is a risk of losing audiences long term "we saw in some cases such as lost the big hiatus caused viewers to lose interest " says mr kalb "a big question could be will audiences return " sam schechner hannah karp and rebecca dana contributed to this
