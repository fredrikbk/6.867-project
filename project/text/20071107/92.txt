party at ralphs were old enough to remember when naderite groups like public citizen were embarrassed by their ties to trial lawyers no more this week in washington the famous "consumer" group which has long resisted efforts to identify the sources of its funding is rolling out the red carpet for americas plaintiff attorneys attendees of the consumer rights litigation conference are cordially invited to saturday nights cocktail reception at public citizen headquarters which a conference brochure describes as "an elegant old dupont circle victorian mansion generously loaned to us for this special event " no word yet on what the famously ascetic ralph nader thinks about standing up for the little guy by sipping cabernet at a dupont circle manse but whats clear is that the trial lawyers will have plenty to celebrate thats because theyll be visiting congressional offices tomorrow and friday to check on the progress of pro lawsuit legislation and they will not be disappointed bills gathering momentum in both houses are anything but subtle in their support for more class action lawsuits tillinghast towers perrin estimates that litigation costs the u s more than &# billion a year and that figure is heading due north the democratic strategy is to attach an anti arbitration provision to nearly every new law in order to limit non lawsuit dispute settlement thus a house lending bill this week bans pre dispute arbitration agreements related to mortgages another house bill bans them in cases involving whistleblowers and the senate farm bill bans them even in meatpacking contracts the mother of them all is a bill that lunges to fulfill the trial bars long cherished dream prohibiting all americans from voluntarily agreeing at the start of any business relationship to settle disputes without litigation arbitration which avoids the cost and time of going to court has proven to be a popular form of alternative dispute resolution even lawyers concede its virtues in an american bar association survey found that of lawyers "believe that arbitration is generally timelier than litigation and feel it is more cost effective " the lawyers may concede the principle but they still want the money and speaking of money the trial bar has plenty to share with friendly lawmakers representative hank johnson d ga who coincidentally collected more money from lawyers than from any other industry group in the election cycle has introduced the arbitration fairness act the bill would outlaw pre dispute arbitration agreements in the future for all private contracts involving consumers employment and franchising and it would retroactively rewrite hundreds of millions of existing private contracts all voluntarily accepted by consenting adults you could then count the minutes until class actions are detonated against wall street brokerages with their million customer agreements featuring pre dispute arbitration clauses or against americas cell phone carriers with more than million customers who have agreed to forgo litigation party at ralphs indeed the idea that americans could do business and even settle arguments without litigation is evidently beyond the pale to mr johnson the congressman also displays a peculiar understanding of american markets when he notes in the findings section of his bill that when companies offer contracts to potential customers "people increasingly have no choice but to accept them " what you will not see in the findings of this bill where politicians typically describe the problem they intend to solve is any evidence that arbitration harms consumers or anyone else his remarkably fact free narrative does claim that arbitration is often heavily stacked in favor of companies but a study in law and contemporary problems a publication of duke law school found exactly the opposite under existing law judges can throw out arbitration agreements tilted too far in favor of one party so most arbitration clauses tend to give the consumer a reasonably fair shake university of kansas law professor stephen j ware says that even in cases where arbitration contract terms are more favorable to sellers the result is generally lower prices for consumers because the cost of lawyering has been stripped out "recognition of this has been standard in the law and economics literature for at least a quarter of a century " he notes balanced against this academic research comes a "study" from you guessed it public citizen claiming that its sleuths have found an arbitration firm operating in california that has been unfair to consumers in a particular type of debt dispute the lawyers will be drinking to that discovery all week in washington we trust the white house is paying attention and will put a damper on the revels by promising to veto this litigation bonanza if it should ever hit the presidents desk see related letters "letters to the editor arbitrary arbitration or choice to
