sign up for the e mail here the international energy agencys latest long term forecast out this morning paints an alarming if familiar picture of soaring petroleum demand describing the now usual suspects of china and india as the worlds emerging economic and energy market giants and it comes as oil prices continue to break their nominal records "the staggering pace of chinese and indian economic growth in the past few years outstripping that of all other major countries has pushed up sharply their energy needs a growing share of which has to be imported " notes the iea the paris based energy think tank for the worlds biggest economies "the momentum of economic development looks set to keep their energy demand growing strongly " it says adding that the consequences for the two countries their richer counterparts and the rest of the world could be dire if global governments stick to their current energy policies "the worlds energy needs would be well over higher in than today " the iea says oil futures already up more than in the past year topped &# a barrel for the first time today as bloomberg reports in overnight trading on the new york mercantile exchange crude oil for december delivery was fetching &# a barrel slightly below the &# mark it reached earlier today which itself represented a jump from yesterday the immediate cause was a decision by bp and conocophillips to evacuate their oilrigs in the north sea in anticipation of a storm expected to bring waves as high as feet bloomberg notes but its the supply demand equation for which china has figured so prominently in recent years that has made the market so vulnerable to weather and geopolitical tension as well as the speculators some observers are also blaming for the most recent surge thus far oil prices that would have seemed stratospheric a couple years ago havent hit consumers businesses and economic growth as hard as they have in the past but that could be changing chinese truck drivers in some of the countrys strongest economic regions have been limited by diesel rationing while u s airlines have reportedly begun to pass on higher fuel costs to passengers gasoline prices in the u s already significantly higher than last month are now expected to follow the sharp rise in oil as the wall street journal reports and americans winter heating bills are expected to be even worse than initially feared usa today adds the geopolitical costs are also now well known iran and venezuela for example can continue to enjoy more protection from outside pressure and specifically from the u s with higher oil revenue filling their coffers as can russia where the lower house of parliament today voted unanimously to suspend the countrys participation in the conventional forces in europe treaty approving what the associated press notes is the latest initiative from president vladimir putin to offer a "show of defiance to the west " the iea points out that along with its market predictions the higher demand for oil will lead to increased reliance by consuming countries like the u s and european allies "on imports of oil and gas much of them from the middle east and russia " and it also warns the trend will lead to continued growth in emissions of carbon dioxide leading to higher "greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere" that in turn contribute higher global temperatures and to changes in climate " the euros now buying &# china today was also the latest source of woe for the dollar which fell to yet another new low of &# per euro after chinese officials signaled the u s currencys weakness would lead them to diversify their &# trillion in foreign exchange reserves "we will favor stronger currencies over weaker ones and will readjust accordingly " cheng siwei vice chairman of chinas national peoples congress told a conference in beijing as bloomberg reports it wasnt clear whether mr chengs statement was authoritative but xu jian a central bank vice director added at the same conference that the dollar is "losing its status as the world currency " a &# billion noncash charge for gm higher oil prices are just one more affliction for general motors which as the detroit new reports "will take a &# billion charge to its third quarter results to offset the value of deferred tax assets in anticipation of a challenging environment in the near future " that noncash charge could translate into a record quarterly loss for the u s auto maker records are breaking all over these days gm which reports its quarterly results this morning and suffered big losses in and "said the write down was triggered by three main issues a string of adjusted losses in core north american operations and germany over the past three years weakness at its gmac financial services unit and the long duration of tax deferred assets " as the wall street journal reports giuliani wants to talk but not about everything rudy giuliani said yesterday that if elected president he would probably hold more news conferences than any american leader in decades "i know that some have gotten away with not doing question and answers i remember telling tony blair that the question and answer session the prime minister has every week is very good discipline to answer at least questions on five or six major things i said it reminded me that as mayor of new york i would do one of these press conferences a day " mr giuliani said during a speech in new hampshire as ad age reports but the ex mayor for now is staying mum on a potentially controversial topic tied to the fact that hes one of the few white house aspirants to maintain a high ranking role in a private sector firm even as he campaigns candidate giuliani has repeatedly rebuffed "all calls to disclose details about the clients and dealings of giuliani partners the consulting firm he founded in " the wall street journal notes and while some clients like the government of qatar and drug firm purdue pharma are known many arent "because the firm is closely held mr giuliani isnt required to disclose much about his income and wealth other than his holdings in the firm itself where he remains chairman and chief executive and receives income in the form of guaranteed payments and partnership distributions " the journal explains his spokeswoman has said the campaign wont comment on matters related to mr giulianis business and a spokeswoman for giuliani partners tells the journal "we do not discuss our clients " so far it hasnt seemed to hurt his standing with voters the latest usa today gallup poll finds that eight weeks ahead of the iowa caucuses mr giuliani enjoys a double digit lead nationally among republicans and is holding on to significant support from social conservatives despite his support for abortion rights and gay rights also of note international herald tribune frontier posts are to be dismantled across eastern europe and passport checks
