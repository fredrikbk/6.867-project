superbugs are dangerous but we are not powerless against them regarding the recent article "attack of the superbugs" scott gottlieb op ed oct it is correct to point out that the food and drug administration is largely to blame for the lack of new antibiotics against superbugs such as methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa but dr gottlieb incorrectly diminishes the effectiveness of preventive measures numerous studies show that screening and cleaning can reduce mrsa infections in hospitals by as much as even in the absence of new drugs screening means identifying incoming patients carrying the germ and then taking precautions to prevent it from spreading to other patients recent studies at rush medical college in chicago and boston university in massachusetts show that training cleaners not to overlook surfaces and to allow detergents to remain on surfaces for at least three minutes rather than just giving a quick spray and wipe can curb the spread of germs from patient to patient can hospitals afford screening and cleaning they cannot afford not to do it the evidence is compelling that these steps actually make hospitals more profitable and require almost no capital outlay while waiting for the miracle cures hospitals should implement mrsa screening and thorough cleaning this two step strategy will save patients lives immediately no matter how the bacteria morph betsy mccaughey ph d chairman committee to reduce infection deaths new york dr gottliebs op ed carries an important message for all americans i agree with everything in his article but he does not present the full extent of the problem nor does he address new and hopeful innovative diagnostic and therapeutic developments he discusses antibiotic resistance in well published "superbugs" such as mrsa but antibiotic resistance is also a growing threat in such common problems as urinary tract infection in nursing homes approximately such infections per long term care beds occur each year these organisms show increasing resistance to even potent antibiotics dr gottlieb also does not mention the dangers of biofilm and nosacomial hospital acquired infections biofilm is a slime like matrix produced by micro organisms as a defense mechanism against their environment biofilm is particularly dangerous to hospital patients whose first line defense against infection their skin has been breached by injury surgery particularly involving implants and various types of catheters this is the main cause of nosacomial infection which involves two million patients and deaths per year in the u s antibiotics are ineffective in preventing and treating biofilm infections the good news is that help may be on the way a group that includes ucla the veterans administration of greater los angeles and genefluidics inc of santa monica calif and which is funded by the national institutes of health published a promising new technique in the journal of clinical microbiology last year the diagnostic technique can rapidly under minutes identify uropathogens in clinical urine by using an electrochemical dna biosensor the biosensor turns the genetic information of the bacteria into an electrical signal this is analogous to a telephone which turns voice into an electrical signal other new methods for rapidly testing antibiotic susceptibility are also currently being evaluated dr gottlieb outlines the limitations of current antibiotics and problems of bringing new antibiotics to the market antibiotics are substances produced or derived from one micro organism which destroys or inhibits the growth of other micro organisms new antibiotics will be developed however progress in antimicrobials will also be made a new group of hopeful antimicrobial compounds called aganocides developed by nova bay pharmaceuticals are based on small molecules generated by our own white cells that defend against invading pathogens in the body these compounds are produced "on demand" and are transient important safety features include long shelf life stability and very high therapeutic index kills pathogens at concentrations significantly lower than concentration where it begins to harm human cells aganocides also unlikely to be rejected by the immune system and are unlikely to provoke bacterial resistance they are also likely to kill bacteria in minutes kill most if not all species of bacteria and kill certain viruses yeast and fungi and aganocides may even kill resistant bacteria and destroy bacteria protected by biofilm current evidence indicates that a normal adult human has more bacteria in his body than his own dna in optimal condition bacteria are divided every to minutes producing billions of pathogens in a single day these two facts alone guarantee that bacteria will always present problems for medical science but new diagnostic and therapeutic developments will continue to allow us to be masters of our bodies bernard m churchill m d
