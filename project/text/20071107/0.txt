a cultural conversation with jean nouvel a french architect goes global like a character out of jules verne jean nouvel says that he creates a small world in each building that he designs "every time im making architecture its in a world that doesnt exist for me each time its an unfolding of interior spaces details locations new relations among the elements of the ensembles colors and materials that are not always the same each time i try to create something that works in depth " he said over the telephone from his paris office "i dont believe in architecture that repeats itself in an automatic way thats why each of my buildings is different in its details " these days mr nouvel like verne has gone global a future concert hall in paris skyscrapers in le havre france and doha qatar and a dreamy museum for the sheik of abu dhabi soon hell have three projects in a new world manhattan mercer a somber condo slab in soho the hudson view th with some windows all of different dimensions and a mixed use skyscraper fused to the museum of modern art through shared galleries the oft punned mr nouvel new in french has fans from jacques chirac to brad pitt who named his daughter shiloh nouvel jolie pitt red state hines interests of houston developers of mercer and the moma spire liked mr nouvel enough to hire him to build an office tower outside paris too twenty years ago a nouveau nouvel unveiled his institut du monde arabe in paris a sleek blend of sculptural economy and elegant arabesque decoration another parisian landmark is his cartier foundation a glass and steel transparency in a glass walled garden not bad for a renegade who once condemned le corbusier and all things modernist in new york his projects are less public yet ths facade promises a nouvel baroque flourish with a mosaic that deconstructs its view in reflections mr nouvels favorite buildings the sainte chapelle in paris and the cathedrals of chartres and rheims are known for their light "the idea was to work with the view in relation to the hudson and with the sunset " he said "i wanted to escape the traditional neutrality of the curtain wall which doesnt immediately express the fact that you are looking " on a clear day you can see nouveau jersey and rival frank gehrys luminous new aic building across the street mr nouvels debut new york design in never built was of a hotel cantilevered over the east river a fusion of bridge and pier jutting out from the brooklyn waterfront the frenchman says critics get stuck on that stand alone defiance "im a contextual architect by desire and by conviction and i have been since the moment i began this profession ive always thought that you build a building wherever it is in a particular place with the notion of respecting everything around it " "in new york " he added "there are always an enormous number of things to tap into that already belong to a history its our job to reveal the presence of that history what story are we telling what are we continuing in architecture you always make the future on the basis of the past on the structure of the past " call it chacun a son contexte "it can be based on contrasts or on a dialogue but each time its a precise analysis of the place and of a sensibility " th avenue he says is all about its site "i cant imagine transporting it somewhere else even to another location in the center of manhattan " in paris mr nouvel has sought harmony his kind bien sur his musee des arts premiers on quai branly leaf covered and on pillars is as long horizontally as the nearby eiffel tower is tall "i put the building in the middle of a very large garden with the effect that this is not a public building that you discover at first glance but through the trees its a protected territory a territory where objects which are inspired by beliefs that are not ours can coexist and shine forth " like the institut du monde arabe quai branly suggests a french acceptance of foreign cultures a fact thats less clear on parisian streets yet the two buildings dont look anything alike admirers call mr nouvel "grammarless " critics say he lacks a style the architect laughs "my style is the effort each time to find the right reason to do this or that for me what characterizes a style is not always to repeat the same elements in a vocabulary its the permanence of an attitude you can recognize architecture by the permanence of that attitude even if the vocabulary of elements is very different " he cites his guthrie theater in minneapolis a massive hulk for culture on the mississippi that mimics the gray depots alongside it a red stripe sets it apart "i thought of the waterfalls and the rapids around minneapolis to make a building that was an extended echo of the industrial buildings and mills that are there " after all he noted "theater is an industry " abu dhabis climate and mr nouvels museum project are a world away a cluster of buildings under a cupola with its own microclimate in a &# billion guggenheim "village" that is only sun and sand today "for a contextual architect thats difficult " he said with a chuckle "i created a peninsula with an architecture built around different buildings simple buildings arab architecture is always geometry and light here its a strict geometry with perforations that create a play of light on the terraces and the buildings underneath " delicate arabesque perforations as in mr nouvels doha tower filter light through the cupola they echo the institut du monde arabes mousharabieh decorative portals that open and close to regulate the passage of light mr nouvels client is thomas krens director of the solomon r guggenheim foundation who commissioned a temporary museum in tokyo an unbuilt opera house in taichung taiwan and a partly submerged museum in rio de janeiro that sank as a project because of local opposition mr krens houston based hines interests and ths cape advisers inc seem unfazed by mr nouvels complicated designs "playing too many notes " as mr nouvel says coyly "i hope in any case that my architecture is complex im a believer in complex thought " said the dr evil look alike co author of a treatise with the inscrutable jean baudrillard "a building shouldnt be able to be decoded in a single glance you always want to hide at least a part of your logic you always want a depth in which some aspects raise questions i still cultivate a certain degree of secrecy " secrecy shrouds mr nouvels planned moma tower hines moma and mr nouvel wont discuss it yet mr nouvels office told sources for the slatin report a real estate blog that he was chosen for the job a moma press release in january noted that the sites &# million sale to hines mandated square feet of exhibition space and square feet for storage mr nouvel hinted at something novel "im for a specific architecture and im opposed to a global or generic architecture especially for skyscrapers a tower for me is akin to what the steeples of cathedrals were before and each time from this standpoint you have to create a point of identity " the onetime theorist reads little these days he recently reread "the idiot" by dostoyevsky "my bedside reading is the book of intranquility by fernando pessoa its the book of someone who is inactive who is questioning about things that are the most subtle the most insignificant maybe its my way of achieving calm through literature " other favorites are michel foucault gilles deleuze and mr baudrillard "if it hadnt been for structuralism i wouldnt be doing what im doing today " he said nor without two french presidents francois mitterrand and jacques chirac for nicholas sarkozy "its still very early " he said "in the electoral campaign there was not much talk of culture even less about architecture " but mr nouvel will be watching perhaps on an island somewhere mr darcy is a correspondent for the art newspaper london
