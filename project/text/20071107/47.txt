give additional shares later this year to leukemia &amp lymphoma society and other charities "if youre going to give give in the most effective way possible " which often means parting with appreciated stock not cash he says in deciding which shares to donate focus on those with unrealized long term gains "long term" refers to those youve owned for more than one year gains on shares youve held for one year or less are considered short term gains that way you typically can deduct the full market value of those shares generally if you donate securities with unrealized short term gains your deduction would be limited to just your cost in those securities says mark nash a partner at pricewaterhousecoopers though there are exceptions to this rule some investors arent aware of that rule just a few weeks ago a donors tax adviser recommended that the client give appreciated securities to schwab charitable fund but the adviser didnt make it clear that the client shouldnt donate securities held a year or less when the client tried to make the donation schwab charitable staffers noticed the mistake and warned the donor "the donor has decided to wait to make his contribution until he has held the securities for over a year " says ms wright violich the funds president donor advised funds such as schwab charitable have become increasingly popular with a typical fund donors contribute cash securities or other assets and get a tax deduction they then can recommend which charities get the gifts donors dont have to pick the ultimate recipient in the same year they make the contribution to the fund "its an extraordinarily convenient vehicle in my view " says david levine a retired money manager in new york city who says he and his wife make about three dozen donations to various charities in a typical year "you dont have to go through the mechanics of transferring shares from your brokerage account or mutual fund company to the account of each particular charity " this year mr levine says he and his wife plan to donate some of their shares of intuitive surgical inc which have "gone up about times" since they bought them several years ago

recent analysis by fidelity investments the firm estimated that million to million american households could potentially save between &# billion and &# billion a year in taxes by donating appreciated
