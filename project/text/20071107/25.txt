business for ceos off duty isnt an option for priests police officers and doctors it isnt really possible to be completely off duty they may enjoy uninterrupted breaks when times are calm but if a big enough crisis arises it doesnt matter whether they are holding a tennis racket or taking a nap they are expected to get back in action right away its time to add big company chief executives to the list of jobs that involve always being "on " regardless of whether bosses favor laid back or intense management styles during normal times they need to take command fast and in person when trouble hits no matter how much it may disrupt their lives away from the office a recent case that has top executives buzzing involves james cayne the year old ceo of bear stearns cos mr cayne has provided strong leadership for the financial services company over the years including the past years as ceo but during julys market upheaval as the journals kate kelly reported last week he was in the office for only of the months working days the other days he was competing in a nashville tenn bridge tournament or playing golf mr cayne phoned in from the bridge tournament to participate in bear stearnss morning meetings of the five person executive committee but didnt have a cellphone or email device at the tournament itself or on the golf course a bear stearns spokesman bristles at any suggestion that such diversions might undercut mr caynes effectiveness "regardless of where he is we have always been able to get ahold of him quickly when we needed him " the spokesman says business leaders such as william george the ceo of medtronic inc from to say that in a crisis the boss cant just phone it in "i dont remember a time when i was ever totally off duty " mr george says "even when i was hiking in canada id take business calls there and if a real crisis hits you come back the ceo has got to be there physically " showing up on the scene reassures subordinates mr george explains it also means a ceo can pick up much more data about whats wrong and how to fix it trying to run things from afar its too easy to underestimate problems or err in the other direction and become consumed by free floating anxieties "presence matters on big things " mr george adds "this is one of the justifications of ceos being well paid the buck stops with them they have that kind of responsibility its your judgment on the line " a few generations ago business moved more slowly and ceos could take well timed vacations with impunity but now capital markets are open around the clock and can spasm in ways that demand the bosss attention product recalls and regulatory upheaval can happen anywhere on the globe activist shareholders can pop up in ways that cant be ignored and while a companys strategy may be set at the center its reputation can be jolted by all kinds of activities on the periphery that puts pressure on the ceo as the face of the company to step in quickly when something goes awry whats more cellphones satellite phones and email devices make it much easier for the boss to stay connected no matter where he or she might be going dark becomes an almost willful decision which isnt tolerated easily by demanding subordinates regulators or investors for most people a career of nonstop work punctuated only by brief interrupted vacations would be unsustainable but ceos are a different breed says harry max a strategist at rubicon consulting in silicon valley "they have tremendous energy they can do this for a long long time " a case in point is scott mcnealy chairman of sun microsystems inc who served as its ceo from to "i never feel like im not working " he says "i check email every to minutes starting at a m before i walk the dog i dont have any problem walking behind the bleachers to check email when my sons are playing soccer " mr mcnealy says he grew up in that kind of environment his father was a senior executive for american motors corp who would bring home a bulging briefcase each evening and sort through paperwork for hours "i asked my dad once why dont you spend more time with us your children " mr mcnealy recalls "he said he was responsible for people at work and that their lives would be disrupted if he didnt make the right decisions i said that makes logical sense im ok with that " corporate boards are entitled to ask for that level of commitment from their ceos says jay w lorsch a professor of human relations at harvard business school "if a ceo isnt spending enough time on the job to do things right " he adds "then maybe its necessary to have a talk with that ceo about whether its time to move on " see related letter "letters to the editor rich vs poor kid time" wsj november
