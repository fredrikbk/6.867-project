drug ads dont tempt europe watch a televised soccer match in london and you wont see suggestive commercials for erectile dysfunction drugs as you might during an american football game direct to consumer or dtc advertising for prescription drugs is banned in europe and the chances of that changing anytime soon appear slim industry players and experts say cultural attitudes and the prevalence of government funded health systems in europe lessen the prospects for consumer ads compared with the u s consumer advertising for prescription drugs thrives in the u s as any viewer of the nightly news knows the industry spent nearly &# billion showing ads for its drugs to american consumers in up from &# million in the year before restrictions on television drug ads were loosened according to a study published in the august issue of the new england journal of medicine they are probably here to stay some proposed restrictions on consumer ads were left out of recently enacted drug regulation legislation in the u s but dont expect the glowing moth in u s tv ads for sepracor inc s lunesta sleep drug to fly across the atlantic anytime soon the european commission believes dtc advertising could affect public health if it is "excessive and ill considered " according to a directive that remains in effect ec spokesman ton van lierop said recently that "direct to consumer advertising for prescription only medicines will continue to be forbidden in the eu " the commission is however considering ways to improve patient access to non promotional information about drugs an effort in which drug makers would like to play a role drug manufacturers say they have no current plans to seek a lifting of the ban on consumer advertising citing cultural and health system differences between the u s and europe "i dont see dtc advertising coming to the major markets of europe " said david brennan chief executive of london based astrazeneca plc "the u s is a market driven model and most of the european model is a government payer model " the unfairness of a european dtc ban to patients seeking drug information has been an occasional argument of the industry merck &amp co executives argued so in a article in the medical journal bmj and it is possible the industry could someday push for a removal of the ban but the main industry association the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations says it doesnt support dtc ads in europe it does however favor loosening restrictions on companies ability to provide the public with nonpromotional health information said spokesman christophe de callatay even if the buzzing bee that sells schering plough corp s nasonex was allowed to enter europe some experts think dtc ads might not be as effective as they are in the u s one reason might be that some european countries have stricter limits on health system reimbursement for prescription drugs than health plans in the u s drug makers are generally permitted to advertise prescription products to european physicians and to make sales calls to doctors as they do in the u s some european physicians arent crazy about the idea of their patients seeing a beaver and abraham lincoln peddle a drug as they do in u s television ads for takeda pharmaceutical co s rozerem insomnia treatment echoing the concerns of u s doctors when tv ads began to proliferate in the s their european counterparts fear the ads would encourage patients to demand prescriptions that arent medically appropriate "patients tend to trust their doctors here and trust their doctors to give the best treatment available " said brian dunn a general practice physician in northern ireland where prescription drugs are covered by the united kingdom health system dtc drug advertising "could undermine that trust " he said but some europeans feel otherwise favoring a removal of the ban as long as ads provide balanced information about a drugs risks and benefits "theres no reason why consumers shouldnt be informed about new developments in prescription drugs " said martin ryan a graduate economics student in dublin "it could be better for consumers to be aware of possible choices " mr ryan added however that european governments would have to regulate consumer ads to ensure they dont over emphasize benefits or minimize risks that is essentially what the fda is charged with doing in the u s although critics have said the fda has had limited resources to do this and have accused drug makers of running unbalanced ads the fda did recently get new power to review tv ads before they run in the u s studies have shown that consumer advertising of drugs can increase the number of diagnoses of the diseases they target people who see drug ads are more likely to ask their doctors for prescriptions and doctors often go along even if theyre uncertain about the medical necessity supporters say the ads increase peoples awareness about diseases and potential treatment options and can help avert under use of drugs but the ads also have been criticized for leading to drug over use and for misleading patients about drugs risks and benefits in for example the fda asked pfizer inc to pull a tv ad for impotence drug viagra featuring a male character known as the "wild thing " saying the ad lacked an adequate description of the drugs side effects and benefits the institute of medicine which advises the u s government on health matters last year recommended a moratorium on dtc advertising for two years after a drugs market launch to allow time to gain more scientific certainty about a new drugs risks and benefits although the proposal wasnt included in recent legislation that gave the fda more teeth in other areas of drug regulation the idea hasnt gone away democratic presidential candidate john edwards recently proposed a similar moratorium in europe patients can make an end run around the advertising ban by using the internet many branded prescription drugs have their own web site such as that for pfizers best selling cholesterol drug lipitor the site features an endorsement from robert jarvik who invented an artificial heart and who also appears in lipitor tv ads in the u s the sites usually have disclaimers saying the product information is intended only for u s citizens but anyone around the world can view them for some u s drug web sites up to of visitor traffic comes from outside the u s estimated mark bard president of manhattan research llc a health care market research firm but most u s product web sites are in english limiting their usefulness to non english speakers also some drugs are approved in europe for different uses than in the u s europeans can get product information in their own language from the web site of the european medicines agency a body of the european union that evaluates drugs
