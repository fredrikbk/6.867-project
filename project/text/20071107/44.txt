educational rewards for profit management of public schools is still in its infancy and many wonder whether it can have a positive effect on student learning in philadelphia that idea has been put to the test the results as we report in a paper issued last friday by the harvard program on education policy and governance would not surprise adam smith the th century economist explained that those who need to make a profit have strong incentives to do well by their customers but can smiths theory actually work when one is talking about educating students in the most challenging of urban schools at the very heart of a major metropolis the answer appears to be yes when for profit management of public schools was first proposed in philadelphia six years ago many in that city were extremely skeptical if not aggressively hostile so the philadelphia school reform commission the entity responsible for the innovation gave only the lowest performing schools to for profit companies while another were given to nonprofit organizations including two of the citys major universities temple and the university of pennsylvania others were reorganized by the school district itself in effect a competition was run among the three types of management for profit nonprofit and government run four years into the race here are the results students at schools managed by for profit firms were roughly six months ahead in math than would be expected had the schools remained in the hands of the school district in reading students in schools managed by for profit firms were two months further along than they would have been if the schools had been under district control though that difference was not large enough to give us statistical certainty meanwhile the nonprofits and the school districts own reorganized schools did no better than expected our findings are based upon information gleaned from nearly student test scores made available to us by the school district of philadelphia they gave us the test scores of every tested student for the years through allowing us to track student performance at for profit nonprofit and low performing district schools both before and after the management changes took place that data was subjected to a rigorous quasi experimental "difference in differences" analysis that estimates management impacts at each type of school by making use of information on how much students were learning both before and after the management change while controlling for the students characteristics though we believe our methodology to be state of the art our findings will nonetheless be controversial because they contradict a prior study by the rand corp in february which found no impact of private management on student performance the rand study however failed to separate out the schools managed by the for profit firms from those managed by the nonprofit organizations in our study too management effects are nil when the two are mixed together as the positive impacts of for profit firms are canceled out by the negative impacts of nonprofit organizations even adam smith would not expect that for profit management will work anytime and anywhere but the philadelphia results demonstrate that putting schools in private hands could lead to improvements in education at the very least the current philadelphia for profit schools should be allowed to continue under private management if results from the first four years continue to hold up they make a strong case for giving the private sector a larger role in urban education mr peterson a senior fellow at the hoover institution is professor of government at harvard university and director of its program on education policy and governance mr chingos is a research fellow at the program
