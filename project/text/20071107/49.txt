dump this house unloading your property in a slow market it could be the kindest cut of all look at the prices of homes getting sold and the property markets decline seems no worse than a rough day in the stock market look at the number of unsold homes and you realize theres a world of financial pain out there true these unsold homes may eventually get bought at decent prices but in the meantime the owners are often bleeding money and many of them would be smart to slash their asking price and go for the quick sale taking time as you can see from the accompanying chart home prices are down just from their july peak yet even as prices appear pretty much unchanged the number of unsold homes has soared at the current pace of sales it would take more than months to clear this backlog according to the national association of realtors sure it would be emotionally draining to have your home on the market for more than months but it probably wouldnt be a financial disaster as long as youre still in the house and you can comfortably cover the mortgage maybe however you have an adjustable rate loan thats now unaffordable maybe youre trying to unload a vacation home maybe you moved cross country for a new job but your old house still hasnt sold the monthly cost of carrying a vacant home could equal of a homes value figures charles farrell an adviser with denvers northstar investment advisors after all you still have to pay utilities insurance property taxes maintenance and of course the mortgage what if the mortgage is paid off theres still an opportunity cost the equity in your home could instead be invested in say bonds yielding to make matters worse "prices could be lower a year from now " mr farrell warns "theres also the risk of owning a physical asset im thinking about things like fire broken pipes theft " cutting deeply despite all this sellers are loath to cut their asking price which is the reason prices have barely budged so far "people focus on what their home was worth two years ago or how much theyve sunk into it or on their desire not to bring a check to the closing " notes financial adviser bert whitehead author of "why smart people do stupid things with money " his advice ditch these emotional hangups and unload your property now "if you really want to sell your house you have to cut deep " mr whitehead says good advice heres how to decide for yourself ask your real estate agent how many properties are on the market in your town today and how many sold in each of the past six months advises chris mayer director of columbia business schools milstein center for real estate "if there are houses on the market and houses sold last month that means its taking months to sell a house " prof mayer says "thats pretty simple math but nobody ever does it if you price your house like everybody else it might take months to sell it " suppose you price your home like everybody else and it does indeed take months to sell figure out how much you would be out of pocket over that stretch either because your home is vacant or because the mortgage has become unaffordably large spend your sunday going to open houses in the neighborhood that should give you an indication of what you need to ask if you want to get your home sold now given the cost of carrying your home and the risk prices will fall further would it be cheaper to slash your asking price if youre going to lower your price prof mayer advises doing it right away or waiting until early next year he notes that very few houses sell between thanksgiving and mid january "the best scenario is that prices fall through the spring and then stabilize " prof mayer says "but im more pessimistic than that i would sell now "
