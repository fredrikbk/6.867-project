fiscally fit shoring up the bottom line tight credit a shaky market and &# oil leave terri and her friends feeling uneasy online edition my neighbor dropped by over the weekend and we got into a conversation about housing and the state of the financial markets she works in the financial services industry so we talk about these things often my neighbor and her husband are in the process of an expensive home remodeling project theyve wanted to do for years but now theyre worried about the timing as one big bank after another discloses huge credit market losses and mortgage companies lay off workers by the thousands my neighbor is growing concerned about her own job security her husband owns a small business that relies on the strength of the housing market she says hes seen sales fall off so sharply that hes considering closing shop still theyre in good shape financially while theyre not planning on calling their remodeling project off they are being far more careful with their spending on the project i told her about my husband gerrys recent decision to not buy a corvette the car of his dreams because it would mean piling more debt on top of the debt we already have for our recent home projects gerry didnt pass on his dream car because he was concerned about losing his job or our financial stability rather its that hes generally the conservative type who likes to avoid incurring debt whenever possible after he made the decision i admitted to feeling uncomfortable with the level of debt wed have taken on if he had bought the car so far our remodeling projects have been cosmetic but weve got some costly necessary repairs ahead of us and i worried that we might be digging ourselves in too deep my neighbor then mentioned a mutual friend whod just finished her own big home remodeling project her husband an information technology specialist has been out of work for months due to an illness now the couple is feeling uncomfortable about relying on a single income and hes actively seeking work again "all of the sudden its like were all feeling it " my neighbor said referring to our sudden unease about our finances after the housing market coughed and the credit markets sneezed though "came down with pneumonia" is more like it even consumers in relatively good financial health are starting to feel a touch of the flu coming on certainly folks like me and my neighbor feel that way which took me by surprise because were households with upper middle class incomes and comfortable net eggs william g brennan a financial adviser at capital management group llc in washington d c says hes seeing similar anxiety among some of his clients "theres a lot of unease about where the economy is heading " he says "people arent calling in crisis mode but they want to be sure theyre protected on the downside " all this unease got me thinking about ways my neighbors and i could shore up our own finances ensuring wed be on the best footing should some financial crisis strike clearly debt is job one i generally pay off my high interest credit card at the end of each month but occasionally i do carry a balance on my card month to month at the same time my husband gerry and i are spending an extra &# a month to pay down our low interest mortgage earlier thats foolish by transferring that &# mortgage principal prepayment to cut down the credit card debt i could pay down my outstanding balance far sooner saving on finance charges and then get back to prepaying the mortgage and speaking of credit cards i hadnt checked recently to see if my variable rate reward program card is still a good deal compared with similar cards you can do that here turns out its not after doing a search for reward cards i found the average weekly rate on a standard credit card is compared with my standard purchase rate of a quick call to my card companys customer service line yielded results the rate was shaved to nice we have an emergency savings account that would pay living expenses for three to four months and gerry and i have a &# home equity line of credit to carry us beyond that if we didnt have emergency savings id cut back on our spending and focus on building it up and if we didnt have the credit line id open one so we could count on it in the event of a long term financial emergency such as a job loss or medical condition barry kohler a certified financial planner with bdmp wealth management in portland maine says now is a good time to take a look at our overall investment portfolio and make sure were properly diversified investors in their s and s like us should make sure theyre well diversified and then stay the course he says while "people who are pre retirement or in retirement may want to consider dialing back on their equity holdings to make sure theyve got enough downside protection " dont abandon stocks wholesale since you need equity holdings to fuel growth he says instead make sure you have a proper balance of stocks and bonds for your risk tolerance this asset allocation worksheet can help you find the right balance mr brennan of capital management suggests holding stocks in tax advantaged retirement accounts such as iras or k s and keeping short term savings in accounts with immediate liquidity such as money market funds short term exchange traded treasury bond funds and open end bond funds "avoid individual bonds that may have to be liquidated at a loss" in the event of a financial crisis he says mr brennan also recommends diversifying our equity portfolio between equity classes including international stocks to reduce risk "income producing equities may add some downside protection " he says investors who are facing a cash flow crunch may also want to move several months of living expenses into liquid investments held in your ira he says in a real emergency money can be pulled out for days no more than once a year and returned without incurring income taxes or the penalty mr kohler of bdmp wealth management says consumers who are feeling anxious about the state of their finances should defer purchases of big ticket items "i wouldnt say go buy a new car but making their holiday pocketbook smaller than their heart would be a good thing " he says gerry and i have already nixed the new car purchase and we have no plans to spend more than we normally do on our holiday spending finally mr kohler says breathe its natural for investors to feel anxious in times of financial market volatility but theres no reason to panic "i think people are overreacting " he says "theres a sense that a lot of it is exaggerated because its fueled by the media no offense " none taken instead he says avoid making hasty financial decisions those often turn out to be the worst are you worried about where the economy and the markets are headed do you plan to cut back on spending this holiday season or make changes in your portfolio write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com
