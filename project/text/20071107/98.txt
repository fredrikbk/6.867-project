politics &amp economics bhutto raises heat on musharraf nationwide protests planned in pakistan but door left open for talks islamabad pakistan former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto plans to meet with opposition parties today to initiate nationwide protests against the state of emergency declared saturday by president pervez musharraf according to her spokesman the plan is the latest indication that ms bhutto who heads pakistans largest political party and last month signed a preliminary power sharing agreement with gen musharraf will play an important role in shaping the nations response to emergency rule ms bhutto canceled a planned meeting with gen musharraf and their power sharing agreement now appears on hold said her spokesman farhatullah babar following the detention of thousands of government opponents lawyers and human rights activists "the talks have collapsed after gen musharrafs decision to impose emergency rule " mr babar said "our talks were for free and fair elections which are not possible under the present situation " a senior government official said negotiations between the two leaders havent completely broken down "it is crucial for gen musharraf not to let ms bhutto join the opposition " said an official familiar with the contacts between them ms bhutto years old is the one politician with the popularity and clout to mobilize the kind of mass protests that could spark a reversal of the emergency rule or force the ouster of gen musharraf by the cadre of generals who now back the president and army chief but the imposition of the state of emergency which ms bhutto has called "a step back to dictatorship " places her in a delicate position in reaching the agreement with the president last month that allowed her to return from self imposed exile to run for prime minister in january elections and avoid longstanding corruption charges ms bhutto was tilting toward the government the agreement backed by the u s was part of an effort to boost the forces of moderation against islamist extremism and spur pakistan on the road to democracy ms bhuttos authority as the most powerful opposition leader now risks being undermined if she doesnt take a strong stand against the same government with which she was negotiating just weeks ago so far she has sided firmly with the opposition but has stopped short of rallying her supporters and the broader pakistani public to large scale street action but many expect her efforts to intensify against gen musharrafs regime "she is going to use this opportunity to convince both the army and the americans of the need to revert to normal politics " said aysha siddiqa a political and defense analyst and author of a book about the pakistani military "ms bhutto may also try to use the agitation on the street without her party getting directly involved to pressurize the army to remove musharraf " she said ms bhutto has spoken out against the detention of politicians and the violent response of security forces to opponents of emergency rule that violence continued yesterday with the worst unrest in the central city of multan where police used batons to disperse about lawyers as they tried to leave a court complex to start a street rally iftikhar mohammed chaudhry the chief justice who was dismissed by gen musharraf and is now under house arrest in islamabad urged lawyers during a telephone conference yesterday to continue their antigovernment protests hundreds of islamic militants meanwhile seized a town in northwest pakistan after outnumbered security forces laid down their arms according to local officials and residents ms bhutto also repeatedly has called on the government to hold general elections as planned in mid january a vote that was expected to install her for an unprecedented third term as prime minister although gen musharraf has suggested he intends to hold those elections as close to the scheduled time as possible they are expected to be delayed ms bhutto is perhaps the only politician in pakistan in a position today to speak out against the government action unlike many other opposition politicians including members of her own pakistan peoples party she hasnt been placed under house arrest any effort by the government to silence her would likely spark just the kind of widespread public response that could make gen musharrafs continuation in power untenable for that reason and to try to keep her criticism of his measures at least somewhat muted gen musharraf hasnt closed the door to continued talks with her that could move their power sharing agreement forward
