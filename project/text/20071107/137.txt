yahoos lashing highlights risks of china market an unusually dramatic congressional hearing on yahoo inc s role in the imprisonment of at least two dissidents in china exposed the company to withering criticism and underscored the risks for western companies seeking to expand there "while technologically and financially you are giants morally you are pygmies " rep tom lantos d calif who called the hearing on capitol hill told yahoos co founder and chief executive jerry yang and general counsel michael callahan "this testimony has been an appallingly disappointing performance " mr yang apologized to the mother of journalist shi tao who was jailed after yahoo china then a unit of the company handed information about him to chinese authorities in she was at the hearing sitting directly behind messrs callahan and yang addressing the families of the dissidents mr yang said "i want to say we are committed to doing what we can to secure their freedom and i want to personally apologize for what they are going through " the hearing was called by rep lantos chairman of the house foreign affairs committee to hear testimony about the circumstances under which yahoo cooperated with the chinese authorities and to hear from mr callahan about apparent inconsistencies in his testimony the highly publicized hearing highlighted a risk that comes with the rewards of moving into the huge chinese market yahoo google inc and other u s internet companies face a potentially high cost in negative publicity with their gains the debate over china is just one of the pressures facing mr yang who succeeded terry semel as ceo in june mr semel had also been dogged by questions about yahoos actions in china like executives at google and other internet companies mr semel expressed his anger at chinas repressive policies while arguing that the company had to follow the laws of countries where it does business its unknown what the consequences would have been for yahoo if it failed to comply with the chinese demands the company said that if its employees violated chinese law they could face prosecution in the country the licenses required for a foreign business to operate in china are entirely at the government regulators discretion ahead of the olympic games next summer in beijing china is facing increased scrutiny on a host of problems from human rights to the environment that could well broaden to affect western companies doing business there some analysts pointed to the hearing as a reason that yahoos shares dropped on a day when the stock market was generally up the decline came despite the potential benefit to the company from the hugely successful stock listing in hong kong yesterday of chinese internet company alibaba com ltd yahoo owns of its parent company alibaba group a stake it bought in alibaba com shares opened at hk&# us&# yesterday more than double its initial public offering price of hk&# and reached an intraday high of hk&# scott kessler an analyst at standard &amp poors said he thought the decline in yahoos shares was more the result of investors selling on the news of alibabas successful stock market debut after a run up in prior days with the hearing past he thinks investors may now believe that yahoo has weathered the china issue "theres a reputational hit from this that the company can now absorb " mr kessler said the alibaba deal put alibaba itself on the front lines in dealing with chinese government officials not yahoo mr yang noted that his company doesnt control the day to day operations of alibaba or yahoo china still mr yangs grilling highlights the bind that internet companies face when they venture overseas privacy experts say in china privacy takes a back seat to laws governing criticism of the government and while yahoo and rivals like google tried to comply with chinas local laws that ultimately backfired on them domestically "theyre caught in a vise " said denny obrien international outreach coordinator for the electronic frontier foundation a nonprofit civil liberties group in san francisco for the past year says mr obrien yahoo and other internet companies have been working with the eff and other nonprofits on a code of internet privacy principles trying to resolve some of the issues that had unfolded in china the effort has been proceeding slowly and isnt yet complete while the u s government had been silent on the topic for some time mr yangs testimony today signals the reinvolvement of u s officials into global internet privacy issues mr obrien said yahoo first entered the chinese market in when it was aggressively expanding overseas in other countries such as japan but local chinese portals stole a march on the u s company and it had middling success in the giant market in yahoo acquired network software co which makes software for chinese language internet searches in it paid about &# billion and transferred its ownership in yahoo china as part of the deal to obtain its stake in alibaba group which owns alibaba com and other properties mr yang is one of four members of alibaba groups board of directors yahoo based in sunnyvale calif ran into trouble in china the same year as the alibaba deal for its role in helping chinese officials identify mr shi he allegedly used his yahoo email account to relay the contents of a secret government order to an overseas web site mr shi is now serving a year prison sentence also at the hearing was the wife of jailed internet writer wang xiaoning according to a committee spokeswoman mr wang was arrested in for using a yahoo account to advocate open elections in china the company is alleged by lawmakers and human rights groups to have cooperated with beijing over his arrest as well in the case of mr shi mr callahan had initially told congress that yahoo didnt know the reasons for a chinese government order seeking information from the company then in october when mr callahan discovered the extent to which company officials did learn of the political aspect to the government order he failed to let congress know his earlier testimony was incorrect lawmakers expressed incredulity that mr callahan hadnt been aware of the details of beijings request that order referred explicitly to "state secrets" violations which several members of the panel pointed out was code in china for political investigations "yahoo claims that this is just one big misunderstanding " said rep lantos "let me be clear this was no misunderstanding this was inexcusably negligent behavior at best and deliberately deceptive behavior at worst " mr callahan apologized to the committee for not returning to inform lawmakers of his earlier error earlier in meetings with committee staffers he also apologized for misinforming the panel according to several people at those meetings yahoo has denied that mr callahan apologized in private for misinforming the committee and at tuesdays hearing mr callahan also said he didnt believe he had been untruthful when testifying in his remarks didnt mollify lawmakers committee members of both parties took turns at the hearing lambasting the executives for what happened rep brad sherman d calif said he believed rep lantos had shown significant self control in not pursuing a perjury investigation into mr callahans february testimony "how could a dozen lawyers prepare another lawyer to testify before congress without anyone thinking to look at the document that had caused the hearing to be called this is astonishing " said rep chris smith r n j mr lantos asked why no one at yahoo had been disciplined for what happened mr yang said that while the company had lessons to learn from the incident he didnt believe there was any need to discipline any one employee "at the end of the day i feel that everybody was doing the best they can given a difficult situation " mr yang said messrs yang and callahan were pressured by lawmakers to endorse a bill authored by rep smith which would criminalize cooperation by u s technology companies with foreign governments that could use information to crack down on democracy activists the yahoo executives refused to specifically do so but said they would look at the legislation further that bill was unanimously approved by the committee two weeks ago and now faces a debate on the floor of the house the lawmakers urged yahoo to help with the humanitarian needs of families of jailed dissidents in china rep smith said one way the company could do this would be to settle a court case brought against it by relatives of the imprisoned dissidents as soon as possible mr callahan said that the company was open to that after the hearing the yahoo executives met with mr shis mother mr wangs wife and their translator it isnt known what was said in that meeting see related letter "letters to the editor yahoos get rich culture" wsj november
