familys story was untrue her father long suspicious encouraged her in to go dig in wartime archives that the u s had recently returned to germany ernst himmler she learned joined hitlers national socialist german workers party as early as two years later he joined the ss guard the special unit responsible for carrying out many of the nazi regimes worst atrocities now years old and married to an israeli jew ms himmler says she was shocked when she found out that ernst was in the ss "it might sound strange but i never considered this possibility " she says ms himmler investigated further she unearthed records of heinrichs elder brother gebhard and coaxed his children into sharing memories and letters she wrote a book "the himmler brothers " about her familys history and the trauma involved in uncovering it ms himmlers book published in german in and in english this past summer is one of several recent memoirs by the children and grandchildren of old nazis that aim to reflect on how the party affiliation affected their families another book published this past summer in german "kind l " tells the story of heilwig weger a girl reared in one of the lebensborn settlements the ss built for orphans and other so called aryan children ms weger was later adopted by oswald pohl a nazi officer hanged in for war crimes the book conveys the pain she felt at losing him the only father she knew while being ostracized by other children because of his actions later she hid her background from her own children the documentary " or things i know about him " released two years ago in germany and this year in the u s shows how the filmmaker malte ludin and his siblings wrestled with the conflict of loving their father a prominent nazi executed after the war while reviling what he had done at first ms himmlers relatives supported her determination to explore the familys history but when she uncovered painful details they balked calling her a nestbeschmutzer someone who fouls her own nest ms himmler for instance found out that the grandmother she adored had made use of her husbands nazi connections and stayed in touch with ex nazi officials after the war in the postwar period memoirs of nazis or their families were long taboo ms himmler has vivid memories of those years in high school one day a classmate asked during a history lesson whether she was related to the himmler when she said yes a tense silence gripped the room ms himmler recalls after which the teacher continued her lesson as if nothing had happened "i think she lost an opportunity " says ms himmler "she could have used what happened to discuss the link that our generation bears to the past " ms himmler an introverted but friendly woman who pedals around todays liberal berlin on a bicycle met her future husband while studying political science at the free university in berlin his family fled poland and the nazis in the s in the early days of their courtship ms himmler says they raked over the past obsessively they visited nazi landmarks in berlin such as the stadium where the olympic games were held they went to krakow in southern poland to see the jewish quarter where his grandparents once lived through ms himmler her husband refused requests for an interview she declined to identify his name out of concern for protecting his privacy she says her husband never held her familys past against her even as he struggled with anger over his familys persecution by the germans his parents who live in israel knew postwar germany well from their own travels there and didnt object to their sons relationship with her ms himmler spent several years burrowing through microfilmed wartime records and phone logs the u s returned to the german federal archive in berlin in as she dug deeper she uncovered painful truths about family members including the grandmother she had loved until the old woman died in as newlyweds her grandparents acquired a home in a well kept berlin suburb to make room for the couple the nazis "freed" the house of its former occupants a union administrator a painter and a civil engineer ms himmler never found out what became of them ms himmler also found records of phone calls her grandmother made to heinrich himmler in as the allies intensified their bombing of berlin responding to her pleas to relocate the family somewhere safer the ss chief hid them in a village in poland after the war ms himmlers grandmother again made use of her nazi connections as she sought to secure an income and jobs for her children at age ms himmlers aunt got work as a secretary in a factory owned by former nazis ernst vanished in berlin in the spring of as the allies pushed into the city the government later informed the family that he was believed dead ernsts elder brother gebhard himmler in a written account of his life described himself as a civil servant barely referring to the nazi party and never once mentioning hitler during her research ms himmler discovered her great uncle had been a party member too in charge of licensing engineers to work in germany he based his decisions on the devotion candidates showed to the fuhrer today katrin himmler and her husband live with their year old son in an apartment not far from the reichstag the seat of the german parliament they talk a lot with the boy about the past ms himmler says she isnt sure whether he has yet put it together that his mothers side of the family once tried to exterminate his fathers examining her grandparents lives has led ms himmler to question whether she would have acted any differently "im not sure i would have " she says when asked later how her husband felt about this she replied in an email "my husband thinks exactly as i and many other people that ordinary people are in certain circumstances able to act in a horrible way and to tolerate horrible crimes and most of us cant be sure how we would have behaved in that time at least if we are honest and not moralistic " some critics in germany say that recent memoirs seek to profit from deplorable family histories and run the risk of apologizing for the nazis by offering humanizing portrayals of them as loving parents and grandparents "im definitely not apologizing for them " says ms himmler "its hard to look at these people as ordinary men and women but we really have to do this " she says "they were doing monstrous things but they were not monsters " see related letters "letters to the editor haunted by the unspeakable monster kin" wsj nov
