those u n super sleuths so mohamed elbaradei finds it "distressing" that neither israel nor the u s shared information with him about an apparent syrian nuclear program before israeli jets destroyed it on september imagine that not everyone is prepared to entrust the head of the international atomic energy agency with their national security for the past year mr elbaradei has been running an independent foreign policy from his iaea perch people tell him he is "doing gods work" or so he tells the new york times in august he announced a nuclear agreement he had reached with irans mullahs without consulting his political superiors at the agency even the europeans protested that one the agreement made no reference to the u n security councils demand that iran suspend its uranium enrichment program a demand mr elbaradei himself dismisses as moot the agreement also allowed the iranians to dribble out information on the dozen outstanding questions the iaea has yet to resolve mr elbaradei has coasted on the iaeas reputation as the authoritative source of information on the worlds nuclear secrets yet this is the same agency that was taken by surprise by nuclear projects in libya north korea and iraq in the s and now in syria which in september was voted co chair of the iaeas general conference all this is reason enough for the u s israel and any other country serious about stopping nuclear proliferation to refuse mr elbaradeis not so good diplomatic offices not surprisingly the syrians are hailing the iaea chief for saying neither israel nor the u s had provided "any evidence" to suggest damascus was in the nuclear business satellite images show the syrians have now covered their tracks in the desert
