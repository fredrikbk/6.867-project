reviving havas by growth not cuts believing in team questions for fernando rodes vila company advertising holding company havas sa title chief executive officer havas long the sick man of the global advertising industry is finally showing some signs of health the paris based owner of euro rscg worldwide and havas media recently released its best financial result in years a third quarter increase in revenue to million euros &# million from million euros stripping out the effects of currency changes and acquisitions thats a jump of it was the third quarter in a row of improving results for the company and the biggest organic revenue gain in percentage terms by any big ad group in the quarter the positive run suggests that the new managers put in place by chairman vincent bollore a couple of years ago are helping to breathe new life into the company mr bollore built up a stake in havas in and then ousted its management team which had embarked on a disastrous series of acquisitions his shareholding has since risen to one of mr bollores key decisions was to promote fernando rodes vila from head of havass media buying arm to ceo mr rodes a soft spoken spaniard who loves food wine and hiking took the job in march his wife and four children followed him to paris from barcelona a year later he has a particularly strong incentive to do a good job a piece of the rodes family fortune is tied up in havas shares the family owns about of the company the wall street journal on oct your french rival publicis sa posted disappointing third quarter results sending its shares plunging completely unexpectedly havass results came out a few minutes later was this a publicity stunt designed to embarrass your competitor mr rodes no no no on the contrary the coincidence is that publicis was also that day which is something we found out on the previous weekend wsj one rival ad executive told me that your third quarter result was so good that it wasnt credible any response mr rodes these q results represent only a very short period of time the only important fact is that they confirm that our yearly results are going to be landing in more or less where we projected which is around annual revenue growth any suggestion as i have read in the press and have heard some people commenting internally that these results are bringing havas to a new higher level of growth thats nonsense wsj now that youve got revenue under control the big question is can you keep up margins some rivals say you win business by cutting prices mr rodes you dont win business by bringing your fees or or down you win business by convincing clients when the new management took over we had to take a major strategic decision were we going to produce growth by the top line through increasing revenue or our cost structure unanimously we said "lets go for the top line " we knew havas could not go again through a huge pressure on costs now it is time after we have gained some momentum on the top line to see if we can master cost control again wsj in what condition did you find havass accounting and budget procedures when you became ceo mr rodes they were more than poor we had everything we needed to have excellent information circuits and tools for management but just didnt use them for example we didnt have a budget we had something we called a budget but those numbers were modified every month with a new forecast all the software we needed was there but we just didnt apply any of those very ordinary things it was not difficult to put them back in place it was a cultural managerial decision more than anything else wsj analysts have long said that havass key weakness is that its media buying arm havas media lacks the scale of its competitors mr rodes volume maybe was important years ago when this market started i dont know of any local media market today that operates on the basis of volume wsj your chairman vincent bollore is also the biggest shareholder how involved is he in the running of the company and how long do you think hell remain an investor mr rodes hes a nonexecutive chairman but under that classification he is very involved he brought three things we knew he was going to bring money he has brought two other things a fresh vision in media and his own personal management capability wsj will havas be independent within three years mr rodes i believe it will i dont know how long he mr bollore will stay but i know he will stay long enough to make things happen wsj whats the best thing youve done since becoming ceo mr rodes to believe in a team the group had not a team culture before nor a team spirit nor the belief that by putting team dynamics and teamwork first we were going to be better
