politics &amp economics bush import policing plan likely to aid legislation white house initiative can help advance efforts under way in congress washington the bush administrations proposals to better police imports will likely bolster congressional efforts to make food and consumer products safer president bush announced an page plan to stop tainted imports after a slew of high profile recalls the plan crafted by a panel of cabinet level officials from agencies calls for giving more powers to agencies that regulate food and consumer goods beefing up technology and data collection and increasing cooperation between agencies and with u s trading partners most of the ideas in the plan arent new variations of some of the proposals have appeared in legislation on capitol hill or recommendations from agencies such as the food and drug administration or business groups with the white house on board the stage is set for more hearings discussions and efforts to craft legislation the white house didnt attach budget and personnel numbers to the plan saying instead it will use the normal funding request process through congress without adequate resources federal agencies may find it difficult to flex their new muscles "i see this as the administration falling into line with the other groups with the industry the congress consumer groups and the fda career scientists " said william hubbard a former associate commissioner of the fda "youve got a strong groundwork upon which to craft legislation " based on the plan much of it requiring legislative action the fda would be given the authority to order recalls of tainted food something it cant do now it would also be allowed to require producers of high risk products to take steps to prevent contamination the agency could also bar imports if it isnt given adequate access to production records china where many of the recent tainted food and consumer product incidents originated has embarked on a wide ranging campaign of its own to improve product safety to restore confidence in its goods both at home and abroad last month authorities barred more than toy factories in the southern province of guangdong from exporting their wares because of unspecified flaws the government says it has also arrested more than people allegedly involved in the manufacture and sale of counterfeit or low quality drugs and food over the past two months "progress has not been minor " said vice premier wu yi the official in charge of the governments efforts "but there are still many weak links and our task is increasingly arduous " ms wu made her remarks last month during an inspection tour of small workshops and restaurants in eastern shandong province chinas general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine the main inspection agency and the state food and drug administration had no immediate reaction wednesday to the white house plans yesterday the fda announced its own prevention focused safety strategy for both domestic and imported food part of it already included in the white house import plan the consumer product safety commission meanwhile would be able to increase fines on those found violating safety rules and make it illegal to sell recalled products interagency efforts would also be stepped up more customs fda cpsc border patrol and other u s inspectors will be stationed overseas and a new imports database would allow greater sharing of information and safety reports "i just want to emphasize we are saying to the world if you want to have access to american consumers you need to meet the expectations of safety and quality that the u s has not your consumers our consumers if you want access to our markets " said health and human services secretary mike leavitt who headed the panel that drafted the plan sen edward m kennedy of massachusetts chairman of the senate health education labor and pensions committee said "after years of inaction pressure from the american people and from congress has at last prompted the bush administration to propose a food safety strategy " but he cautioned that "without adequate funding no strategy can be effective " with lawmakers divided on what is the best plan to fix safety problems it is unclear how a consensus can be reached that would also please the white house sen richard durbin d ill who welcomed the white houses action wants to establish a single food agency to replace the current dozen including the fda the agriculture department and the environmental protection agency rep diana degette d colo wants the government to establish a system to trace how contamination occurred mr durbin and rep john dingell d mich chairman of the house energy and commerce committee prefer user fees on imports to help fund the fda even with white house support for giving the fda the authority to order mandatory recalls some members may still object mike taylor a research professor at george washington university school of public health said he expects congress will analyze the white houses proposal and make it stronger already yesterday sen charles schumer of new york said the white house plan wont work until the administration provides more funding allows consumers easy access to safety information and strengthens food and product safety with only a few weeks before lawmakers leave for the holidays a senate aide said that although hearings or bill introductions may take place the senate is unlikely to pass a food safety bill this year with next year being an election year the staffer said the best chance for passage may be before march or april mr dingell said he is planning to hold a hearing on the proposals "at the earliest possible date " but added "the critical issue of funding is curiously absent from the proposal " zhou yang in beijing contributed to this article
