how airports bucked trend in late arrivals in a year dominated by record delays stranded passengers and the ripple effects from new yorks packed airspace travelers at a few airports have received a lucky surprise more on time flights in the first nine months of this year the average on time arrival rate at the nations busiest airports dropped to from a year earlier according to the department of transportations bureau of transportation statistics but eight major airports have managed so far to buck the trend four are in california san diego los angeles oakland and san francisco apparently benefiting from unusually dry conditions this year in the golden state houstons rain battered george bush intercontinental has also seen a modest uptick in timely landings as has the worlds busiest airport hartsfield jackson international in atlanta the other two las vegas and chicagos midway meanwhile the chances of getting bumped from a flight worsened in the third quarter compared with the year earlier period according to figures released this week by the transportation department which is considering raising the maximum amount airlines pay to compensate customers for being bumped from overbooked flights the largest u s carriers turned away scheduled passengers at a rate of per every fliers the dot said thats up from in the year earlier period the airline industry has blamed everything from private jets to congress for its poor on time performance this year but the continued improvement at these eight airports shows that there is a lot the facilities themselves can do to improve travel conditions both houston and atlanta have expanded in recent years adding runways and gates to accommodate an increased number of passengers but they have also taken creative steps to improve the flow of planes in the air and on the ground a look at their approaches shows how other airports can cope with the rising demand for air travel and potentially sidestep the worsening delays plaguing much of the system back in the rising number of flights at atlantas hartsfield was outpacing the airports capacity and the on time rate was plummeting in may the airport opened a fifth runway air traffic controllers could now handle up to landings per hour in good weather an increase of from before airport authorities also made a crucial change in the layout of two popular runways originally planes landing on runway r needed clearance to cross a parallel runway l to reach the terminals a process that limited activity on both earlier this year the airport built a strip of pavement connecting runway r to the terminal area by wrapping around the end of l planes taking off from l now soar over jets winding along this new strip dubbed taxiway victor the new route requires planes landing on the first runway to traverse a longer path but it has increased the airports efficiency because planes on the two runways no longer interfere with each other tom nissalke hartsfields director of environmental and technical services says runway l can now handle between and departures per hour up from a maximum of "the overall delay reduction far outweighs the additional taxi time " says mr nissalke the airport has also improved the use of airspace traditionally hartsfield and other airports relied on pilots to manually navigate planes using ground based aids and regular voice communication with controllers because of this planes had to be kept far apart and were flown along specific coordinates that added time to flights over the past few years hartsfield has been leading the way in phasing in so called area navigation technology which allows cockpit computers to steer planes along more precise predictable routes it has also enabled air traffic controllers in atlanta to introduce another arrival path for planes approaching from the northeast and another one is in the works for planes approaching from the northwest atlanta based delta air lines inc says area navigation and other improvements at hartsfield are reducing delays for its flights by between and minutes per departure so far this year of flights have been arriving on time into hartsfield compared with for the year earlier period and in "getting in and out of atlanta seems to have improved " said trey loughran a senior vice president with atlanta based equifax inc who flies out of the airport about times a year houstons bush intercontinental has also relied on a mix of expansion and new technology to keep its on time arrival rate above and even to improve it slightly from last year unlike airports in crowded urban areas such as new yorks john f kennedy international and la guardia airports bush intercontinental has ample space to grow in recent years it has built a new runway and converted another from general aviation to commercial use a new terminal brought new gates upping its overall gate capacity today to from in bush is also harnessing technology to better utilize existing space rick vacar aviation director for the houston airport system said that with the number of passengers at bush expected to soar by million to million in the airport could carve out a new runway between two existing ones an option now possible because of new technology that allows for more precise flight paths the airport is also starting to acquire land in the hopes of adding another runway five to years from now lisa hurst director of travel for san diego based petco animal supplies inc said her employees have had more problems connecting through dallas denver and chicago "i try to route people through houston if possible " even if an airport has extra space expansion projects require lots of time and money legal challenges and other hurdles dragged out atlantas fifth runway project for nearly a quarter of a century pushing the price tag close to &# billion seattles sea tac international is years into a &# billion construction project there have been nearly miles of new runways added at major airports since the faa says but only two major new airports in denver and dallas have been built over the past years with u s passenger traffic expected to rise by and potentially double by the agency says four major new airports will be needed it points to atlanta chicago las vegas and san diego as potential sites even if planned improvements to major airports and their airspace occur the faa estimates that major airports will still need major capacity enhancements by many factors outside airports control also affect whether flights arrive on time including weather and the performance of major carriers oakland international and san diego international have benefited from drier weather this year another help is the track record of southwest airlines which lands more than of its flights on time and is the dominant carrier at both airports for many other airports congestion and delays may continue unless demand for air travel slows the faa is hoping to redesign new yorks airspace which accounts for one third of all u s commercial airline activity to free up additional routes but even if the airspace gets more flexible problems on the ground loom as a major hurdle there are no new runways planned at new yorks three major airports and no room for more anyway the port authority of new york &amp new jersey which operates the airports has proposed several capacity enhancing steps such as installing new ground surveillance technology and constructing new taxiways to better manage takeoffs and landings it also purchased stewart international airport located miles north of new york city in hopes of turning it into a bigger regional hub that could take some pressure off the three big airports for now the faa has temporarily resorted to one of the least desirable solutions available curbing the number of flights at new yorks kennedy next year reducing flight options for consumers laura mandaro contributed to this article
