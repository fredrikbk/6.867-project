aegean marines plan for growth build ships aegean marine petroleum network inc has a simple plan to gain market share in the marine fuel supply industry build ships lots of ships the piraeus greece supplier of fuel to the shipping industry plans to nearly triple the size of its fleet to bunker oil tankers through as international regulations reduce the number of older tankers on the water it has already placed orders for new tankers while a world wide shipbuilding boom has filled shipyards to capacity delaying any of aegeans competitors from placing their own orders for the near future at the same time rising prices for marine fuel are nudging smaller undercapitalized fuel suppliers out of the market aegeans stock price has almost doubled since mid september to more than &# and a recent acquisition in the baltic sea as well as mondays deal to acquire a terminal on the english channel shows the company has expansion plans as one of the few suppliers with a world wide presence aegean appears poised for more growth many believe aegeans expansion plans hinge on the continued growth of the shipping industry which doesnt look to be slowing down "the primary reason for aegeans growth is that their volume of business should increase significantly " said douglas mavrinac an analyst with jefferies &amp co he noted that demand for marine fuel will rise to meet an expected increase in the size of the global shipping fleet aegean owns bunkering tankers and operates service centers in greece gibraltar fujairah on the gulf of oman jamaica and singapore and soon in portland harbor on the english channel aegeans competition comes mostly from regional suppliers working out of a few ports "the oil majors exited the industry because they were making so much money on the upstream exploration and production side that the downstream refining and marketing risk of having to deal with something so environmentally sensitive as a bunkering transfer or a ship to ship transfer where youre pushing oil over a gunwale is kind of risky " said aegean president nikolas tavlarios "so they said lets just contract this out to little barge operators " now the environmental hazards of bunker supply have led to international regulations calling for the removal of all single hull bunkering tankers from the world fleet mr tavlarios said implementation of the regulations will cut a current fleet of about ships down to a few hundred aegean has the dual advantage of a fleet comprised of double hull tankers and more on order to be delivered through and it has acquired two new ships through its recent purchase of belgium based marketer and supplier bunkers at sea nowhere will the new regulations leave aegean more room for expansion than in singapore the southeast asian port is the worlds largest with a bunker fuel market of million metric tons serviced by about ships only five of which are double hulled with most of the ports fleet unable to comply with international maritime organization regulations singapore initially isnt implementing the rules and will instead phase out aging single hull ships over a year period prohibit single hulled tankers more than years old and prohibit any new single hull tankers from entering the market aegean estimates the number of ships operating in singapore will drop to from by leaving plenty of market share for anyone with an expanding fleet of double hulled vessels "they are certainly in the right area and they have great growth prospects " said frank bisk equity analyst with new york based hedge fund pilot advisors lp an aegean shareholder "organically they have a plan set out through i certainly do think they could be a consolidator buying some of these other mom and pops especially in the future and after " aegean is positioned for growth according to jefferies mr mavrinac because of the ships it has on order which represent of the current orders for new double hulled bunkering tankers at shipyards around the world through new shipbuilding is the major choke point for players in the bunker fuel industry who need double hulled vessels with shipyards filled to capacity through the end of the decade according to industry analysts a company placing an order today would need to wait until at least to receive delivery kevin sterling an analyst with stephens inc points out that as construction activity continues to strengthen overcrowded shipyards could experience delays in vessel delivery delaying aegeans growth plans and throwing aegeans peak earnings further into the future but aegeans mr tavlarios doesnt see construction delays as a risk to the companys growth "there have been delays and weve announced them " said mr tavlarios but the delays "are in months and not years " and can still fit within aegeans growth strategy working capital is increasingly important to bunker suppliers as fuel prices have nearly doubled in the past year increasing the funds that operators need to maintain adequate ship and service center supplies "smaller companies that are privately held are in financial stress because in order to buy and sell bunker fuel the working capital they need is substantially increased " said robin shoemaker an analyst with bear stearns aegean has a strong balance sheet with little debt following its &# million initial public offering in december with cash and cash equivalents of &# million and a working capital surplus of &# million after aegean stocks recent gains stephenss mr sterling downgraded aegean to equal weight saying it was hard to recommend new money at current price levels mr shoemaker said the market is anticipating strong earnings growth "the companys progress has been on track " said mr shoemaker "its a company with a unique niche and the market took notice "
