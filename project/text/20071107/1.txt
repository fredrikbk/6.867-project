a deformed doughnut no chinas tv tower outlandish beijing structure nears key construction step beijing five years ago rem koolhaas and ole scheeren unveiled their radical design for the new china central television tower here to a disbelieving public even their client wasnt sure it could be built they say formed like a misshapen square doughnut the building is full of technical challenges with two towers leaning inward at sharp inclines that will be joined to form one continuous loop there were no building codes for this convoluted sort of structure which messrs koolhaas and scheeren conceived as a challenge to the notion that all skyscrapers should point skyward complicating matters beijing lies in an earthquake zone now the moment is fast approaching for a crucial part of the towers construction in a matter of weeks workers will construct the floors that will join the two leaning towers producing the buildings unusual shape the technical details are like something from a science fiction novel the joining must be performed at dawn thats because heat from the sun expands steel in different portions of the tower over the course of the day and such distortions must be avoided at all costs "if one tower is distorted it would be locked into the system and tax the whole system " says mr scheeren grasping a scale model of the cctv tower in his hands as if it were a giant rubiks cube ready to be solved the cctv tower is probably the most ambitious of an estimated new structures being built in beijing a symbol of why chinas capital is developing a reputation as the "wild east" in architectural circles mr scheeren for example says it would be unlikely that this structure could be built anywhere else in the world because the design would not be permitted by building codes elsewhere in china there was an openness to making things happen that "created an extraordinary context for architecture " says mr scheeren with the olympics in mind chinas authorities have been trying to transform beijing an ancient city crafted by rulers such as kublai khan into a modern metropolis theyre doing this through a collection of buildings that make statements including an olympic stadium shaped like a birds nest an egg shaped national theater and the bubble wrapped watercube where olympic swimming events will be held but the &# million cctv tower looms large in the public imagination both massive and controversial it is likely to become a symbol of chinas recent accomplishments the building will be the second largest office building in the world after the pentagon and a visible emblem of chinas state controlled media china central television the countrys only nationwide broadcaster the imminent joining essentially borrows from bridge building technology except that if the section were a bridge it would be an exceptionally large and cumbersome one it is a full stories high at some points and it includes a cantilevered overhang scheduled to be completed in february that will jut out almost feet into nothingness five years ago it would have been impossible to engineer the tower because high speed computational systems particularly for seismic analyses werent as sophisticated says andrew chan group deputy chairman of arup group ltd a global design and business consulting firm "we had to write the rulebook " he says rocco yim one of the judges at the design competition that eventually picked the square tower says he initially had great reservations about the "extremely irrational design " but he came to see it as representing "a certain spirit that is just what the new china is all about " says the hong kong based architect "irreverent a can do spirit fearless and extremely confident " to help make the cctv tower a reality mr scheeren took the unusual step of moving to china in to supervise things a role usually performed by local engineers and architects after the design stage but it was an important step for mr scheeren years old who wasnt yet a household name like his mentor mr koolhaas winner of the pritzker prize the highest honor in architectural circles the prada clad mr scheeren is best known for designing several award winning stores for the italian fashion brand and has never worked on a product of cctvs magnitude before beijings building codes had no provision for a building of this shape so municipal authorities formed a special panel of structural engineers especially for the cctv tower the building was approved in two years after the design competition for much of the team studied a three story high replica of the cctv tower that they had placed on a "shake table " which is a hydraulic platform that simulates earthquake tremors the platform was equipped with several hundred sensors to help builders monitor the movements of the more than steel beams in the tower and see which parts of the building would undergo the most stress under different conditions as a result the outer surface of cctv tower will be wrapped in a steel mesh resembling a diamond like net with the main structure of the building outside instead of inside pressures can "literally travel around the system and find the best load path into the ground " says mr scheeren parts of the mesh including the areas where the building has the most stress such as the corners are visibly denser and they have been incorporated into the buildings design in addition the building is covered with glass coated with a pattern made of gray baked on enamel providing more effective shade from the sun this "merges very well with the air quality of beijing " remarks mr scheeren in fact on days of high pollution in the capital the glass will appear to dissolve in the sky leaving only the net of the structure visible as though lightning had frozen in the sky critics argue that its impossible to separate the buildings form from its function housing one of the biggest propaganda units in the world cctv is both the biggest media company in the country and the official voice of the communist party it will also be the sole chinese broadcaster during next years olympics and as a result the image of the cctv tower will be beamed to millions of homes last year architecture critic inga saffron wrote that messrs koolhaas and scheeren may be remembered "as the ones who gave chinas tv monopoly the architectural equivalent of the bomb " ms saffron a fan of mr koolhaass work said in a phone interview that "the message from the design is very scary " referring to the cantilevered portion of cctv tower that hangs thousands of feet above the ground coupled with the gargantuan size of the overall site about the size of football fields the cctv tower will "always remind you of how small you are and how big the state " ms saffron said cctv towers builders say it is designed to withstand major earthquakes without collapsing northern chinas biggest earthquake in recent years happened in tangshan city more than miles from beijing the earthquake measured on the richter scale and killed more than people to make space for the main square tower and an adjoining boot shaped tower hundreds of beijing residents in the area were forcibly evicted and they say offered inadequate compensation retired teacher qiu guizhi was distraught when she returned home from a trip to find herself evicted she was so desperate and angry she says that she climbed up to the roof of the building and tried to jump she was stopped by the police and held in detention for days she says she still hasnt received a penny of her promised &# in compensation mr scheeren has been kept busy defending his creation a few months ago he spoke as part of a panel organized by the berlin academy of fine arts on the topic of architects who design for autocratic regimes "historically architects have built for those in power " he said "how else are great buildings made or paid for " later in an email mr scheeren clarified his statements saying "historically much of large scale architecture has been produced for governments or powerful organizations and this dependency conflict will remain a complex issue for architecture generally " he has also said that his architecture firm received many indications including explicit statements that cctv was interested in becoming more liberal and independent and was seeking a building that would facilitate these changes the design of the building creates more openness he argues for example the highest floors in the overhang wont be reserved for cctvs top management and instead will include public spaces such as a canteen the building will have three major canteens that can feed people at a time there will also be a public viewing deck with glass floors so that visitors can see the vertigo inducing overhang as well as corridors where they can peer into offices and television studios the buildings loop "expresses a unity of a production process of what a media company can be it isnt promoting isolationism but connectivity " mr scheeren says sue feng contributed to this article
