mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q in your review of apple tv last week you said it wouldnt work on a standard non widescreen tv but i have seen reports that it does work on these sets how is that possible a what we wrote was that it was designed for newer widescreen sets especially high definition sets and wouldnt work on older square type sets "unless they can display widescreen formatted content and accept some newer types of cables " some older tvs can do this but many cannot the sets must have connections called component or hdmi which many older sets lack especially lower priced ones even if they can display widescreen content i have also heard reports that you can use apple tv on older sets that cannot handle widescreen content but my guess is that on these sets the menus and user interface are distorted q i have just bought a new dell vista computer none of my backup software now works does smartsync pro work with vista do you have any suggestions a smartsync pro a program i have recommended in the past regularly crashes on my own vista desktop though its maker smartsync software claims most features do work on vista the company says it is working on a new vista version in general this is a major problem with adopting vista it is amazing to me that so many hardware and software vendors still havent issued vista compatible versions or drivers one suggestion might be to try the internal backup and restore function in vista which microsoft claims is improved over what was available in windows xp i havent tested it but more information is at http www microsoft com windows products windowsvista features details backup mspx q in your apple tv review you said the xbox costs more but arent they priced the same at &# a i said the "comparable" xbox model was more than apple tv and in making that calculation i was being kind to the xbox the base &# "core" model of the xbox has no hard disk so to be comparable to apple tv which does you would need the high end xbox which costs &# and includes a hard disk but even this high end xbox doesnt have wi fi wireless networking which is built into apple tv and is needed to stream pc based content to tvs in the many many homes that lack wired networks to get wi fi on an xbox you must spend &# for an optional adapter which brings the cost to &# but i assumed a user might be able to find a wireless adapter for &# so i rounded the price down to &# which is slightly greater than a premium over the apple tv even with that premium the xbox offers slower wireless speeds and a hard disk only half as large next month a new xbox model is expected to be available that will have a gigabyte hard disk triple the size of the apple tvs disk it is likely to cost &# but still wont include wireless networking as i noted in the column the xbox can do some media tasks the apple tv cant do and of course it is also a full blown game console unlike the apple tv that may make the xboxs higher price well worth it for some
