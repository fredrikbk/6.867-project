american air to hasten orders for boeing jets american airlines efforts to secure new planes underscores the balancing act airlines face as the aerospace industry rushes to assuage growing appetite for jetliners the amr corp unit said it will accelerate the delivery of new single aisle jetliners from boeing co so it can begin replacing md s american will receive the first three planes in early seven years ahead of schedule with the remainder likely to come in instead of the jetliners carry an average list price of about &# million each though big customers like american get discounts financial terms werent disclosed once it takes delivery of those planes the fort worth texas carrier has rights to acquire additional s from boeing with as little as months notice but those rights were agreed to under a contract when the operating environment was different raising questions now about how boeing might accommodate additional demands boeing spokesman randy harrison declined to comment specifically on how the company would handle this but he said that "boeing looks forward to supplying american with the airplanes they request in keeping with the longstanding agreement " he noted that scott carson head of boeings commercial airplanes unit said recently that there is always the option of horse trading on various airlines delivery slots americans growth efforts will depend on a host of factors from the aerospace industrys ability to supply new planes to continuing improvements in airliner technology chicago based boeing for example has said that without a major jump in production rates its order book is largely sold out until american also must strike the right balance between adding current generation boeing s and next generation aircraft which would be even more cost efficient but likely not available until an airline with too many of the older planes could be at a competitive disadvantage american is already at a disadvantage on its unit labor costs which are among the highest of any u s airline "we have flexibility in terms of fleet planning " said american airlines spokesman andy backover who added american remains conservative about its slowed growth rate "were trying to strike the right balance between reinvestment in the business and continued financial performance " in americans case time is of the essence the carrier has one of the oldest fleets among u s airlines now eager for new planes after a five year economic slump like american many carriers deferred aircraft deliveries during the industrys downturn as they struggled to regain solid financial footing with the industrys return to profitability last year many carriers are moving toward either speeding delivery of existing orders or placing new ones or both the demands could require some maneuvering by airlines and aircraft manufacturers if airlines flood the market with requests quickly boosting production in the face of high demand could be difficult boeing for example faced significant problems in the s when it ramped up production too quickly to meet a surge in demand suppliers were unable to make parts fast enough the boeing s american is expecting burn less fuel per mile than the md s which account for nearly half of americans mainline fleet and average years of age the newer planes also require less maintenance "we believe that beginning to replace some of our md s in a measured way makes economic sense and represents prudent and strategic reinvestments in our business that will bring long term benefits " said gerard arpey the chief executive of american and its amr parent american the nations largest airline in terms of passenger traffic wont speculate on when and if it would place additional aircraft orders beyond the accelerated deliveries j lynn lunsford contributed to this article
