bernanke notes risks but holds to outlook fed chief sees more factors that could slow growth added subprime attention washington federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said risks to the economy have grown especially from soft business investment and weakening housing but with inflation still too high the fed is comfortable with keeping interest rates steady for now a week after the fed surprised markets by signaling it is less inclined to raise rates mr bernanke suggested in testimony before the joint economic committee of congress yesterday that while his forecast for the economy has changed little he sees more risks that could cause growth to fall short of that forecast however with inflation creeping higher recently he said rising prices remain the main factor in driving the feds interest rate decisions much as they have since last summer addressing the problems in the market for subprime mortgages or those made to buyers with low incomes or poor credit history mr bernanke said he would review the feds powers to tighten standards around such lending but he cautioned that doing so might encourage more private lawsuits against lenders that result in their pulling back impairing the supply of credit in any case he said tougher standards might make little difference without more enforcement in a statement after its weekly policy meeting last week the fed dropped the explicit reference to possible "additional firming" that is higher interest rates and replaced it with the more neutral "future policy adjustments " the "additional firming" phrase had been in the statement since last june mr bernanke said the main reason for the change wasnt to signal lower rates but to get more flexibility for the fed to change rates as it sees fit "were looking for a bit more flexibility given the uncertainties that we are facing and the risks that are occurring on both sides of our outlook " that is lower growth and higher inflation he said another motive was to step away from the practice of giving explicit guidance on the direction of interest rates mr bernanke said as a fed governor he had strongly supported the fed providing such guidance when it first started to do so in but many other fed officials have continually objected to the practice "the incoming data have supported the view that the current stance of monetary policy is likely to foster sustainable economic growth and a gradual ebbing in core inflation " mr bernanke said strongly suggesting interest rates are on hold for now but he said recent inflation readings have been "elevated" and he repeated almost verbatim his comments from february that the scarcity of skilled workers and accelerating labor costs pose a risk to inflation he added that inflation was likely to moderate "over time " while inflation remains the feds predominant concern mr bernanke said "uncertainties around the outlook have increased somewhat in recent weeks " he detailed two main risks a decline in housing construction is a drag on growth he said but added that this risk should lift later this year once builders work off high inventories of unsold homes so far reductions in housing starts "have not yet led to meaningful reductions in the inventory of homes for sale " he said and the recent surge in defaults on subprime mortgages and dramatic tightening in lending standards for such loans "raise some additional questions " as many fed officials have said in recent months mr bernanke said the impact of subprime problems on the broader economy "seems likely to be contained " but by devoting almost a full page of his seven pages of prepared remarks to the subject yesterday compared with one sentence in his congressional testimony last month he indicated the mortgage market has become an important factor in the feds outlook the other risk mr bernanke sees to the economy is business capital equipment spending which fell in the fourth quarter of last year a trend that appears likely to continue in the current quarter yesterday the commerce department reported a drop in orders for capital goods excluding aircraft and defense orders in february from january while some investment pullback was likely given the slowing in the overall economy "the magnitude of the slowdown has been somewhat greater than would be expected given the normal evolution of the business cycle " mr bernanke said but he predicted that business investment would grow moderately this year thanks to high profitability strong balance sheets and low corporate borrowing costs mr bernanke played down the odds of recession in an implicit challenge to the recent comments of former fed chairman alan greenspan noting that the economic expansion was aging mr greenspan had put the odds of recession at one in three "there seems to be a sense that expansions die of old age " mr bernanke said "i dont think the evidence really supports that "
