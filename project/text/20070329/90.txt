risk taking shell ceo stays in race with unusual strategies big investments in staff van der veer battles rivals london when jeroen van der veer a low key chemicals executive and marathon ice skater took the top job at royal dutch shell plc in industry watchers wondered how long it would be before the dutchman took a tumble at the scandal tarred energy titan three years later hes not only still in the race but hes also starting to outpace bp plc his biggest european rival since taking over shell amid a scandal over how it accounted for its energy reserves mr van der veer has ridden the oil price boom to higher profit at the same time though high costs and diminished access to fresh reserves have been squeezing big oil so he has pushed a bunch of large but risky development projects in the long oil patch rivalry between european giants shell and bp mr van der veers company is back on top shells shares outperformed bps last year as bp floundered from a series of operational blunders and scandals in the u s including a handful of safety probes stemming from a refinery blast and pipeline problems in alaska for the first time in years shells market capitalization is bigger than bps at &# billion to &# billion among non state controlled oil companies only exxon mobil corp is larger yesterday shells board extended mr van der veers contract to a vote of confidence in his performance it hasnt been easy skating shortly after taking the helm mr van der veer abolished shells century old dual dutch and british board structure a move that streamlined decision making and accountability the company is still something of a sprawl based in the hague but with its primary stock market listing in london then late last year the russian government grabbed away shells majority stake in a crucial project and both shell and bp have underperformed exxon disappointing investors recently with reduced short term production estimates after concentrating power in the companys first modern chief executive role mr van der veer started outspending competitors by pumping cash into a series of gigantic "nonconventional" energy projects shell hoped these long life projects would refresh its tired portfolio of traditional oil development deals shell is diving in deeper than many other companies and expects that of its oil and natural gas production will be from nonconventional sources by up from today mr van der veer has also had to beef up the companys research and development staff like most oil companies shell underinvested and shed staff during the low oil price days of the s mr van der veer went on a hiring spree to staff his big projects in an industry starved for talent shell says it hired midcareer professionals last year he has appointed shells first chief technology officer and seven "chief scientists " as well as an executive to spearhead research into carbon reduction "we put technology technology development and research on the map " mr van der veer years old said in an interview at shells london offices across the river thames from westminster palace "i think its absolutely key to our future " big bets include a &# billion oil and liquefied natural gas project on the island of sakhalin in russias far east and an &# billion gas field development and natural gas to diesel plant in qatar "in order to grow our business and be strong and be profitable we have to do things that others cant do " mr van der veer said "boiled down when it comes to unconventionals it is still possible to make good returns " after three years of skepticism some analysts are buying in shells nonconventional projects should kick in meaningful production growth after pushing shell ahead of bps mostly conventional plays in the long term according to neil mcmahon a london based analyst at sanford c bernstein mr van der veer also has outflanked bps deal making ceo john browne at the negotiating table in libya shell signed an agreement in with the countrys leader col moammar gadhafi to explore for gas and refurbish a crumbling lng plant there meanwhile lord browne has been mired in talks over bps gas ambitions there and libyan officials have publicly criticized bps tactics a spokesman for bp said the company isnt disappointed with its efforts there "we expected these negotiations to take some time and they have " he said recent successes look all the more impressive given the state of shell when mr van der veer took over early in shell surprised investors by disclosing it had massively overstated its energy reserves the measure of oil and gas a company says it has in the ground and a key metric investors use to gauge a companys growth prospects shells stock fell sharply after the disclosure which triggered a series of regulatory probes and a steep fine from the u s securities and exchange commission in the aftermath directors ousted shells top executive chairman philip watts and installed mr van der veer a mechanical engineer and economist by training mr van der veer worked his way up through shells low profile refining and chemical businesses international investors werent enthused initially by the lanky dutchman who spoke thickly accented english "at first i thought you need a dynamic leader to get the company going " says bernsteins mr mcmahon who has a neutral rating on both shell and bp "but given their aim the long term rejuvenation of their portfolio maybe mr van der veer is exactly what you need " mr van der veer joined shell in at the age of in many meetings he wears shell emblazoned ties and cuff links he is a long distance ice skater twice completing a famous kilometer race through cities in the netherlands he made his name running a huge dutch refinery where he navigated labor problems and executed an expansion inside shell he is "regarded as a straight talker " says mark moody stuart a former shell chairman and now chairman of mining giant anglo american plc "thoughtful but tough " sir mark says mr van der veers nonconventional strategy is a gamble oil prices appear supported at about &# a barrel but a fall to &# a barrel could shatter the economics of those deals shell says it can lock in long term contracts for much of the output hedging its bet mr van der veer has had setbacks costs for shells biggest nonconventional projects have soared in nigeria a big chunk of its huge oil production volume remains shut down by fighting in the niger delta late last year russian president vladimir putin extracted control of shells sakhalin project and brought in state controlled oao gazprom as the majority partner dimming shells output and reserves prospects mr van der veer says not all the details of the new shareholding agreement have been worked out and he says shell is fortunate now to have a "very strong russian partner " but he limits the positive spin he is putting on the episode asked if shell is happy with its situation he says only "it is early days " bhushan
