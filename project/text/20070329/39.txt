ethanol creates a pricing puzzle for corn farmers boom complicates bets on planting contracts straddling two markets belmond iowa one foggy morning last week farmer dave nelson pulled his wheel truck up to a grain elevator near here and with a scowl on his rugged bearded face delivered bushels of last falls corn crop he was grimacing because demand for corn to make ethanol has pushed the grains price to just under &# a bushel but mr nelson had agreed about a year ago to sell his crop for &# a bushel "it seemed like a good price at the time " he says but this year "im not dinking around " across the plains farmers are placing big bets on where the price of corn will go in they are preparing to plant more corn than they have in decades spending more on seed and fertilizer investing in new equipment and buying crop insurance against the possibility of bad weather some are signing futures contracts to lock in prices now some are holding off in the hope that prices will climb higher mr nelson is doing a little of both the planning is an annual rite of spring but this year it has huge implications for farmers in a market driven by a boom in ethanol the corn based biofuel that has surged in popularity partly because of rising gasoline prices and partly because president bush declared that the u s is addicted to oil plant too much corn and you could help depress prices plant too little and you could miss a windfall buy too much insurance the price of which is also rising and risk shrinking your profit margin buy too little and risk taking a hit if there is a soggy spring or a summer drought with corn prices at near record levels it would be tough for growers to lose but they could easily fail to take advantage of what could be a once in a lifetime opportunity and for the growing number of farmers who have also invested in ethanol production like mr nelson the calculus is even more complex as they aim for a corn price that maximizes profits for both businesses early estimates are that farmers will plant million acres of corn up from million last year that would put acreage at its most since the end of world war ii along with growers hedge funds and other speculators are watching for tomorrows u s department of agriculture estimate of this years corn plantings at marvs market street grill &amp bar in gowrie iowa near belmond farmers are treating the report like college basketballs march madness over hamburgers with some farmers seed salesman dave lemke tosses out different estimates for how large the crop will be "i think well see corn and soybeans " he says "last year it was corn and soybeans " down the street at security savings bank corn grower vance bauer and bank president steven lane debate what might happen "i wish i knew " mr bauer sighs the year old farmer has decided against increasing his corn acreage "i dont want to get caught up in the euphoria " he says lest it backfire and push prices down mr bauer also owns a small stake in an ethanol plant though which stands to benefit if corn prices fall the game is even more complicated for mr nelson years old who in addition to being a lifelong farmer is chairman of global ethanol llc which runs ethanol plants in iowa and michigan as mr nelson was delivering that load of corn last week his cellphone rang someone wanted to discuss a contract related to a new ethanol plant mr nelson hopes to build in belmond "its planting season now " he snapped "the contract has to wait till june " mr nelson first climbed on a tractor on his fathers farm near belmond when he was and started farming full time at looking for ways to add value to his grain mr nelson in the late s began investigating ethanol he decided it had potential after seeing early plants turn profits in south dakota and minnesota he helped form midwest grain processors cooperative and crisscrossed the region raising money at meetings in bars church basements and community halls by the co op had built a million gallon a year ethanol plant in lakota iowa doubling its capacity three years later the co op later joined with a michigan company great lakes ethanol to build a plant near riga mich last year midwest grain sold a interest to global ethanol an australian company mr nelson handled the negotiations and now oversees the companys two plants instead of spending every day in jeans on his acre farm he is donning business suits and traveling to attend board meetings woo investors and lobby washington lawmakers its all "quite exciting " he says but "by the end of march im ready to be home in time to get ready to plant " as a corn grower he wants to fetch the highest possible price but as an ethanol producer he knows high corn prices can trim his profit margins so like a lot of farmers who have invested in ethanol he is straddling both markets trying to make as much money as possible in each ethanol mr nelson says is the "perfect hedge " when he was marketing his grain last spring he had no idea corn would shoot to &# he says but that is just part of being a farmer he adds "theres always another bushel to raise or another bushel to sell you cant get attached to your corn " this year mr nelson has decided to plant corn and soybeans up from corn last year though he has yet to plant a seed he already has sold half of his corn crop bushels at about &# a bushel through cash contracts with local grain elevators and feed mills because he worried that tomorrows usda report could indicate a corn glut and drive prices down as much as a dollar but he has held back the rest of his crop in case prices jump higher at the same time mr nelson is juggling corn growing costs that have risen to about &# an acre not including land up from about &# three years ago he says that is partly because his nitrogen fertilizer costs have doubled to about &# a ton from a few years ago he plans to stick with part old fashioned chicken manure and part chemical fertilizers with prices so volatile crop insurance is more important than ever a drought probably would further inflate corn prices by cutting the supply but farmers whose crops were damaged wouldnt have corn to sell they would still have to deliver grain to meet their contracts though meaning they would have to buy it themselves on the cash market as prices were rising then sell it at the lower price they agreed to insurance can mitigate that risk but premiums have risen sharply in the past year as higher prices have made the crop more valuable this year mr nelson is spending about &# an acre on insurance up from &# last year and insuring fewer acres all the higher costs are why some farmers are taking a more cautious approach "i know these are high corn prices " mr bauer says "but maybe theyre not that good if inputs go up " tomorrow morning mr nelson plans to rise at the usual a m grab a cup of coffee and watch the usda report unfold on a computer in an equipment shed on his farm while he says he is "pretty much set" on his plan for this planting season a lifetime of coaxing crops from the ground has taught mr nelson there is no end to the uncertainty "we have four months of weather to deal with after that " corrections &amp amplifications according to the u s department of agriculture u s corn production in was billion bushels a graphic that accompanied yesterdays page one article about how ethanol production influences corn farmers planting strategies incorrectly labeled corn production figures in millions of bushels instead of billions wsj march
