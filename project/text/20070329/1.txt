abcs silent expert how does "world news with charles gibson" do it for the fifth time in seven weeks the abc newscast last week drew the biggest audience on average million of the three network evening news shows marveling at the newscasts ascendancy after two years of turmoil in abcs anchor ranks media observers tend to dwell on the unexpected old shoe appeal of mr gibson but there may be another explanation facing up to the reality that alas many folks these days like to get their news from "the daily show with jon stewart " abc news has added comedy to the mix how else to explain those hilarious skits when chief washington correspondent george stephanopoulos reports on the brouhaha over the justice departments firing of eight u s attorneys while the proverbial elephant in the room is lurking just off camera mr stephanopoulos doesnt mention his own valuable expertise on the subject of fired federal prosecutors the kind of expertise that might help place the current mess in context mr stephanopoulos was the clinton white house communications director in when the justice department cleaned its slate of all u s attorneys and he was central to the administrations finessing of the episode just the sort of insider experience presumably that prompted abc news to hire mr stephanopoulos fresh out of the white house in and yet even when mr gibson and mr stephanopoulos engage in the sort of exploratory anchor reporter chit chat that is a staple of network news nowadays somehow the two manage not to crack up as they rake over the latest sinister developments in the fired prosecutors "scandal" without acknowledging that one of the newsmen knows a good bit more than he lets on about how these things work mr stephanopoulos remains just as sober when working solo on sunday mornings as the host of "this week" or helping out on "good morning america " there hasnt been this much stone faced comedy in circulation since buster keatons heyday its a pity because mr stephanopoulos might be able to help viewers understand why the firing of eight u s attorneys in the bush administration has been by far the biggest television news story lately and yet when dozens of federal prosecutors were fired during the clinton administration it was barely noticed by network newscasts according to the tyndall report which tracks this sort of thing during the week of march the three network evening newscasts spent a total of minutes on the prosecutors story with the war in iraq placing second at minutes "world news with charles gibson" logged of those minutes on the prosecutors by contrast in attorney general janet renos wholesale firing of u s attorneys appointed by george h w bush was a non story on the abc evening news literally a non story according to records kept by the vanderbilt university television news archive as in zero coverage cbs also skipped it nbc gave it seconds at the risk of putting a damper on all the fun heres a primer on the sort of white house experience that abcs chief washington correspondent could draw on to enlighten viewers first of all misleading messages from a hapless attorney general can be corrected janet reno had only been on the job for a matter of days when she announced the blanket dismissal of u s attorneys in march and she bungled the job letting word get out that prosecutors involved in significant investigations would be allowed to complete them as was noted at the time this would have meant that an ongoing investigation of the powerful house democrat and vital clinton ally dan rostenkowski by the u s attorney for the district of columbia jay stephens would continue uninterrupted the white house or rather mr stephanopoulos quickly torpedoed that idea in a press briefing he announced that among the prosecutors whose resignations had been demanded "there are at least some people who are in the middle of trials right now who will not be replaced " trials he specified not investigations "interestingly " a hartford courant editorial noted back then "miss reno didnt explain the impending dismissals the presidents personal spokesman george stephanopoulos did the fast talking " lesson number two when the white house comes under suspicion of politicizing the process of replacing federal prosecutors dont deny it in when a reporter asked mr stephanopoulos about the origins of ms renos decision to jettison all the u s attorneys the exchange went like this mr stephanopoulos i assume she was in discussions with the white house counsel but it is her decision q can you tell us whether the white house counsel may have suggested the idea mr stephanopoulos i dont know if he specifically suggested it but i am certain that he was consulted q would it be fair then to say that after consultations with the white house she decided to do this mr stephanopoulos it would be fair to say that she consulted with the white house before making the announcement q and the white house approved q the decision or the announcement mr stephanopoulos the white house did not disagree q i want to thank you for your persistence laughter finally keep an eye on the aftermath jay stephens put his u s attorney job behind him and was soon hired by the resolution trust corp an independent regulatory agency to investigate claims stemming from the collapse of madison guaranty savings &amp loan for those who have filed away their memories of the clintons arkansas years madison guaranty was connected to the rose law firm hillary clintons former employer and the firm would be an area of interest for any investigator then in february according to the dallas morning news the rtc got an irate conference call from harold ickes the white house deputy chief of staff and george stephanopoulos by then president clintons senior advisor to protest the hiring amid reports that they tried to have mr stephens fired it would have been his second pink slip in less than a year the white house issued a statement that mr ickes and mr stephanopoulos had "no recollection" of making such a request mr stephanopoulos long ago changed jobs too but plenty of members of congress remain right where they were in and that may be the only lesson we need regarding the nature of the fired prosecutors "scandal" then as now democrats control both houses but in they have a republican administration to make miserable mr lasswell is deputy books editor at the wall street journal
