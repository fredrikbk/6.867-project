why private colleges are surging in india noida india indias continued economic success depends in part on whats happening in this city on the outskirts of new delhi where construction workers lay brick for new science buildings libraries and dormitories for the rapidly expanding amity international school amity is part of a wave of private universities in india the most high profile backed by the nations business moguls that are sprouting up to meet the exploding demand for skilled workers while the private universities are adding much needed capacity they are also raising questions about the quality of their degrees and the motives of some wealthy backers amity one of the fastest growing private universities in india started as a small management college about years ago funded by ashok chauhan whose akc group of companies made a fortune in plastic products and herbal medical products now with students at two university campuses near new delhi plus various grade schools and high schools the school is adding new dormitory rooms and about a million square feet of buildings in the next year amity plans to expand throughout india says the schools chancellor atul chauhan the year old son of the founder "the number of good students applying to top universities who dont get in is huge " he says "why should they lose out they should have opportunities " the need to expand those opportunities has attracted interest from u s universities this week the heads of several schools are in india meeting with government leaders ahead of an expected vote next month in indias parliament on a law that would allow foreign universities to set up branches in india but with extensive restrictions among u s universities considering expanding to india is the georgia institute of technology which according to spokeswoman lisa govenstein is "investigating the possibility of establishing a presence in india most likely in partnership with a local indian university that could offer joint degrees " thanks to the wealthy backers some of indias young private colleges have impressive infrastructure including elaborate science labs and well outfitted dormitories "the more private institutions that come up the more options we have " says sankaranarayanan padmanabhan global head of human resources for tata consultancy services ltd indias biggest outsourcing company by revenue however indias nationwide accreditation system is only about a decade old and the process is voluntary in most states so there is little incentive for universities to acquire it because so few institutions have accreditation tcs and other big employers have developed their own systems for measuring the caliber of the schools public and private the new institutions raise difficult issues "the government is not very comfortable with the growth of the private sector " says pawan agarwal a former government official in the higher education field and now a scholar at the indian council for research on international economic relations the governments concern is that some of the new colleges and universities may be taking advantage of the rising middle class prospective students have few independent sources for assessing quality in contrast to the u s where a student can look at not only accreditation but also independent rankings by magazines and newspapers another concern is that indias private universities which by law must be nonprofit are blurring the lines between philanthropy and business mr agarwal says while students at even the top publicly funded schools pay less than &# a year in tuition the private institutions charge two to three times that amount going as high as &# "the concern is that the private colleges are exploitative they create the impression of high quality and ask for high fees " mr agarwal says nevertheless the indian government is gradually allowing more private institutions for decades the country relied mainly on publicly funded institutions such as delhi university and the highly competitive indian institutes of technology and indian institutes of management for higher education but a lack of university capacity has led to india having a lower proportion of youth ages to enrolled in higher education than china the philippines and malaysia the national university grants commission sets rules and criteria for the new institutions and states are responsible for ensuring they are enforced the private engineering college started by one of indias original technology tycoons shiv nadar near the high tech hub of chennai earned a high mark from tata consultancy services sri sivasubramaniya nadar college of engineering named after mr nadars father was approved in by the national board of accreditation its seeking a university status that would allow ssn to grant degrees in its own name now the school is affiliated with the nearby anna university formed in from the merger of several public and private colleges which designs the programs and grants degrees to ssn students over the last decade mr nadar has poured about &# million into ssn to build facilities and fund scholarships according to kala vijayakumar ssns president ssns school of advance software engineering offers a graduate program that sends select students to study in the u s at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh jayalakshimi the daughter of a picture framer almost didnt go to college because banks refused to lend to her low income family then she received a full scholarship to ssn and most recently an offer to work for hcl technologies ltd after graduation this may as a software engineer the year old will earn a salary seven times higher than what her father makes framing pictures says jayalakshimi who goes by one name "i really must thank mr nadar " anil agarwal the billionaire founder of mining firm vedanta resources plc last summer pledged &# billion to start a mega university with students in the state of orissa mr agarwal himself never went to college rising from his start as a metal trader "a huge amount of students cant go outside of india " he says "this is a university that can look after them " but some government officials question mr agarwals motives noting that his mining firm is seeking deals for mineral rights and mining operations in the orissa state they suspect the university is a veiled attempt to win support another issue is funding as some of the &# billion personally pledged by mr agarwal is tied up in company stock and dedicated to his family foundation mr agarwal says there is a "chinese wall" between the university project and his company "we dont want anything free " he says he expects other donors to contribute to the university as the project proceeds amity has had trouble with government regulations the school was in danger of having to shut down after indias supreme court struck down the law under which it had received its accreditation from the state of chhattisgarh the court felt the law was too lax allowing many of or so private schools opened under the chhattisgarh law to function as diploma mills amity which has headquarters in the state was caught up in the legal tangle even though the school was established long before the law was passed special legislation was put through in the state of uttar pradesh where amitys largest campuses are located to keep it operating the university faces another problem now this time a regional official says the management program with students isnt up to standard amity has challenged the ruling and chancellor atul chauhan says hes confidant it will be overturned however such incidents are having a palpable effect on public perceptions and recruitment "the degree doesnt hold value if the university is devalued as an institution " says kanika anand who chose to attend miranda womens college at delhi university instead of amity though amity offered her scholarship options "i didnt think that university is worth going to " mr chauhan says the hiccups are normal he looks up to universities such as stanford and harvard and sees the u s ivy league as a model for private universities in india "this whole concept of private education is a revolution that is happening " he says binny sabharwal contributed to this article
