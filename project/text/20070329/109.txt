unsafe deposit in iraq an army officer battles to open a bank military shifts fight to local politics gunfire outside hall baghdad iraq for lt col dale kuehl one of the keys to bringing some semblance of order to the restive area that his troops patrol has been a small squat bank branch last july about two dozen men wearing iraqi police commando uniforms and driving police trucks stormed the bank branch in the once wealthy baghdad neighborhood of ameriyah they shoved a rifle into the back of the bank manager a small year old woman then they began dumping the &# from the banks vault into a police body bag the following day iraqs ministry of finance closed the bank saying it was unsafe neighborhood bank branches which pay government pensions are a critical economic lifeline in iraq since the robbery col kuehl who commands an soldier battalion has spent &# to install new metal gates bulletproof glass teller windows security cameras and a new vault the bank remains closed col kuehls battle in ameriyah shows how hard won even the smallest victories like opening a bank branch can be in iraq its also a window into how completely iraq has changed the way senior u s commanders think about warfare they increasingly see their fight as one that includes tasks usually left to politicians or diplomats such as cajoling the shiite dominated government to extend basic services to sunni areas where they have been withheld commanders like col kuehl must try to reassure locals even as nonstop violence and sectarian killings explode around them for decades the u s military has defined warfare as separate from politics when politics failed war was necessary and the military took the lead the attitude was one of the after effects of the vietnam war in which the army told itself that it had lost because politicians prevented the generals from fighting the war they longed to fight "after vietnam we redefined officers as nothing but warrior trainers " focused on teaching soldiers how to operate increasingly sophisticated weapons systems says lt col doug ollivant an army strategist in baghdad who has helped shape the current surge strategy "we had a very restricted view of warfare " in ameriyah today col kuehl years old says his battle is closer to armed politics than all out war "i need to convince the locals to have more faith in the government than the extremists " he says before the iraq invasion col kuehls sector in ameriyah was home to iraqs elite its population consisted of doctors high level baathists and senior army officers as sectarian violence has risen many of its residents have fled to jordan and syria poorer sunnis driven from their neighborhoods by shiite militias have streamed into the area squatting in abandoned houses residents now get only a few hours of electricity a day trash and the occasional dead body litter ameriyahs roads u s military officials say the lack of services in ameriyah reflects a broader effort on the part of elements of the shiite dominated national government in baghdad to starve sunni neighborhoods for resources in february u s military officials overseeing western baghdad compiled a classified briefing showing that in sunni areas the vast majority of health clinics gas stations food ration and propane distribution sites had been shuttered or fallen into disrepair in contrast similar facilities are largely up and running in shiite areas "it is very difficult to get the ministries to provide basic services in the sunni neighborhoods people arent getting what they need " says col kuehl one senior u s military official in baghdad says some elements of the iraqi government appear to be pursuing a "strategy of exhaustion" in the sunni areas iraqi officials counter that the sunni areas where the insurgency has gained the strongest foothold lack services because they are less secure in ameriyah the bank has been central to col kuehls effort to convince sunnis they have a future in iraq ameriyah leaders who work closely with u s forces are often targeted by sunni insurgents so u s officials had to approach the bank manager cautiously the manager a petite mother of three who wears big gold framed glasses that dangle from a plastic chain had worked at the ameriyah bank for years she took the top job when her former boss a baathist was fired in because she has been threatened she asked that her name not be used "my husband says i am too ambitious and too stubborn " she says last summer after she had the rifle shoved into her back during the robbery she began to meet secretly with maj john maguire who oversees reconstruction projects in ameriyah they worked on a plan to reopen the bank maj maguire spent five years as an armor officer riding in tanks before leaving the army in after that he worked for goldman sachs as a compliance officer before he was involuntarily recalled to active duty last year he got only six weeks of training on how to do reconstruction in a war zone before landing in baghdad "mostly i have had to learn on the job " he says maj maguire says he did internet searches to figure out what the bank needed over the course of a month he worked with local contractors to install steel doors at the banks entrance reinforce the vault and place security cameras throughout the facility he and the bank manager replaced the three shiite security guards who were watching the bank when it was robbed with local men who were chosen by ameriyahs sheiks in early december the bank opened about three weeks later as u s military and bank officials were planning for the first shipment of about &# million to pay pensions the iraqi government ordered the bank closed again "we were two days from receiving the money " says the bank manager the senior iraqi government representative for the area of western baghdad that includes ameriyah says the bank was shut because the area was too unstable and the security guards hadnt been vetted with the ministry of interior he asked that his name be withheld for his safety a few hours after the bank was closed the manager called maj maguire irate "how could you invest all that money into the bank and just let them close it " she says she asked "i didnt know what to say " maj maguire says "she is risking her life to get the bank open " the following week col kuehl lobbied his superiors for help in an email "what everyone needs to understand is that most of the locals believe that the government of iraq is deliberately trying to undermine development in the sunni areas " he wrote if the bank isnt opened quickly he warned local opinion of the iraqi government "will decline even further than it has " at first col kuehl and maj maguire assumed someone at the u s embassy would intervene and the iraqis would open the facility "i figured it would be about days " maj maguire says "it is frustrating i didnt understand why we dont have the influence to make it happen " col kuehl who grew up in huntsville ala and graduated from the u s military academy at west point is often stymied by the pace of change hes seen in his five months in iraq fellow officers have found him standing before a white board in his small plywood walled office at a m scribbling out new ideas "standing in front of the white board is where i do my thinking " he says being mired in local politics not just warfare col kuehl is forced into almost impossible community relations work as he tries to bring stability to this violent neighborhood earlier this month local sunnis complained to col kuehl that iraqi army forces in ameriyah went on a rampage after two insurgents fired rocket propelled grenades at them the iraqi troops let loose a torrent of fire killing the insurgents and in the process wounding an old man and woman according to locals then the locals say the soldiers executed a year old boy in his front yard and ransacked several stores in the area col kuehl arranged a meeting with local sunni leaders the victims and the iraqi army battalion commander in the area at first he doubted the story the iraqi commander col achmed was considered one of the best iraqi leaders in the area by u s officials and he was one of the few sunni leaders in the iraqi army "the terrorists are playing a new game " col achmed fumed before the meeting because his family has been threatened he asked that his first name not be used "it is a war of words they are trying to dissolve the trust between our two armies " col kuehl tried to calm him down "weve got someone trying to stir people up in ameriyah " he said as col kuehl and the iraqi army commander rolled up to the meeting in ameriyahs main government building a roadside bomb exploded at the front gate damaging an iraqi vehicle "keep your heads on a swivel " col kuehl told his troops as they filed into the building inside the hall about men sat on chairs along the wall the man who said his year old son had been executed by iraqi troops thrust a passport photo of his son in col kuehls face "baby " he said and then began sobbing he tore open a plastic bag full of hundreds of spent shell casings and dumped it at the feet of col kuehl and his iraqi counterpart as the brass casings clanged on the floor the man buried his face in his hands a second man who said his brother had been killed by a stray bullet fired from a police checkpoint thrust the spent round he said had killed him at col kuehl who took it and turned it over gingerly in his hands outside the meeting hall iraqi troops and an insurgent sniper began to exchange fire first the sniper shot at the iraqi and u s troops guarding the entrance to the building then iraqi soldiers unloaded with their heavy machine guns into an empty building for the next minutes the pattern continued the sniper fired a couple of shots the iraqi troops responded with a steady blast of heavy machine gun fire u s troops who couldnt determine where the sniper was shooting from said the iraqis were firing aimlessly "why are your people still shooting " the father of the year old boy screamed at col achmed "you know why because someone is shooting at them " col achmed replied by the end of the meeting col achmed seemed worn down by the complaints and the constant volley of fire from his own troops "i have fixed a lot of problems in this battalion i succeeded and i cannot do any more maybe this is my limit " he said he pledged to do a joint investigation of the incident with col kuehl col kuehl meanwhile asked the locals to give the iraqi army time "we are working hard to get better " he said after the meeting col kuehl said that there was probably "more than a grain of truth" to the locals complaints he also conceded it was unlikely he would ever get to the truth the blood evidence at the scene of the shooting was gone the year old boys body had been buried and most neighbors were too afraid to testify in court "i dont have a csi unit on hand " he said referring to the television show col kuehl said he would turn over results of the investigation to the sheiks in ameriyah he also planned to put together a phone list of local sheiks he could call when there was a firefight in the area "the most effective weapon i have got right now is my cellphone " he said a few days later col kuehl suffered an unexpected setback when col achmed abruptly resigned citing threats to his family last week after months of inaction the logjam over the bank seemed to be ready to break lt gen raymond odierno the no military officer in iraq asked iraqi officials to open the bank as quickly as possible according to u s officials iraqs finance minister bayan jabr told u s officials that if he received an official letter from u s forces indicating that ameriyah was secure he would reopen the bank u s officials say they sent the letter then a new hurdle emerged the ministry of finance refused to approve the banks sunni guard force col kuehl says so the bank remains shuttered
