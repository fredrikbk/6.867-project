adams and sellars respond to mozart with a work of beauty san francisco for their sixth stage collaboration composer john adams and director peter sellars have made use of a year old indian folk tale called "a flowering tree " in a two act two hour plus work that had its american premiere here recently with the san francisco symphony not quite an opera not quite an oratorio "a flowering tree" recalls their collaboration on "el nino " first performed here six years ago full orchestra and chorus the chorus on both occasions singing in spanish three vocal soloists and three dancers in this case mr sellars decided to use traditional javanese dancers who shadow the singers and mime additional roles in the story but in general just bob and weave slowly in ritual postures and patterns what little action there is takes place on three floating disks like lily pads to the right of the orchestra and on a small balcony that projects left of the chorus which sings from terrace seats above and behind the stage three years ago mr sellars was offered the job of artistic director of a festival in vienna designed to celebrate mozarts th birthday in fall he decided to program not the music of mozart but works in various media by living artists from around the world who would somehow "respond" to mozart especially the music of mozarts final year when he invited mr adams to join in the composer picked "the magic flute" as his model seeing in this luminous idealistic opera an excuse to escape from the darkness and moral confusion of "doctor atomic " an apocalyptic opera which opened here in october on which he had been struggling for too long the day after "doctor atomic" opened mr adams set to work on "a flowering tree " which he completed in nine months or about six months longer than mozart spent on "the magic flute " it was performed four times in vienna in november with a venezuelan orchestra and chorus which explains the spanish choral text then three times with the berlin philharmonic in december it opened in san francisco march with the same soloists and dancers who had performed at the first two venues mr adams conducted as he had at vienna "a flowering tree" is the only one of mr adamss works i can recall in which he devotes so much energy and attention to the creation of beauty this sense of beauty comes primarily from his writing for strings which maintain a continuous forest murmur almost throughout overlaid with lyrical instrumental and vocal solos and sprinkled with a stardust of bells and percussion mr adams gives his percussionists a collection of pieces of hardware in addition to the traditional timpani i couldnt tell for sure when i was hearing which bell block chime or gong but by means of this battery of noisemakers the composer was able to achieve a wide range of emotional effects in addition to those created by the usual strings woodwinds and brass plus harp and celesta the contributions of the last two are especially important in evoking the magical otherworldly quality of the score a minimalist seesawing phrase in the strings is rapidly repeated for a long time at the start eventually a slow sweet rising and falling theme emerges on cellos and bass clarinet the first voice we hear is that of the storyteller who declaims most of the plot in clear stentorian tones bass eric owens is totally commanding in this the strongest of his three recent world premiere roles we next hear from kumudha the poor daughter of a work wearied widow as she bemoans her mothers fate and prays for relief soprano jessica rivera has a voice of precision and purity perfectly suited to the sad spiring lyrical plaints mr adams gives to kumudha she miraculously discovers her ability to transform herself into a flowering tree and back again as she does her sister picks off her blossoms which the two girls sell at market to help ease their mothers life this transformation the first of four in the work is realized musically by ascending shimmering strings the birdlike song of recorders and the fairy touch of harp and celesta what we see is kumudha and her dancer double lifting their arms like trees as the stage space is washed in soft pastel colors a demanding arrogant prince tenor russell thomas learning of kumudhas gift decides that he wants her and it for himself and insists on their marriage they spend two unhappy unconsummated nights together before kumudha discovers that what the prince really wants is to see and command her magic transformation unwillingly she yields then returns to womanhood the prince is now overcome with genuine love and the two embrace amid the fallen blossoms the orchestration of these sequences is appropriately rapturous and subsides into a heavenly bliss the nightly transformations and subsequent bliss continue until the princes jealous sister learns of kumudhas magical trick and forces her to perform it in front of her rude and mocking entourage the princess is mimed by a dancer the chorus sings the crowd but the wicked sister halts kumudha in mid retransformation leaving her a monstrous limbless creature half tree and half woman mr sellars achieves this effect by having kumudha and her dancer double shove their arms behind their backs and bend their feet behind their knees then twist torsos and necks together on the floor where they inch along like snakes without arms she is unable to perform the ritual required to resume her full human state kumudha now has to creep or be carried from town to town earning her bread by singing as a public freak and sleeping in the gutter driven mad by her disappearance the prince puts on the white robe of a wandering beggar and sets off down the road from opposite ends of the land the two lost unhappy lovers sing antiphonally of their longing for each other blending into the most beautiful vocal music of the work ultimately their aimless paths cross recognizing each other beneath their deformations kumudha restores the prince to sanity with her touch and he completes her interrupted transformation by pouring water over her these final episodes are realized in music by a long swelling crescendo which ends with the affirmative sunlight of a spectacular b major chord if not the equal of the radiant e flat major blessing that orchestra and chorus offer the reunited lovers at the end of "the magic flute " the conclusion of "a flowering tree" at least seems to look in its direction in the end mr adamss debt to the dying year old master lies less in the parallel separation suffering and blissful reunion of their two pairs of lovers than in his attempt to write music in inspired by the relative simplicity directness and transparency of mozarts in mr littlejohn covers
