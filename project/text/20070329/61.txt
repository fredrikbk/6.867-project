making sense of a world turned upside down alexis de tocqueville by hugh brogan yale university press pages &# in france people on both sides of the political spectrum generally agree that a strong central government is the best means of achieving two lofty purposes national grandeur and job security true french politicians often just before elections talk about the need for drastic change yet few of them are ever willing to oppose the states long habit of intervening everywhere in frances economy and culture as it happens the greatest french political thinker alexis de tocqueville had no great sympathy for this statist mind set he was a passionate champion of freedom societys freedom from state control the citizens freedom from government interference little surprise then that tocquevilles work although well known and tirelessly quoted in america is less influential in his own country hugh brogans superb biography helps to explain why the reality of french politics throughout tocquevilles career seemed almost willfully at odds with his ideals the french revolution turned upside down the life of his fathers and mothers families both aristocratic and sympathetic to louis xvi several close relatives were guillotined alexis father was given a reprieve from his own death sentence only because robespierre was beheaded a few days before stemming the terrors blood tide napoleons dictatorial empire a few years later wasnt much more hospitable to the members of tocquevilles family they vainly hoped that constitutional monarchy established in with the restoration of the bourbons would solve frances problems the young alexis in the meantime read the enlightenment philosophers studied law and served in the s as a legal apprentice at versailles at another time tocqueville might well have gone on to become a politician of some influence but his class was rapidly losing relevance ultimately he had more opportunities to think about public life than to participate in it he was lucid enough to see that the world was changing irreversibly that the aristocracy of which he was a part could no longer presume its supremacy but he was too proud to join in any of the groups that were seizing on these changes for their own advantage the violent july revolution of ending bourbon rule left him with divided feelings he made the decision fateful in politics to keep himself independent of a particular sect or party in the early s tocqueville traveled to america discovering there a stable and peaceful democracy unlike anything that he had seen in france the u s hadnt experienced revolutionary terror military adventurism monarchic restorations and a sequence of turbulent regime changes tocqueville attributed this happy situation to the american form of political liberty from town meetings to federal elections it dispersed power citizens had a wealth of opportunities to participate in their own democracy and to check those who might abuse it tocquevilles admiration for america was nevertheless qualified by his suspicion of equality for tocqueville human diversity is always present and always desirable but it is also vulnerable especially in democratic societies to a withering quest for uniformity the future belonged to democracy he concluded but it was unclear whether it would evolve toward liberty or a new kind of despotism when in france overthrew the july monarchy and became a republic once again tocqueville did all he could to help his country create a lasting democratic regime his career as an independent deputy in the national assembly and his short stint as a minister of foreign affairs came to an end however when the republics new president louis napoleon bonaparte the nephew of napoleon i abolished parliamentary rule and appointed himself emperor mr brogan narrates with great verve this stormy period which forms the principal subject of tocquevilles "memoirs" published posthumously probably the smartest cruelest and most accessible description of french political mores the second empire turned out to be less oppressive than the first nonetheless in tocque villes eyes napoleon iiis coup detat was a criminal act shockingly the new emperor who put an end to democratic representation enjoyed wide popular support to tocquevilles grief france seemed to like being ruled from above and to care little about freedom how could this be the case he wondered in a country that had risen up so spectacularly against monarchy in and what if in fact the french revolution was less a fight for liberty than an appeal for a powerful centralized state from this angle the revolution could be seen as an effort to continue rather than challenge monarchys long struggle to bring france under full control tocquevilles last unfinished book "the old regime and the revolution " is the work of a disappointed man who had hoped that liberal democracy could make its way in france during his lifetime but now had to admit that the urge to control from the center had prevailed it did so he argued because the monarchy had created a set of political habits that permeated the french mind although tocqueville still believed that democracy would win out in the end he realized that the centralizing impulse was not going to vanish soon mr brogans book is wonderfully learned and intelligent he emphasizes tocquevilles humanity his attachment to his family his lifelong friendships and in particular his love for his wife mary mottley an englishwoman and a commoner who did not enjoy the approval of alexis family when he first met her in his s since according to french law at the time a man before the age of could not marry without the consent of his parents the story of their romance is a moving example of patience and mutual devotion by contrast mr brogan shows only limited sympathy for tocquevilles political thought too often missing its depth and prophetic character the strength of the book comes from mr brogans narrative talent and remarkable knowledge of tocquevilles life and times the biography reads like a novel combining humor and urbanity with erudition and insight it should be translated into french mr pavel is a member of the committee on social thought at the university of chicago
