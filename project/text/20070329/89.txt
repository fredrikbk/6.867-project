prologis feeds off chinas boom with large presence in nation reit pleases wall street beijing for many investors the shine has come off u s listed real estate investment trusts as they look expensive given the uncertain outlook for the american economy and property one u s based reit that is retaining fans is doing so in part because of growing income from a country with an economy that remains hot china prologis which is based in denver has been investing in warehouses that play a role in chinas huge trade the company is involved in operating million square feet of warehouse space of which prologis owns and is in joint ventures for the other prologis isnt the only u s industrial reit that is already in china though it has the largest presence by far in the nation at present space in china accounts for just of the prologis portfolio but the new york stock exchange listed company which has a market capitalization of more than &# billion aims to convert its beachhead into bigger business for prologis china is the only portfolio that is growing a year chief executive jeffrey schwartz says ming mei president of prologis china says the company intends to develop million to million square feet of warehouse space a year the goal he says is for chinese assets to be of the global portfolio in five to years prologis has a substantial presence in coastal cities such as beijing shanghai ningbo and hangzhou now it is headed inland this month prologis announced plans to invest &# million in distribution centers in five interior cities changsha chengdu chongqing nanjing and wuhan that announcement came about the time of a pullback by some investors from real estate shares of prologis which last week had a &# billion convertible debt offering were off cents at &# in p m composite trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange at that level the share price was up so far this year some analysts say the recent investor pullback makes now a good time to look at industrial reits these arent involved in apartment space and thus arent vulnerable to the subprime loan related woes roiling parts of the u s real estate market and in asia prologis has a small but notable growth story prologis "is one of our favorite stocks and one of our largest holdings " said michael winer who manages a &# billion fund for new york based third avenue management prologis forms of his holdings according to factset research systems inc on march merrill lynch raised its assessment of seven reits including prologis to "buy" from "neutral " saying it expects their net asset value to grow in the next three to five years prologis tracks the footprints of multinational companies many of them are exporting to and from china helping rev up global trade last year of the worlds largest ports cumulatively had an average increase in container traffic volume according to chicago based morningstar inc which expects trade to be as robust this year because ports and distribution hubs go hand in hand analysts say logistics companies are positioned to gain when trade flourishes prologis entered china in a year after beijing freed up the logistics sector under the terms of its world trade organization membership prologis says china has three billion square feet of warehouses built by the central government in the s that are tiny and poorly located mr mei says those state owned warehouses will need to be overhauled which could mean business for international logistics companies however growth in china for prologis may have to come with increased costs last year when the central government moved to reduce the amount of new land made available for industry prologis calculated that its land acquisition costs eventually would rise the company still has options on million square feet of land chinas land ownership structure is one of the reasons that analysts like ross smotrich of bear stearns "wouldnt want to underestimate the risks" of prologis investing so heavily in china others point out that the development economics in china are difficult to assess because of the relatively new state of the market therefore prologis could be affected in the event of an economic slowdown not everyone thinks shares of prologis are attractive at the moment heather smith an analyst who tracks real estate stocks for morningstar estimates its fair value at &# a share "we really like their strategy and their management team but they are a bit overvalued at this point like most of the reit sector " she says noting hefty potential ms smith adds that "asia is a largely untapped market and prologis has a head start in china " on a five year basis thomson financial has forecast average annual earnings growth of for prologis that is bigger than what
