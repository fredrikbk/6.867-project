psychology professor at mongolias state university arrived in kuala lumpur to look for her alerted by ms shaariibuus two mongolian friends and initially assuming that she had been arrested he contacted malaysian police they quickly found witnesses of the oct kidnapping carried out in plain sight outside mr razaks home interrogations of mr razak then led to mr azilah and his fellow vip unit officer who had to be recalled from a mission protecting prime minister abdullah in pakistan eventually the investigators came upon a jungle clearing outside kuala lumpur where charred bone fragments were found on nov subsequent dna testing made with the assistance of ms shaariibuus father confirmed that these were indeed the mongolian womans remains a week later mr azilah and the fellow vip unit officer sirul azhar umar were charged with murder mr razak with abetting them all three have pleaded not guilty and are being held without bail they face the death penalty if convicted the female constable hasnt been charged attorneys for the two vip unit officers dispute mr razaks affidavit which was submitted as part of a failed bail application in late january mr azilah his lawyer insists was simply doing his job "my client is a senior ranking officer in the special unit of the police and he has always acted on instructions including in this case " says the attorney zulkifli noordin mr zulkifli declined to say who issued these instructions after ms shaariibuu was spirited away from mr razaks house his client took her to the national police headquarters in central kuala lumpur for interrogation mr zulkifli said what happened after that mr zulkifli will not yet say the malaysian police have declined to comment while the case is in court as newly emboldened malaysian newspapers first reported the arrests of mr razak and the two officers late last year the police tried to halt the coverage and briefly detained five local reporters opposition politicians like mr anwar the former deputy premier cried coverup prime minister abdullah himself stepped in ordering a thorough investigation and assuring fellow malaysians that "nobody is above the law " unlike mr abdullah his deputy mr najib has kept silent so far ignoring demands of opponents that he explain any personal role in this drama the spotlight on mr najib however is likely to intensify once the actual murder trial begins come june the chairman of malaysias biggest opposition party karpal singh will be waiting to pounce in that courtroom as the attorney representing ms shaariibuus family
