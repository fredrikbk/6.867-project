intel to pile more chores onto its chips changes are called biggest since an amd mainstay intel corp said it is planning the most fundamental design change in its chips since it introduced the pentium pro family of chips in including adopting a feature that has been a mainstay of rival advanced micro devices inc the move disclosed along with other intel technology plans at a briefing for reporters in san francisco is the latest example of a long term trend to hand more chores over to a single chip the microprocessor that is the basic calculating engine in most computers the shift can increase processing speed and reduces the need for accessory chips that increase the cost and power consumption of computers attributes that are increasingly important in making portable pcs and reducing power bills at data centers by intel said it plans to introduce a basic architecture for its microprocessors code named nehalem that for the first time will include a built in feature called a memory controller that circuitry manages how a microprocessor retrieves data from external memory chips intel now incorporates the feature on separate products known as chip sets other chip companies have long integrated memory controllers onto microprocessors arguing that the approach cuts down on delays as signals move among additional chips amd introduced the feature in gaining a performance boost that has been a major factor in the smaller company grabbing a record of the microprocessor market by the end of intel executives in the past argued that it could achieve similar results by expanding the data repository on each chip known as cache memory intel said it also plans to build graphics circuitry onto some nehalem chips amd has signaled similar plans which were a major reason it forged a &# billion deal last year to buy ati technologies inc a chip maker that specializes in graphics pat gelsinger an intel senior vice president and general manager of its digital enterprise group said customers will be able to choose among nehalem chips that have anywhere from one processor core the equivalent of a single electronic brain to eight cores each core will be able to execute two sets of instructions known as "threads" at the same time the multithread technology which intel had offered in the past but not emphasized lately makes it possible for an eight chip to perform up to chores at the same time intels most powerful chips at the moment bundle two dual core chips in a single package nehalem was designed to exploit a new intel manufacturing technology that can create circuitry with features measured at nanometers or billionths of a meter intel also plans to introduce a family of chips known by the code name penryn that also use the nanometer manufacturing technology
