slim pickings miracle obesity pill looks less miraculous repeated fda delays european restrictions ail sanofis acomplia when sanofi aventis sa reported data on a new obesity pill at a medical conference in march it generated instant buzz hundreds of newspaper and television reports around the world the next day referred to the drug acomplia as a "super pill" and a "miracle drug " with a new approach to obesity acomplia promised not only to help people shed pounds but also to raise good cholesterol and cut diabetes risk it even showed signs of working as an antismoking aid "that is amazing people are going to want this drug today im sure " effused an anchor on abcs "good morning america " three years later acomplia is looking less like a miracle the drug still hasnt hit the market in the u s the food and drug administration has asked for more data and repeatedly put off approval for the drug as an obesity treatment while rejecting it for smoking cessation side effects associated with acomplia including depression and anxiety are likely giving the fda particular cause for concern analysts and doctors say sanofi announced this week that the fda has scheduled a meeting of its outside advisers on june to review acomplias safety and efficacy that could be a precursor to a final decision acomplia faces trouble in europe too european regulators approved it for sale last summer but germanys state financed health care system thinks the drug has few real medical benefits and is refusing to pay for it other countries including france are covering the drug only for limited groups such as people with diabetes success with acomplia is important for paris based sanofi whose sales of about &# billion make it the worlds third largest drug maker behind pfizer inc and glaxosmithkline plc several of sanofis biggest drugs are facing future generic competition including anticlotting agent plavix which sanofi jointly sells with bristol myers squibb co recently there has been talk that sanofi which completed a hostile takeover of french german drug maker aventis in might be interested in acquiring bristol myers the companies declined to comment the acomplia troubles show the challenge companies face in pitching potential hit drugs especially in markets like obesity where public enthusiasm is apt to jump out ahead of the scientific data and regulators review sanofi initially did little to hold back the hype and even contributed to it by distributing a news release at the march meeting quoting doctors speaking positively about acomplia it also said in february of that year that acomplia "could become a very large blockbuster " later sanofi clamped down on its publicity and investors complained the company wasnt offering enough information about the repeated delays at the fda sanofis stock price has dropped since february when the fda first said it needed more time to review the drug in the back of everyones mind are the diet drugs redux and pondimin part of the combination known as fen phen after creating a public sensation the drugs were linked to heart valve damage and removed from the market in triggering lawsuits that have cost drug maker wyeth more than &# billion in legal fees judgments and settlements if acomplia is approved for sale in the u s some analysts believe it could still reach sales of more than &# billion a year competitors havent given up on the category pfizer merck &amp co and bristol myers are studying drugs that work similarly to sanofis acomplia known by the generic name rimonabant attacks obesity in a new way by blocking receptors in the brain and in fat cells that help regulate appetite and metabolism cannabis the active ingredient in marijuana acts on the same receptors which is believed to explain why marijuana users often get hungry sanofi at first saw acomplia as a weight loss tool but as sanofis researchers tested the drug they saw evidence of wider benefits better blood sugar and hdl cholesterol levels shrinking waistlines and less of the harmful fats known as triglycerides in the blood for a time sanofi also tested acomplia as an aid to help people quit smoking part of sanofis problem is that it has struggled to define what acomplia is the company initially viewed the drug as a weight loss aid and then shifted to saying it treated risk factors for heart disease and diabetes gerard le fur who was sanofis head of research and development for more than a decade before becoming chief executive in january now says "if we were to start again we would say its an antidiabetic agent" that induces weight loss sanofi began reporting results of its acomplia trials at the american college of cardiology conference in new orleans in march "its mind boggling how this one receptor seems to be tied into all of these risk factors for cardiovascular disease " christopher cannon a cardiologist at harvard medical school and brigham and womens hospital boston said at the time although the company was careful not to call the drug a miracle pill media reaction was gushing "one pill a day could keep food and nicotine cravings away " usa today reported that month an online publisher of consumer medical news medical week news inc set up a web site called acomplia report soon it had about visitors a day says milton benjamin editor and publisher of medical week news he says sanofi at first cooperated with the site providing it interviews with company officials and keeping it posted on clinical trial news the sites daily traffic rose to in november when sanofi announced results of a two year trial in overweight and obese patients the sanofi funded trial later published in the journal of the american medical association showed that those who stuck to a daily milligram dose of acomplia lost an average of more than pounds in the first year and maintained their new weight for an additional year those who lost the weight and then switched to a dummy pill gained nearly all of it back during the second year but there was a warning sign too patients on the milligram dose had a rate of psychiatric disorders such as depression compared with of those taking a placebo when sanofi submitted the drug to the fda and to the european medicines agency for review in the second quarter of the fda made clear it was perturbed by all the acomplia chatter says dr le fur "we were told by the fda not to talk about" acomplia he says "the fda believed that we put pressure on them through you the journalists and the financial analysts and that is not true " in the wake of safety scandals involving fen phen and mercks painkiller vioxx the fda and other regulators are particularly sensitive about approving medications that could be used over long periods for chronic conditions dr le fur says sanofi took some steps to turn down the volume on acomplia in april a trademark lawyer for sanofi emailed mr benjamin of the acomplia report warning of legal action unless he transferred the domain name acompliareport com to sanofi within days he refused after a skirmish he got to keep the name in exchange for publishing a disclaimer that the site was not associated with sanofi a sanofi spokesman says the case was a routine trademark defense that had nothing to do with the sites content on jan hanspeter spek sanofis head of pharmaceutical operations told financial analysts during a conference call that the company was "very very confident" it would receive fda approval and begin selling acomplia in the second quarter of preparing for a launch the company sent a person sales force to visit insurers and other u s health care payers less than three weeks later on friday feb sanofi issued a terse release saying the fda had rejected acomplia as a smoking cessation treatment and delayed approval for obesity requesting more information from the company over the weekend sanofis investor relations department took calls from research analysts sanofi officials told those callers that the company expected the drug to be approved "in months not years " according to several analysts some of them reported that intelligence to clients in research notes monday morning the prediction turned out to be wrong as did a subsequent prediction that the fda would act by the end of sanofi now declines to offer a forecast the next deadline for the fda to deliver a yes a no or another official "maybe" comes at the end of july amit roy a pharmaceutical analyst with citigroup in london says sanofis guidance on acomplia approval in the u s has been "misleading in a sense " there have been "very many delays and very little information " he says a sanofi spokesman says the company gave all its guidance in good faith dr roy now thinks global sales of acomplia will reach only about &# billion in down from his previous forecast of more than &# billion while the fda and sanofi decline to discuss the reasons for the delay outside specialists believe the sticking point likely has to do with the depression and anxiety side effects thats especially an issue for a drug that some patients who are desperate to lose weight may seek out aggressively "if there are potential adverse psychiatric effects and people are going to be able to buy this over the web then it could potentially become unsafe " says barbara kahn chief of endocrinology diabetes and metabolism at beth israel deaconess medical center in boston a few months after acomplia was introduced in the united kingdom frederick west a year old with diabetes in hertfordshire england began taking the drug he lost about pounds in the first few months but after about four months he started experiencing mood swings including periods of aggression mr west works as a gamekeeper on a large english estate where he is sometimes required to carry a gun "im normally a very cool person " he says "i was not behaving in my normal fashion " mr west says he decided to stop taking the drug in december and soon returned to normal he has regained about six pounds since then european regulators have cautioned that acomplia shouldnt be used in patients with "uncontrolled serious psychiatric illness such as major depression " however they have approved the drug for overweight people with diabetes or abnormal levels of fat in their blood as well as for any person with a body mass index of greater than a foot person would have to weigh about pounds to reach that level sanofis dr le fur says the psychiatric side effects were "mild and moderate" and occurred in a "rather low" percentage of patients in the clinical trials he also says that the depression and anxiety tended to ease with time acomplia is now available in most european countries sanofi says sales in after the mid year launch were about &# million a figure it calls promising but sanofi faces a problem getting cash strapped european health systems to pay for acomplia in a major setback germanys health ministry in january decided that acomplia was a "lifestyle" weight loss drug and refused to pay for it sanofi says it plans to challenge the decision in german court france decided this month to cover acomplia only for obese people with type diabetes who have found certain generic diabetes medications ineffective others will have to pay the full euros per pill cost out of pocket sweden has opted to cover acomplia only for patients with a body mass index over or for diabetics and certain others with a bmi over to bolster its argument that acomplia is worth paying for sanofi is spending millions on eight additional clinical studies to test whether acomplia helps lower a persons risk of developing diabetes or having a heart attack or stroke the largest of these trials involves patients and will last five years some web sites have cropped up offering to sell the drug to americans the sites typically arrange for an american to receive a prescription from a doctor in a country such as britain where the drug is marketed after which a pharmacy in that country can mail the pills although importing most prescription drugs is illegal under u s law the fda and customs officials mostly ignore small mail orders in a discussion forum on acomplia report com readers swap stories about their experiences taking acomplia some describe side effects like an anxious feeling at night others have none "just a lovely and welcome disinterest in food i get hungry around mealtimes and i eat a little and thats it " one reported many american insurers refuse to pay for the two main obesity drugs on the u s market meridia from abbott laboratories and xenical from roche holding ag and glaxosmithkline which is now also sold over the counter under the name alli by glaxo "we understand and we accept that a slimming agent shouldnt be financed by" health insurers says sanofis mr spek "we have a strong even vital interest to show that our patients are not those that take the product in order to fit into their bikini " anna wilde mathews contributed to this article
