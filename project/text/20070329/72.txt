parents rebel against school fund raisers tired of being forced to sell wrapping paper and raffle tickets some opt out while others devise more effective alternatives want to buy a bucket of cookie dough like so many parents beth eagleson has grown weary of that question the sign that another school fund raiser has arrived invariably requiring that she do much of the selling for her sons in elementary and middle school "someone is always trying to raise money " says the san clemente calif mom "its to the point that its almost a competitive sport my school can raise more than your school " like ms eagleson many parents gripe about fund raisers the time required to sell and deliver the products the time taken away from classroom studies and that some go to pay for events like school dances instead of educational needs chief among the complaints the fact that schools often receive on average less than of the money raised according to the association of fund raising distributors &amp suppliers a trade group the rest goes to the for profit fund raising companies supplying the products "parents are tired of getting hit up by fund raisers " says ms eagleson it is a backlash
