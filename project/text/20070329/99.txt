far that search hasnt been easy mr forsee declined to comment for this article sprint spokeswoman leigh horner said "the right plans are in place and theres accountability across the organization to deliver better performance and ensure that progress is being made " even if mr forsee delivers improved subscriber numbers this summer a bigger task lies ahead finding an identity for sprint in the increasingly competitive u s cellphone industry more than three quarters of u s consumers already own a cellphone and its getting harder for carriers to sign up new customers especially high spending ones all the carriers are battling to distinguish themselves from one another verizon claims network leadership at&amp ts cingular wireless is bringing fancy new services and handsets to market like apple inc s iphone and deutsche telekom ags t mobile usa competes mainly on price and courts younger consumers sprint which is now the third largest carrier with million customers is betting on a future high speed wireless internet network known as wimax to set itself apart but that is still a few years away sprints problems started last summer when the company reported weak financial results

chief operating officer len lauer a sprint veteran who was respected in the industry and whose responsibilities included overseeing the nextel integration mr forsee pledged to get the company back on the right track by investing in upgrading the nextel network and tightening credit policies so that more "subprime" customers werent added in december the board signaled it would give his plan a chance installing him as chairman to replace the outgoing tim donahue nextels former chief executive but in early january sprint warned investors that its fourth quarter results wouldnt look good for the first time sprint would actually lose subscribers who pay on a monthly basis about of them revenue it said would grow only slightly from the previous year and margins would be under pressure too investors had a chance to voice their concerns a few days later at the citigroup telecom investor conference in las vegas some legacy sprint investors expressed frustration that nextel and its creaky network were at the root of many of the problems telling mr forsee that he had been duped into the merger people familiar with the sessions say mr forsee responded that his initiatives would take some time to show positive results these people say in addition to his roles as chairman and chief executive mr forsee has been handling mr lauers former responsibilities since last august in recent months he has offered the operating chiefs job to several industry veterans including a top executive at alltel corp and a former executive at bellsouth corp but they werent interested people familiar with the situation say in february sprint was in fairly advanced discussions with bill morrow a former executive at british carrier vodafone group plc people close to the matter say those talks fell through as well mr morrow who is president and chief operating officer of pacific gas &amp electric co declined to comment sprint has now narrowed its search to one external frontrunner and resolved sticky issues involving that executives noncompete agreement and likely relocation according to one person close to the situation the hunt "is progressing toward a conclusion " this person said however mr forsee and the candidate have only met briefly so far and havent yet worked out how they will share power the person said mr forsee has said previously that he wanted to fill the job by the end of the first quarter mr forsee and his lieutenants have said they still expect the fixes they have set in motion to spark a turnaround by the second half the company says the nextel network is already tuned up and is now in its best shape ever though additional upgrades are still on the way and a new phone that combines sprints more reliable voice network with nextels popular walkie talkie capability is selling well it says sprint expects to sell two to three million of them this year the carriers wimax network which promises to more than double its wireless broadband speeds is scheduled to hit several major markets beginning in late some investors seem to be making an early bet that a turnaround is already afoot big sprint shareholders like goldman sachs asset management lp and southeastern asset management inc added significantly to their sprint holdings in the fourth quarter according to factset research systems inc sprint sought to address one of the key criticisms of the merger that the deal didnt produce enough savings or synergies by making job cuts but some investors and people inside the company worry that sprint may be scaling back too much in areas like mobile data and entertainment services and marketing which could be crucial as voice revenue declines the company says the cuts were painful but necessary "the reductions were a result of redundancies that were still occurring " says ms horner she also says that sprint is making progress toward the &# billion in promised merger synergies by consolidating systems and functions that sprint and nextel previously managed separately including billing customer activation and employee payroll joann s lublin contributed to this article
