preparing for takeover time magazine pictured ronald reagan with a tear running down his cheek on its cover last week earlier this month a new york times cbs news poll found that only of democrats expect republicans to win in howard dean recently told politico "i am trying to build relationships with other governments in preparation for a democratic takeover " and the house and senate have passed legislation setting a timetable for withdrawing from iraq after pocketing one congressional victory democrats assume their ideas own the future and are now overconfident heading into the elections much of the mainstream media is reinforcing this conclusion but is it right in republicans won control of both houses of congress after nearly years of the new deal being firmly implanted in washington they too concluded that voters had tired of their opposition republican thomas dewey fresh off a his strong re election as governor of new york campaigned in as if momentum alone would carry him to the white house despite the now famous headline wrongly proclaiming "dewey defeats truman " it was harry trumans relentless campaigning that won out six decades later republicans are in trumans shoes the gop is coming off of a prolonged period of control in washington and the country is now in the middle of a protracted war todays speculation similar to the prediction that truman would be defeated assumes that the current domestic political dynamic will persist that seems unlikely by autumn we will know if the surge in iraq has succeeded republicans will then have the opportunity to reposition themselves on the war democrats may retort by advocating a rapid pullout but then they would be vulnerable to a rudolph giuliani or john mccain the reason voters trust hawks to make peace it took dwight eisenhower to go to korea richard nixon to go to china and voters may decide it will take john mccain to go to the middle east democrats should prepare for the arizona senator to advocate for the u s to "withdraw with honor " despite the many antiwar presidential candidates throughout history there has never been an antiwar president in these days of hubristic bloggers it bears reminding liberals that they amount to less than one in five voters put another way which one of the three one term democratic senators with no firsthand national security experience will sink republicans in wartime democrats cannot improve on winning nine in ten african american voters as they did in when geraldine ferraro was on the democratic presidential ticket ronald reagan still won a majority of support from women voters including white women with two charismatic democratic male candidates running in it is also worth recalling that richard nixon won more women votes in than john f kennedy equally when john edwards debated dick cheney the vice president came out on top gravitas and experience matter in politics if the leading democrats of are largely the same as the leading democrats of recent past a past that includes only two presidential victories for the party in the past seven contests the left is banking on a public shift at first blush it appears a shift may be underway last week the pew research center for the people and the press reported that half of the public now leans or identifies as a democrat while only lean or identify as republican in the country split for each party but in of the country identified or leaned democratic while only identified or leaned republican george w bush prevailed in the following two elections more disconcerting for democrats pew found that the public perception of the democratic party is "no better" than when mr bush was first inaugurated while in the number of americans who registered as republicans decreased those voters largely became independents not democrats the problem for democrats in is that voters cannot envision their leading candidates as good captains in a storm republicans dont suffer that problem messrs giuliani and mccain have both demonstrated an ability to manage a crisis most certainly this is not the same democratic party of troops are not being disparaged no leading democrat argues that the united states must withdraw from the world as george mcgovern had however the antiwar wing has successfully pushed every leading democrat to espouse a set timetable for withdrawal from iraq even though historically doves win democratic primaries not presidencies it is becoming popular today to point out that after vietnam democrats still won the election but the cbs news exit polling found that more than six in voters said "restoring trust in government" led them to support their candidate while foreign affairs was selected by about five in voters watergate defined that election by democrats began paying for vietnam jimmy carter enacted mr mcgoverns philosophy while democrats no longer championed jfks "peace through strength" and the voters elected reagan in a landslide at their core presidential elections are contests between two characters this is the titanic difference between a midterm and presidential contest on st patricks day at a high school in new hampshire mr mccain badly delivered jokes for about minutes he spoke too quickly his seven decades showed mr giuliani tends to demean the importance of his shortcomings on conservative social issues in contrast ronald reagan campaigned in as the advocate for conservative christians which compensated for his divorce and hollywood background for these reasons and iraq republicans are beatable in but beatable isnt the same as beaten republicans will more likely than not resurge if mr mccain remains the blue chip stock of presidential politics this is the time to buy low democrats must ask themselves are they experiencing their time to sell high and if thats the case then it is time for democrats to take stock of themselves liberals are compelled to entertain the possibility that the public was not duped into voting republican in previous years and woke up in could it be that it is not the people who were deceived but the democratic base the next election may prove to be another sobering night for the american left mr kuhn who covered the presidential race for cbs news is writing a book on presidential politics
