job one in ohio weve reported some good education news of late but then theres ohio where new governor ted strickland has decided that one of his first priorities should be an assault on public and private school choice as part of his first budget mr strickland is proposing to abolish a two year old voucher program that provides a &# tuition scholarship for up to children who attend schools certified by the state to be in "academic emergency " that can mean as many as one in three schools in some parts of the state and in columbus nearly one in two the program is new and was designed as a follow on to the successful cleveland voucher program both programs have been major political targets of the teachers unions that supported mr stricklands election making him the first democratic governor in ohio in years mr strickland decided that the cleveland program had too much local political support to take on so instead hes trying to kill the statewide voucher plan before it can develop its own constituency the governor is also proposing a moratorium on the creation of new charter schools in the state saying charters have been "a dismal failure " in ohio some students are served by charters which are public schools freed from bureaucratic and union rules unions and charter opponents have used the failure of about two dozen charter schools in ohio to tarnish the entire concept but unlike failing public schools charters that dont perform can be put out of business failing public schools live on and on trapping students year after year for the most part however charters are thriving in ohio and many of them have waiting lists for admission large scale research on charter performance is spotty but a recent study by the buckeye institute found that students in ohio charters performed better on six of nine academic measurements in math and reading than kids in traditional public schools this was despite spending less money per pupil and having less experienced teachers mr stricklands other excuse for this assault on school choice for the poor is that the state needs to save money yet the voucher program costs a mere &# million out of a &# billion state budget that includes big new spending increases on education and bonuses for the public school bureaucracy the columbus dispatch reports that from to spending per pupil in columbus schools rose to &# from &# as everywhere the problem in ohio schools isnt money its the status quo of union enforced mediocrity wed have thought that with ohios many other problems a new governor would have better things to do than deny opportunity for poor kids to escape the worst schools in the state
