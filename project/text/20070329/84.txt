reborn republicans give me that old time fiscal responsibility nothing like a few months out of power to help rekindle that old time religion of fiscal responsibility in some republicans "contract renewed " editorial page march rep jeb hensarling thinks his partys presidential candidates would be wise to adopt the taxpayer bill of rights he helped develop cant hurt but where was his concern for taxpayers for the past six years when republicans were loading up bill after bill with earmarks and expanding the size and reach of government at every turn voters will see this bill of rights for exactly what it is a stunt to try to recapture the bygone glories of the contract with america in the ideological debate was over and the republicans had won americans wanted the fiscal conservatism that they preached with its twin prongs of low taxes and limited spending yet under the bush presidency republicans betrayed many of those principles and in doing so lost political power and their credibility now rep hensarling hopes to resuscitate that credibility with his taxpayer bill of rights voters bought that line once and found in the end that republicans have no more fiscal self control than democrats william j wolter novi mich as a longtime fiscal conservative jeb hensarlings piece should be music to my ears instead i see it for what it really is politics as usual if jeb and the other conservatives in the house truly believed in the taxpayer bill of rights they would still be the majority party instead they spent the first six years of the bush administration spending the taxpayers money with reckless abandon now that they are in the minority its time to roll out the same old rhetoric in an attempt to lay the blame on the democrats when it was jeb and his cronies who inserted spending earmarks into bill after bill in return for lucrative campaign contributions from k street it would be almost laughable if it wasnt so disturbing william r borton mount laurel n j i nearly screamed and not with joy after reading the op ed by jeb hensarling its not that i disagree with any element of his or dick armeys taxpayer bill of rights but where were these fundamentally conservative tenets when the republicans controlled both the house and senate the sad reality is that republicans behave like conservatives only when theyre the minority party roger w lockhart akron ohio see related letter "letters to the editor lonely voice of reason during gop spendfest" wsj april
