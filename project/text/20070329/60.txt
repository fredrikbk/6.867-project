latest music phone is a creative gadget marred by big flaws gadget freaks are still buzzing about apples planned iphone a combination smart phone and music player that wont even be available until june meanwhile the traditional cellphone makers are continuing to churn out music phones that can be in the hands of consumers much sooner the latest and most unusual of these music phones has just been announced by sprint its a samsung model called the upstage the upstage costs just &# less than a third of the iphones planned &# price and it will go on sale early next month samsung has shown real creativity in solving the problem of cramming a decent music player and phone into one small gadget the slim upstage has been designed with two distinct faces on one side it has a phone keypad and a small screen for making voice calls and tapping out text messages but if you turn it over you see a larger screen and navigation controls mainly for playing music but also for other tasks such as viewing online data at the same time sprint is slashing the price of songs sold on its proprietary music service from an outrageous &# each to just cents that isnt quite as cheap as it seems because you have to pay &# a month for the privilege of buying the cent songs but its still a positive step for consumers ive been testing the upstage and found that its two sided design works pretty well its a better music phone in my opinion than verizons chocolate model built by samsungs korean rival lg but the upstage has too many weaknesses and compromises for me to recommend it it has lousy battery life both as a phone and as a music player a limitation sprint and samsung have tried to offset with a free add on that makes the phone too bulky and it comes with so little memory that out of the box it can hold only around average songs adding more capability costs extra thus lessening the price advantage there are other downsides as well i tested the upstage primarily as a music player because thats its claim to fame i compared it with the base model ipod nano which also costs &# although of course it doesnt include a phone i did try out the basic phone stuff like making calls all of which seemed ok though the screen on the phone side of the device is very small a sort of throwback to early cellphones sound quality reception and the keypad all were fine the built in megapixel camera is standard for phones these days only one of the phones two screens can be used at any one time and you have to press a "flip" button on the side to switch this worked well but was kind of a pain when i was trying to use the keypad to type in text like a web password or the name of a new song playlist on the music side of the phone i had to flip to the side with the keypad and then flip back i loaded in about songs and the upstage played them back pretty well displaying all the correct song information and album art i also loaded in some photos which also displayed fine though the phone can handle only small picture files i purchased a song from sprints music service and that downloaded and played well the only problems were that the album covers and photos looked grainy because even the larger screen has pretty low resolution and occasionally the start of a song was clipped the ipod nano exhibits neither of these problems out of the box the upstage comes with only a tiny memory card which can hold only around standard mp files the ipod nano can hold of those files to get the same capacity on the upstage you have to buy a larger &# memory card though the upstage is bigger than the ipod nano it has far worse battery life just hours of talk time for the phone and seven hours of music playback time compared with up to hours of music playback time for the nano to compensate sprint is throwing in a "battery wallet " a case with an additional battery built in this brings the talk time to hours and music playback time to around hours but it makes the phone twice as thick there are two other problems with the upstage first synchronizing its music with songs stored on a pc requires you to install and use sprint music software it doesnt work with windows media player or the windows version of apple itunes which most music lovers already own you also can manually drag and drop songs onto the phones memory card second the navigation pad on the music side of the phone can be confusing it works by touch controls you have to use just the right pressure and slide your finger just the right distance along its sides to get it to work right its too complicated samsung and sprint deserve credit for a good try with the upstage but it doesnt quite cut it email me at mossberg wsj com see video versions of my reviews at wsj com mossbergvideo
