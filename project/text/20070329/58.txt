kerry gets his man john kerry permitted himself a moment of celebration yesterday after the white house withdrew the nomination of sam fox as u s ambassador to belgium "i hope this signals " he said "a new day in political discourse " perhaps but at least senator kerrys vanities were for the moment satisfied mr fox a year old st louis businessman made a &# donation to the swift boat veterans for truth in for this transgression mr kerry subjected him to a lengthy sermon interrogation before the senate foreign relations committee in february the nomination stalled in the intervening weeks with mr kerrys opposition spreading in solidarity to other democratic committee members particularly presidential aspirants barack obama and chris dodd the fracas was drawn out further when mr kerry demanded in a written questionnaire that mr fox apologize or otherwise pay obeisance to his lingering resentments he declined this unwillingness to "embrace the truth " as mr kerry put it convinced the democrats that mr fox was unacceptable none of this of course was at all pertinent to mr foxs credentials to serve still with the nomination set to go down the withdrawal came less than an hour before the committee was to convene the swift boat allegations were no doubt contentious but they are of a piece with the contemporary bipartisan standards of adversarial politics senator kerrys inability to move on sets an unfortunate precedent its only likely effect on the "political discourse" will be an even greater tolerance for vindictiveness
