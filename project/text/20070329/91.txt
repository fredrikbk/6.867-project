sanyo ends era of family rule president steps down as owners push to shed weak businesses faster tokyo to understand the problems facing japans electronics industry look no further than sanyo electric co the midsize electronics company is cracking from the strain of trying to stay in too many businesses it has a sprawling portfolio of products ranging from chips to batteries to home appliances it also builds homes owns an internet service provider offers financial and recruiting services and even operates a retirement home and a golf course the reluctance to shed weak and noncore businesses has resulted in diluted profit last year sanyo received a &# billion bailout from a consortium led by goldman sachs group inc since it began restructuring in sanyo has cut more than of its work force closed factories and shed some minor businesses yet the company continues to be unprofitable as it has been unable to stem revenue declines in products such as digital cameras mobile phones televisions and home appliances it is expected to report its third straight year of losses in the current business year ending saturday yesterday sanyos year old president toshimasa iue said he would step down after less than two years because of disagreements with goldman sachs and the other financial firms who have majority control over the company and have been pushing for faster changes the departure of mr iue who is a grandson of sanyos founder ends the familys leadership of the company and opens the door to a sale of some units "i was unable to gain the trust of the financial firms and investors that are crucial to sanyos recovery " mr iue said at a news conference adding that the slow speed of the overhaul was a major point of contention goldman sachs declined to comment last week sanyos chairwoman tomoyo nonaka also resigned ms nonaka a former television journalist had been appointed in with the aim of bringing in an outsider with a fresh perspective mr iues successor seiichiro sano currently vice president is expected to act more aggressively to turn around the company particularly with divestitures though he was noncommittal yesterday "as for the issue of selling our mobile phone and digital camera operations this is not something that can be decided lightly i am still settling on a plan for fiscal " mr sano said like many japanese electronics companies sanyo is in too many different businesses and cant let go since the company was founded years ago as a bicycle lamp maker it has continued to add new products and services without getting rid of weak businesses that is because it didnt want to lay off workers by closing operations it didnt want to shed businesses that were started by the revered founder and it wanted to remain in mainstay domestic products such as rice cookers and televisions having vast portfolios allows companies to take profits from successful businesses to move into new growth businesses but it also limits the resources that can be devoted to any one product meanwhile the ability to spread losses across the company to minimize the impact also puts off a sense of crisis as a result of this grow at any cost strategy sanyo has become weak and unfocused aside from batteries of which it has top market share sanyo is a small player in most of its products it ranks th in mobile phones with less than a global market share and th in flat panel lcd televisions according to market research firm isuppli corp it is losing market share to taiwanese rivals in digital cameras its sales for the year ended march were down to about &# billion in the first three quarters of the current year which ends saturday sales fell sanyo said in november that it expects to post a loss of about &# million this year reversing earlier expectations for a profit in mobile phones an area that sanyo has identified as crucial to its revival it was late in launching an ultraslim phone overseas that hurt sanyo which was already handicapped by its size compared with giants such as nokia corp which has more than a market share in the flat panel television market sanyo has become an also ran squeezed in the middle between low cost chinese manufacturers and top companies such as samsung electronics co of south korea sony corp and matsushita electric industrial co the problems facing sanyo are more severe than those affecting the rest of japans electronics industry but its bigger rivals are facing similar difficulties pulling out of weak businesses that means japanese companies end up being too small in each product segment to become a market leader says fumiaki sato a deutsche bank ag analyst who recently wrote a book on restructuring the electronics industry they are "in an uneasy place in the middle " he says meanwhile the domestic market is crowded with more than a dozen competitors in a single product in mobile phones sanyo competes with other firms for a small slice of the japanese market which is about of the global market in rice cookers eight companies are vying for a share of a &# million market such heavy focus on the hypercompetitive domestic market weakens the companies ability to compete globally it has led to a decline in profitability across the industry since the early s the heyday of japanese electronics makers says mr sato analysts say sanyo still has an opportunity to recover but it must start aggressively shedding more businesses sanyo created a wholly owned chip company last year as a precursor to selling that business many industry observers say it should also consider selling its appliance and mobile phone businesses before they become too weak to attract any interest "it was unsustainable for sanyo to have the same number of products as bigger companies like matsushita " says tatsuya mizuno an analyst with fitch ratings "sanyo will get cash by selling some of these businesses so they should take advantage of that while they can and focus its resources on a few products where it can make a difference " jay alabaster contributed to this article
