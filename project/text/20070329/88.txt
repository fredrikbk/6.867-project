politics &amp economics paris clashes shape frances political agenda echoes of suburban unrest sharpen campaigns focus on law and order paris clashes between police and rioters at a paris train station this week a vivid reminder of the violence that gripped frances troubled suburbs in are thrusting the issue of law and order to the forefront of the countrys presidential campaign the plight of frances poverty stricken banlieues where protesters months ago burned cars and looted stores to protest second class treatment lack of jobs and poor housing had already emerged as a key campaign issue ahead of the april first round of voting candidates of all political stripes including socialist segolene royal and centrist francois bayrou have flocked to these largely immigrant areas in past weeks encouraged by statistics suggesting banlieue residents will vote in record numbers this year politicians have wooed them with vague proposals to boost jobs and improve schools but tuesdays riots are likely to establish the debate more firmly around law and order that shift could in turn shape the elections outcome to the extent it eclipses other pressing issues such as pensions unemployment or european integration as candidates move into the final stretch of the campaign "if the police dont enforce a minimum of order what is the role of the police " conservative candidate nicolas sarkozy said on france info radio yesterday mr sarkozy who this week resigned as interior minister to focus on the campaign was responding to criticism from the french media over police handling of the clashes on tuesday afternoon agents stopped a passenger for traveling without a ticket at gare du nord station which serves several banlieues north of paris dozen of youths quickly gathered around when the crowd got rowdy riot police fired tear gas and charged clubs in hand the melee lasted into the night for many in france the countrys so called sensitive districts embody the woes that plague the worlds fifth largest economy high unemployment decaying public services and social segregation they also highlight the rapidly changing makeup of frances population first and second generation immigrant families number high among the six million people or of frances population who live in low income suburbs with the memory of the october riots still fresh in their minds banlieue residents have signed up in large numbers to vote in this years election the second and final round of which will be held may "i skipped the ballot but i will vote this time around " said ibrahim samake a mali born year old resident of franconville a suburb north of paris who says he hasnt had a job for the past three years "we cant let others decide for us " at argenteuil a suburb near franconville where a third of the population lives in subsidized housing projects more people have registered to vote than in when the last presidential contest was held in the nearby suburb of pantin some new voters have registered compared with five years ago the average national increase is although the difference in figures may also reflect differences in population growth among areas lured by the possibility of a new basket of votes socialist candidate ms royal has visited banlieues across france several times in just the past few weeks she walked around the snake like five story housing projects in pantin that house people mainly immigrants from north and west africa mr bayrou the centrist candidate and left wing candidate jose bove have also recently visited banlieues "theyre here nearly every day its like a disneyland parade " says meftah benaissa a bulldozer driver from algeria who lives in val dargent a sprawling housing project that shelters of argenteuils residents and where the jobless rate is double the national average in the beginning ms royal and mr sarkozy offered up some proposals to improve the economic and social conditions of the people living in the banlieues the socialist candidate suggested improving the quality of public schools while mr sarkozy said he would create a "marshall plan" to provide job training for all young people without a diploma but in recent weeks as the election draws near the candidates had already started to tout security and patriotism as solutions to the banlieue problem it is a shift in rhetoric that political analysts say is likely to pick up in the wake of the gare du nord clashes the shift is aimed at frances mainly white voting majority but also at residents of "sensitive areas " "in the impoverished suburbs there is a deep aspiration for social justice but also for law and order " says jean daniel levy a political analyst with csa polling agency mr levy and other political analysts say the candidates renewed focus on law and order reflects an effort by mainstream parties to reach out to voters throughout france including in the banlieues who supported far right leader jean marie le pen in and might do so again but many people in the banlieues fear that deeper problems like the need for better living conditions and public services might now not get addressed "the suburbs require concrete answers to solve concrete problems of unemployment education and segregation " says karim zeribi an expert on equal opportunity programs who advises frances state railway company mr sarkozy and ms royal are leading in the polls with each expected to garner about of the popular vote in the first round according to the latest survey by tns sofres polling agency mr bayrou who hasnt given specific banlieue proposals is a distant third at mr sarkozy who has faced criticism that the get tough policies he advocated after the riots have stoked unrest and alienated police from youths and immigrants in impoverished suburbs earlier this month proposed a "ministry of immigration and national identity " saying france wont be able to integrate new waves of immigrants unless it gives them a set of core french values critics have assailed the idea saying it singles out immigrants and brings back memories of world war ii when frances vichy government set up a bureau of jewish affairs ms royal is stepping up her calls for what she defines as a "fair order" and her proposals arent going down very well either the socialist candidate who hopes to become the first woman president of france has proposed military training for young delinquents more recently she proposed that households display a french flag at their windows on bastille day and learn the lyrics of la marseillaise the national anthem "i can buy a flag but hows that going to bring down unemployment here " says mr benaissa the bulldozer driver in argenteuil
