home &amp family cranky consumer seeing if banks are any nicer we find out if service is truly a top priority free coffee and couches special to the wsj in recent times several big banks have been claiming that theyve rediscovered customer service in new york city at least this is showing up in trivial ways such as a notable absence of bulletproof glass and greeters saying hello to customers as they walk into local branches some are even installing couches and tvs and playing pop music to encourage people to linger and perhaps pick up the pamphlets about banking services that they leave scattered around the souped up amenities are aimed at making banks seem less cold and institutional and a bit more nice and neighborly elsewhere in cities around the country bank brand atms seem to be popping up all over the place from atm only retail outlets to drugstores and supermarkets all in the name of convenient cash this is all fine and dandy but when it comes to the important things such as answering customers questions having plenty of tellers available and being upfront and not overly aggressive about fees have banks really changed their ways and when you get past the window dressing of bank branches that resemble airport lounges is there really much difference from one big bank to the next in terms of what they can do for you we visited five banks to ask about opening an account we told them wed need three checking accounts one for each person in a married couple and a joint account linked to each and that wed also have a savings account several money market accounts an ira and a brokerage account worth more than a hundred thousand dollars combined we asked what advantage there would in bringing all those assets to the bank in one bundle then we sized up the bank by its ambience how knowledgeable and helpful the account managers were and what they offered us to address our banking needs sure we realize that everyone from a bank to a boyfriend is on their best behavior when theyre courting you and theres no way to predict what surprise fees might pop up or what changes a bank will make to its account terms after youve gone through the trouble of depositing your money to be sure there are distinct differences between the banks some target customers with small balances and dont provide any incentive for those with multiple accounts and diverse needs to bundle their money with them others court higher end customers by offering access to financial advisers some bankers were better at listening and asking questions while others immediately pitched the accounts their bank wanted to promote we found out that banks are making a genuine effort to be more friendly but that some of those efforts like piping in prince tunes or adding stylish lounges dont make up for staffers who listen and products that make our financial lives easier in fact sometimes the funkiness can even be a distraction write cranky wsj com bank bank of america retail ambience a seating area near the atms with free coffee and cnn had the impersonal feel of an airport lounge stark white walls and tellers behind glass at the rear end of the bank didnt help customer service a quasi greeter at the front of the bank asked us what we needed and fetched an account manager most of the staff was away for the day but a small business rep who also lived in the neighborhood was chatty and made an effort to help us though he clearly didnt know more than the basics about the banks retail services product service offerings the rep told us about a checking account for customers with higher balances but neglected to mention a wealth management suite of services that would better suit our needs we asked for information to take with us and got a black and white "schedule of fees" that amounted to a lot of fine print comment its trying to be both a capable behemoth and a friendly local bank and hasnt quite found the right balance we werent confident that we would know exactly what we were signing up for if we opened accounts here bank chase retail ambience most like a traditional impersonal bank with a row of glassed in tellers and another row of gray cubicles least inviting and most intimidating bank in our test customer service the account manager began by asking us about ourselves and what we were looking for in a bank when he found out we wanted to move our "whole relationship" over he got even friendlier introducing us to a financial adviser they seemed to know the neighborhood and the regular customers and actually had a conversation with us about why customer service is important things we didnt expect given the banks impersonal appearance product service offerings it seemed like we heard a well rehearsed sales pitch but we also got the sense that bank staff was experienced at handling customers with multiple accounts and complex needs we liked that there was a full time investment adviser at our branch that we could get to know and trust we also liked that wed be able to leverage the total balance in our several accounts to get better service and fewer fees comment despite the slick sales pitch we liked the effort they made to provide continuity and knowledgeable service at the branch level bank commerce bank retail ambience change counting machines greeters and glass free teller stations with no lines make the branches feel less intimidating and impersonal than a traditional bank customer service service was friendly but off the mark when we told the greeter we wanted to open an account she told us we could do so for as little as &# we asked to talk with someone and the account manager told us the same thing we inquired about transferring our ira and brokerage accounts and she told us eagerly that they had iras but shed never opened one for a customer then she handed us a brochure with an number to call product service offerings a la carte offerings are great for smaller customers but dont provide an incentive for bundling several larger accounts here that we seemingly couldnt get help with services beyond basic banking at the branch level was also discouraging comment a good option for a college age or recently graduated son or daughter who has small balances and simple banking needs and doesnt want to be penalized for not holding jumbo balances in the bank bank hsbc retail ambience a giant map on the wall showing world wide offices is a reminder that this a global behemoth first and foremost a long line for tellers and too many pillars and tall white cubicle walls made the branch seem busy and hard to navigate but we realized later that the arrangement provided privacy for conversations with the bankers customer service an account manager asked us what we needed and after we described our situation turned us over to a "premier relationship" manager we sensed that he was giving us a routine pitch but he asked several times if we had questions and listened to our questions he followed up a week later by phone as promised but wasnt pesky product service offerings we would benefit from the cumulative clout of our accounts here for better service and rates the bank uses its international reach to emphasize travel and relocation services for its higher end customers too comment the best choice for international travelers or expats who like knowing they can walk into a branch of their own bank while abroad it seemed up to the task of handling sophisticated clients and providing one on one service at the branch level bank washington mutual retail ambience it took us a few minutes to realize that the women standing at a circle of free standing computer stations in the middle of the bank were tellers perhaps we were distracted by the brightly painted walls and pop music customer service a helpful account rep wanted to tell us all about inexpensive accounts for people with low balances with some prodding she told us about accounts for customers with larger sums of money after further prodding she suggested we talk to the financial adviser who happened to be on site that day about brokerage services he told us about a premium brokerage account we might want product service offerings there didnt seem to be any way to bundle our banking and investment accounts together as leverage for better banking terms the financial adviser assured us that if there was an unacceptable banking fee he could talk to a branch manager and have it waived but we didnt relish the thought of having fees levied and then rescinded on a one off basis comment the banks attempts to be funky and unique are fun but can leave you feeling bewildered with no incentive for bundling all your banking why would you even bother corrections &amp amplifications the commerce bank branch reviewed in the
