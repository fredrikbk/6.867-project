politics &amp economics republican hopefuls vie for tax cutters support top candidates try to offset concerns over social issues washington in the republican presidential race appeals to economic conservatives could prove crucial as all three leading candidates face doubts from social conservatives the bidding begins in earnest today when former massachusetts gov mitt romney becomes the first major candidate in the field to unveil a tax cut plan a staple of republican primary debates since ronald reagan transformed the partys fiscal priorities in the campaign that comes as former new york mayor rudy giuliani this week gained the endorsement of publisher steve forbes who won an enduring following among the partys economic base when he campaigned for president on a flat tax platform in the partys third top tier candidate arizona sen john mccain appears to have largely written off the most ardent antitax advocates just as he has accepted hell never attract some leaders of the religious right he alone among the trio has rejected full repeal of the estate tax which conservatives refer to as the "death tax " and he alone will skip the annual economic meeting of the club for growth a conservative economic advocacy group that opens today in palm beach fla aides say he will be in iraq mr romney will use the platform to announce a new tax plan that will include marginal tax rate cuts a corporate rate cut and savings incentives according to a person close to the romney campaign the competition for the mantle of top tax cutter could be crucial if antiabortion and other activists seek another champion as many are threatening to do "giuliani has to be pro tax cuts it is the only thing that would even keep him in the race " said tony fabrizio a republican strategist the candidate has a record of endorsing gun control gay rights and abortion rights "if he went south on taxes that would be the absolute ending " mr fabrizio said on some issues the three leading candidates agree they all argue that taxes should be kept low and that president bushs and tax cuts should be extended all three refer often to president reagan and his theory of supply side economics which holds that tax cuts stimulate the economy democrats meanwhile have attacked the bush tax cuts and some have suggested rolling at least part of them back to pay for other priorities john edwards for instance has called for rescinding the tax breaks for upper income individuals in order to fund universal health care influential conservative groups are beginning to agitate for additional tax cuts from republicans and broad tax overhauls as the price for their endorsement "in a successful republican campaign will have to say im not going to let the taxes go up and heres my front and center tax cut that excites people " said grover norquist president of americans for tax reform which has asked all the candidates to sign a pledge vowing not to raise taxes mr romney is so far the only one of the main candidates to do so "i really believe gov romney will be the pro growth tax cutting candidate in this race " said cesar conda an adviser to mr romney and a former domestic policy adviser to vice president dick cheney in addition to mr conda mr romney has assembled several of president bushs former advisers and chief tax cutters including glenn hubbard who chaired the council of economic advisers during mr bushs first term and n gregory mankiw who succeeded mr hubbard but mr romney has some troubles with economic conservatives the cato institute a libertarian think tank gave mr romney a "c" grade on his fiscal policy as governor saying he increased state fees and proposed corporate tax increases "weve got grave reservations about the health care plan that he helped to pass in massachusetts " says pat toomey head of the club for growth many tax cutters may lean to mr giuliani who has been reminding audiences that he cut or eliminated taxes times while mayor of new york "if you lower taxes and you do it intelligently and you do it in a planned way and you do it with a little bit of prediction in mind you actually collect more money than if you raise taxes " mr giuliani said in a speech to stanford universitys hoover institution last month his economic adviser michael boskin of hoover says mr giuliani is "a pro growth fiscal conservative" who helped revive new york citys economy and "turned a large &# billion deficit into a large surplus " mr mccain has long had an uneasy relationship with the partys tax cutting wing although he has been a voice for fiscal restraint his emphasis has been more on curbing deficits and containing spending one of his signature issues in the senate has been attacking pork barrel spending mr mccains chief advisers hew more from the deficit hawk wing of the republican party including two former heads of the congressional budget office douglas holtz eakin and dan crippen in the campaign sen mccain offered his own tax cut proposals and attacked then gov bushs larger proposals as reckless after mr bush became president mr mccain cast votes against tax cut proposals in and arguing that they benefited the rich over the middle class and that the country needed to be spending more money on military readiness "if you want to be consistent with the republican goals of keeping the private sector free of the burden of a large government our biggest threat today is future spending " says an adviser to mr mccain "every dollar you spend shows up in a tax increase down the road the best tax cutter in the party today is the one who would keep spending down " a candidate once again mr mccain is now making a nod to the tax cutters he says he now supports extending the bush tax cuts when they expire in and he is considering proposing some type of tax overhaul which could include revenue neutral tax cuts and while he doesnt support repealing the estate tax an adviser said he is in favor of making it less burdensome so that it only affects those of "extraordinary wealth " still mr mccain continues to battle conservative economic groups he has blamed the republicans loss of the senate in on the club for growth saying it unfairly targeted former republican sen lincoln chafee of rhode island "im not sure what the club for growth and i have really in common " he said in an interview with the christian broadcast network the club for growth responded with an internet ad saying it wasnt sure either
