a cricket legends strange sudden exit that cricket finds itself on these pages is warning enough that something big and probably unpleasant has happened to it youre not wrong for last week on march in room of jamaicas pegasus hotel a maid came upon not only the lifeless body of bob woolmer the english coach of pakistan but possibly crickets jfk moment within days police announced he had been murdered where were you its some tale and here is some trivia his death occurred five days into crickets showpiece the world cup it came barely a day after one of the sports greatest upsets debutante ireland as synonymous with cricket as enron is with credibility and composed of postmen and teachers who play cricket part time beat woolmers team traditional powerhouse and world champion pakistan it was americas miracle on ice buster busting tyson and argentina beating the dream team at the olympiad all in one and on st patricks day murder is no way to go but a loss to ireland spoke poorly as the last act of a man considered one of crickets genuine radicals if there is a left field in this often straight laced game then woolmer was an inhabitant in the mid s he evolved the once nonexistent then peripheral role of the coach while in charge of south africa hinting to cricket that it too could contain a vince lombardi or a phil jackson off field men intrinsic to their teams on field success entire matches were recorded analyzed laptops used as often as sports scientists innovative training drills were constructed though often it was said that woolmer went too far as when he tried to communicate with his team during play via an earpiece but south africa was successful and woolmer was feted having nudged cricket into modernity when he came to pakistan in june woolmers peak was past though the prospect was delicious one of crickets more orderly scientific minds working with the sports confirmed schizoid team champions one day clowns the next for a while through the matchup worked as woolmer helped galvanize the players and pakistan bubbled with a series of heady triumphs but the last seven months of woolmers tenure were maddening his team lurching from crisis to controversy slipping from grace so speedily that britney spears might have shivered pakistan became the first international team in years to forfeit a test match two leading players tested positive for steroids got banned and were subsequently exonerated results suffered tensions rose one of the last images of woolmer before the world cup was the coachs televised spat with his own leading star shoaib akhtar crickets denis rodman for showmanship and drama but not the cross dressing a despairing crescendo built up until all the madness the drama the tragedy gushed out in the caribbean the curse of the irish capping off pakistans worst campaign woolmers death further blackening it hectic schedules prevented woolmer from spending enough time in pakistan to be loved or hated there had they known the genial worldly raconteur of cricket tales his evangelical zeal for the game his approachable manner and keen eye for cultural traits he often muttered inshallah or god willing in times of uncertainty as pakistanis are prone to do their attachment to him might have been stronger instead he was respected when times were good but a surplus foreigner when bad initially after pakistans loss to ireland fans vented in time honored fashion players effigies were burnt and chants called for players and woolmers heads barely had the anger been exorcised when news of his death filtered through immediately anger became guilty grieving and woolmer was transformed into a martyr of sorts who had taken the loss so to his heart that he died as a result duly he was conferred a lofty civilian honor by the president when it emerged after two autopsies that murder was the case anxiety took over drawing rooms sidewalks schools streets television and teashops became dens for gossip and speculation about a crime miles continents and oceans away pakistan became a nation of amateur sleuths and armchair critics many wondered whether the pakistan players were suspects as did the international media why fingerprint them was it really murder why did it take pakistan four days to send help to the players and of the diplomatic rather than legal kind was woolmers murder connected to match fixing the practice of fixing performances or games by players with illegal bookies in tow which so blighted cricket in the late s big banks and bigger soft drinks canned their cricket based campaigns the team was poor woolmers demise morbid and cricket offered no happy vibe gradually as the investigations dragged headlines lessened every passing day normality and anger returned when the players finally arrived back in pakistan over a week after woolmers death fans taunted them caring little that they were deeply traumatized after losing someone close the luckier players slipped away at the airport through back exits dazed the world cup continues in mind body but not spirit cricket goes on for it is no virgin to scandal and darkness cricketers have murdered and been murdered historian david frith notes that the suicide rate among cricketers is disproportionately high at last count he had documented over cases drugs recreational or performance enhancing have reared their heads periodically over two decades on field confrontations are not scarce players have attacked fans and political crises are never far match fixing to which woolmers murder is persistently but not definitively linked shook the game to its very core the last time cricket was a gentlemans game was when men wore top hats yet has there been anything quite like this as sudden as macabre and with as great an immediate impact beyond cricket maybe even sports the murder of a high profile coach of a high profile team after a high profile loss during the sports highest profile tournament still the mind boggles crickets fraternity says too often in cases of gamesmanship a breach of spirit or mass scandal that its just not cricket its been said this past week too though truth be told never has that phrase seemed so inadequate mr samiuddin is pakistan editor of cricinfo com
