politics &amp economics bush defensive on iraq blames congress washington president bush is on the defensive in the political war over iraq as polls and this weeks senate pullout vote show his strategy for turning things around is patterned after bill clintons showdown with the then republican congress shift blame to lawmakers for failing to fund the troops in recent days mr bush has accused democrats of trying to "score political points" with critics by passing an iraq war funding bill that would "undermine the gains our troops are making on the ground " he says he would veto any bill that sets detailed timelines for withdrawing u s forces next year his veto backed by republican lawmakers almost certainly would be sustained yesterday mr bush launched an even more pointed attack as lawmakers wrangle about provisions that have little chance of becoming law "the clock is ticking for our troops in the field " mr bush said in a speech here to a cattlemens group "funding for our forces in iraq will begin to run out in mid april members of congress need to stop making political statements and start providing vital funds for our troops " democrats dismiss much of the white house rhetoric as an attempt to manipulate public sympathy for hard pressed u s troops in iraq democrats note that contrary to white house warnings top defense officials recently said that current funds should last at least until the end of april then "the white house spin machine took over and they started saying ah we need this bill yesterday " senate majority leader harry reid of nevada said as debate on the bill began "they keep changing their operation " last years supplemental war funding bill didnt pass until mid june democrats say they and not the white house are in tune with the publics sentiment they point to recent polls showing majorities of americans supporting a timeline for withdrawing u s troops the key for the white house is persuading the public that congressional democrats tug of war with mr bush is tantamount to cutting off funds for the war effort which many americans oppose the longer the congressional debate persists the riskier the democrats position becomes some veteran democrats say the situation is beginning to bear an uncomfortable resemblance to the partisan clash that led to a shutdown of the federal government in late and politically damaged the new republican majorities in congress back then republicans allowed a budget dispute with president clinton to escalate to the point that federal employees were furloughed and many basic government services were halted such as renewing passports and issuing veterans disability checks the standoff in which many observers say republicans overreached helped mr clinton regain his political momentum setting him up for re election the next year "look the american people expect you to fight for what you believe in " says leon panetta mr clintons chief of staff in "but they dont expect you to be stupid about it if in the end this is going to hurt our troops democrats have got to be very careful theres a point at which they are going to have to compromise " in some respects the risks for democrats now are greater than they were for republicans in to win passage of their funding bill in the house last week democrats were forced to freight it with unrelated domestic spending for items such as peanut storage more fundamentally even a temporary suspension of war funding could lead to a "humanitarian catastrophe" in iraq says michael ohanlon a brookings institution expert on military funding depending on how long the funding stalemate lasts democrats could even find themselves being blamed for unrelated security problems despite the dangers for democrats some veterans of the shutdown including former house speaker newt gingrich say the white house faces big disadvantages that mr clinton didnt the war is an increasingly unpopular cause even among republican lawmakers and some of mr bushs grass roots conservative base that coupled with mr bushs inflexibility on strategy and tactics means the president has less room to maneuver politically than mr clinton did "mr bush has got to play a very limited hand" focusing on the risks to u s troops and the military operation mr gingrich says "if he makes it bush versus congress hell lose " at the same time some observers say democrats arent likely to be as inflexible as newly empowered republicans were in mr ohanlon suggests the smart play for democrats might be to postpone the fight until the fall when war funding for is considered but for now democrats appear as committed to their battle plan in washington as mr bush is to his plan for baghdad "the president must change course " said mr reid "and this legislation will allow him to do that "
