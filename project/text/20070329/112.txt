wonder land packet politics the thing i like most about the "hillary " political ad on youtube isnt the face shrouded in a ghastly pixel haze but the voice her voice recedes into a weird unreal echo truth to tell you could insert any of the faces imploring us now to make them president and achieve the same effect if youre still playing catch up go into youtube com search "hillary" and watch in wonder it took some days after it posted on youtube for the non web media to confer legitimacy on the one minute second clip calling it a potential "conflict" between the hillary and obama camps days later after claiming ownership of the video political pro phil de vellis wrote on the huffington post that hed done the ad in a sunday afternoon on his mac with "some software " he said theres more where that came from "the game has changed " hes right but it began a long time ago the change came some years back when the u s defense department bought into a suggestion by electrical engineer paul baran the son of a grocery store owner that it build a data transmission network based on "packet switching " this was the internet as someone whos on the web too many hours i have wondered what changing screens hundreds of times each day to access different gobs of "information" has done to the way our brains order the world which is known as human consciousness this "change" is having a material effect on just about everything else why not on who gets elected president next year in an eon ago steve g steinberg wrote a prescient article in wired magazine on the battle between what he called bellheads and netheads this was essentially an argument over the network design of the web between engineers for the established phone companies the bellheads and the anarchic engineers of the web netheads it was a war between the old world of circuit switching and the new world of packet switching the one we inhabit today this may have been an arcane argument among engineers but the grander philosophical claims then were justified what was at stake as mr steinberg accurately predicted was "very different visions" of how we communicate the engineers were changing how we think for more than a century we were conditioned by the world of lily tomlins famous telephone switchboard operator ernestine ernestines "switch" was a circuit switch which means it connects a directly to b conversation or faxed data travels in a predetermined channel packet switching could hardly be more different information departs point a but then breaks into pieces or packets and bounces around a shared network almost randomly then somehow arrives together at point b the packet is a bundle of electrons but "packet" is an apt metaphor for how the technology has changed us rather than sit still to fully absorb a copper wires stiff stream of information we flip through screens sorting fragments of data into a final thought or solution like it or not i dislike a lot of it this is how most of us now live and think viacom is suing youtube because youtubers are extracting five minute clips of the best parts of "the daily show " why waste minutes today the bellheads are long form tv traditional political ads minute cds two hour movies predetermined a to b formats newspapers are in fact a collection of "packets " a subject for another time the netheads are youtube shared playlists remixed videos the idea of personal choice and randomly arriving political ads such as "hillary " that netheads are chop shopping "the daily show" or "the colbert report" is ironic but as the yoda of old media walter cronkite said "thats the way it is " prepackaging versus packets and so in politics one of the conundrums of politics now is why rudy giulianis polling lead for the gop nomination is not just strong but persistent conventional wisdom holds it will fall when "conservative" voters learn his full biography and liberal social views how could they not have heard an alternative explanation is that voters are "processing" mr giuliani differently packet switching is what allows us to flip effortlessly through torrents of data on web screens holding in mind a basic search goal by now this experience has forced more people than ever to think in terms of hierarchies how to sort through lots of information and assign values the way we quickly separate the flood of email into levels of importance by now we all have an intel inside this may be why mr giuliani is getting away with his social views in the gop weve become so adept at assigning value to good and bad information in searches that we can do it for a "flawed" candidate like rudy giuliani faced with an array of rudy "packets" the anti terror reputation three marriages abortion and all the rest gop voters have already sorted the data put anti terror at the top of the hierarchy and are comfortable giving the social issues relatively lower values still relevant but mid range this is how we do work now every day why should it not affect politics if it is true that our political thinking is being bent by constant streams of small value laden packets of data that we constantly remix into personal hierarchies then paradoxically the "new" politics of web sites such as moveon org or the daily kos are really old school like bellheads who originated deep in the last century the leftwing sites think politics is still straight and simple "pull the plug" on iraq "enact universal health care " for sites on the right the one answer is the fence to stopper mexico but political reality is more fluid and contingent than ever before the big solution is wholly alien to the packet switching political mindset now nancy pelosi thought the iraq vote was a slam dunk in fact her caucus broke into a random array of views on iraq that final vote has about as much stability as a web page some say ads such as "hillary " are democratizing politics but thats just hardware more sellers throwing stuff at us the bigger change is happening inside the publics mental software no poll can capture how the voting mind is processing the political inbox today whats not to like about that write to henninger wsj
