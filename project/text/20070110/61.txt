meredith to buy interactive ad agencies purchases to augment publishers new focus on marketing services in a sign of how the once sharp dividing line between the media world and madison avenue is disappearing publisher and broadcaster meredith corp today will announce its acquisition of two interactive marketing agencies giving it a significant presence in the ad world meredith whose magazine titles include better homes and gardens family circle and ladies home journal is spending an undisclosed sum to acquire los angeles based digital ad agency genex and arlington va word of mouth marketing firm new media strategies the acquisitions follow merediths purchase of los angeles based interactive marketing agency ogrady meyers whose clients include nestle last april the latest deals are the strongest signal to date that meredith confronting slowing growth in its core publishing and television businesses is broadening its focus to include marketing services one of the fastest growing parts of the advertising industry even after these purchases the des moines iowa company is still on the prowl for other acquisitions to round out its marketing services offerings says stephen lacy merediths president and chief executive "we believe the marketing services area will have a faster growth rate than either of the two traditional media businesses " mr lacy says meredith owns magazines and tv stations publishing accounted for about of the companys &# billion in revenue for fiscal which ended june the strategy pits meredith against most of the big ad holding companies such as omnicom group and wpp group which lately have been pouring resources into services such as digital marketing and in store advertising such services are increasingly demanded by advertisers who are trying new techniques in response to changes in media meredith plays down its competitive threat to ad agencies saying it wont enter the creative side of advertising still there used to be a clear division between media outlets such as newspapers magazines and tv stations which sold ad time or space and ad agencies which designed and placed the ads on behalf of marketers one reason the potential for conflicts of interest if an ad agency owned by a media company was seen to be unfairly directing ads to its sibling media outlets but the line has been fading for some time publishers such as conde nast with vogue magazine and wenner media with rolling stone have in recent years started in house ad units to lure more advertising dollars to their titles growth of the internet has blurred the line more new media outlets such as google have expanded aggressively into ad sales while newspaper giant gannett acquired internet advertising technology firm pointroll inc in mid for their part madison avenue firms have taken tentative steps into new media last year wpp group invested in wild tangent an online game publisher with advertising capabilities and interpublic group acquired a minority stake in facebook the online social network as advertisers spend more money online they are increasingly open to being served by a new host of players says seth alpert managing director of admedia partners an investment bank that represented both genex and new media strategies in the meredith acquisitions meredith began the transition in the late s producing custom and internet related publications for companies that include clothing retailer charming shoppes daimlerchrysler carnival cruise lines and century these publications are largely marketing tools for charming shoppes for instance owner of the lane bryant fashion bug and catherines retail stores meredith produces a magazine for plus sized women called figure eventually meredith realized it could do more for those clients in the new media area if it acquired an agency "with merediths custom publishing business these guys are asking themselves what is this business really isnt that marketing " mr alpert says at the same time merediths traditional business was encountering choppy conditions ad pages at better homes and gardens merediths flagship publication fell last year compared with according to the publishers information bureau although some other titles showed increases the expansion into marketing services already has begun to pay dividends after meredith acquired ogrady meyers the agency began working with charming shoppes to create an online component for figure the site to launch this spring will include a community aspect polls and blogs the three agencies together give meredith a broad array of clients ogrady is strong in food packaged goods and health care whereas genexs clients are predominantly in the automotive financial services and technology sectors it also gives meredith a full suite of interactive marketing services including web site development and word of mouth marketing that will allow the company to compete on pitches for both traditional and digital work building these capabilities internally would have taken a long time "so we committed ourselves to the buy " says jack griffin president of meredith publishing group he adds that the move into advertising wont create conflicts for merediths traditional business because the focus of the agencies is on creating web sites and word of mouth campaigns rather than buying space in traditional media for the interactive agencies becoming part of meredith helps them compete with bigger ad companies "the business is changing you are no longer having a consistent client that wants independent nonintegrated services they want integrated services that can cross all media " says walter schild founder and ceo of genex ad notes procter &amp gamble site not so anticommercial on monday procter &amp gamble went public with details of its new social networking site for women capessa which appears on yahoo health and is designed to be a forum for women to discuss subjects such as parenting pregnancy and weight loss the site includes video accounts of women telling their personal stories p&amp gs global marketing chief jim stengel told the wall street journal that the newsite would avoid being too commercial and wouldnt run ads for p&amp g products on capessa pages apparently yahoo had a different idea on monday night some of the videos were preceded by "pre roll" ads for p&amp g products one video dubbed "after cancer a new style erikos story" was preceded by a commercial for pantene ice shine shampoo for example yesterday p&amp g said yahoo controls the advertising on the site and has the right to run pre roll ads from any advertiser on capessa and one of p&amp gs media buying firms bought ad time including "pre roll" ads on capessa through yahoo a p&amp g spokeswoman said "we provided you with inaccurate information " says robyn schroeder a p&amp g spokeswoman
