the morning brief u s airstrikes in somalia may reignite hard feelings the wall street journal online the u s s intense campaign to rid somalia of al qaeda suspects believed to be operating there marks the american militarys first action in the country in more than a decade and is drawing concern and criticism over the effects of the airstrikes days after a strike sunday by a u s air force ac gunship u s officials "declined to provide details of who or what was hit " the washington post notes in mogadishu there were reports that as many as people many of them civilians were killed in the incident but some officials suggested that these reports confused the airstrike with ongoing operations by ethiopias military in the area the post says adding that it was impossible to confirm any of the differing accounts in mogadishu or in washington news of sundays attack "immediately set off new waves of anti american anger in mogadishu somalias battle scarred capital where the united states has a complicated legacy " the new york times says "theyre just trying to get revenge for what we did to them in " deeq salad mursel a taxi driver tells the times referring to the "black hawk down" incident in which somali gunmen killed american soldiers and brought down two american helicopters in a mogadishu battle and u s military and intelligence officials tell the paper they expected more military strikes the u s campaign also runs the risk of "stoking greater instability in a region already racked by strife " even though u s defense officials have cited "credible intelligence" that al qaeda leaders were using southern somalia as a base to plan regional attacks the wall street journal adds meanwhile on wednesday u s forces launched a fresh airstrike in the southern part of the

plan response to troop increase as president bush prepared to unveil his plan for a possible surge in troop levels in iraq democrats in the house and the senate intended to introduce nonbinding resolutions opposing an increase in what the new york times calls "the most significant reconsideration of congressional support for the war since it began " while the resolutions would do nothing to actually block mr bush they would put lawmakers support or opposition to the plan on the record democrats are expected to largely back the move and senate majority leader harry reid tells the times that he expects a number of republicans to vote in favor of the resolution but white house press secretary tony snow was critical saying that while the resolution is symbolic the necessity of succeeding in iraq is "very real " the initiative comes as democratic sen edward kennedy introduced legislation to cut funding for troop levels above the already in place the los angeles times says the law would also require the president to seek congressional approval for any troop increase republican sen lindsey graham said such limitation would set a "devastating precedent " the times reports meanwhile leon panetta iraq study group member and former white house chief of staff under bill clinton said in an interview with newsweek that many military officials and even members of mr bushs

would solve the fundamental cause of violence which was the absence of national reconciliation " mr panetta tells newsweek that at the time the iraq study group was talking to officials they
