think small getting started as a real estate investor even in a sinking market carefully buying and managing properties can bring new riches the real estate bubble has burst get over it in areas that saw big home price run ups in the first half of the decade prices are stagnant or worse new home inventories are up new home builder stocks are down a kind of real estate weariness has set in whos the cocktail party boor the guy still talking about making a killing on miami beach condos smells like a buying opportunity probably not right away because theres still plenty of froth in the markets that saw the biggest price increases but soon youll see the real estate investors property vultures who buy when prices are low and then ride property manias to their crest toeing the market again even in todays uncertain climate novice real estate investors can make money especially in smaller properties that are easy to acquire and manage lets explore some options the most basic form of property investment is a so called in law unit or guesthouse on the site of your home itself sometimes attached to the main house sometimes not no one has ever gotten rich renting out such properties but they can significantly reduce the cost of homeownership renting out an in law unit for &# a month and using that money every month to pay down principal on a &# year mortgage will shave years from the mortgage term and reduce total payments by more than &# and you will be able to write off all your costs on your income taxes including depreciation on the unit up to your actual rental income just as with an in law unit renting out your weekend house is not a way to get rich many of the same numbers that applied to in law units can be applied to your weekend home although the tax situation is decidedly different first the irs gives second home landlords a very nice little present in that it allows two weeks of tax free rental income a year beyond that however the accounting can be irksome the irs doesnt want people buying second homes and disguising them as rental properties it has two criteria to determine whether the property is a second home bad or a rental good its a second home if you dont rent it out at all or if you personally use it at least two weeks a year or of the number of days the place is available for rental whichever is longer throughout much of the country the market for single family homes is seriously out of whack as prices fall and inventories rise thats changing but compared with rents prices are still quite high outstripping the ability of such properties to cover their mortgage and operating costs avoid this segment of the market unless you have a chance to buy a property at a or discount from its previous price dont think this is out of the question in the late s and early s when the government liquidated the real estate loan portfolios of bankrupt savings and loans speculators picked up properties for just dimes on the dollar managing a house that pays for itself is what its all about you can do it in one of two ways renting or "flipping " renting is a "buy and hold" strategy while flipping calls for quick turnarounds of fixer uppers that can be spruced up and sold quickly but in the current environment renting is probably the more prudent path although it can be very difficult to make a house pay for itself at todays prices thats because if your house carries an or loan the renter will have to pay more per month to rent the house than he would to buy it look at it this way theres a handsome three bedroom two bath house in tampa fla for sale at an asking price of &# if you bought it with down and a loan at your monthly payment will be about &# thats piti principal interest taxes and insurance as a landlord at a minimum youll want to budget at least &# a month in additional expenses that puts your break even point at almost &# a month thats far more than you can reasonably expect to earn where comparable properties in the same neighborhood can be rented for less than &# but it turns out that theres a similar house available less than a mile away this other house is roughly the same size the difference is this ones being taken over by its lender and the house has a mortgage loan of &# a buyer with cash can drive a hard bargain and make out very well and the worse the market the better for the buyer but dont get carried away if you simply take over an existing or note you wont make any money let the lender foreclose and take over the place then lowball the lender a housing market that saw the price of single family homes skyrocket was not quite so generous to smaller two family or multifamily properties because the universe of home buyers expanded so much in the past years the universe of renters contracted and the market for smaller rental properties contracted with them in memphis where two bedroom apartments in better neighborhoods rent from &# up to &# a month good two family properties can still be bought for far less than a one bedroom condo on either of the coasts recent prices for year old two family homes near the university of memphis main campus ranged from &# to &# monthly payments including insurance and maintenance on an &# mortgage down on the &# property come to only about &# a month so renting both units at the low end of the market would result in a positive after tax cash flow of more than &# a month upgrade the units and you can charge top of the market rents of &# a month good deals on smaller buildings can be found throughout the country even in some of the hottest markets in trendy pasadena calif where even modest homes can sell for &# to &# a square foot two three or four unit rental buildings can be bought in the &# to &# range
