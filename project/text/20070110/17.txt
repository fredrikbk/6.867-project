business bookshelf why your boss needs to care about you for a book essentially about empathy " the elements of great managing" is a little full of itself the self importance starts right on the cover "" bills itself as "the long awaited follow up to the best seller first break all the rules " but it turns out that the earlier book by marcus buckingham and curt coffman about "what the worlds greatest managers do differently" has had a few follow ups already mr buckingham has written or co written "now discover your strengths" and "the one thing you need to know " mr coffman has written "follow this path " neither man is involved in " " it turns out that the gallup organization considers "" the follow up to "first break all the rules " why because both books rely on polling information gleaned from the companys database and because the new books numerical title refers to the dozen traits shared by exceptional managers as defined by "first break all the rules " this time out gallup employees rodd wagner and james k harter are credited as the authors though its clear from the start who is really in charge messrs wagner and harters bosses the managerial "elements" discussed in "" represent were told information obtained by the investment of millions of dollars "as such they are proprietary they cannot be reprinted or reproduced in any manner without the written consent of the gallup organization " okaaaay its an awkward prohibition though if "first break all the rules" had been as influential as the company claims wed already know the precious elements by heart they seem fairly self evident in any case for instance and i paraphrase here in order to avoid the wrath of gallup attorneys "" advises us that the best managers make sure that their employees know what is expected of them and that the right materials are on hand "great managing " it turns out includes caring about employees listening to their opinions and talking to workers frequently about their progress here is where the empathy comes in such managerial recommendations do indeed sound pedestrian but they are still laudable goals for any organization and it doesnt hurt to put them between the covers of a book the authors are to be credited for at least drumming up some off the beaten track examples to buttress their message there is the story of a fiberglass factory in rio claro brazil where the manager made sure to provide not just the best safety goggles but also an infra red thermometer to measure the heat of the furnace this concern about the equipment and the work environment the authors say was interpreted by the brazilian workers and why not as a reflection of the companys genuine concern for their safety and their performance then there is the tale of the idaho falls call center where the managers caring and clowning according to the authors made the place fun and profitable given that the call centers employees are put "in a great mood" by a manager who straps on "in line skates and rolls through the center singing and playing the guitar " the case study appears to refute "the office" and ricky gervaiss career such tales are entertaining but they might come across as mere anecdote cherry picked to bring a little liveliness to what might otherwise be a rather dry run through of corporate bromides so the book teems with references to scientific studies as if we need neuroscience to understand that people employees included enjoy praise and acknowledgement the real question is how is a business supposed to persuade managers who the authors assume are always dedicated and never slackers themselves surely not the case to use these principles which amount to caring deeply about their employees apart from saying that companies should pay more attention to the quality of their line managers the only answer in "" comes from a two page chapter called "what great managers need " it turns out that "one of the most fundamental needs of a great manager is a great manager " the ellipsis is the authors own the dozen elements discussed by messrs wagner and harter all relate to "soft" skills the kind that help managers to retain employees and encourage them near the end of the book the authors devote a chapter to "the problem of pay " which they say is "an element unto itself " but is it they cite research on happiness that suggests surprisingly little correlation between income and feelings of well being thus "the power of money" works "only in combination with all the non financial drivers of employee engagement " but there are a few catches while people might not tie their happiness to income alone they are very interested in making more money than the next guy and the context of how a company pays its workers is almost as important as the pay itself "what employees enthusiastically do for the company depends heavily on what the company eagerly does for them " the authors say gallup doesnt poll employees about pay but psychological studies confirm that "more than just the money the thought counts " in other words a great manager doesnt simply offer a raise he does it with a smile thats not one of the elements and gallup doesnt claim to own it but there it is mr ackman is a writer based in jersey city n j
