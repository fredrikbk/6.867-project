politics &amp economics high court eases way for patent challenges washington the supreme court continued to reassert its oversight of patent law yesterday with a ruling that weakens intellectual property protections by making it easier for legal challenges to patents the decision put the justices on the side of those who have complained that existing rules stifle innovation and it is their latest rebuke to the specialized panel that hears patent appeals the u s court of appeals for the federal circuit for rulings skewing property rights in favor of patent holders the high court this term has also heard a separate case appealing obstacles imposed by the federal circuit against challenges to a patent on grounds that the invention is "obvious " a decision on that is pending yesterdays opinion by justice antonin scalia reversed the federal circuits rule that if a company pays royalties for a patent it forfeits the right to challenge the patents validity that has deterred companies from filing challenges because they would be at risk for treble damages for infringement if the patent were found to be valid the decision is a victory for medimmune inc a gaithersburg md pharmaceuticals company that derives about of its revenue from the respiratory tract drug at issue synagis under protest medimmune paid a royalty to genentech inc of south san francisco calif to avoid a patent infringement suit over a component antibody under a federal circuit ruling the act of paying a royalty precluded challenging the patents validity the federal circuit reasoned that since the license payment obviated an infringement suit there was no controversy between the companies in general federal courts may only decide cases and controversies not rule on theoretical disputes or issue advisory opinions justice scalia wrote that a party shouldnt have to "bet the farm" to challenge a patent he cited several prior cases where the court allowed parties to challenge laws as unconstitutional without breaking them and thus exposing themselves to criminal punishment moreover he wrote the supreme court in had decided a similar patent case by ruling that "the fact that royalties were being paid did not" make the dispute "hypothetical or abstract " the bush administration supported medimmune contending that allowing challenges would help weed out invalid patents that stifle innovation "public policy strongly favors ridding the economy of invalid patents which impede efficient licensing hinder competition and undermine incentives for innovation " the government said in a friend of the court brief the implications could be greatest for the biotechnology industry where huge profits can turn on a relatively small number of patents according to pamela samuelson co director of the center for law and technology at the university of california berkeley prof samuelson said the supreme court is telling the federal circuit to be "more balanced and less patent owner friendly " "everybody knows there are a lot of weak patents out there " she said "a lot of inventors take very substantial risks going out into a field of technology and sometimes they get their foot blown off when some patent is out there like a land mine " however some predicted a chilling effect "this decision allows companies that have taken out licenses to challenge the validity of a patent while also enjoying the benefits of that very same patent " said charles barquist a patent litigator in morrison &amp foerster llps los angeles office "medimmune turns all fundamental assumptions about the stability and finality of a patent license completely on their head " he added in a statement late yesterday "the court has upset the risk benefit calculation that underlies virtually every patent license " genentech issued as statement downplaying the significance of the ruling saying the supreme court "only addressed the threshold jurisdictional issue of whether there need to be further proceedings to finally decide this case it does not express an opinion concerning the merits of medimmunes claims against genentech " indeed medimmune general counsel william bertrand said the victory wont have an immediate impact on his companys bottom line as it has been paying royalties all along and the ruling doesnt nullify the patent at issue but it does enable resumption of the challenge eric schmidt a biotech analyst at cowen and co sees modest potential impact on genentechs future earnings from the decision an adverse decision should medimmune prevail at trial could have an impact of four cents a share on earnings he said genentech receives royalties from licensees as well as paying some royalties to the city of hope hospital in duarte calif under the patent mr schmidt said the companys annual income from all royalties is approaching &# billion a year medimmunes synagis which racked up &# billion in sales is an injectable product containing protective antibodies that help guard infants and young children against respiratory syncytial virus or rsv a common childhood infection responsible for about hospitalizations a year in the u s alone
