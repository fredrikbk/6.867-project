politics &amp economics minimum wage wrangling has parties switching roles republicans focus on health care issue democrats push tax cut playing against type in the new congress republicans are talking up health care while democrats talk up tax breaks for small business the juxtaposition is striking as the two parties haggle over what it will take to raise the federal minimum wage a democratic priority now seen as inevitable after the midterm elections democrats are embracing billions of dollars in tax breaks to ease the effect on small employers but as republican governors in california and massachusetts bring forward state plans to help uninsured families republicans in congress recognize the health care issues populist appeal and propose to help small employers deal with covering their workers the result is a three issue washington triangle that could have unintended consequences paying for small business tax breaks for example may mean tightening tax shelters for the wealthy and big corporations the action begins today when the house is poised to adopt its minimum wage bill raising the hourly rate to &# from &# the change would be phased in over two years with three cent increments in the senate finance committee chairman max baucus d mont will hold a hearing today to weigh tax breaks to help small employers especially the restaurant industry which wants a substantial acceleration in depreciation for new construction "were a small business country and my state is a small business state " mr baucus said he expects to add &# billion to &# billion in tax breaks to the senate wage bill next week hoping to trump the democrats house republicans are pushing legislation to let employers with fewer than workers seek coverage through trade association health plans that could operate on a national scale exempt from state regulation "i think that this leadership has decided to go with health care because that is the most personal decision that families make each and every day and it affects so many people " said rep eric cantor r va the deputy whip "in the last years it does seem to me that the republicans have gotten smarter in not opposing everything " said robert berenson a senior fellow at the urban institute and a former clinton administration medicare official "regarding the uninsured they have wised up and are pursuing their own solutions " powerful realtor and small business lobbies have a stake both for their members and as potential health plan sponsors chief among these is the national federation of independent business a longtime republican ally and an opponent of the clinton administrations health overhaul plan patient groups argue that the promised cost savings from ahps will come at the expense of weakening protections for the sickest state regulators oppose the intrusion on their jurisdiction and bigger insurers whose small business health plans are regulated by the states are worried that nonregulated ahps will have a competitive advantage senate republicans made some progress toward a compromise last summer but fell short of the votes needed to forestall an election year filibuster by opponents the question now is whether movement on the minimum wage can trigger a willingness to take a fresh look at ahp legislation and make the changes needed to reach agreement facing re election in mr baucus is hopeful "lets see if we can reach an agreement " he said proposing to move the minimum wage bill first and then come back to talks on the small business health plans senate majority whip richard durbin d ill also facing the voters in two years has an interest as well "were definitely optimistic " an nfib spokesman said later so far the tax side of the political equation has been overshadowed by the health care skirmishing but mr baucus is working with his ranking republican iowa sen charles grassley and also wants to come up with tax offsets to minimize the impact on the deficit the tax breaks under consideration include leasehold and expensing provisions for small employers work opportunity tax credits as well as a plan to reduce the depreciation period for new restaurant construction from years to years the year cost of the package is expected to run in the range of &# billion to &# billion about half of what congress did in
