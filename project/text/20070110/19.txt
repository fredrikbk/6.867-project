business world apples gore we can only wonder what al gore is making of his experience as the no defender of todays no backdating miscreant mr gore an apple director was a member of the special two man committee that investigated and exonerated steve jobs in the backdating matter by now we presume he is well versed in what backdating is and isnt but how easily mr gore the scourge of big pharma etc could have been the one braying about greed ceo theft the defrauding of shareholders mr jobss famed marketing magic was on display yesterday at the macworld expo in san francisco in another way his case has performed a magical feat in prompting a few more voices to question whether backdating is really the crime of the century or merely a business curiosity blown way out of proportion by poorly reasoned coverage here and there in the new yorker at the fortune magazine web site in the bloggings of law prof larry ribstein and journalist john carney the intellectual fallacies that have permeated the coverage are gradually poked away asks business week "is the world ready to see one of its greatest innovators sacrificed at the altar of the good governance gods especially when its not clear how mr jobs was enriched or his shareholders damaged " no such understanding was emoted for brocades greg reyes or comverses kobi alexander ceos indicted in backdating scandals much like apples but this is still progress much reporting has made it sound like backdating was the equivalent of executives taking erasers and white out to their paychecks to add a couple of zeroes and public understanding still suffers from this bum steer but all that backdating comes down to is a nonmaterial accounting irregularity yes readers accounting rules should be obeyed involving a defective judgment about whether "in the money" options needed to undergo expensing were still at the beginning of the so called scandal and many executives will likely end up paying a price for this poor decision but in no way does it implicate theft of shareholder money or even substantive accounting fraud here we propose to violate a cardinal newspaper ordinance that logic should never be discussed in a newspaper the beginning of all error was the medias unwarranted assumption to put a fine point on it that backdating was somebodys way of paying an employee more than um er that same somebody intended er sputter gurgle you see the problem whether options are backdated or not they must reflect the intentions of whoever designed them if im designing the package how can i intentionally design it to pay more than i intend so the claim that backdating was used to "inflate" pay compared to what can only be nonsense in any case if companies wanted to increase executive wages backdating was a needlessly baroque way of doing it they could just have handed out more options backdatings appeal had to lie elsewhere the likeliest even self evident explanation is that managements discovered that employees eyes light up when "in the money" options are put before them indeed if employees are as prone to fallacious thinking as the media in valuing options packages their delight in "in the money" options allowed them to be taken to the cleaners compared to what they would have received in "at the money" options but you ask wasnt the purpose to conceal from shareholders how much employees were being paid your error is forgivable if youve been getting your information from the press the entire substance of backdating was to allow the details of these "in the money" options to be accurately reported albeit without taking an accounting charge for them remember companies at the time could pay an employee the gnp of france in "at the money" options without taking a charge blessed is the editor who can say to a writer "make sense of subject x for me " and hope to receive back something more than a distillation of tropes already in the media most editors are not so blessed a factor just now reaching critical mass on sunday a lagging commentator in the new york times likened backdating to "getting to pick lottery numbers after the winning numbers are drawn " a confused washington post editorial called on mr jobs to reimburse apple for the compensation he stole against this who would have thunk it stands mr gore yelling stop to the lynch mob in apples own backyard the san jose mercury news delivered a critics delectable complaint that the gore investigation had "tried to preserve the companys no asset" in mr jobs isnt that exactly what a shareholder wants from the apple board right now the apple case is a marvelous example of why corporate governance reformers do shareholders no favor even as they expand their own bailiwicks by making governance reform a never ending end in itself indeed mr gore deserves credit for putting himself in the line of fire at all and worse is surely coming mr jobs is starting to face insinuations of insider trading for stock sales after the first backdating cases broke but before apple was implicated mr gore might have waved off the special committee assignment and sought to cover his own hindquarters from the lawsuits and criticism aimed at apple thats been the tendency of directors since sarbanes oxley enacted greater individual liability for accounting scandals head for the high grass and hire a lawyer to point fingers at somebody else its no accident that in the last years the value of americas corporations rose fold and the corporate reform industry grew right in step to tell us how badly and corruptly our companies are governed the more successful the stock market is at cultivating strong businesses the more were told the whole system is rotten in need of reform we just wonder what mr gore thinks about all this now
