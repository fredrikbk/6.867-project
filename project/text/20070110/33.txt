economists react economists see trade data boosting gdp outlook the u s trade balance narrowed a third straight month during november reaching its lowest point since july in an unexpected decline that could mean a boost for the economy the u s deficit in international trade of goods and services decreased by to &# billion from &# billion in october the commerce department said here is what economists think about the data and what they mean for trade and gross domestic product the november trade data reinforce the view that the trade deficit has peaked and is becoming a positive contributor to growth trade will be a very strong plus for growth in the fourth quarter exports had another strong quarter while imports were down in part the import weakness reflects less need for materials as manufacturing production fell nigel gault global insight further brighter news on the trade deficit after octobers oil driven spectacular improvement the trade narrows further beating market expectations drilling down in the detail of the report it was the non oil goods and services balances that drove the improvement bnp paribas market economics imports now appear on track to decline annualized in real terms in the fourth quarter the weakest showing in four years as the sizable inventory correction that appears to have occurred in the fourth quarter appears to have significantly hit foreign as well as domestic suppliers as expected petroleum products were little changed after plunging in october autos +&# b rebounded in line with assemblies consumer goods +&# b surged in line with upside in inbound cargo through the key west coast ports and capital goods +&# b posted a decent rise led by computers the key offsetting downside surprise was a plunge in non oil industrial materials &# b that was led by metals natural gas and forestry products morgan stanley research the encouraging news for the u s economy is the strength in exports which were higher than a year ago and at the highest monthly level on record through the first months of exports were tracking a gain from the comparable period in and in striking distance of matching or exceeding the record growth rate in capital goods led the export increase while non food non auto consumer goods accounted for the lions share of the increase in imports nomura economics research this report provides the raw material for another upward revision to fourth quarter gdp growth estimates at present we project fourth quarter growth at an above consensus with a trade contribution of about half of what we have seen in the first two months of the quarter if fridays inventory data do not show a larger inventory drag on growth as an offset to the trade contribution there is room for an upward revision to our real gdp growth estimate to around for the fourth quarter bear stearns u s economics we have not formally changed our fourth quarter gdp estimate but will do so once we have had a chance to sift through the numbers and cogitate on their implications for other components of gdp one tempting thought is that the lower than expected levels of imports signal weakness in domestic demand however imports of consumer goods were up on the month continuing an upward trend while imports of capital goods rebounded after two months of declines goldman sachs economics the surprise relative to our forecast was the fact that goods imports rebounded by only we had expected a somewhat larger gain by category imports of consumer goods were actually firmer than we projected but imports of industrial supplies sank and for once oil was not the primary driver it would be reasonable to assume that a big chunk of this surprise is related to falling prices rather than shift of volumes indeed despite the improvement in the nominal trade deficit the real deficit was essentially steady which was close to our expectation and thus implies that any upward revision to q gdp coming from these data will be minor going into today we stood at stephen stanley rbs greenwich capital compiled by tim hanrahan
