common sense conventional contrarian views for smartmoney the new years party was still in full swing last week when the federal reserve took the fizz out with its sobering reminder that inflation could still lead to higher short term interest rates the dow jones industrial average up more than points on wednesday the first day of trading in abruptly reversed course so much for the conventional wisdom that last years rally would accelerate in january a typically strong month in which fresh cash flows into the market this is when i like to review the conventional wisdom since the new year is filled with predictions that often turn out to be wrong i respect conventional wisdom because often its right but its more profitable to go against the herd this year several themes already have emerged the u s economy will achieve the "soft landing" aimed for by the fed the stock market will have a positive if unspectacular year gaining about to energy and commodity prices will continue to drop as inflation fears abate interest rates will remain low with the fed likely to reduce short term rates by summer foreign stocks and emerging markets remain attractive the dollar will continue to fall though not precipitously enhancing returns in foreign currencies this year the first weeks trading was an indication how much of the conventional wisdom rests on the assumption that the fed has stopped raising rates and will likely begin reducing them in to me this is the biggest risk for believers in the conventional wisdom higher than expected rates could slow or reverse the drop in the dollar dampening returns for foreign investments the sharp pullback in emerging markets last year was triggered by rising longer term interest rates in the u s and fears this would damp the global expansion my hunch is that a similar scare will afflict markets at some point this year which will likely represent a buying opportunity but longer term i think the conventional wisdom is right sooner or later the fed will begin to reduce rates so even though the bull market that began in october is reaching old age i too am bullish on the u s stock market the key will be to reduce exposure at overoptimistic market peaks and take advantage of corrections to buy stock sectors are another matter despite the recent sharp pullback in oil prices energy stocks have held up surprisingly well i dont expect that to continue over the near term the conventional wisdom is that oil prices are in a long term cyclical decline as investors flee and prices drop ill be adding to my energy and commodity positions im not saying oil will rebound by the end of but eventually the forces that drove oil to &# a barrel in july will reassert themselves once again ill take a contrarian view by recommending the health care sector now that the democrats have control of congress its more out of favor than ever and yet i continue to believe that sheer demographics will propel these stocks to outperform one of these years in my view plans that expand prescription drug use and still allow a profit to drug makers should compensate in increased volume and revenue for what they cost in lower margins as i did last year i embrace the conventional wisdom that foreign stocks are excellent opportunities but this year im shifting away from emerging markets toward the more mature economies of europe and japan emerging markets simply have risen too far too fast ive resisted the conventional wisdom that low interest rates are here to stay and so far ive been wrong call me stubborn but i still believe we could see higher longer term rates in even if the fed does begin to cut short term rates a stronger economy should boost demand for longer term borrowing and produce higher longer term rates fortunately my strategy for the possibility of higher longer term rates parking fixed income assets in one to three year cds has stood me in good stead with yields now at about but one of these years id like to be able to extend some maturities at higher rates well see if delivers such an opportunity james b stewart a columnist for smart money magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsjcommon
