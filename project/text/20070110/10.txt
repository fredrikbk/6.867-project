apples iphone is it worth it apple inc s feverishly anticipated iphone combines the music and video features of an ipod with the communications functions of a smartphone the question is how many consumers will be willing to pay the hefty price for the combo the iphone has a sleek design and is only millimeters thick a inch screen bigger than on most ipods extends for almost the entire length of the nearly button free device instead of the ipods iconic scroll wheel users will navigate through their song collections make phone calls and perform other tasks by tapping their fingers on the iphones touch sensitive screen users of the iphone will make calls or type emails on a virtual keyboard that pops up onscreen as needed apple of cupertino calif has an exclusive agreement with at&amp t inc s cingular the nations largest cellular carrier by subscriber to sell the iphone in the u s for &# and &# well above mass market cellphones with a commitment to a two year wireless plan although it has been on a hot streak apple doesnt always hit it big when it enters new markets the company collaborated with motorola corp on a phone called rokr that plays songs from users itunes music collections but it was seen by many as a disappointment because of limited storage capacity its unclear if and when the prices for the iphone might come down as prices for electronics gear such as flat screen television sets and video camcorders tend to do while prices for the ipod have generally stayed in the same range over the years consumers have been getting more features on new generations of ipods essentially getting more for their money each time with cellphones the historical model has been for prices of such devices to come down quickly with wireless carriers sometimes taking a loss on the products in order to get consumer subscription revenue in defense of the price of the iphone apple chief executive steve jobs said in a speech at the start of the macworld conference in san francisco that consumers normally have to pay &# for a comparable ipod nano and &# for a smartphone which would lack many of the whiz bang features of the iphone at roughly the same price with cingular apple developed a feature the companies described as a major innovation calling it "visual voice mail " instead of having to wade through voice mail messages in the order in which they were left iphone users will see a list with the names and phone numbers of people who left them voice messages and tap to listen the messages in whichever order they like there are also sophisticated sensors within the product that for instance adjust the brightness level of the screen to make it more legible based on ambient lighting conditions another sensor automatically shifts the screen orientation of the iphone to landscape from portrait mode when a user holds the device between two hands which will allow users to view movies and television shows in wide screen mode initially users will load music video and other content onto the iphone from their computers not wirelessly over the cingular network executives in the music industry say apple will need to negotiate new licensing agreements with music labels to obtain rights to sell songs wirelessly on the iphone in a nod to how drastically products like the ipod iphone and a new television set top box coming out in february called apple tv are reshaping the company apple yesterday said it has changed its corporate name to apple inc after decades as apple computer inc in his speech mr jobs said the iphone was the result of more than years of development work at apple and positioned its importance on par with the two other biggest innovations in apples history the macintosh computer and ipod mr jobs also said the company had worked with yahoo inc and google inc to bring popular internet features like yahoo mail and google maps to the product he said the iphone is powered by apples mac os x operating system which runs the companys line of computers all of the products features come at a steep cost for consumers though leading some analysts to question how big apples opportunity is to tap the mass market as it has with the ipod mr jobs said apple was aiming to sell about million iphones through the end of which would account for about of annual global shipments of cellphones but at &# and &# prices for versions of the iphone with four gigabytes and eight gigabytes of storage capacity respectively apple will be going after a fraction of the market toni sacconaghi an analyst at sanford c bernstein said cellphones priced above &# account for only about of the global market for its part cingular said it expects to attract high end customers who are willing to pay the price of the device and for the data services the phone could offer prices for which the companies didnt disclose cingular wouldnt say whether it was subsidizing the cost of the iphone as carriers typically do for most handsets on average north american carriers subsidize &# to &# per phone according to research firm gartner inc cingular ceo stan sigman said he was so convinced that apple would come up with a breakthrough phone that cingular signed a deal with apple in new york two years ago without even seeing a product the deal is a multiyear agreement in which cingular will handle customer support billing and other chores through the deal apple is not becoming a mobile virtual network operator in effect a reseller of airtime on another carriers network apple also said its new apple tv product formerly called itv will go on sale in february for &# the apple tv originally announced in september will feature a gigabyte hard drive and will be able to play video and photos from computers throughout the home mr jobs said viacom inc s paramount pictures will join walt disney co in selling movie downloads that can be played on the apple tv through the itunes store providing more than movies from its back catalog for download on itunes to allay concerns of dvd retailers about competition from itunes paramount is not including its new releases paramount studio head brad grey noted
