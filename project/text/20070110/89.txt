siberians love their billionaire and his largess popular gov abramovich enriched chukotka region now he wants to leave anadyr russia when lyubov vereshchakova heard that her local governor was resigning she thought about collecting signatures to make him stay for good "god sent us roman arkadievich and we wont let him go " the kindergarten principal says defiantly "he must stay here for the rest of his life " most super rich businessmen are reviled in russia but roman arkadievich abramovich is an exception at least in the corner of northeastern siberia that he has ruled for the past six years in chukotka affection for gov abramovich borders on the cultish an orphan who during the s rose to become one of russias richest and most influential oligarchs mr abramovich has spent a chunk of his personal fortune on making chukotka more livable since his election in the economy has tripled in size once hemorrhaging people its now in the grip of a baby boom that has created a thorny problem for the year old tycoon who is desperate to quit when mr abramovich first tried to resign in president putin asked him to stay on another year last month he tried again so far the kremlin hasnt given him an answer "i believe my mission is accomplished " mr abramovich told a group of journalists late last month "life in chukotka is now no worse than in any other part of russia " its easy to see why he has had enough half inside the arctic circle chukotka is a texas size expanse of treeless permafrost nine time zones east of moscow where temperatures can plunge to minus degrees fahrenheit reindeer outnumber people four to one mr abramovich never really made chukotka his home since buying chelsea football club an english soccer team in he has spent most of his time in britain where he has splurged on multimillion dollar townhouses in londons ritziest neighborhoods and a vast country estate he is now a bigger celebrity in britain than in russia and rumors of his impending divorce which are flatly denied by mr abramovich himself fill the british tabloids "its obvious abramovich has new toys to play with now " says natalia feoktistova an english teacher here in anadyr chukotkas regional capital but its also obvious why the chukotkans want him to stay before he arrived some villagers were so hungry they walked miles to the coast to eat seaweed critics say his expenditures pale in comparison with the vast dividends he has earned off his political connections one of the few s oligarchs to prosper under president putin mr abramovich sold his oao sibneft oil company to the state controlled gas giant for &# billion in while he still owned it the company saved &# billion from tax breaks granted in chukotka similar arrangements landed another russian oil baron mikhail khodorkovsky in a siberian prison for tax evasion still the thought that their governor may depart has thrown the people of chukotka into panic once wholly dependent on soviet subsidies chukotka is now addicted to the largess of an ultrarich mogul they worry about how theyll survive without him anatoly kochnev a local polar bear specialist has a solution "we should form a gang of reindeer herders and have them lasso us another billionaire " he says over a beer in a smart new anadyr restaurant "we could call it the chukotka swat team " brought up by grandparents in russias far north after his parents died mr abramovich first set eyes on chukotka in when he was running for parliament "i had never seen anything so awful in my life " he says anadyr was a city of abandoned apartment blocks and broken windows the massive subsidies that kept its economy afloat in soviet times had vanished miners who once earned sky high salaries hadnt been paid for years chukotkas reindeer herd plummeted as starving natives ate their livestock rats prowled the basement of anadyrs hospital in mr abramovich ran for governor winning more than of the vote "people said i did it because i had lived in the north and had a difficult childhood or because i wanted to atone for my sins as a businessman " he says "you can choose whichever reason you like none of them are right " his true motivation he says was more basic "when theres people you feel you can do something for them take responsibility for them " he says there were financial incentives too at the time chukotka was one of several regions offering big tax breaks to companies that set up shop there though most only did so on paper mr abramovichs aides say sibneft plowed more into chukotkas crumbling infrastructure than it saved in taxes the governor also started paying income tax there around &# million in or a quarter of the regions total revenue though he didnt pay local tax on the proceeds from the sibneft sale since that company was held offshore over the past five years aides say he has spent more than &# billion out of his own pocket to fund local charities awash with oligarch cash anadyr is now neat and tidy its apartment houses have been freshly painted bright red blue and green the city has a new power plant a new airport terminal and a heated indoor ice rink the influx of money has been a boon for chukotkas native people the chukchi many of whom spent the s in alcohol racked despair native villages have new schools and hospitals and the local reindeer herd has doubled to nearly businessmen are now trying to market vacuum packed reindeer chops to restaurants in moscow but even before mr abramovich has taken leave chukotkas economy is suffering along with the governor sibneft had been a major local taxpayer but after the state gas company bought it in it re registered it in st petersburg depriving chukotka of a big chunk of tax revenue mr abramovich insists things will never be the way they were in the s "new hospitals and schools wont be built at the same rate as before but theyre not needed now " he says he has wrung promises from the kremlin of fat handouts for years to come and hell still be paying income tax in chukotka he says but the regions economy is no more viable than it was when he first arrived tin and tungsten mines have been shut down and the local bread factory still has to import flour chukchi walrus hunters and reindeer herders will always need state support "traditional occupations are always loss making and people here dont know how to do anything else " says deputy governor viktoria anisimova lyubov vereshchakova takes visitors around her kindergarten which was rebuilt in on the governors dime once a drafty ruin it now boasts toy filled rooms with aquariums and potted plants and corridors brightly painted with murals like many others in anadyr she fears for the post abramovich future whoever comes after him she says will be "all talk and no action " "weve had that type before " she says
