fiscally fit are we saving enough with personal savings at a record low terri wonders how the cullens compare enough about spending terri we want to know how much you save thats the question asked by a number of readers such as bud wonsiewicz "what happened to your net worth in what you own minus what you owe helping readers focus on this would cut through the clutter of your spending on tvs decks etc " ok fair enough here goes over the last years ive grown comfortable with my familys saving habits since we were married in my husband gerry and i have built up emergency savings equal to slightly more than the requisite three months salary which we invest in taxable cds and mutual funds we both save each pay period for retirement which is supplemented by contributions from our respective employers and each month we put money into a college savings account for our seven year old son gerald that said weve gotten out of my husbands habit of saving in advance for big ticket items and paying for them in cash for big purchases and projects such as our backyard home renovation project and gerrys big screen tv we tap a &# home equity line of credit we also use credit cards but the balances are normally paid at the end of every month to keep debts from getting out of control we make one major purchase at a time and dont make another using the account until the bulk of the last purchase has been paid off we also make monthly payments that exceed the minimum payments due to pay the debt off quickly and keep our finance charges to a minimum occasionally were able to slash outstanding debts quickly using one time cash infusions such as year end bonuses tax refunds and a nice severance package gerry received after being laid off last summer gerrys dad believes weve become spendthrifts hes a depression era baby who encourages us to save every dime and live as frugally as we can although he appreciates the comfort our home remodeling projects have given us he thinks we could have and should have spent far less he also urged gerry to downgrade the other large expense in our lives our boat back when gerry was having second thoughts about keeping it my own parents love what weve done with the place and they appreciate the joy we get out of the boat but im sure they feel the same way my father in law does as our parents face retirement and the escalating costs for health care they worry were overdoing it gerry and i have a different view gerry started saving for retirement earlier than most and has retirement savings and pension plans in his current job i started saving much later than gerry but have made retirement savings a priority and over the last decade ive closed the gap in our savings were comfortable now that our retirement savings goals are on target and so we feel less anxiety about spending a little more of our disposable income to enjoy our lives now were gerry and i only a few years into saving wed no doubt be funneling most of our disposable income into retirement savings still as our incomes have risen over the years our spending has increased in step i wondered has our line of credit clouded our judgment about what we want versus what we can afford are we spending more than we earn if so were not alone personal savings as a percentage of personal income was a record low in november compared with a month earlier according to the bureau of economic analysis compare that to an average personal savings rate of in the s i decided to crunch the numbers to see whether gerry and i need to curtail our spending using my quicken personal finance software i walked through what we spend and save during a typical month and compared it to the national average since the most recent government stats on the national personal savings rate are for november ill use that month for comparison november usually isnt a typical month for our finances because we tend to start christmas shopping in the week or two leading up to thanksgiving day but freakishly warm weather in the northeast left us so out of the holiday spirit that we didnt get around to shopping until mid december i used the beas table of "personal income and its disposition" to start my calculations top of the list our gross personal income our income in november totaled &# of that amount &# came from gerrys overtime pay and a stipend i get for monthly television appearances it also includes &# in interest and dividend income from our taxable investments after capital gains taxes next i subtract the &# gerry and i contributed to federal state social security medicare and disability insurance taxes from our personal income in november in most months that total is actually &# boosted by the additional &# in taxes id normally pay each month before hitting the social security wage cap of &# in that threshold is &# to learn more about the wage cap click here our total disposable income for the month so far &# now come personal outlays thats government speak for living expenses well start with most peoples biggest expense their homes we pay &# a month &# plus a prepayment of &# for our primary mortgage we owed &# on our home equity line of credit payment in november but we paid &# to get the debt down more quickly our property taxes came to &# for the month and homeowners insurance was &# so home related costs came to &# that brings our disposable income down to &# or a little less than half our total gross income and we havent even started "spending " we dont have auto loans and this month we didnt make any large purchases of durable goods defined as items with a life expectancy of three years or more instead our largest expenditures went to food commuting and charitable giving according to quicken we spent &# on groceries with thanksgiving entertaining boosting our typical cost at the checkout probably by &# to &# we spent an additional &# dining out including actual dinners out buying lunch at work and geralds lunch money so food ate up &# of our disposable income in november leaving our disposable income at &# commuting costs were a big expense too &# for gas and ferry fare charity was a part of our budget as well we gave &# to our church and to an autism research charity walk to benefit our niece rylina that was higher than usual normally we give &# to &# a month protecting our assets also came at a price &# for life auto and boat insurance we also paid &# for geralds after school program total &# that brings our disposable income down to &# utilities landline and cell phones cable tv with premium package internet service gas and electricity totaled &# note thats unusually low because were paying an introductory price for our "three play" phone tv internet service and because the weather was unseasonably warm &# would be a more typical outlay here miscellaneous expenses including medical expenses dry cleaning costs postage union dues and gifts added &# more total &# all told we paid &# in november to keep cullen inc running subtract that from our total disposable income of &# and were left with our personal savings for the month &# or a personal savings rate savings as a percentage of disposable income of nearly an important note for whatever reason the government doesnt consider funds deposited in tax advantaged flexible spending accounts in its formula for calculating the personal savings rate we contribute &# a year &# a month pre tax to a dependent care flexible spending account an additional &# a year &# a month pre tax to a medical spending account and &# &# a month pre tax to a commuter spending account paying for these expenses with pre tax dollars shaves about &# off our annual tax bill the government formula also doesnt consider funds deposited in tax advantaged retirement savings accounts such as my k plan i contribute of my salary to a k plan of which is matched by my employer in an aggressive portfolio made up mainly of u s and international stock mutual funds bonds make up about of my portfolio our personal savings rate would have been higher if i followed the governments formula for calculating personal income and included contributions made by gerrys employer to his pension and retirement plans i chose to break that income out separately because gerrys monthly work hours fluctuate some months he works overtime most weekends others he has no overtime at all including income from gerrys hectic november work schedule would have made it look like we save a lot more than we typically save as part of gerrys retirement savings plan his employer now pays &# an hour to his trade unions annuity that will rise to &# an hour next month under his contract depending on how much overtime he works that rate of pay can be higher his employer also contributes &# an hour to his pension plan my k portfolio is light on bonds because gerrys annuity is invested primarily in very conservative stock funds and high grade corporate and government bonds combined weve accumulated about &# in retirement savings not including gerrys pension plan we dont include gerrys pension in our retirement planning because if recent trends are any sign theres a chance those funds wont be there for us when we retire in addition to retirement saving gerry and i sock away &# a month in new york states college savings account for our son gerald invested in an aggressive life cycle portfolio with an aim toward paying about of his total college costs and as i said over the last decade weve built up about &# in savings to provide a financial cushion in the event of a medical layoff or other type of emergency so are we saving enough we think so weve done our retirement planning and are satisfied that were on target to be out of the working force full time by age but after doing the math im thinking we could at least try and save a little more im not maxing out my k account so theres a good place to start this year ill boost my savings by an additional with an eye toward doing so each year until ive reached the maximum contribution allowed thats &# for or &# if youre age or older gerrys less worried about saving right now and more focused on paying down our home equity line of credit hes earmarked his holiday bonus toward that end do you think were saving enough for retirement or should we be saving more is spending

retirement and creating plans to fund all of those fun activities no one enjoys pondering and planning for doom and gloom scenarios add to that all of the things that compete for our savings such as
