subprime lenders may face funding crisis a liquidity crunch is pinching some corners of the residential mortgage industry as delinquencies and losses on loans made to borrowers with scuffed credit are piling up a rising number of subprime lenders are struggling to keep their so called warehouse lines of credit a funding source important to their ability to make loans this has forced some to close their doors and others to put up for sale signs warehouse lines provide financing for a mortgage lender for the period between the time it makes a loan and the time it sells the loan to investors a lender puts loans it originates in inventory or "warehouse " before the sale in other words the short term credit provides the funds borrowers use to pay for their homes the lender then uses the money it gets from the sale of the mortgage in the secondary market to pay down the financing independent mortgage lenders because of their limited capital rely on this form of financing more than deposit taking banks or other big financial institutions to secure the revolving lines of credit mortgage lenders use the loans they originate as collateral stanley street president of consultant street resource group inc in atlanta estimates that about to of all u s residential mortgages are backed by warehouse financing at some point "they cant operate without them " said james pedrick an executive vice president at mortgage lenders network usa inc referring to mortgage originators dependence on warehouse lines the middletown conn based mortgage lender the nations th largest subprime originator recently told its network of mortgage brokers that it had to suspend funding new loans because of "unresolved issues" with its banks mr pedrick declined to specify the issues except to say "we still have active warehouse lines " the company is in talks with lehman brothers holdings inc about a deal that could resolve its liquidity problems and help it resume making loans many warehouse financing pacts include financial covenants or restrictions requiring a mortgage originator to maintain for instance its capital net worth or debt ratio at a certain level the covenants serve to protect the banks by allowing them to call loans if the borrowing companys financial condition worsens that in turn could cause the borrowing company to close down the current trouble with subprime lenders comes as the fading housing boom has exposed more instances of poor underwriting and mortgage fraud and more cases of borrowers missing their first few mortgage payments through the complex web of buying and selling mortgages and related securities mortgage originators increasingly are being asked to buy back loans already sold to investors because of early delinquencies "the liquidity disruption were seeing now seems to be driven in large part by the spike in early payment defaults " said karen gelernt a partner at law firm cadwalader wickersham &amp taft llp in new york who specializes in mortgage banking in some cases those loan repurchase requests have led mortgage lenders to carry higher contingent liabilities which would cause their warehouse banks to question their solvency in other cases a warehouse bank may lower its valuation of the mortgage loans used to secure the financings based on the jump in delinquencies the bank then may initiate a margin call to require the mortgage lender to provide additional collateral or repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings "the most likely source of a liquidity crisis is increased collateralization requirements from warehouse lenders " notes allen puwalski senior financial analyst at the center for financial research and analysis an independent research firm in rockville md in that scenario he says mortgage originators would be forced to use more cash to fund their operations reducing potential production volumes following the well publicized collapses of privately held ownit mortgage solutions inc in california and sebring capital solutions in texas mr puwalski and his colleague zach gast recently evaluated the liquidity situations at five publicly traded monoline subprime originators the analysts found that liquid assets made up from to of loans held for sale at fieldstone investment corp fremont general corp accredited home lenders holding co and novastar financial inc that range is generally in line with various covenants placed on mortgage originators by warehouse banks they noted new century financial corp stood out with less than liquidity the analysts said raising questions about its ability to carry out its plan announced in november to buy back five million shares or of its outstanding common stock over the next months "when making decisions concerning share repurchases we take into consideration warehouse lending requirements the current operating environment and other factors " a new century spokeswoman said in a statement new century based in irvine calif ended the third quarter with about &# billion in warehouse financing fieldstone investment in columbia md was in danger of defaulting under its financing agreements late last year because of higher losses and delinquencies the company averted the crisis by amending the covenants of four warehouse financing pacts totaling as much as &# billion the new terms with j p morgan chase &amp co credit suisse group

projected by fieldstone for the second half of wouldnt result in a breach of agreements fieldstone said it is continuing to negotiate with the lenders to extend the terms beyond jan commercial banks investment banks and better capitalized mortgage originators all are common providers of warehouse lines of credit they earn fees by offering the financing for those who engage in the business of buying mortgage loans and repackaging them into securities to sell to institutional investors particularly wall street firms warehouse financing allows them to gain better insights into the quality of the loans they might end up purchasing drew buccino executive vice president of indymac bancorp inc s warehouse lending division said the pasadena calif based mortgage bank has been paying close
