cuban economists envision role for markets in post castro era with fidel castro ailing and absent from the public stage some influential cuban intellectuals are laying plans for a more market oriented approach to fortify the islands ailing communist economy the debate over economic experimentation squelched a decade ago by the castro regime offers a glimpse of what a post castro cuba could look like now it is intensifying at a time when castro disciple hugo chavez is steering venezuela toward the kind of hardline socialism that has failed to produce prosperity in cuba together the cuban economists proposals would cut down on state interference in businesses and aim to wring more productivity out of the island nations economy among the steps under discussion decentralizing control expanding the power of managers at privately owned agricultural cooperatives extending private ownership to other sectors boosting investment in infrastructure and increasing incentives to workers none of the plans would shuck communism for capitalism or open the island further to foreign investment which economists outside cuba say are critical for the island to prosper but the fact that the government is permitting and perhaps even encouraging the debate suggests regime officials might find these kinds of changes acceptable though it may take mr castros death to put them into action "we are in the midst of a process of debate which is cautious and controlled but is happening for the first time in many years " said pedro monreal a senior professor at the center for research on the international economy in havana "its an historic moment " says julia sweig a cuba specialist at the council on foreign relations in washington "the cuban regime feels confident enough to have voices it once purged be at the center of the economic debate on reform " the proposals are prompted by the continuing economic privation in cuba where state salaries dont come close to covering living costs but the planning is made more immediate by the year old mr castros continuing health problems the cuban government hasnt disclosed the nature of mr castros illness a spanish surgeon recently said it isnt cancer but he hasnt been seen in public since temporarily relinquishing power at the end of july and he is unlikely to return to his presidential duties cuba claims its economy grew at last year after an gain in which would make it one of the worlds fastest growing nations but critics say the numbers are as phony as those once produced by the soviet union carmelo mesa lago a professor emeritus at the university of pittsburgh who has long tracked the cuban economy says cuba engages in statistical sleights of hand such as double counting entries changing base years to yield better results and failing to show how it estimates revenue produced by cuban doctors and other professionals working overseas "i dont see anything in cuban economic statistics that would warrant this magic rate of growth " says mr mesa lago who figures the government is probably inflating its growth statistics by at least two thirds whatever growth cuba manages owes a lot to venezuela which provides it with subsidized oil some of which cuba re exports and employs tens of thousands of cuban professionals president chavez sees himself as an heir to mr castro in leading a bloc opposed to u s policies and earlier this week said he would nationalize his countrys largest telecommunications and electric utility companies aping mr castros early moves in his turn to communism even with the aid most cubans are able to scrape by only by working in black market enterprises or because of cash sent by relatives in the u s and europe the disconnect between the cuban governments claims and the cubans peoples bleak living standards may increase popular pressure for change "the cuban people can believe that the economy is growing statistically but its not growing in their homes " says rafael hernandez editor of the magazine "temas" "issues" in english a scholarly quarterly in havana that writes about the cuban political economy and society mr hernandez says the government should pick up the renovation agenda that mr castro and his brother raul now cubas acting president shut down in for straying too far from socialist ideology and for potentially undermining political control at the time the regime approved agricultural co ops which survive today where the state continues to own the land but members own the business and equipment these entities can sell a portion of their output in farmers markets at prices higher than those set by the state now mr hernandez says the co ops should be used as a model for other sectors small textile or shoe makers should be able to start co ops that sell in private markets he said currently the government permits only families to own such private businesses a co op would be able to expand and hire employees outside the family but under mr hernandezs concept co op members wouldnt be permitted to sell shares in their venture which might accelerate capital accumulation "co ops are socialist " he says "you could do it without violating socialist principles " omar everleny perez a senior researcher at the center for the study of the cuban economy in havana agreed "there should be an increase in the space for the private sector and cooperatives not only in agriculture but in other sectors " although he isnt as specific as mr hernandez or as confident that change is coming mario gonzalez corzo an economist at the city university of new yorks lehman college says the cooperatives would have to be decentralized and revamped to have much of an economic impact currently the government subsidizes co ops purchases of fertilizer machinery and other goods and sharply limits how much they can sell privately managers have to bargain extensively with government officials to get permission to change prices mr monreal the cuban international economist says the islands economy needs a more thorough makeover along the lines of what china and vietnam managed cuba is deficient in "calculation motivation and innovation " he says by that he means cuba doesnt let markets determine prices provide enough incentives for firms and enterprises to earn money or encourage cubans to take economic risks following a china model would require far more decentralization and acceptance of private markets than cuba has ever permitted even to well connected cubans the direction of the debate is difficult to follow "its a kind of black box process " says mr monreal he views raul castros decision last month to examine agricultural problems but to defer any decisions for six months until an economic survey is completed as a template of how the regime will incorporate changes the presidents brother who has served for decades as defense minister has frequently backed economic overhauls and the companies owned by cubas armed forces including tourism firms cigar marketers and consumer goods retailers are among the best managed on the island but year old raul lacks his brothers commanding presence and needs to move cautiously to broaden support he appears to be trying to do so by allowing the economic debate to proceed in december he told university students in havana that they should debate issues "fearlessly " cuban economic history under fidel castro is a tale of timid liberalization and retrenchment with purges of reformers caught taking the wrong positions during one crackdown in mr monreal mr hernandez and others were forced out of their jobs mr hernandez said he believes that even if the political winds once again shift against him "that wouldnt shut down the expressions of opposing views " it may take mr castros death or at the very least a public declaration that he is permanently incapacitated to give government officials the confidence to institute even modest economic retoolings mr castro has relentlessly opposed any changes that smack of capitalism and believes venezuelan oil subsidies have reduced the islands economic problems and need for market based incentives in the past few years mr castro has led drives to recentralize the economy and stamp out corruption which has often meant more repression of cubas tiny private sector for instance he fired thousands of gas station attendants he suspected of siphoning off gasoline to sell on the black market and replaced them with "social workers" cuban youths doing government service the government has even banned private citizens from starting businesses as masseuses and clowns zig zagging in havana since fidel castro took power in cuba has tried numerous economic tonics within the communist framework  stalinist style central planning introduced  castro tries to build revolutionary "new man " dispatching urban workers to cut sugar cane and nationalizing tens of thousands of businesses  timid market measures adopted wage differentials introduced to increase productivity  despite "perestroika" reforms in soviet union cuba repeals market incentives as part of a "rectification process"  moscow led communist bloc collapses cuban economy battered after soviet aid is halted  new experiments u s dollar legalized private agricultural cooperatives formed selfemployment legalized  liberalization process halted as castro worries about losing control  venezuelan aid eases economic strains economic planning is centralized again  castro criticizes "those who thought they could build socialism through capitalist
