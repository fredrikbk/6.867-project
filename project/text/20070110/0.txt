a cultural conversation with jerry wexler at he still has cds to burn sarasota fla in new york city in the s at a time when jazz was simply called "hot" and wind up record players revolved times a minute they were the record collectors a small cosmopolitan circle of young hipsters wasps jews germans turks would gather they prized and hunted down rare recordings of this music frequented jam sessions at places like jimmy ryans and the famous door and argued the relative merits of men like king oliver bix beiderbecke henry "red" allen and louis armstrong they were self appointed archivists proudly aware that few ears heard the earthy magic that enraptured theirs "oh we were absolutely a cult it was we happy few as the english say " says jerry wexler "we were groupies without the sexual component we used to get together and listen to records and maybe wed smoke a cigarette without any name on it " celebrating his th birthday today mr wexler is revered for his role as producer and former president of atlantic records the label he co led for years with ahmet ertegun who died this past dec together the jewish pool hall hustler from the north end of manhattan and the erudite son of a turkish diplomat educated in washington built an empire from a small notion of a company in doing so they helped lead the progress of popular music from rhythm and blues a term mr wexler himself coined while a reporter to the rise of rock producing music by ray charles and big joe turner otis redding and aretha franklin led zeppelin eric clapton and the rolling stones the two grew from mere collectors to become leaders and legends in the recording industry but as mr wexler notes they werent the only ones whose early devotion to jazz paved the way to significant careers "that was a great fraternity of music lovers who very strangely became music entrepreneurs and producers and directors and label owners " in that coterie there was john hammond who brought benny goodman billie holiday and bob dylan to columbia records and george avakian who did the same with miles davis alfred lion who started the blue note label and bob thiele who ran impulse milt gabler whose commodore music shop in midtown manhattan proved the launching pad for this group and who headed decca producing bing crosby sammy davis jr and bill haleys "rock around the clock " nesuhi ertegun ahmets brother who became one of the atlantic troika producing john coltrane ornette coleman and charles mingus try to imagine a parallel in another industry a group of model airplane hobbyists later helming delta northwest and continental "this didnt happen and doesnt happen anywhere else as far as i know music fans actually becoming principals in the milieu that they loved and adored " mr wexler says "of course the contrast to what the business became is enormous theres nothing like that anymore " much is not like it was in the business of music ask any executive dealing with the fluctuations and changes of the past five years theres irony in mr wexlers complaint for his triumphs at atlantic helped spur general growth in an industry where his owner operator role became outdated and major labels separated along business and artistic lines "there are no more producers who run their own record companies not significant companies there arent even staff producers anymore because ahmet and i were in the studio back in the s and s atlantic had a special aura we were regarded as the little tiffany record company " accepting an offer of equity in the company mr wexler moved to atlantic in having served as a reporter for the trade journal billboard and promotion man for a music publisher the fledgling label was six years old an independent fighting for market share among the major companies of the day mr wexler recalls "i came into atlantic as the daily operations man calling the distributors for payments and raising hell and until i produced with ahmet we did everything together our desks were in the same room at w th street over patsys restaurant we started out making r&amp b black music for black adults a good way to contrast it is with motown they made black music for american teenagers " atlantic operated on a day to day basis "we never had a recording budget or a sales budget " mr wexler says "we always made it on next months receivables we had a good roster of repeating artists and were able to sell enough singles i remember back in the early s what we had to do was sell singles a month that paid for our salaries and the operation "at a certain point we had to grow a record company cant stay static but we never had a grand plan or strategy only tactics it was not a conscious decision to go for the big market and rock n roll in the beginning we made sporadic efforts that didnt quite work out but eventually we had cream and sonny &amp cher and the bee gees then emerson lake and palmer yes and led zeppelin " in the same year mr wexler guided aretha franklin to an unbroken string of top hits he persuaded his partners ahmet and nesuhi to sell atlantic to the warner media conglomerate then called warner bros seven arts which was soon bought by steve rosss kinney services it was a decision mr wexler now regrets as naively premature the three continued to head atlantic but were accountable to shareholders the small tiffany label that had successfully competed with the majors became a major itself "in the long run the deal didnt work out too bad for ahmet " says mr wexler referring to erteguns year reign as the leading record man at the warner family of labels mr wexler did not fare as well "the fact that we had sold didnt change the way we worked because steve ross never interfered but some of those big brains on the corporate board would come up with ideas like we should poll the kids at the malls to see what songs aretha franklin should record i would explode when theyd bring up that stuff " in mr wexler left his post at atlantic and became an in demand free lance producer the next few years saw him create albums for bob dylan etta james willie nelson and dire straits and a memorable soundtrack for the film "pretty baby " in he married his third wife the novelist jean arnold and entered a life of semiretirement today the wexlers reside in a gated community in sarasota fla their house overlooks a placid seawater inlet in the living room grammy awards and other statuettes stand among photographs of family and friends willie nelson ray charles the muscle shoals rhythm section on the walls are original magritte lithographs felix vallotton woodcuts and a portrait of new orleans piano maestro malcolm rebennack known popularly as dr john "the two albums im proudest of producing are dr johns gumbo and doug sahm and band " mr wexler says naming a pair of titles that cover the richly varied heritage of respectively new orleans and texas "and they both tanked " he adds almost gleefully "two of atlantics worst sellers " mr wexler does little to hide the fact that he has disengaged himself from the music business he scoffs when asked if he still reads billboard "in what way could it possibly engage me im not involved in it it seems very alien to me " in fact mr wexler hides little at all two weeks ago white whiskered and t shirted he exhibited much of the legendary drive that enabled him to produce and promote atlantics musicians to the top of the charts he moved briskly from room to room and from task to task overseeing his wifes coming surgery creating copies of music from his personal collection "im always burning cds for people i used to burn a lot for ahmet " fielding calls from a new circle of music enthusiasts wishing to include his words in a variety of audio and video projects "everybody seems to be coming to my door bbc npr well there arent too many people at the age of that are coherent or even alive and not everybody can deliver a paragraph extemporaneously " mr wexler may remain in the full embrace of music and of his left leaning roots "im a liberal white wine drinking quiche eating foreign movie watching yellow dog democrat " he exclaimed at one point but the kind of health concerns that come with advanced age have him mindful of entering his th decade "im not ravished by the idea im going to be please no paper hats no ice cream " that mr wexler is one of a few surviving members of the music focused fraternity of his youth was brought home by last months sad news "i just wrote a letter to ahmet erteguns widow mica saying that every day when i wake up i dont think ahmets gone i just think hes not here ive been playing jimmy yancey over and over and over " in "rhythm and the blues " mr wexlers autobiography that describes a path that began on the sidewalks of manhattan and reached the highest musical summits there are two simple words on the dedication page "for ahmet " "well in a way " mr wexler explains "he handed me a life " mr kahn is the author of "the house that trane built the story of impulse records" and can be heard regularly on national public radios "morning edition "
