politics &amp economics new science on stem cells draws white house focus washington with the house preparing to expand federal funding of embryonic stem cell research the bush administration is trying to change the terms of the debate by promoting methods of developing stem cells that dont harm embryos facing likely approval first in the house and later in the senate of an embryonic stem cell research expansion the white house confirmed it has been working on a possible executive order related to stem cell research though a spokesman wouldnt provide details stem cell research advocates said the order would endorse federal funding for research involving nonembryonic stem cells though that wouldnt represent a change in the limits mr bush placed on embryonic stem cell research in it may help the white house respond to criticism of an expected veto of the embryonic stem cell bill which has broad support in congress and among the public supporters of embryonic stem cell research say the bill would lead to lifesaving cures for illnesses and they predict easy passage in the house tomorrow the bill would permit federal funding of stem cell research using embryos developed for fertility purposes but about to be discarded people for whom the embryos were created would have to provide written consent for the donation the senate may take up the legislation as soon as next month but mr bush made clear over the summer that he opposes expanding research funding that he views as encouraging the destruction of human life mr bush issued the first veto of his presidency after both the house and senate voted to expand embryonic stem cell research mr bush has shown no sign he will waver from the existing policy which allows federal funding for supplies of stem cells that had already been taken from embryos in senate and house backers of stem cell research have added to their ranks partly because of elections in which democrats picked up seats sen tom harkin d iowa predicted the senate has the two thirds support that would be needed to override a veto that isnt likely in the house but proponents are promising to "introduce it over and over " as rep diana degette a colorado democrat sponsoring the bill said yesterday mr bushs veto could prolong the debate into the presidential campaign season causing republican candidates who largely support expanded funding for stem cell research to find a way to state their position without inflaming their antiabortion base white house spokesman tony fratto declined to provide details about the content and timing of the possible executive order but he said "we are clearly working on ways we can direct whatever tools and funding we can" to explore stem cell research that doesnt harm embryos the white houses domestic policy council is working on a report to be released today that highlights nonembryonic stem cell progress including a study published this week that described cells in the amniotic fluid of pregnant women as having similar characteristics of embryonic stem cells "we are exploring all the alternative science that maybe will make this question moot so we as a society do not have to deal with this moral grudge match " mr fratto said backers of expanded stem cell research dismissed the strategy as a distraction if mr bush issues an executive order promoting other methods it wont change policy said sean tipton president of the coalition for the advancement of medical research who called it "a political fig leaf " backers are frustrated that antiabortion republicans including mr bush have seized on the study of amniotic stem cells which was published this week in the journal nature biotechnology to bolster claims additional stem cell research using embryos isnt needed the study "is noteworthy but it does not represent a major breakthrough " mr harkin said ms degette and rep michael castle r del another sponsor of the house bill released a letter yesterday from one of the authors of the study on amniotic cells anthony atala director of the wake forest institute for regenerative medicine dr atala wrote in his letter that the legislation likely to pass the house this week would "speed science in the regenerative medicine field" and that his work on amniotic stem cells is complementary to not a substitute for embryonic stem cell research meanwhile the antiabortion family research council said amniotic stem cells present an alternative that "increases the promise of treatment without destroying human life " rep phil gingrey a georgia republican and antiabortion obstetrician gynecologist introduced a bill authorizing federal funding for stem cell research that doesnt destroy embryos democrats are unlikely to allow the bill to come up for a vote in the house
