corporate focus business when firms turn to lawyers when people get in trouble they often turn to lawyers so i guess its no surprise that companies do the same the latest examples home depot and pfizer the two companies share top billing in the ceo pay without performance hall of shame their former chief executives bob nardelli and hank mckinnell each walked away with roughly &# million in parting compensation after failing to deliver a penny to their shareholders the boards of both companies then turned to lawyers to clean up the mess the folks at pfizer insist jeffrey kindlers law degree harvard had little to do with his selection as the companys new ceo at home depot where the top job went to frank blake columbia a friend and former general electric colleague of mr kindler a spokesman says theres a difference "between having a law degree and being a lawyer basically since franks been out of the lawyer mode " still this trend in the corporate world is hard to ignore lawyers seem to get called in when companies have serious legal troubles or when a charismatic leader leaves behind an unmanageable muddle when then new york attorney general eliot spitzer lowered the boom on marsh &amp mclennan the board dumped chief executive jeffrey greenberg and replaced him with lawyer and spitzer buddy michael cherkasky case western after time warners gerald levin brokered the disastrous merger with aol he fled the company leaving lawyer dick parsons albany in charge theres clearly some sense to this lawyers are trained to foresee risk making them well suited for times of trouble perhaps more important they understand what it means to be a fiduciary acting in trust on someone elses behalf messrs nardelli and mckinnell clearly failed to grasp that basic tenet of public company leadership but some see this trend as one more cause for concern about the direction of the business world in the post enron era "its a sign of the times " says philip howard a lawyer himself and a relentless crusader for legal overhaul who wrote the book "the death of common sense " "were more concerned with legal compliance than with getting the job done if you have an economy where people circle the wagons and try and prevent anything bad from happening the economy will suffer " can lawyers make good ceos one man struggling to show he can is chuck prince usc who became chief executive at citigroup in after spending years as consigliere to his predecessor sandy weill mr weill built citigroup through mergers and acquisitions but his far flung empire was filled with cowboys whose relentless pursuit of profits got the company into a succession of scandals in response the federal reserve shut down citigroups growth machine prohibiting the giant bank from making any more acquisitions until it cleaned up its act the prohibition was lifted last year that left mr prince with little choice but to focus on creating a new culture of ethics and compliance in an interview two years ago he told me that todays ceos are given little time in their jobs and as a result he could only hope to accomplish one or two big things changing citigroups culture he said "is job one " now mr prince wants a shot a job two restoring growth his shareholders however are getting impatient last fall they balked as the companys expenses grew faster than revenue and as rivals like j p morgan chase and bank of america offered better shareholder returns a number of analysts downgraded citigroups stock in an eleventh hour rescue effort mr prince appointed a new chief operating officer to focus on costs at a meeting with analysts on dec he made a lengthy and spirited argument that the company would resume solid growth and profitability in the market responded and citigroups stock rose to &# from &# in the final month of the year "we scored in the last three minutes of the game " mr prince told me last week still the fall flap put mr prince on notice he has to do better this year "i will succeed or fail not on what happens with compliance " he said "i will succeed or fail on whether this enormous battleship can get up to" speed like messrs kindler and blake mr prince believes his legal training is irrelevant as long as he remains focused on the goal of expanding the company he says "whether you are a lawyer or a plumber it doesnt make a difference " meanwhile those who worry that the turn toward lawyers is a sign of public companies poor health can take some comfort from this they arent yet turning to priests alan murray welcomes reader questions and will respond at wsj com talkingbusiness
