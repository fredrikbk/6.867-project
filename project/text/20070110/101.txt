the mossberg solution edited by walter s mossberg using your dvr from afar two methods allow remote recording checking the grid the whole point of using a digital video recorder is convenience rather than arranging your schedule around television shows you watch what you want when its best for you but you may be running out the door for a weeklong trip forgetting to plot out which shows will air while youre gone or you might learn of a new series or show while at work unable to get home in time to record it this week i was reminded of how setting my tivo digital video recorder to record programs can be done more conveniently through remote online access i did so using two methods tivo inc s own web service tivo central online at www tivo com and sling media inc s downloadable slingplayer software program which works when slingbox hardware is attached to your television other remote recording solutions also are available using computer based programs these two programming aids came in handy allaying my fears of ever missing a show like the "oprah" episode on which the entire "greys anatomy" cast appeared i forgot to set my tivo tivo central onlines remote programming scheduling grid was helpful and sling medias slingplayer brought the tivos features onto my computer screen as well as a live feed from the remote television remote access from tivo com is included with the monthly or annual service fee tivo owners already pay but many of them dont know about it or use it tivo central online works best with a broadband connected tivo such as the series used with the &# wireless g usb network adapter which i have or the new tivo series the earlier version of tivo called the series box uses a phone line to periodically dial in and receive tivo data the series can also use a phone line tivos using a broadband connection only need about a half hour of notice from tivo central online to record a coming show phone connected tivos need at least hours notice i created a tivo com account which automatically knew of my home tivos channels and broadband connection searches on the tivo central online site can be narrowed using genres tivo central onlines grid guide is useful for remotely programming your tivo displaying titles times durations and channels for each show from my office i recorded a coming episode of "oprah" by following steps similar to those on my actual tivo the episode title appeared in my home tivos to do list with a computer icon beside it indicating that it had been scheduled via tivos web site this worked well but tivo doesnt allow you to actually watch the program while away from the tivo recorder unless you use a more laborious and complicated process called tivo togo which requires that you transfer content from the tivo to a laptop or portable player the slingbox is a separate device that attaches to your television and lets you remotely watch the tvs content from anywhere using a computer or mobile device if your tv has a tivo connected to it the slingbox lets you remotely control your tivos scheduled recordings and settings or watch its content as if you were sitting in your living room an on screen image of the tivo remote control adds familiarity to slingplayer the slingbox costs between &# and &# depending on which product you get and the slingplayer software program is a free download from www slingmedia com the company charges a one time &# fee though for the mobile software programs that work on windows mobile devices the experience of using the slingplayer is rich and becomes even more enjoyable when tivo is added to the equation i downloaded the slingplayer on my apple imac it also runs on windows xp and vista as well as mobile platforms i logged in to view content from a slingbox enhanced tv and tivo a vivid image of a tivo remote control worked just as it should its buttons are all usable and you even hear the tivo sound effects as i watched shows remotely the picture was choppy at times slowing down to "optimize" the video every so often but the longer i watched the better it got any changes that you make on the tivo using your slingplayer are reflected back on the actual tivo so if youve watched half of a show on your computer before stopping you can resume the rest of the show by watching on your tv starting where you left off next time youre away from your tivo but want it to record something think about setting up a free tivo central online account allowing you the flexibility of remote recording should you want to use it the slingbox and slingplayer work well for users who miss their tv programs enough to want to see them right away mossbergsolution wsj com
