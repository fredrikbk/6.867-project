ethanol bandwagon picks up speed california other states push for expanded use higher gas food costs in separate actions aimed at reducing "greenhouse gases " california gov arnold schwarzenegger ordered a cut of "at least " in the carbon content of motor vehicle fuels used in his state by while governors of states prepared to push for a new federal rule to require greater use of ethanol fuel both efforts are designed to reduce global warming and the u s s reliance on imported oil but they also could raise consumer prices for food and fuel the initiatives also signal the increasing urgency of climate change as an issue both in state capitals and in washington president bush is expected to express more support for domestically produced ethanol when he gives his state of the union address later this month meanwhile democratic leaders in congress are talking up the need for alternative fuels and national emissions controls announcing his carbon reduction order in remarks prepared for delivery in his state of the state address last night gov schwarzenegger said "california has the muscle to bring about such change " while the details of the proposal have yet to be worked out california officials explained that the program would leave it up to oil suppliers in the state to figure out how to reduce carbon content but that using more ethanol which contains less carbon would be the most likely way the move they estimated would triple the size of the states market for ethanol and other renewable fuels gov schwarzenegger said his order would be the first standard in the world that would diminish the use of fossil fuels which come from deposits that have been buried in the ground for millions of years and which release carbon into the air when burned the regulation which the governor ordered completed by would also include incentives for more electric and hydrogen powered vehicles the governor acted under his states recently passed law to regulate carbon dioxide emissions meanwhile the governors today will propose a new federal standard that would mandate substantially higher use of ethanol fuel and offer new tax incentives for the production of cellulosic ethanol which can be made from farm wastes and wood chips and doesnt rely on corn the feedstock typically used by current ethanol producers the proposal would require fuel sellers to increase the use of ethanol to billion gallons a year by eclipsing an earlier federal mandate contained in the energy policy act of billion gallons by the new standard calls for the use of billion gallons by and around billion gallons by which means ethanol could displace about of the nations expected gasoline use a january proposal by the governors coalition to mandate greater use of ethanol as fuel was quickly endorsed by president bush and became the centerpiece of the energy bill passed by congress the governors unveiled their new proposal to the president in a letter saying "oil is the unquestionable epicenter of national security crises that distort the foreign policies of many nations and that suggest potential scenarios for economic disaster " while the new moves enjoy considerable political support and the endorsement of environmental groups experts who watch the nations food consumption worry that more ethanol use will drive up food prices michael swanson an economist with wells fargo &amp co said the demand for corn has already raised corn prices meanwhile producers are already lowering the number of young chicks they raise and are fattening cattle less because of soaring corn costs trends that mr swanson predicted will soon raise retail meat prices "were looking at corn futures trading in the range of &# a bushel thats as high a price as weve seen in this decade " mr swanson said earlier spikes in the price of corn were caused by small crops but this years crop "was one of the largest weve ever had " he added currently ethanol is turned into motor fuel by mixing it with gasoline in blends of or less ethanol both the pending california rule and the governors proposal would require major owners of gas stations to provide pumps that distribute blends of ethanol and give auto makers incentives to make more "flexible fuel" vehicles that can use this blend jim carlton contributed to this article
