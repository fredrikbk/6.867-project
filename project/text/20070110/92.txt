terminatorcare monterey calif on monday arnold schwarzenegger presented his proposal for reducing the number of californians who lack health insurance his proposal is almost indistinguishable except in details from that of the democrats who dominate the california assembly and senate the democrats tend to favor solutions involving regulations government spending and taxes and senate president pro tem don peratas proposal the main contending democrat plan hits the trifecta it would require employers to provide health insurance give them the option of paying a tax instead of providing health insurance and increase spending by expanding both the medi cal and healthy families programs which provide care to low income children including children of illegal immigrants and the disabled mr schwarzeneggers solution hits the trifecta also he would require employers with or more workers to provide health insurance or pay a tax on all wages covered by social security look for employers with to employees to get creative about outsourcing and look as well as harvard economist jonathan gruber has documented for wages to fall in firms that offer health insurance because of the mandate gov schwarzenegger would throw in a tax on doctors and a tax on hospitals to help fund medi cal californias name for medicaid and he would expand medi cal to adults earning as much as above the poverty line and to children even those here illegally in poor and middle income families he hopes by doing this to shift &# billion of medi cals annual cost to the federal government there are two problems with such solutions first they infringe on economic freedom preventing in robert nozicks phrase "capitalist acts between consenting adults " second government solutions rarely work why doesnt increased government power tend to solve the problem of the uninsured there are two main reasons first when government provides health insurance many people who take advantage of it drop their own privately provided health insurance in a article in the quarterly journal of economics harvard economists david m cutler and jonathan gruber found a "crowding out effect " as the federal medicaid program expanded for every two people who gained insurance through medicaid one dropped private health insurance although this is a net addition of one the costs to taxpayers are much higher than expected because now half of the newly covered instead of paying their own way as they previously did become wards of the state second of the million or so people without health insurance at any given time about will have health insurance within four months this is one of the main findings of a study by the congressional budget office "how many people lack health insurance and for how long " that shouldnt be surprising in a country where most private health insurance is employer provided and most unemployment spells last weeks or less solutions that involve government mandates on employers or employees will therefore miss connecting with about half of the people who are uninsured at a given point in time but what if the governor could solve some of the problem by making health insurance cheaper he can not by regulating more but by deregulating let me explain in the last few decades state governments the main regulators of health insurance in the individual and small group markets have mandated coverages for many kinds of health care according to the council for affordable health insurance cahi a pro market association of insurance carriers there were state mandates in among the most common and most expensive mandates are chiropractic care treatment for alcoholism and drug abuse and mental health benefits californias government mandates coverage for all of the above as well as for many other benefits including for example infertility treatment a very expensive benefit abolishing these mandates would allow people who dont want to be covered for these things to buy cheaper insurance while still allowing those who want them to buy and pay for them would such an approach work thats like asking whether if the government currently required new cars to have cd players eliminating that requirement would lower the price of a car of course it would work it is important though not to overstate its benefits the gain to californians from abolishing these mandates would not be huge cahi compiled data from americas health insurance plan and ehealthinsurance for the individual market and from the federal government for the small group market and found that in although california had more mandated coverages than all but six other states it had among the lowest insurance rates for individual health insurance policies &# versus a top rate of &# for new jersey the reason explains cahi is that in other ways california is much less regulatory than many other states it does not for example require guaranteed issue on individual policies which drives up premiums by forcing insurance companies to supply policies to all comers regardless of health status yet the governors proposal would reverse this somewhat and prevent insurance companies from saying no because of age and health california should not contra gov schwarzenegger do new regulatory harm rather it should repeal existing regulations that cause harm so as to make health insurance even more affordable there is one other way to deregulate the california government could allow any californian to buy health insurance from any willing insurer in any state and be subject to the regulations of that state that way people could shop for the degree of paternalism they want if they want insurance from a state that requires many coverages they could do so and pay the high premiums that result if they want bare bones coverage they could do so also the result would surely be that some of the current uninsured would buy insurance were i in the market for individual insurance and given the choice i would not bother paying for coverage for alcohol or drug abuse if a version of gov schwarzeneggers plan passes the only thing certain is that there will be more regulation more government spending and more taxes a better path would be to deregulate and thus achieve some increase in the number of insured without new spending or taxes or regulation mr henderson a research
