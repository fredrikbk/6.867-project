irs system to collect back taxes is faulted the irss system for collecting back taxes is faulty and that often forces taxpayers to pay too much according to a report by a government appointed irs watchdog nina olson the internal revenue services national taxpayer advocate listed in her annual report to congress yesterday what she says are the top problems facing the irs seven of these problems relate directly to collection practices for individuals who are behind on their taxes ms olson the designated "voice" of the taxpayer within the irs said the agency is failing to promptly "personally" notify taxpayers beyond an initial form letter whats more the irs is making it difficult for taxpayers to actually pay their late tax bills the report said not only are taxpayers hurt but the irs also suffers because it puts up barriers to collecting the money it is owed it said some taxpayers will never hear from the irs to recover back taxes others however could be contacted by the agency years later and find that their tax bill has ballooned as a result of additional interest and penalties "people wind up in a collection lottery " says bill lazor a certified public accountant and partner at kronick kalada &amp berdy pc in kingston pa he advises clients to get an extension of the filing deadline to avoid penalties "it is so easy to get an extension " he says "it is not worth filing late " in the report the irs responded that its collection methods strike an "an appropriate balance" between its staffing levels and its enforcement obligations but it also said its procedures and rules are under review and could be revised delinquent taxpayers do receive written notification from the irs alerting them that taxes are owed but that often fails to grab taxpayers attention such form letters dont amount to adequate notice the taxpayer advocate said low income earners are more likely to end up on the short end of the stick than those with big incomes according to the report people with high incomes with sizable tax debts get more attention from the irs because their payments add more to government coffers in these cases the irs often calls or visits the taxpayer the report said that some taxpayers who owed the government relatively small amounts didnt get a call from the agency early enough and werent told the true cost such amounts are about &# to &# often an individuals tax debt wont get agents attention until the penalties grow significantly a process that could take years the report said that is because interest accrues on delinquent tax accounts at a recent rate of about annually compounded daily that amount applies to penalties and interest and the outstanding tax balance "taxpayers are often stunned by the cumulative impact of penalties and interest on their balances due " the report said from to the irs classified nearly delinquent taxpayers who owed a total of about &# billion as "currently not collectible " the advocate said that many of those taxpayers arent likely to be personally contacted until the size of the debt triggers irs action for those faced with rising tax bills many arent told by the irs of alternative payment methods such as installment agreements that would help pay off the debt the report said whats more the irss rules to get liens released are burdensome the agency fails to offer payment alternatives and often leaves taxpayers in limbo when they try to pay off their debts the advocate said using the taxpayer advocate this irs unit helps taxpayers with problems that couldnt be resolved through normal channels to find out if youre eligible call be prepared to provide your address phone and social security numbers a description of the problem your previous attempts to solve it and the irs office you contacted the type of tax return and the year s involved
