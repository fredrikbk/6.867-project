should steve jobs go to jail steve jobs recently became the latest chief executive thrown into the options timing imbroglio apple disclosed that its ceo was "aware or recommended" favorable grant dates on option grants to employees but that he did not "receive or benefit" from any of the grants or "appreciate the accounting implications " apples board concluded that mr jobs had done nothing wrong and emphasized its "complete confidence" in its ceo the markets followed suit rather than fret investors actually bid up apples stock by more than &# per share given the stock bump the boards exoneration and mr jobss lack of accounting experience could this possibly be a case of criminal securities fraud believe it or not in the minds of some prosecutors applying a far reaching and unproven theory of fraud it is just last summer the government indicted gregory reyes the former ceo of brocade communications despite the fact that mr reyes like mr jobs was a non accountant who didnt personally benefit one cent from the option grants at issue the problem with the governments theory is that it conflates books and records violations with criminal securities fraud in the process the government untethers securities fraud from the legal elements that help safeguard executives from conviction for inadvertent accounting violations resulting in little or no harm to companies or to investors fundamental to american law is the notion that a defendant cannot be punished absent intent to commit a crime yet prosecutors are alleging that non accountants violated an accounting rule known as apb so opaque even auditors didnt understand it many in silicon valley are still scratching their heads how can someone intentionally violate a rule that they and most others dont even comprehend prosecutors and regulators have alleged just that not surprisingly the first and only federal court confronting the issue so far found that apb was so obscure that its violation could not demonstrate evidence of fraudulent intent as a matter of law indeed much of what is pejoratively called "backdating" was actually undertaken in good faith in many instances during the internet boom silicon valley high tech companies were hiring so many new employees and awarding so many options grants that paperwork errors led to changed grant dates yet these occasions have been lumped into the so called "backdating" pool and portrayed as a harbinger of the next enron unlike in the typical securities fraud cases where revenues are overstated or cash expenses hidden and when discovered the companys stock craters prosecutors of backdating cases face an enormous challenge in proving that stock based compensation expense actually cost investors anything stock based compensation is a non cash expenditure meaning the expense does not reflect cash flowing into or out of the companys treasury this fact is often overlooked by those who assume that backdated option grants are the same as cash hand outs in the current regulatory environment these economic realities too often get lost when addressing past errors in options accounting accurate financial reporting is critical to a companys health but at some point the quest to restate an ideal financial statement risks exalting form over substance with the companys true financial health becoming virtually irrelevant while an approved income statement is made paramount the most basic element of fraud is deception or deceit and a typical example is when a company misstates revenues or cash expenses yet there is no proof of deceit or concealment in alleged backdating cases in fact it is remarkable how much companies have disclosed about their option grants company ks form s proxy statement and other filings were replete with information about options indeed despite media accounts that suggest that executives were secretly lining their pockets the economic value of options granted whether to executives or to the rank and file was no secret at all if the alleged backdating did not involve self dealing or kickbacks and options expenses were immaterial to investors how were investors harmed if the harm was only "making a hash of the financial statements " as sec chairman christopher cox has suggested shouldnt backdating cases be charged as books and records violations rather than securities fraud despite the media clamor and various colorful analogies to lightning lotteries and pick pocketing most options backdating cases are not fraud but books and records errors it is understandable in an era when public concern is growing over rising executive compensation that attention should be turned to stock options individual companies may want to reconsider how and at what volume they grant options yet a thoughtful look at the elements of securities fraud may help observers distinguish between accounting issues and criminal acts mr marmaro a former federal prosecutor and mr weinstein are attorneys at skadden arps slate meagher &amp flom they are currently representing the former ceo and chairman of brocade communications in connection with stock option issues
