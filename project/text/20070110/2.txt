act one how to offer advice when your parents struggle with finances those of us who went home for the holidays may have watched our parents struggling to help their elderly parents i and a few of my friends stood by as our parents fielded phone calls from grandparents who need help with basic tasks like going to the supermarket or making lunch these minor requests if fulfilled help our grandparents keep costs down and continue living at home but they can pile up and make life difficult and expensive for our parents it seemed in some cases that no one ever considered what they would do when our grandparents could no longer care for themselves in our twenties often its all we can do to get our own lives together the idea of planning for our parents future is a burden beyond our means emotionally and financially but if our parents finances fray it may fall to us to help prevent disaster if not sooner than later and even if our parents are healthy and self sufficient now theyll likely need some kind of care later on according to a study by professors from pennsylvania state university and georgetown university their research projects that of people who turned last year will need long term care at some point and that family members will provide much of that care long term care is expensive in the national average cost of one year in a private room at a nursing home was about &# according to a georgetown university report released this month it also estimates that four hours of daily home health aide services in that same year cost &# many of us have parents who are far more practical than ourselves but others have parents who are still living in the moment with champagne taste on a budweiser budget the kids are willing and even keen to play armchair adviser but they dont know what planning tactics to advise or how to do so without offending the people who raised them bringing in an unbiased third party can help parents feel more comfortable says mark edinberg a psychologist and author in fairfield conn who specializes in elder care and family mediation a parent may have or choose a financial planner or an estate lawyer and children could arrange a family meeting says mr edinberg who recommends scheduling a talk on a day that doesnt fall within a hectic holiday break he says the discussion should include siblings and be framed as a talk about the whole familys financial future he recommends including topics like your parents geographic proximity to other family members who will be supportive as they age dont tell your parents what to do he says "they are responsible parties youre doing this with your parents and not for them " joseph matthews an attorney in san francisco and the author of "long term care how to plan and pay for it " recommends a serious planning conversation with parents who may need long term care "sit down and look at retirement income long term care insurance and the availability of adult family members to help with care " he says mr matthews recommends finding out if parents intend to spend their retirement years at home and if so encourage them to budget for in home care long term care insurance is a security blanket he says which may or may not be utilized but premiums are much more expensive if the buyer starts paying in their s and s sometimes parents do welcome and even turn to their young adult children for help two years ago delia sneed of springfield tenn asked her year old son jake sneed for help with planning jake was then a finance major at the university of tennessee knoxville ms sneed had recently been divorced from jakes father and was for the first time accountable for all her personal finances from electricity bills to a stock portfolio for their arrangement to work ms sneed now and her son found it essential that she be responsible for making the ultimate decisions about her financial plans "i dont want to burden him with that hes been strictly an adviser but a very valued one " she said "its too much pressure for someone young " added jake jake who says that he has always been good at saving money helped his mother understand her stock and mutual fund investments and acted as a sort of translator between her and her financial adviser now he is an analyst at an investment bank in atlanta ga key to the success of their teamwork was that ms sneed trusted jakes motives for helping her with finances "there wasnt any greed involved " she says "he understood that money was his and his sisters money too that it wasnt just my money and it belonged to all of us " family is our first and last support network if it functions smoothly everything else should be a little bit easier if not you can either wait to react to a crisis or start preparing for the inevitable write to emily meehan at actone wsj com
