a show that takes the funnies seriously masters of american comics newark museum newark n j jewish museum new york through jan is it ok to ask whether everything we admire automatically belongs in a museum to ensure its legitimacy need we worry that if its not in a museum it cant be any good "masters of american comics " which "endeavors to establish a canon" for such works is an exhibition that might have benefited from a more narrowly focused approach to persuading us that comics are worthy of museum attention fourteen "master" artists from the early th century to our own time are chronologically presented at the newark museum and new yorks jewish museum demonstrating an amazing range of styles in both original art work and the more familiar printed versions these latter provide the bulk of the exhibition and turn it into an exhausting if entertaining reading experience that requires a different kind of visual energy from that generally associated with looking at art one wishes for the comfortable sofas or easy chairs that would permit us to emulate the manner in which these narrative adventures entertained generations of devotees at home on the other hand the side by side interplay between original drawings and their printed comic versions provides ample opportunity for understanding how carefully conceived ideas and the nuanced characterizations and tonality we associate with old master drawings become neutralized by the heavy hand of the mechanical press too little is made of this although the visitors ability to check out comparative differences is one of the exhibitions strengths and argues in favor of an art museum setting as a result we get to see energetically creative shifts in pen or pencil marks and erasures that gradually define the comparatively static if lovingly familiar comics themselves a part of me wants to see only these drawings for the pleasure of getting close to the creative process but the impulse to follow the many story lines presumably what the artist intended keeps suggesting that i might plop down comfortably and read the full version rather than the museums frustrating readers digest editing the newark presentation is more interesting for showing the earlier artists while the jewish museum suffers from art spiegelmans having withdrawn his work in protest of its presentation thats unfortunate because of his reverence for his inspired predecessors but ironically mr spiegelman is so familiar to us that his absence does little to impair the impact of the exhibitions sense of discovery while the museums exposition might have benefited from making more of the developmental aspects of comics history some of that does emerge in the wonderfully illustrated catalog edited by john carlin paul karasik and brian walker and replete with a series of intriguing contemporary takes on how we might look at this stuff it reminds us of connections with modernism politics fantasy and a range of other issues that are a bit confusing in the exhibition itself i suspect that comics aficionados find much of the display editing even more frustrating than does the casual visitor the tongue in cheek self celebratory nature of this medium is one of its most endearing textual qualities starting with "lyonel feininger the famous german artist exhibiting the characters he will create" and then moving to marvels "the worlds greatest comic" and r crumbs "no finer comic magazine on the market today beware of imitations " laughing for and with the reader and assuming common frames of reference the way a renaissance painter assumed the viewer had read ovid many of these comic artists play with politics and sociology and human psychology as well as with one anothers work will eisner gives us lil adam lil abner and nick stacy dick tracy by cartoonist al slapp al capp their creator while harvey kurtzman of mad comics fame shows us essentially plagiarized orphan annie and jiggs as well as little annie fanny a racy version of little orphan annie because they know well understand and we do its both essentially populist and esoterically self referential the artistic cross references abound as well winsor mccay perhaps the most impressive of the artists on view reminds us that his character little nemo a young fellow who keeps finding himself in gravity defying and other surreal situations inhabited a world of forms that bridge an amazing range of imagery from thonet chairs to salvador dali paintings to michael graves architecture a century after he was a popular newspaper artist mccay is an ever more awesome artist viewed with our expanded sensibilities grafted on to his endlessly imaginative work viewers may be surprised to find lyonel feininger here a modernist american german artist better known for his association with the blaue reiter artists feininger published comics only briefly for the chicago tribune and apparently used his earnings to return to europe for further art study true to his roots feiningers comics echo such german childrens illustrators as wilhelm busch of "max und moritz" fame but also look very much like his pre abstract paintings for sheer wit no one can really touch george herriman whose feisty krazy kat comics include the forerunners of virtually all the other comic characters we have come to love the antics of officer pupp and his gang anticipate hanna barbera walter lantz and walt disney within a consciously artistic framework that looks as radical now as it must have been when first published despite its frustrating format this is a very rich exhibition for nostalgia trippers whether you like dick tracy terry and the pirates maggie and jiggs popeye mr natural or charlie brown theres a great deal of satisfying work to see especially in comparing the different framing and organizing principles of each artist "krazy kat" and "gasoline alley" page layouts are carefully composed with brilliant artistic verve that one might not have noticed previously a museum setting definitely enhances our appreciation of those comics with the greatest artistic range we also get to see how much richer the black and white images were before they received the colors added in the printing process that intense clarity which so persuasively confirms most of these imaginative men as first class draftsmen is dissipated during the inevitable translation to a mass medium with the graphic novel today taking up significant shelf space in most bookstores will eisners influence which artist raymond pettibon suggests is dickensian seems pervasive especially in his often spooky "the spirit" series aside from his impact on the here invisible spiegelman eisner is shown to be a progenitor of a subsequent range of serious novelists such as marjane satrapi whose autobiographical persepolis books have become best sellers this exhibition doesnt adequately clarify the difference between the newspaper comic strip experience and the spin off comic books we have all enjoyed and by its reticence in deconstructing the material the exhibition fails to do more than hint at the role of immigrant and first generation american jews in the creation of this phenomenon that plus the gap left by spiegelmans dissociation from a project for which he "provided the intellectual impetus" and was "the indispensable catalyst" is why the jewish museums fascinating if hastily organized addendum display on "superheroes" takes on the issue of illustrators whose immigrant jewish background is reflected in their idealized and larger than life realizations of figures fighting for "truth justice and the american way " but such a nietzschean jewish subject deserves more than this cursory overview if the dual museum trek is a bit awkward its nonetheless very rewarding and part of the gradual refocusing and "art canonization" of comics as an important cultural phenomenon even if youre not into nostalgia tripping the range of inventive draftsmanship alone justifies the belated "museumization" of most of the artists in this welcome and exciting exhibition mr freudenheim was the director of the baltimore museum of art worcester art museum and the gilbert collection in london and was assistant secretary for museums for the smithsonian institution
