atlanta gets a makeover more up less out atlanta the city that built out wants to build up atlanta has long been linked to sprawl and traffic jams now several huge mixed use construction projects seek to remake the citys landscape the new developments aim to create neighborhoods in atlanta as swank and walkable as some sections of new york and chicago with easy access to nearby office jobs chic restaurants or fashionable boutiques if successful the physical and cultural shifts could serve as a blueprint for other cities a few weeks ago two big names in real estate announced a massive development project in the midtown area of atlanta spanning three city blocks the project dubbed th &amp midtown will offer office space two luxury hotels high rise condominiums and pricey retail shops in the &# billion initial phases with hopes of luring high end european fashion houses developers selig enterprises inc and daniel corp are pitching the project as a part of "midtown mile" a block stretch of peachtree street that city fathers hope will resemble chicagos michigan avenue in look and feel and thats just one of at least six multimillion dollar projects with similarly ambitious goals under way in the urban core here other large projects include the &# billion allen plaza on the edge of downtown &# million peachtree pointe on the northern edge of midtown as well as at least three in the upscale buckhead area all of these come in the wake of the success of the &# billion atlantic station a former polluted area at a factory where barrel hoops were made that has been converted into a mini city of office space national retail chains apartments and condominiums though the suburbs are in no danger of emptying demographers are finding demand for urban residences young professionals flooding atlanta for employment are being joined by "empty nesters" whose children have grown and moved out and by others who have finally had their fill of the long commutes from the outer ring of suburbs developers say they are seeing similar trends in other sunbelt cities including charlotte n c tampa fla and dallas its part of a movement toward downtown living thats happening in many places across the country of course atlanta already has a dramatic skyline as developers have been building office skyscrapers here for decades but until very recently there were hardly any residential towers much less the kinds of mammoth mixed use developments that are now sprouting across the three main urban markets of downtown midtown and buckhead a high end neighborhood north of midtown urban living is being prodded by business and political leaders here in hopes of easing gridlock in the face of a continued population surge in buckhead the state transportation department is using about &# million in federal funds as well as contributions from the local business district and the city to redesign peachtree road into a boulevard with wider sidewalks and a tree lined median but dont hold funeral rites for the atlanta automobile just yet one reason people took refuge in suburban malls is that they offer a valued amenity air conditioning "summertime in atlanta is like living in a dishwasher " says andy lechter an executive vice president of studley inc "thats a third of the year when its hard enough to walk from your car to the shopping mall " for much of the citys modern history a walkable atlanta seemed a contradiction in terms some of the nations first suburban office parks were built in the rings around atlanta "for the longest time this city was like a doughnut nothing happening downtown everything happening in the suburbs " says hal barry chairman of barry real estate cos an atlanta developer but over the past four years or so the mind set changed in part due to exasperation over long commutes says jeff dufresne executive director the atlanta district council of the urban land institute a not for profit think tank among the nations large metro areas atlanta is ninth in population but its residents had the fourth longest average commute minutes according to a survey by the u s census bureau another contributor to the change the number of college educated young adults ages to increased in the s the fifth fastest rate of the large metros according to a recent study commissioned by the metro atlanta chamber of commerce a survey of that group showed that young adults were unhappy with the lack of round the clock activity downtown barry real estate cos allen plaza is poised to capitalize on that demand the developer lured the electricity giant southern co to a new corporate headquarters the accounting firm of ernst &amp young took space in a second tower and a third planned tower with stories will be the tallest building to be built downtown in a decade the complex also will house two hotels and post properties an atlanta based real estate investment trust is teaming up to build apartments in yet another tower for the complex the projects offer different types of "mixed use " in two of the buckhead projects peachtree and peachtree luxury condos are being stacked on top of more than a dozen floors of office space guaranteeing buyers a view of the city lights by contrast another buckhead project the &# million terminus complex in reference to atlantas original name is separating the different real estate activities into silos overbuilding is a risk "its a city in a perpetual state of boom " says keith pierce director of research for greater atlanta for cb richard ellis a real estate services firm but recent absorption the change in the net amount of occupied space has been strong enough in the citys office market to justify new construction despite a relatively high vacancy rate adds duke doubleday senior vice president for brokerage at atlanta based ackerman &amp co the condo market has been bumpy recently but hasnt halted while sales in the city center dropped by from to the former was an aberration and sales were in line with the seven year average according to haddow &amp co atlanta based real estate consultants nonetheless condominium inventory is considerably higher than in previous years and developers are hoping that strong growth in the atlanta market will fill all those units two million new residents are expected to move to the atlanta area in the next years which is roughly equal to most of the population of nevada being placed here
