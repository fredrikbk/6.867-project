the tax hit you may not see phaseouts which limit tax breaks based on income come under renewed fire what to watch out for millions of people are paying taxes at higher rates than they probably realize because of tricky provisions that can reduce or even eliminate major tax breaks based on their income these so called phaseouts because some benefits begin to phase out when your income exceeds certain levels and similar provisions should be repealed or at least simplified said nina olson the internal revenue services national taxpayer advocate in a report to congress released yesterday ms olson who isnt a political appointee heads an irs unit designed to help taxpayers cut through red tape and deal with problems that typically couldnt be resolved through normal channels the report says more than million individual income tax returns about of the total filed last year are affected each year by one or more of these provisions which can drive up a taxpayers marginal tax rate well above his or her official tax rate its doubtful that congress will eliminate phaseouts repealing them would cost the u s treasury department billions of dollars each year at a time when lawmakers are focusing more on cutting budget deficits than on simplifying the nations notoriously complex tax system yet the report throws a new spotlight on a dimly lit corner of the tax world that many taxpayers need to understand more thoroughly in order to make intelligent tax and investment planning decisions phaseouts are also referred to as "stealth" taxes because theyre difficult for the average taxpayer to detect among the most significant limits on personal exemption amounts and on many itemized deductions such as charitable contributions and state and local taxes for taxpayers whose income exceeds certain levels more than million individual returns for were hit by the income limit on itemized deductions as a result taxpayers were unable to deduct a total of more than &# billion of itemized deductions for that year other benefits that may be affected include a credit for adopting a child the child tax credit and education related incentives a new deduction for mortgage insurance also has phaseout provisions even sophisticated taxpayers may be unaware of this issue since growing numbers of americans are paying someone else to do their taxes for them last year more than of all taxpayers used paid preparers up from in the mid s and growing numbers of people rely on tax preparation software to do the number crunching for them "most of my clients are unaware" of the phaseouts says stephen w defilippis owner of west suburban income tax service in wheaton ill and an enrolled agent which means he is licensed to represent taxpayers before the irs he says clients often are amazed their tax bill was significantly higher than expected phaseouts need to be repealed said ms olson because they inject "needless complexity" into the tax laws reduce the effectiveness of tax incentives and make it tougher for many taxpayers to estimate their tax bills and pay the right amount of withholding or estimated taxes also she argued they probably reduce overall tax compliance "they add quite a bit of complexity to the tax code " agrees lindy paull of pricewaterhousecoopers in washington ms paull is a former chief of staff of congresss joint committee on taxation which issued a lengthy report in urging congress repeal numerous phaseout provisions many phaseouts and other similar provisions affect only upper income taxpayers such as the one that applies to personal exemptions for this year each personal exemption is a maximum of &# up &# from but if your income exceeds a certain level the most you can claim on your return for will be &# the irs says for a married couple filing jointly the personal exemption begins to phase out when their income exceeds &# for and reaches the maximum phaseout amount after &# for most singles the range is &# to &# congress voted to ease this provision starting in and repeal it entirely in but nobody knows whether that will happen now that the democrats have recaptured control of both houses of congress some democrats say they want to roll back president bushs tax breaks for higher income taxpayers other provisions affect people with much less income for example there are complex rules for how much of your social security benefits may be subject to tax suppose your income which for this purpose includes such items as tax exempt interest income and half of your social security benefits exceeds &# but not more than &# in that case a maximum of half your social security benefits would be reported as part of your adjusted gross income if your income exceeds &# up to of your social security benefits would be included as income and taxed accordingly as a result some lower income americans may be paying significantly higher tax rates than they think phaseouts are popular among lawmakers as a revenue raising device since raising tax rates typically creates much bigger headlines and more of a political firestorm than tweaking complex phaseouts and other provisions thus it would appear that many stealth taxes are here to stay the irs sets feb as the starting date to process returns claiming tax benefits enacted last month congress waited until last month to extend the life of several tax breaks that had expired at the end of among the now resurrected provisions known as "extenders " is the option for taxpayers who itemize to deduct state and local sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes other revived provisions include special deductions for higher education tuition and fees and for educator expenses any other returns for individuals not claiming the extender provisions can be filed as normal this month the irs said briefs the most serious problem confronting taxpayers is the alternative minimum tax says the irss ms olson the senate finance committee plans a hearing today on "tax incentives for businesses in response to a minimum wage increase " email taxreport wsj com stealth taxes many people stand to lose part or all of key tax benefits because their income is too high numerous tax benefits include income based "phaseout" provisions among the breaks affected the phaseout of personal exemptions and limits on many itemized deductions a new report by irs national taxpayer advocate nina olson urges congress to repeal or at least simplify phaseouts source irs national taxpayer report
