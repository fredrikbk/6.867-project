how plastics went from byword to bye as costs rise prices dont ge tries to sell storied unit that bred products leaders forty years ago the future seemed to belong to plastics as captured in the one word career advice offered to the young benjamin braddock in "the graduate " plastic was replacing glass metal and wood in products ranging from milk cartons to furniture to automobile parts at general electric co a young manager named jack welch was making his name creating a market for new materials such as lexan a hard plastic invented by a ge scientist in when astronauts buzz aldrin and neil armstrong walked on the moon in they wore helmets made with lexan today plastic isnt as special its makers are caught between the high cost of their raw material oil based benzene and the low price of the final product ceding ground on basic plastics to lower priced rivals and the man who succeeded mr welch as ge chairman jeffrey immelt is shopping all or part of ges plastic business for as much as &# billion the move to sell the unit is "pure supply and demand " says j p morgan analyst stephen tusa "while there are some new specialized products the majority of the products do not add enough value for customers to pay a premium " if the sale is completed it will be mr immelts latest move to reshape ges portfolio since taking over in hes sold slower growing heritage business like industrial diamonds and motors while tapping markets such as oil and gas equipment water treatment security technologies and computerized medical records hes also moved ge which already owned nbc deeper into entertainment by acquiring the universal film studio plastic was once a sexy high growth business at ge as the conglomerate acquired specialized manufacturers and opened factories in foreign countries to tap new markets mr welch says in his autobiography that he chose to work in the plastics unit which ge created in the s because it was developing new composites his first position in placed him alongside daniel fox who had invented lexan in an incident immortalized in a ge ad dr fox discovered the plastic while brewing a batch of polymers that cooled and hardened with a steel stirring rod sticking out of it forming a kind of mallet " we kept it around the laboratory and occasionally used it to drive nails it was tough " dr fox who died in once said in addition to space gear lexan was used early on in the windshields of fighter jets and the first compact discs in ge developed noryl a blended plastic used in products such as electrical coatings in televisions and later in computer hardware mr welch became general manager of the unit with its headquarters on plastics avenue in pittsfield mass in noel tichy a university of michigan professor who once led ges management school says mr welch created an entrepreneurial business culture in his decade at the plastics unit taking philosophies honed there with him when he went on to run ge mr tichy says that mr welch "had to convince the automotive makers that they should consider plastic parts for the cars " car makers are now one of the units biggest clients when mr tichy wrote in the s on the changes ge would have to make to thrive in the first half of this century "i certainly didnt predict plastics would be one of them " the plastics unit has long been a training ground for other top ge executives as well mr welch rotated his top managers through the division from mr immelt to john rice now a ge vice chairman in the s mr welch named robert wright to head up strategy at plastics before mr wright went to run the companys media business now nbc universal mr immelt worked in the plastics unit for six years in the s and five more years in the s before taking over the medical division in the plastics unit mr immelt saw first hand some of the problems plaguing the business today at one point he missed his profit targets partly because of high material costs over the past few years mr immelt has pushed for new specialized plastics to distinguish ge from competitors including light weight materials for cars general motors corp s chevrolet volt prototype battery powered vehicle uses ge resins extensively including in its doors hood roof and fenders and wire coatings ge says those materials helped to cut the weight of the car in half ges lexan has moved into new markets too the roof of the new shanghai rail station square yards is made of the clear plastic but these moves havent been enough to combat a growing number of competitors particularly in asia the plastics unit has also been hurt by the slowing automotive industry growth has slowed dramatically at plastics in the first nine months of last year the plastic unit had &# billion in revenue and operating profit fell from the prior year ge continues to pursue new technology in plastics investing &# million in last fall ge said it would expand factories that make specialty plastics in the u s spain and the netherlands while cutting back on basic plastics it also continued to acquire modest size plastics companies the unit has employees in locations world wide analysts expect interest in the unit from both private equity firms and strategic players including dow chemical co and german chemical company basf ag one of the largest suppliers of plastics saudi arabian company saudi basic industries corp has also expressed interest according to a report by citigroup analyst jeffrey sprague analysts say private equity buyers might be able to make the unit more profitable by cutting costs more sharply than ge is willing to do the auction however is at a early stage and ge could still decide to spin off the unit if it isnt happy with the offers in a conference call last fall when asked about the
