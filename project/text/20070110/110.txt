u s effort to isolate iran gains ground as european bank restrictions take hold the u s governments attempt to isolate irans economy will get a significant boost this month when the last european bank known to be clearing large volumes of that countrys dollar transactions in the u s halts the practice commerzbank ag germanys second largest bank said it will stop handling dollar transactions for iran at its new york branch by jan cracking downthe issue as the u s aims to isolate iran commerzbank will join other european banks in halting its dollar transactions whats at stake the u s says banks provide unwitting support for irans efforts to back terrorism and build nuclear weapons the bottom line few big banks continue cooperating with iran forcing it to do business in euros not dollars and increasing the cost of international transactions over the past year most european banks with longstanding relationships with iran have bowed to u s pressure and sharply curtailed transactions with irans state controlled banks which the u s says support terrorism the u s also is seeking to financially quarantine iran because of tehrans vows to press ahead with its nuclear program in defiance of international will in a related move the treasury department yesterday named irans fifth largest state owned bank bank sepah and its subsidiaries as weapons proliferators and barred banks operating in the u s from handling any transactions on their behalf last year commerzbank became bank sepahs principal clearer of dollar transactions in the u s stuart levey treasurys undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence said bank sepah served as the key financial conduit for irans main missile firms which were singled out in a united nations sanctions resolution against irans nuclear program last month u s analysts say there is evidence that iranian firms are feeling the pinch of the u s led drive iranian banks and companies for instance are now having to put up large deposits as high as in foreign banks to get them to issue letters of credit for foreign transactions they claim iranian officials deny the nations banks handle money for terrorist organizations or purposes mohammad jafar mojarrad vice governor of the countrys central bank said that while the u s has "put a lot of pressure on iran" and some foreign banks have scaled back dealings with the country operations of the countrys banks havent been affected choking off irans financial ties to europe is key to washingtons effort to isolate the country the european union is irans largest trading partner by far trade between the two topped &# billion last year but trade growth is stagnating largely because of u s pressure because many big european banks have stopped dealing with tehran in recent months the fundamentalist islamic regime of president mahmoud ahmadinejad has relied on commerzbank and a handful of smaller banks to handle its dollar based transactions the result irans beleaguered economy is having a harder time moving hard currency around the globe in an easy and cost effective way that implies a higher cost of doing business for iranian companies and the government which are being forced into more expensive alternative financial markets u s pressure isnt likely to bring irans economy to its knees but it could cause serious pain iran receives tens of billions of dollars annually in oil revenue but it spends much of those funds to import refined fuels and other goods as irans access to hard currency becomes more restricted and costly the country could see a reduction in its ability to pay for heavy machinery and other items essential to keeping its oil industry and other key parts of its economy going in response to u s pressure on european and other bankers who serve iranian firms iran has said it wants to switch most of its business to euros the currency of the eu but oil is irans biggest export and many of the countrys trade partners in the middle east will do business only in dollars the currency of the international petroleum industry at present commerzbank handles both dollar and euro transactions for irans state owned banks like several other european banks it will cease handling only dollar transactions that is likely to limit the economic damage to iran enabling the countrys banks to continue paying suppliers who will accept euros or other currencies but it is likely to subject commerzbank and its peers to further u s pressure "the risks of doing business with iran are the same in all currencies " said mr levey intelligence officials say bank saderat a large state controlled iranian bank placed on a u s treasury blacklist in october for allegedly funding terrorism has been able to process dollar transactions through commerzbanks new york branch in recent months by using the accounts of two other iranian banks commerzbank says it ceased dealing with saderat after it was put on the u s blacklist and has no knowledge of any subsequent transactions "commerzbank has no knowledge of bank saderat directly or indirectly using the accounts of other iranian banks to process dollar transactions " the bank said in a statement commerzbank in a response to an inquiry from the wall street journal about its dealings with iran also said "all such dollar clearing transactions are currently being phased out" as of jan it added that "any clearing conducted by our u s operations is in strict compliance" with u s government regulations the efforts to isolate iran also appear to be yielding results in italy one of tehrans largest trading partners in trade between the two countries topped &# billion in a sign of how some european banks are rethinking their dealings with iran italys largest bank intesa sanpaolo spa says its trade finance business with the country has dropped significantly in recent months u s efforts to stop european banks from dealing with iran are controversial european banks view the campaign as an attempt to extend the reach of u s sanctions on iran without the backing of the united nations or the eu indeed there is no general international ban on providing financial and trade services to iranian banks but banks that assist irans banks are increasingly exposed to u s regulatory scrutiny and political pressure from the u s treasury department the u s a key market for most international banks has long unilaterally imposed strict limits on what business banks and companies with operations in the u s can conduct with iran in
