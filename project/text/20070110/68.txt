newspapers set to jointly sell ads on web sites gannett mcclatchy and tribune to form nationwide network yahoos competing effort the nations three largest newspaper publishers are gearing up to sell advertising jointly on their newspapers web sites believing their survival depends on seizing new online revenue gannett co mcclatchy co and tribune co are planning to offer advertisers one stop shopping for display ads on internet sites the goal is to attract big advertisers such as car makers and phone companies that want to reach a nationwide online audience but dont want the hassle of negotiating ad deals with each company or newspaper the joint effort code named "open network " marks a big new bid to win back advertisers that are defecting in droves to the web currently national advertisers buy the bulk of their online display ads banners and boxes from big portals such as yahoo inc time warner inc s aol or microsoft corp s msn yahoo has announced plans to work with seven other newspaper publishers to build a similar one stop shopping spot for advertisers google inc has also reaped a bonanza with advertising links that appear next to search results the three newspaper companies known in the industry as gmt are likely to each contribute of their online advertising space to the network according to people familiar with the situation they hope to announce something early this year although the deal isnt finalized and could still fall apart the venture is designed to help the chains tackle a vexing problem they have long had trouble attracting national advertisers in their print editions this is largely because of price newspapers can jack up ad prices for local retailers that have few other ways to reach a hometown audience but national advertisers often find it cheaper to buy a tv spot or magazine ad than to buy space in dozens of newspapers national advertisers also account for about of advertising on the internet according to pricewaterhousecoopers efforts by the chains to coordinate their print advertising sales have shown little success partly because individual papers werent enthusiastic about standardizing ad sizes or giving up control of their relationships with advertisers but with the industry under severe stress that reluctance to band together may change "traditionally print newspaper companies have not worked well together to sell national ads in print " says jack williams president of gannett digital "we intend to sell internet advertising differently " tribune and mcclatchy declined to comment the nascent effort faces a challenge from a rival group of newspapers led by hearst corp and medianews group inc that own more than newspapers known in the industry as the "seven amigos " this group has teamed up with yahoo to sell online recruiting classifieds and is finalizing a deal to develop its own national ad sales network both sides concede that it would be better for the newspaper industry to have a single effort but they have competing efforts in online classified ads making cooperation in display advertising difficult circulation is declining at major papers across the country as readers increasingly find news online and elsewhere while newspapers are selling more online ads the growth isnt fast enough to make up for setbacks in print during the first nine months of internet ad revenues including search ads rose to &# billion according to pricewaterhousecoopers data compiled for the interactive advertising bureau during that same period the local newspaper industrys ad revenues slipped to &# billion according to tns media intelligence last year investors frustrated with the poor performance of newspaper stocks forced knight ridder inc to sell itself to mcclatchy this year tribune is expected to sell off portions of its business to satisfy restless shareholders newspaper chains such as gannett built themselves in the s through s often buying family owned papers and investing in labor saving technologies that boosted profits as two paper cities disappeared many of the chain papers gained an effective monopoly as the only vehicle for reaching big and affluent local audiences that served them well with local advertisers such as retailers and car dealerships and allowed them to support the costs of journalists and printing plants the newspaper industry has tried to sell national ads before in the industry set up a national sales arm the newspaper national network to sell ads in certain categories that newspapers werent successfully selling most chains also attempt to sell national ads across their properties gannett has a team in chicago that helps big advertisers buy in multiple gannett papers however even with the national newspaper usa today in its portfolio national advertising represented only about of gannetts newspaper advertising revenues during the first months of late last year more than newspapers began testing a program allowing advertisers to buy print ads automatically through googles web site that effort is targeted at small advertisers that wouldnt be likely to get attention from a newspaper salesperson now as circulation declines and readers move to the internet the chains realize they need to do more an early internet joint venture was careerbuilder com a web site for classified jobs advertising tribune and knight ridder bought careerbuilder in when it was an also ran behind monster com and yahoo hotjobs gannett joined the venture two years later and the trio built careerbuilder into the no online recruiting web site with million unique visitors in november according to comscore media metrix careerbuilders success has also driven a wedge in the newspaper industry careerbuilder has raised the cut of revenue it takes when its newspaper partners deliver ads to the site or when it delivers an ad to a newspaper according to people familiar with the arrangements in the past year several newspapers defected from careerbuilder to monster com including the philadelphia inquirer st petersburg fla times and akron ohio beacon journal in a september meeting medianews chief executive dean singleton complained about careerbuilders renegotiated terms and reluctance to take on big new equity partners to gannett chief executive craig dubow according to a person close to the situation mr dubow refused to loosen the terms this person says so mr singleton threw his weight behind negotiations with yahoo hotjobs a competitor to careerbuilder in november mr singleton announced a deal with yahoo hotjobs along with belo corp cox newspapers inc hearst newspapers journal register co lee enterprises inc and e w scripps co the "seven amigos" also signed a letter of intent to expand the relationship with yahoo to include a national ad sales network similar to the one being formed by gannett mcclatchy and tribune since then two other newspaper groups have joined the yahoo consortium media general inc and morris communications co the expanded yahoo deal is likely to require the newspapers in the consortium to use yahoo search on their newspaper web sites according to people close to the discussions in addition yahoo and the newspapers could sell ads on each others sites with revenue being shared among the partners the deal is being finalized these people say lincoln millstein senior vice president at hearst newspapers said he hopes gannett mcclatchy and tribune will join the yahoo consortium instead of striking out on their own "were all struggling to get our fair share of national advertising revenues and this partnership with yahoo would go a long way toward achieving that goal " he said so far gannett has signaled its intent to go a separate route in a december presentation to investors mr dubow the gannett ceo first mentioned the troikas efforts to build "the largest network of newspaper developed local sites for any advertiser to reach local consumers " he said that "unlike past efforts in the industry " the group will "focus on customer needs " in an interview gannetts mr williams confirmed the project is in the works he said the group would welcome other members so long as they agree to conditions about ad pricing and placement "if other people are interested in participating they can join but only if they are willing to live with the rules " he said the project would rely in part on mcclatchys existing national online sales network called real cities gmt is leery of the seven amigos agreement to use yahoos technology to deliver advertising on the newspapers web sites according to a person close to the situation yahoo will then gain sensitive information such as which newspaper sites are doing well and which pages are most popular by contrast the gmt group is considering other technology options that wouldnt involve handing control to a potential competitor it has held discussions with centro llc a chicago based company that places ads on newspaper sites across the country according to a person close to the situation shawn riegsecker the president of centro says the two camps need to get together to compete with big portals "if you break this industry apart you completely devalue the value proposition to the spot advertiser in the national market " mr riegsecker says sarah ellison contributed to this article
