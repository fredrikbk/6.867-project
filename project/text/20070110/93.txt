thailand tightens rules on foreign investment bangkok thailand thailands military installed government added a new degree of uncertainty to the business climate by approving plans to force some foreign investors to reduce their shareholdings in businesses considered vital to national security but the government stopped short of including retailers insurers banks and brokers meaning some key areas of the economy will escape the provisions the draft law could complicate the transaction that triggered the proposed new investment rules in the first place singapore state investment firm temasek holdings pte ltd s purchase of a majority stake in thai telecommunications company shin corp from the family of former prime minister thaksin shinawatra who was ousted in a military coup in september other investors in thailands telecom sector such as telenor asa of norway also could be forced to reduce their investments if the draft becomes law the new rules which the thai cabinet approved yesterday also increase the unpredictability of doing business in thailand at a time when the country already is losing the confidence of many investors in december thailands central bank introduced stiff capital controls on foreign investments and on new years eve a series of bombings in bangkok killed three people and further eroded business confidence army leaders have accused followers of mr thaksin who is now in exile often in china of planting the bombs in bangkok a claim that mr thaksin denies investigators also are investigating the shin deal for evidence that mr thaksin broke the law which would help justify the sept coup this has led to worries among investors that thailands new leaders might pursue a witch hunt to incriminate mr thaksin which also could damage the interests of foreign businesses unconnected to the countrys political turmoil the proposed changes in the investment rules which need approval by the national legislative assembly which was appointed after the coup dont appear as sweeping as many investors had feared retailers insurers banks and brokers are specifically exempted from the proposed changes to the investment law that effectively leaves hypermarket operators such as tesco plc of britain and carrefour sa of france both of which have large chains in thailand off the hook other major investors such as car manufacturers ford motor co of the u s and toyota motor corp of japan arent subject to the foreign ownership restrictions applied in the service sector as a result of existing rules designed to promote export oriented manufacturing operations in thailand "while we still await further details on the proposed changes first indications are that the revision is somewhat less stringent than initially expected " said frederic neumann an economist with hsbc in hong kong even so investors in thailands financial markets reacted to the governments latest decision by again selling down stocks the benchmark stock exchange of thailand index fell yesterday to close at following earlier declines triggered by the dec bombings and the capital controls the controls required foreign investors to deposit of their investments in a non interest bearing account at the central bank for at least one year though the government one day later exempted investments destined for the stock market on monday the joint foreign chambers of commerce of thailand which represents countries and more than companies issued a rare statement to voice its concern that thousands of businesses in a wide range of sectors would be affected by the proposed new foreign investment rules "any change in the law making it more difficult to do business here is something we view negatively " the organizations chairman peter van haren said yesterday he added that the chambers are willing to work with the government finance minister pridiyathorn devakula told reporters yesterday that the changes would largely be limited to the telecom industry he said foreign companies in the service sector that hold more than of voting rights wont be required to reduce their shareholdings or voting rights but they would now be required to report their shareholding structure to the government the new regulations are designed to prevent some foreign owned businesses from circumventing foreign ownership restrictions by using thai citizens to hold nominal legal control of companies while foreigners retain majority voting rights thailand has allowed overseas investors to skirt foreign investment regulations in this way for decades which has helped propel the countrys economic growth but while this gray area has attracted investors many businesses have been built on questionable legal foundations temasek appeared to fall afoul of thailands foreign investment laws last year when it led a group of local investors in purchasing a majority stake in shin corp from mr thaksins family for &# billion critics of the deal including thailands ministry of commerce say it placed strategic communications assets in the hands of foreigners because temasek and not its local partners controlled the company a temasek spokesman didnt respond to requests yesterday for comment the company has said it would be prepared to reduce its shareholding in the telecom company if necessary
