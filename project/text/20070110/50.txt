innovating beyond traditional tv ads questions for judy l hu company general electric title global executive director advertising and brand general electric has a long history of invention after all the company was founded by thomas edison now ge has been bringing some of that entrepreneurial spirit to the way it advertises by trying its hand at nontraditional commercial formats last year for instance ge ran a tv ad known as "one second theater" that had information about ad characters embedded within some of the frames some tv ads are made up of about frames per second short teasers before the ad alerted tivo viewers that they could use their digital video recorders to slow the ad down and find the additional content more recently ge has made short films that subtly promote its products available on demand to digital subscribers of time warners time warner cable judy l hu ges global executive director advertising and brand has been supervising these efforts given technologies such as digital video recorders that make it easier for tv viewers to avoid watching ads "we definitely feel that we have always got to be experimenting to find different ways to reach the consumer " says ms hu years old a former ad agency executive one idea being considered is embedding new tv ads with pictures of employees from erie pa and cincinnati and running the commercials in those specific locales the hope is that the employees will use dvrs to slow the ads down and find themselves and their colleagues below ms hu talks about what it takes to get audiences to make a choice to watch a commercial and tells why some of ges more complex businesses get a big spotlight in its current advertising the wall street journal some of the new techniques ge is using ads available on demand via digital cable for instance depend heavily on your ability to convince consumers to stop what they are doing and spend more time looking at or finding an ad in a world where people seem more eager to avoid ads altogether what makes you think you will get people to do this ms hu thats an easy one because what were showing arent ads in their usual format what we are showing are pieces of film that are highly entertaining they are new they are creatively done and they are beautifully produced and they capture peoples imagination thats why people will go to them they are different from standard ads wsj and you really think you can even get people with dvrs to make the choice not to skip through advertising ms hu yes i do actually weve had proof i shouldnt be quite so flippant with you of course we track what we do and were really numbers oriented with one second theater what we like to say is we gave audiences a second and they gave us two minutes its two minutes they actually spent and we track this with our partners but people who actually stopped and took a look at it when they recorded it spent three times as long they spent three times as long as they ordinarily spent with any other ad ge says of all tivo users chose to watch the promotion spending an average of two minutes with it when tivo helped us track this we actually got people who ordinarily might zap through the ads they recorded to actually sit and watch it and spend more time with it than ever before that was our goal going into it it was a risky operation because we didnt know for sure that it would work wsj many of ges businesses are involved in activities that are somewhat arcane to the average consumer one of your new ads finds a clever way to demonstrate ges desalination capabilities for example in the commercial a boat full of fishermen use their nets to catch bottles of fresh water from the ocean so they get fresh water from salt water wouldnt you be better off placing some of this advertising in venues that attract a deeper concentration of people in these particular industries ms hu the whole campaign imagination at work was really designed to help change the image of ge we launched it four and a half years ago and its really not designed specifically to increase sales so its different in that sense and i always joke about this even with people internally at ge if i run an aircraft engine spot that doesnt mean that someone is going to pick up the phone and say gee i have this need of an aircraft engine it doesnt work like that what we really want to do is to speak to our clients investors potential recruits in a way in a human way that touches their minds and hearts as well as in a rational way and tells our product story i think its a huge challenge to the agency omnicom groups bbdo we do have very difficult highly technical stories to tell and when they manage to do that in seconds its nothing short of a miracle wsj its well known that ge puts the bulk of its tv ad spend into ads on nbc and its cable properties but in a world where network audiences are shrinking wouldnt you reach more people by spreading your ads around or are you getting such a great ad rate from your nbc subsidiary that its hard to pass up ms hu its certainly not the latter what i would say is this we love nbc we love the shows were going to be there we buy just a little bit on other cable networks but the bulk of our commercials are on nbc and nbc cable
