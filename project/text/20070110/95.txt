the daily fix cooperstown calls ripken gwynn but turns its back on mcgwire cooperstown made its annual call yesterday summoning two to immortality in baseballs hall of fame but the story was who wasnt called and this time the reasons werent the stuff of barroom arguments they go to the heart of the sports steroids crisis and are a harbinger of cooperstown conflicts to come cal ripken jr who redefined shortstop as a baltimore oriole and broke lou gehrigs famed consecutive games streak earned enshrinement in his first year of eligibility with of the vote joining him with of the vote the san diego padres tony gwynn one of the greatest pure hitters ever on the outside looking in relief ace rich gossage of the vote shy of the margin needed for induction and boston red sox slugger jim rice and a home run hitter named mark mcgwire once crowned the savior of post strike baseball for his pursuit of roger mariss single season home run record now tarred and feathered amid suspicions but no actual proof as a poster boy for performance enhancing drugs mr mcgwire clubbed homers but hall of fame voters named him on just of ballots a clear repudiation of his career timing is everything two revered baseball scribes write "i feared at first that their enshrinement might be diminished by the steroids debate " tom verducci writes of ripken and gwynn in sports illustrated "but in recalling their ambassadorship for baseball during and since their playing days i believe their honor will be enhanced by such rattle and hum not only did ripken and gwynn serve only one organization with loyalty and respect they also gave back to the game on its most important side the amateur side when the cheering stopped ripken as the conscience and hands on guide for cal ripken baseball a division of babe ruth baseball and gwynn as the baseball coach at san diego state " in the washington post thomas boswell asks "how does baseball catch these undeserved breaks for much of the last years baseballs bosses owners and union have tacitly condoned and virtually encouraged an epidemic of illegal and dangerous performance enhancing drugs and the two superstars of the last quarter century who are least likely to have cheated who if anything were nagged for not having quite enough power arrive right on schedule " ripkens "election to the hall of fame announced yesterday is the high point of a script hollywood would turn down as too sappy " writes john eisenberg in the baltimore sun "a kid roots for his hometown ball team which his dad works for and in some ways embodies the kid grows up gets drafted by the team and makes it to the major leagues he wins the world series he plays for his dad he plays with his brother he never leaves town he doesnt miss a game for years he makes sports history he retires he makes the hall of fame never leaves home i mean come on its a norman rockwell painting a john r tunis novel as wholesome as the come on milk he endorses you couldnt make it up but it really happened " in the san diego union tribune tim sullivan writes that gwynn as might be expected from so cerebral a student of batting thought and thought about his cooperstown chances and amazingly worried about them "the question at least in gwynns mind was whether singles hitters like himself were accorded a lesser form of immortality whether the sluggers sneered at the table setters in some sort of informal hall of fame hitters hierarchy " he writes "obviously mr padre was overthinking the whole thing the padres would not have commissioned a statue of gwynn to be unveiled this summer if he were some second rate star this is a guy remember with more batting titles than any man breathing yet the idle ballplayers brain is susceptible to all kinds of claptrap during the five years between retirement and a first appearance on the baseball writers association of americas ballot " an amazing stat from mr sullivan "were each of gwynns singles worth only the feet between home plate and first base their cumulative length would stretch more than miles " as a fan of the new york mets jace didnt get much of a chance to see ripken play but he saw all too much of gwynn who hit against the mets in his career so let me add my own little tribute each time i saw tony gwynn beat my favorite team the first thing i thought had nothing to do with anger or despair instead it was "thats another hit ill be able to tell my son i saw tony gwynn get " this is the same subject but the fix likes those asterisks as barrier velvet rope mr mcgwire incinerated his legacy in the spring of when he mumbled to members of congress that "im not here to talk about the past " unfortunately for him thats all columnists wanted to discuss in the los angeles times bill plaschke explains that times rules dont allow him a hall of fame vote but he wouldnt have voted for big mac despite feeling a bit queasy about that "today i wonder if mcgwire is less a duck and more of a scapegoat for several years writers have been looking to administer some street justice in mcgwire we found our mark " maybe so but mr plaschke finishes his column sounding like a vigilante with a clear conscience "it sickens me to think that ripken and gwynn might have shared their cooperstown podium with a cartoon character gwynn would have talked about how he collected hits by showing up early and studying films for hours then mcgwire would have talked about what how overnight his arms grew into at least homers for four consecutive seasons ripken would have talked about the work ethic that led him to show up for every game for more than years then mcgwire would have talked about hmm disappearing after retirement so nobody could see how much his body has shrunk " in the bergen record bob klapisch has words for the disappearing slugger "mcgwire has only one option remaining if he hopes to makes it to cooperstown before he dies he can tell the truth mcgwire owes the game and its fans one last moment of clarity before he disappears forever into his gated golf course community in southern california tell us what you did in tell us why you did it tell us the mistakes you made were borne partly by peer pressure and partly because of your own greed and need for approval stop hiding and face the fans who once believed you and sammy sosa saved baseball " in the st louis post dispatch bernie miklasz points fingers at more people than mr mcgwire "the halls of cooperstown are safe at least for now and throughout our great republic im sure well sleep better tonight knowing that a suspected steroids user has been barred from taking a spot among the assorted vaseline ball pitchers amphetamine heads racists alleged game fixers and known druggies now the sporting press that basically served as mcgwires personal public relations agency in is having a belated attack of guilt and acting on the impulse to play high priest for a day and thats a leading reason as to why mcgwire went from national hero to national disgrace " but what about messrs gossage and rice to say nothing of bert blyleven and andre dawson and why did some writers not vote for such obvious hall of famers as ripken and gwynn on espn com jayson stark offers an entertaining look inside the voting process and handicaps some potential inductees chances in years to come tip of the fix cap to
