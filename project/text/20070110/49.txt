genentech is a hard act to follow after strong biotech firm races against its own track record it doesnt get any better than for genentech inc and that may be the problem the biotech behemoth is expected to announce today that earnings grew as much as for the year the impressive result was driven largely by the successful debut of genentechs new eye drug lucentis which treats a form of age related blindness also fueling the years performance was solid if less explosive growth of its core cancer drugs avastin rituxan and herceptin genentechs challenge what to do for an encore "no company grows at into infinity " warns cowen &amp co analyst eric schmidt he currently forecasts growth of thats still well above average for an industry where good growth typically means to but it shows how genentech the second largest biotech company by sales after amgen inc is starting to face some of the same challenges to growth now confounding its even bigger and more mature pharmaceutical competitors "look out three to five years " mr schmidt says "genentech like every biotech and pharma company before it is going to face the problem of needing to grow off a larger sales base theres no risk that earnings will decline anytime soon but well probably see genentech as a midteens growth company in a few years " along with the growing pains of a maturing company analysts point to a pipeline depleted by flurry of swift product launches and a recent regulatory setback as putting potential brakes on growth filling the pipeline after a blockbuster year is "a good challenge to have " said genentech chief executive officer arthur levinson at the j p morgan healthcare conference in san francisco late monday he cited brand new molecules in genentechs early stage program and more than later stage products many of these new uses for existing drugs as fuel for growth genentech has vowed to put new molecules into its pipeline by an ambitious goal in its three decades of existence the company based in south san francisco grew from a boutique biotech trying to prove it could spin gold out of the straw of gene splicing after first coaxing living cells to churn out human insulin and human growth hormone it came up with the clot buster activase for heart attacks now it has evolved into a cancer drug company ranking at the top in u s oncology product sales cowens mr schmidt projects that genentechs revenue will total &# billion with &# billion of that coming from product sales and the rest coming from royalties contract income and other operations he estimates earnings will total &# billion or &# a share over while genentech has forecast earnings growth in the range of to dr levinson declined to comment on specific estimates as for refilling its pipeline genentech recently announced encouraging results for its experimental ovarian cancer drug omnitarg and promised to unveil detailed data at a big cancer meeting in june but omnitarg is still in the middle stages of human testing far from final proof and the market another new drug known as apol trail which delivers a suicide order to cancer cells is still in even earlier safety tests right now the companys pipeline appears "somewhat depleted" of novel candidates nearing late stage development mr schmidt says "were scrambling hiring new people into r&amp d as fast as we can " dr levinson told a packed crowd of investors on monday "were consumed" with hiring the best researchers to stoke the pipeline he added "the money is there were working on the people scrambling to make sure people are as pleased with our growth years from now as this year " susan desmond hellman genentechs president of product development said in an interview that although product launches were run out faster than anticipated "i feel as good about the genentech r&amp d as ever " but as with any discovery company she cautioned "not all new molecules will work " for now analysts say a lot of the companys pipeline action comes from clinical trials testing new uses for its existing drugs avastin rituxan herceptin and lucentis to extend their already successful franchises "avastin is a pipeline in itself " says geoffrey meacham an analyst at j p morgan chase &amp co in new york "simply leveraging the avastin assets will continue to drive growth for genentech " he sees label extensions for the drug as the companys near term "value story " however there could be "a drag on earnings for " as a result of a recent food and drug administration decision to delay genentechs application to market avastin for breast cancer says gene mack a biotech analyst with hsbc securities usa inc in september the fda asked genentech for more rigorous analysis of its breast cancer data deferring approval "the hangover the deceleration of earnings growth in has been compounded " mr mack says "a very important expansion of avastins label that we were expecting at the end of isnt coming until the end of " meanwhile a cash rich genentech is also adding product opportunities by forging partnerships just before the new year genentech signed a &# million investment in exelixis a smaller biotech company developing experimental molecules that have the potential to lead to cancer drugs avastin is the "marquee franchise going forward " with a breast cancer approval foreseen in late or early mr schmidt predicts even sanguine forecasts envision lucentis will eventually plateau though genentech is testing new uses for the drug in diabetic eye disease now used to prevent blindness and restore vision to people suffering age related macular degeneration or amd a problem affecting the sight of one million u s patients the drug costs &# per injection mr schmidt the analyst sees lucentis posting &# million in its first full year sales in lucentiss spectacular debut is clouded by off label use of genentechs older drug avastin made with a larger version of the same antibody at a fraction of the price amid popular demand by ophthalmologists and patients and support from the american academy of ophthalmology the national eye institute a unit of the national institutes of health is sponsoring a head to head clinical trial pitting lucentis against its cheaper predecessor "off label use of avastin may remain a factor in this market" for some time dr levinson acknowledged monday at the j p morgan meeting dr desmond hellman said in an interview last month that genentech declined to sponsor the trial but didnt oppose the nih sponsored study or physicians off label use but she cautions that when given as a cancer treatment in far higher doses avastin carries a "black box warning" signaling potential cardiovascular risks lucentis is a smaller molecule version tailored for use in the eye and carries less risk of such side effects she said dr desmond hellman called reports on the success of using avastin off label "impressive" but "anecdotal " and she added "if my mom had amd id want her to get a drug that is proven safe and effective " the nihs two year multicenter trial set to start in april should settle the question but for now it adds to analysts uncertainty over the future of lucentis as a blockbuster "call me concerned " says hsbcs mr mack adding that avastin needs only to show equal safety and efficacy to trump lucentis "i believe that in this trial avastin doesnt have to be superior to lucentis " he says "it is th the cost "
