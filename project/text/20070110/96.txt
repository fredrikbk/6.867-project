the evening wrap forward march president bush will lay out his plans for the way forward in iraq this evening and while an infusion of american military muscle appears likely the move may satisfy neither hawks nor doves tonight the president lifts the curtain on his months in the making rethink of his strategy for the war and as has been widely expected an escalation in the number of american boots on the ground will be the major part of the package according to an associated press report mr bush will deploy another u s soldiers in iraq about of those will find themselves in the restive anbar province roost of the sunni insurgency and an area that is thought to be thick with al qaeda militants and foreign fighters the remaining soldiers will land in baghdad where sectarian militias have been taking turns lobbing mortar rounds into each others neighborhoods and where suicide bombings and the discovery of mutilated corpses are nearly a daily occurrence the first brigade appears due to arrive in the scarred capital in roughly a week with a second brigade likely to march in by the middle of february the remaining soldiers will dribble in over time the ap reported the u s force will be supplemented by three iraqi brigades the whole question of a surge has been hotly debated for months first there is a fight over semantics war opponents believe that "surge" read temporary is disingenuous and that what is really being proposed by the administration is a dramatic escalation of american involvement in iraq something that democrats say voters rejected in november many critics argue that the time for more troops was at the invasion or shortly after the fall of baghdad and that a surge now would leave the military stretched too thin on other fronts but those who endorse sending in more troops may also find the "surge" plan wanting frederick kagan and jack keane the american enterprise institute scholars generally credited as the prime movers of the "surge" movement said in december that it would take at least combat troops to clamp down on the violence and weeks earlier than that mr kagan was agitating for an infusion of at least troops there are currently about u s soldiers in iraq the length of the mission is also critical surge proponents say that the new troops will need to stay a while to control iraqs sectarian clashes with the added troops and a bundle of economic initiatives the u s is shifting its emphasis from training iraqi security forces to protecting a populace beset by insurgent and sectarian violence and trying amid the bloodshed to nurse along some species of entrepreneurship and prosperity to be sure iraqis will be expected to share the burden "they are going to have more boots on the ground " white house adviser dan bartlett said "theyre going to be the ones doing the knocking on the door " but the souls and &# billion being dedicated to the change in direction make it dear to americans and the plan has already triggered seismic tremors in washington sen norm coleman a stalwart republican took to the floor of the senate today and said "i do not want to embarrass the president but i do not support a surge " with democrats getting ready to pass a symbolic resolution against the move more such speeches may be in the offing like mr coleman other republicans may seize the chance to express their doubts lest the
