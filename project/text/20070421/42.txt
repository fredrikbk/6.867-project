pursuits books sarkozying up to the french electorate testimony by nicolas sarkozy pantheon pages &# in the days leading up to the first round of the french presidential elections scheduled for this sunday the attention of the public has come to focus squarely on the favorite nicolas sarkozy the year old center right candidate inspires fear or admiration although rarely both together and the vote is shaping up as a referendum on the man himself "the disturbing monsieur sarkozy" was the giant headline on the front page of wednesdays left wing daily liberation the word "disturbing" cuts both ways of course and mr sarkozy might agree in part with the characterization for the past year he has loudly pledged to shake up a country mired in economic and social malaise "testimony france in the twenty first century " the english language translation of last summers political blockbuster in france gives american readers a good idea of how mr sarkozy might go about it though not quite in the way that his preface promises he claims that his book will give "an analysis of the difficulties france faces " but "testimony" doesnt exactly do that its also not a policy tract an autobiography a statement of political philosophy or a campaign pitch rather it is a series of vignettes from mr sarkozys career taken in their entirety they offer the portrait of a complex political personality mr sarkozy is in prose as in life impetuous open minded authoritarian willing to offend opportunistic eager to challenge convention and ideologically muddled his bruising personal style hyperkinetic confrontational blunt would be harder to bear were it not such a refreshing contrast to frances stultified political culture the candidate himself makes no apologies for "going too fast going too far and even being too much " little wonder that the french know mr sarkozy better than either of the other main contenders for the french presidency segolene royal a socialist and the centrist francois bayrou or that mr sarkozy has set the terms of debate in this race in its fitful way "testimony" helps to explain why mr sarkozy is so divisive the book offers a more intimate look at the man than "ensemble" "together" a dry political manifesto that mr sarkozy has just brought out in france it is clear that above all he strains to be different and in a resume sense he certainly is he is a gaullist "with a foreign sounding name " as he notes his father is an immigrant from hungary his mother of greek jewish stock he did not attend the ecole nationale dadministration the fancy finishing school for the french ruling elite his path he says was to "start as a grassroots party organizer and climb his way up " this horatio alger esque self portrait is a bit of a stretch however a lawyer who was born into the upper middle class mr sarkozy has been a political insider for the better part of three decades the story goes that in the mid s then prime minister jacques chirac spotted mr sarkozy only years old and gave him "five minutes" to speak at a party powwow in nice he mesmerized the crowd for nearly a half hour mr sarkozys talent for oratory and his willingness to provoke helped him to rise politically he made enemies along the way most famously of president chirac and his fortunes have dipped from time to time but he always fought his way back for most of the past five years he has held prominent posts interior minister and finance minister in the unpopular sitting government he knows that to win the presidency he must position himself as an anti incumbent candidate to judge by the latest polls he is pulling the trick off a tribute to his political skills in "testimony " mr sarkozy doesnt exactly declare a governing philosophy he calls himself a man of action who finds "pragmatic solutions to a burning problem for french society " among the problems he has in mind are the troubled mostly arab immigrant housing projects outside so many large french cities and more broadly frances chronically high unemployment rate but action guided by what to what ultimate end since he cannot seem to declare a clear set of beliefs or guiding political principles mr sarkozy is a hard man to predict which makes the french not unreasonably anxious his economic views are a hodgepodge of free market liberalism and state intervention he slams the "ridiculously inflexible policy of a hour workweek" without committing himself to revoking the law with chilling ignorance of how capitalism works he speaks enthusiastically about twisting the arms of french retailers to lower prices "what right did i have " mr sarkozy asks speaking of his time as finance minister "to let certain big industrial or distribution groups continue to get excessively rich on the backs of the french " he wants "national and european industrial champions " again as finance minister he poured billions of taxpayer funds into the train maker alstom "a french industrial jewel" then on the verge of bankruptcy yet no other mainstream politician is as frank about his countrys ills "france has been discouraging initiative and punishing success for years " he writes "france is like the anglo saxon countries when it comes to inequality and poverty but without their social mobility and full employment and like the scandinavian countries when it comes to public spending and taxes but with greater unemployment and deficits we have all the disadvantages of the two systems without the advantages of either " it takes chutzpah to say so in france the big idea in mr sarkozys book is "rupture " a break with "the old ways of doing things " he apparently wants to overhaul charles de gaulles fifth republic by strengthening parliament and imposing presidential term limits he appears to realize that to "restore frances full global role " the country must revise its politics and not least its stifling economic policies "i think france is impatient " he writes "exasperated by delays and eager for profound change " early in the campaign "change" was indeed his big theme but he has shifted gears of late to woo the french nationalist right he now talks tough on crime and on immigration promising a ministry for "national identity " and he downplays reform if mr sarkozy wins enough votes on sunday to end up in the may run off election as polls predict he will it is likely that he will himself change again moving to the middle to reassure frenchmen who now fear him as some sort of reactionary in a way such policy positioning matters less than mr sarkozys personality his greatest asset and greatest liability mr sarkozys defenders say that he would transform france in the way margaret thatcher transformed britain but would he he is certainly not the conviction politician that she was and yet there are those bold words the big question in the end is whether mr sarkozys brand of hard edged nonideological pragmatism will be up to the hard task at hand mr kaminski is editorial page editor based in paris of the wall street journal europe
