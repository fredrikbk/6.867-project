more professors are lured out of ivory tower to street demand for new funds offers a chance to test theories make money investors soaring appetite for alternative investments and exchange traded funds is giving college professors a chance to break out of their ivory tower and test their academic theories in your portfolio princeton universitys burton malkiel guru of the "efficient market" theory which holds that all stocks have an equal chance for gain has developed strategies for investors interested in china and is also designing an index to track chinas development the work of yale universitys robert shiller author of the s best seller "irrational exuberance " was the basis last year for innovative futures contracts on housing prices at the chicago mercantile exchange and new oil trading tools known as "macros " listed on the american stock exchange "a lot of academics have left universities for hedge funds the last few years " says jeremy siegel a finance professor at university of pennsylvania who also serves as a director at wisdomtree investments a company that issues etfs mutual fund like investments that trade on an exchange mr siegel helps design etfs for wisdomtree using his research into the benefits of dividend paying companies he didnt leave campus life behind entirely however "i dont enjoy managing other peoples money " he says "i like to teach " it isnt the first time profs have pursued part time business careers over the years academic theories like the black scholes model used in determining options prices have heavily influenced wall street firms including perhaps most notoriously the doomed hedge fund long term capital management in the s ltcm used black scholes to value its portfolio but later got crushed under a massive debt load there is also a long history of scholars in engineering and other technical fields parlaying their inventions into big paydays particularly in silicon valley stanford university president john l hennessy has reaped millions in recent years from outside activities including sitting on google inc s board the latest off campus forays by professors have already spawned at least one nasty battle prof siegel and wisdomtree have been challenged by robert arnott chairman of research affiliates llc and an index designer who claims wisdomtrees funds are based on his ideas not mr siegels mr arnotts work is being licensed by wisdomtree rival powershares capital management llc "we have a patent pending we have a trademark " mr arnott says "its a shame when people cant come up with their own ideas " prof siegel says he wasnt even aware of mr arnotts research in when he started working with wisdomtree wisdomtrees president bruce lavine says he is "baffled" at arnotts allegations "its like al gore saying he invented the internet " for the people involved in designing new investment products the trade offs are obvious academics lend respectability to wall streets offerings while professors can not only test their theories in the real world they get to make money doing it universities generally have rules limiting professorial moonlighting but theyre willing to tolerate a certain amount of it especially if the work casts the institutions in a good light and curries favor with potential benefactors on wall street for the professors the payday can be tidy precise compensation details are hard to come by but prof siegel for instance says he gets a six figure package annually from wisdomtree including stock options speaking fees and a monthly stipend in the past year wisdomtree has grown to &# billion in assets invested in its etfs including recent offerings focusing on foreign stocks companies with steady earnings growth and other areas of the market like many of these new products wisdomtrees funds have only short track records so far making it tough to assess whether theyll live up to expectations over the longer term of the six etfs investing in u s stocks that the firm launched among its first wave of offerings last june three have beaten what the company considers their benchmark u s market indexes prof siegel who recommends dividend focused investing over a period of years or even decades says he isnt worried by that mixed performance in less than months of trading "the strategy gets better returns in bear markets " when dividend payments help make up for a lack of rising share prices he says with the s&amp p and dow up more than each since wisdomtrees first offerings launched last june the funds have yet to face such a scenario leo melamed former chairman of the chicago merc says markets have often tapped academia for big picture strategy ideas or as a sounding board for ideas generated in house for example back in the s when mr melamed was considering trading not just traditional agricultural products but also foreign currencies an unusual concept at the time he consulted the late university of chicago economist milton friedman who endorsed the idea for wall street firms working with a prominent academic can be a major selling point to investors says john bearce of managed portfolio advisers a division of ixis asset management since last year mr bearces firm has attracted about &# million into individual investment accounts using a china focused strategy designed by princetons prof malkiel author of the well known tome about the efficient market theory "a random walk down wall street " prof malkiel sometimes speaks at investor conferences "to get his blessing helps us tremendously " says mr bearce "when we go into client meetings hes an integral part of our story " ixis uses a portfolio of etfs created by other companies to gain both direct and indirect exposure to china an approach that prof malkiel devised while traveling in china last year another potential offering is a retirement investment based on the writings of boston universitys prof zvi bodie he advocates increased use of inflation protected treasury bonds in k plans and other accounts that rely on employee contributions prof bodie says hes considering turning his work into an actual investment tool although there are some stumbling blocks for instance hes wary of the exclusive licensing or consulting agreements that hed likely have to sign with a wall street firm "im much more interested in getting the ideas out there in the public " prof bodie says diya gullapalli contributed to this article
