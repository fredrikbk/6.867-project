pursuits books drinking and driven the author of lucky jim and jakes thing was all too familiar with the hungers and misgivings immortalized in his dark comedies the life of kingsley amis by zachary leader pantheon pages &# the writings of kingsley amis the british poet novelist science fiction writer humorist journalist amateur linguist professional drinks columnist and relentless sender of letters to the editor show how hard it is to grasp the full point of a joke or argument or fictional scene without knowing the full context it has always been obvious that certain large themes in amiss work among them infidelity drink and aging were attempts at working out matters important in his life and yet for most readers and even for scholars the life beneath the writing was slightly out of reach i ought to know as a graduate student in writing a dissertation on amis i tried to plumb the personal history underlying the opus as tactfully as i could amis and i exchanged several letters and i saw him in london more than once after vetting me he could hardly have been more cordial or more willing to show me parts of his world and yet somehow he deflected my efforts to learn the personal details that mattered to his work i can hardly complain about a man protecting his privacy even an author but his guardedness was a barrier to critical understanding early efforts to write about him and not just my own suffered as a result it was a barrier certain to fall as amis clearly knew he had spread evidence of his literary wellsprings everywhere in letters autobiographical writings and interviews and in his conversations with friends wives lovers children and colleagues it has become ever more clear in recent years that the whole corpus of amiss fiction was in the words of scholar richard bradford "one of most entertaining and thought provoking autobiographies ever produced " on the evidence summarized in zachary leaders "the life of kingsley amis " the forces that shaped amis almost always shaped his fiction and his poetry the notable exception was "lucky jim " amiss debut a romantic comedy that had next to nothing to do with amiss own life though its irreverence toward postwar british society mirrored its authors heavily revised in response to the poet philip larkins suggestions larkin was a lifelong friend of amiss dating from their days at university the novel was more generic and less amisian than anything else that amis did at least in plot and character mr leader does a fine job of breaking out larkins contribution to the creative process the language alone was pure amis of one of jims dreary hangovers "his mouth had been used as a latrine by some small creature of the night and then as its mausoleum " most of the time though amis wrote about what he lived and his life was built around the pursuit of drink sex companionship and literary expression the rage for alcohol in particular was prodigious over time his drinking rituals controlled his schedule and choice of friends and fueled his increasingly erratic behavior he compensated by making drink a subject of his writing most memorably in "the green man" a ghost tale in which the narrators dipsomania is a plot device as well as the focus of what were obviously amiss guilty ruminations about the effect of his own hedonism on his childrens lives throughout his first marriage to hilary bardwell from to amis looked for sex everywhere he could seemingly making passes at almost every woman who crossed his path his pained awareness of the irresolvable doubleness that this behavior created in his heart and his marriage inspired a number of his early novels such as "that uncertain feeling" and "take a girl like you " his philandering also provoked similar behavior by his wife disrupted his childrens upbringings and ultimately brought the marriage down in his second union with novelist elizabeth jane howard amis was apparently faithful but he ironically succumbed to impotence which along with his alcoholism seems to have laid that marriage low his resulting rage informed more than one savage novel including "jakes thing" and "stanley and the women" if priapus deserted him bacchus did not increasingly amis built his life around mostly male drinking companions at his local pub at the garrick club at bertorellis restaurant where he met weekly for extended lunches with a group of right wing wits the desire to dominate these gatherings led him to exaggerate a blimpish and rude persona until it was doubtful whether he knew himself what was his own nature and what was an act the conversation in these circles helped to inform the semi reactionary political writings for which he became well known in later years his fairly early anticommunism was guided by robert conquest the poet and russian scholar who remained a confidant until amiss death in and then there was the writing compulsion itself over his career he penned novels plus poetry criticism polemic radio dramas and belles lettres most amis readers would say they preferred his achingly funny earlier works to his later productions whose style seemed almost jamesian in its complexity but even toward the end he was able to write accessibly enough to win the booker prize for "the old devils" and to produce a late masterpiece "you cant do both" neither drink nor infirmity nor compulsions slowed his literary production right up to his deathbed mr leader edited amiss "letters" a huge volume throughout which amis unburdens himself of all sorts of prejudices often about the folly of modern literature including that of his son martin complaints anecdotes and comic commentary mr leaders grounding in that work enables him to provide more detail on the interplay of the life and the books than did worthy biographies by richard bradford and eric jacobs respectful of amis and of all who became part of the story through their association with him mr leader fulfills his mission honestly telling the history that explains the books mr gohn now writes about and practices law in baltimore
