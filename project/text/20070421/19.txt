economist breaks new ground as first female winner of top prize the economics profession long dominated by men for the first time has given one of the disciplines major prizes to a woman the american economic association announced friday that susan athey a year old professor at harvard university with professional interests ranging from deepest economic theory to canadian timber auctions had won the prestigious john bates clark medal awarded every two years to the nations most promising economist under the age of no woman had won the medal in its year history some past recipients have been chosen to spotlight a particular avenue of economic research but that wasnt the case this time colleagues saw the medal as recognition of the breadth depth and impact of prof atheys wide ranging body of work they also saw it as an important signal of encouragement to other women both already in the field and considering economics as a career "im amazed and thrilled " said prof athey "its hard to believe my name will be added to such a distinguished list " recipients of the john bates clark medal dont get a large financial award but it has often been a harbinger of greater things to come of the previous winners have gone on to win the nobel prize in economics others have played major roles in government both martin feldstein and joseph stiglitz have headed the presidents council of economic advisors and former harvard president lawrence summers did a stint as treasury secretary steve levitt co author of the bestselling book "freakonomics " was also a clark medalist the choice of prof athey is "a very good thing" for economics said john roberts a professor at stanford business school in california who advised on her doctoral dissertation "the fraction of the economics profession thats female is discouragingly low and susan has worked hard to do something about that " as of about of all full professors in ph d granting economics programs were female according to the committee on the status of women in the economics profession prof athey has been a rising star in economics since her doctoral dissertation on a new way to model uncertainty created a stir on the academic job market in leading the nations top economics departments to court her she ultimately chose the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge mass but later moved to stanford and then last year returned to cambridge to join harvard she is one of a number of female economists who have risen to prominence in recent years they include mits esther duflo who focuses on field experiments and development economics amy finkelstein also of mit who does health economics and university of chicago financial economist monica piazzesi "you can point to multiple fields of economics where one of the very top stars is a woman " prof athey said "thats been a really exciting change in the last five to years " prof athey said she first took an interest in economics in the early s when she was a junior at duke university making money on the side selling personal computers to the government at procurement auctions robert marshall a microeconomics specialist for whom she worked as a research assistant suggested she help him look into a flaw she saw in the auctions the low cost of disputing the results appeared to be encouraging losers to protest an inordinate number of outcomes which often enabled them to get payments from the winners through legal settlements the economists research concluded that winners could be using the settlements to pay off losers for cooperating on bids a point professor marshall now at pennsylvania state university argued in congressional testimony ultimately the government scrapped the mechanism prof atheys experience with prof marshall showed her "the power of economic theory to change the world " she said "by the time i finished working with him i was completely sold " prof athey went on to do widely respected work in the area of auctions a subfield of microeconomics that took center stage in the mid s as former soviet republics sold off state property and the u s government launched auctions for radio spectrum she has extensively studied the ways in which bidders can collude to manipulate the results and used that knowledge to help governments figure out how best to auction the rights to public resources one piece of advice she offered use sealed bids which her research has demonstrated will encourage more competitive behavior among bidders earlier this decade she helped the canadian government design timber auctions that as of had allowed it to reap some &# billion of annual revenue from timber sales the auctions also helped the canadians defuse a big trade dispute with the u s which had accused ottawa of effectively subsidizing timber exports among her fellow economists though prof athey is possibly more appreciated for her work to deepen and make more elegant the theories and methods economists use to model and measure the real world while doing her ph d dissertation at stanford for example she developed a technique that allows economists to better understand how uncertainty about say oil prices or exchange rates affects the behavior of investors businesses and the entire economy the breakthrough coming as it did from a year old student took many in the profession by surprise "i remember being just totally stunned " said paul milgrom a professor at stanford who together with prof roberts advised ms athey on the project "this was a problem that had occurred to me that i thought was just too hard " prof athey who has two young children and is married to fellow harvard economist guido imbens has constantly found opportunities to encourage and recognize female participation in economics when for example she was put in charge of organizing a winter meeting of the econometric society she assembled a committee of female economists to choose the papers that would be presented "it was a terrific committee with leading scholars in every area " she said "the subtext is that this is possible "
