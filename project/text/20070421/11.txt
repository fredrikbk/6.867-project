cross country cheesy judges milwaukee last year candidates for state supreme court seats spent a combined &# million nationwide earlier this month a whopping &# million was spent to win a single vacant seat on wisconsins state supreme court it seems voters are growing discontented with their judges and increasingly willing to engage in partisan battles over who should sit on the bench and not without cause the outlays in the badger state came after a remarkable string of state supreme court decisions showing that the court didnt recognize many limits to its own power and these decisions came as an extension of a long standing battle between conservatives and liberals in the state the contest for the vacant seat was between annette ziegler a county judge favored by business groups and linda clifford an immigration lawyer with close ties to democratic gov jim doyle ms ziegler won of the vote on april after campaigning against a series of rulings that had rattled the states business and medical communities with their creative interpretation of the law she claimed her opponent would make the court even more activist since they were competing for the seat of a retiring conservative justice ms clifford herself acknowledged "i am willing to let the state constitution breathe and reflect what society needs in any given context " david ziemer news editor of the wisconsin law journal said before the election that a clifford victory would bring "a more creative more unpredictable flexible court" that would be "more prone to going out of the box " indeed the court began jumping out of its box into uncharted waters in immediately after justice diane sykes stepped down to join a federal appeals court in chicago she was replaced by louis butler a former milwaukee judge who had lost to ms sykes by a two to one margin in mr butler soon became the fulcrum for a new majority that overturned the courts own precedents and long standing deference to the legislatures policy choices in he authored the infamous thomas decision the court ruled that a plaintiff who claimed he had eaten paint chips containing lead pigment could sue paint manufacturers and lead pigment suppliers if he could prove they had done business in wisconsin even if the pigments were not in the paint chips he claimed to have eaten the ruling adopted a "risk contribution" theory of liability that allows a person who cannot determine which company caused his injuries to sue a variety of companies one of the thomas dissenters argued that "the defendants can be held liable for a product they may or may not have produced which may or may not have caused the plaintiffs injuries based on conduct that may have occurred over years ago when some of the defendants were not even part of the relevant market " another dissenter wrote that the case made it "nearly impossible for paint companies to defend themselves or frankly for plaintiffs to lose " within months of the decision a chicago plaintiffs firm sued wisconsin companies alleging that their client died from asbestos exposure but not necessarily from asbestos made by any of the named defendants thomas wasnt the only opinion in which the court left the rule of law stranded it struck down as unconstitutional the states cap on non economic damages in medical malpractice cases by arguing in a mind numbing paragraph section that the caps bore "no rational relationship to a legitimate government interest " the courts conclusion was bizarre according to many observers the legislature had specifically passed the caps to make malpractice insurance "available and affordable" and the caps had worked in the american medical association judged wisconsin to be one of only six states not in a medical malpractice crisis business groups feared that the guilty until proven innocent liability law being trailblazed by wisconsin would spread to other states and expanded far beyond asbestos perhaps including such famous badger state products as butter beer and motorcycles while the court continued its creative expansion of judicial power in its next term judge sykes now on a federal appeals court was not amused last year she gave a lecture at marquette university casting a critical eye on this unfolding record which she said reflected "a dramatic shift in the courts jurisprudence departing from some familiar and long accepted principles that normally operate as constraints on the courts use of its power " given the clear lines on judicial activism that were drawn in the recent election here it appears a majority of wisconsin voters share at least some of judge sykes concerns ms zieglers victory sets up what will no doubt be an even more expensive and contentious supreme court race next april when judge butler an appointee must stand for election to a full year term several business groups active in the ziegler victory will likely be back to take on judge butler including wisconsin manufacturers &amp commerce which spent over &# million on tv ads this year and widely distributed "a court unbound " a critique of its decisions by a prominent wisconsin lawyer which was published by the federalist society one conservative who may step into the race should he want to take on the liberal groups that pounded ms ziegler is milwaukee county judge michael brennan hes already deplored the court for its "indicators of judicial activism " thirty eight states elect appellate level judges business interests trial lawyers and unions are spending gobs of money to foster what each of them claim will be a "fair hearing climate" for their interpretation of state constitutions and an american bar association poll conducted a few years ago found that a majority of americans are losing respect for those who sit on the bench of respondents said judges believe they can do whatever they want so hotly contested races similar to what wisconsin witnessed this year will likely now become commonplace when john roberts was confirmed as chief justice of the u s supreme court two years ago he made clear his view that "judges are like umpires umpires dont make the rules they apply them " most americans agree with that notion but in practice an increasing number of courts are making suspect calls that signal they really prefer to rewrite the rules of the game whats happening in wisconsin may also happen in other states as it does more and more voters will want to ensure that the judicial umpires themselves are properly selected and supervised mr fund is a columnist for opinionjournal com
