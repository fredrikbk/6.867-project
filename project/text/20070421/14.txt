come fly with me under desert skies in very high style software mogul mcafee builds aerotrek empire howard hughess trailer rodeo n m flying a tiny aircraft over this remote desert john mcafee spotted his target a foot long bus outfitted with leather couches televisions and a refrigerator "that would be our breakfast " he said landing on the empty two lane road within minutes mr mcafee and fellow aviators were feasting on pastries and steaming hot coffee sporting pierced ears spiked hair with bleached blond tips and a goatee the year old mr mcafee looks more like an aging surfer than a software multi millionaire one whose last name is synonymous with protecting computers against software viruses thirteen years after selling his stake in what is now known as mcafee inc for more than &# million the entrepreneur is ardently pursuing his newest passion skimming the desert floor in an open cockpit plane resembling a motorcycle with wings over the past four years mr mcafee has poured more than &# million into building a network of eight airports in remote areas of new mexico and arizona including a home base in rodeo that features a five bedroom villa a trailer once owned by billionaire howard hughes and numerous restored antique automobiles mr mcafee co founded and leads the "sky gypsies" a roving band of fellow aficionados they often spend weeks in the desert waking before sunrise to wing their way through scenery thats unreachable by almost any other means "my personality is such i cant do something halfway " mr mcafee says on a typical flight mr mcafee might land his craft beside the remains of a pioneer wagon trail or soar between the sheer walls of a winding canyon in the mountains where geronimo and his band of apaches made their last stand in one of his favorite places to relax is in the shade of a cliff beneath an ancient pictograph of warriors paddling a canoe down a river that disappeared from the valley more than years ago this type of flying which the sky gypsies call "aerotrekking " is best suited for remote areas where pilots can cruise for miles at no more than or feet above the terrain before mr mcafee came along aerotrekkers "were a fringe element inside a fringe sport " says john kemmeries a fellow gypsy who introduced mr mcafee to the sport in late "now its possible for us to fly to some of the most beautiful places on the planet without having to worry about disappearing into the wilderness " mr mcafee who says he isnt sure of his exact net worth is usually attired in jeans and hiking boots he eschews trappings like private jets but admits a weakness for building palatial homes one of them is square foot retreat he designed in woodland park colo with an unobstructed view of pikes peak recently mr mcafee decided to auction off the acre estate which he says is worth &# million the sale is on may "money does a really strange thing it gives you this sense of omnipotence " he says "but eventually you realize youre just one person you look around at all this stuff youve acquired and you wonder how youre ever going to use it " since selling his stake in a startup venture known as tribal voice for &# million in mr mcafee has devoted himself to what he calls "the opposite of the business world " a longtime believer in the benefits of yoga he became so immersed in the discipline that he wrote four books on the subject and began leading seminars around the world but before long the pressure of teaching daily classes "began to feel too much like work " so mr mcafee began looking for new ways to escape in august he was thumbing through a magazine on a flight to katmandu nepal with his girlfriend jennifer irwin when he happened onto an article about a trike called such because of its resemblance to a childs tricycle these feather light single engine machines can dive at miles an hour float for hours and fly just feet off the ground "i looked at jen and said weve gotta do this " he recalls the kite wing airplanes used by the sky gypsies trace their roots back to hang gliders popularized in the s like other forms of small aircraft they got a big boost in when the federal aviation administration created a sport pilot license that reduces the amount of training required for purely recreational flying since then dozens of new types of light sport aircraft have hit the skies within weeks of his nepal trip mr mcafee was taking lessons from mr kemmeries who marketed the little planes from an airport outside tucson ariz it took mr mcafee about three months to become bored with a typical flight which usually consisted of flying to a nearby airport for coffee or a hamburger and then returning after a few hours the problem was that the most interesting places are so far away from existing airports that the trikes would run out of fuel long before they could return home so mr mcafee decided to build fuel and sleeping stops employing what he calls his "usual amount of overkill " he and ms irwin boarded a yellow hummer specially outfitted with extra fuel tanks and spent weeks between march and september driving through remote sections of the desert most of it miles from paved roads mapping out routes that would provide a combination of scenery and safe places to land by the time they were done the pair had sketched out routes that stretched from western new mexico to northern arizona for the main airport and home base they picked a place just outside rodeo n m about miles southeast of tucson ariz between the chiricahua and peloncillos mountains rodeo is located on a plain that stretches for miles and is so sparsely populated at night that its supposedly the darkest valley in the lower states mr mcafee purchased hundreds of acres of land on which he built a sprawling villa a guest house and three cavernous hangars he recently brought in an eclectic collection of gleaming aluminum travel trailers including the one that belonged to howard hughes for members and guests to sleep in to navigate the compounds dirt roads and "spice things up a little" mr mcafee acquired a collection of vintage automobiles ranging from a restored model a to a auburn boattail speedster worth an estimated &# more than members strong sky gypsies pay a membership fee to the group ranging from &# all the way up to &# a year the fees are used to defray the cost of maintenance such as keeping dirt runways graded although membership is technically by invitation only there are other ways to wrangle a ride just ask tori wade a former clerk in a hour record store in new yorks greenwich village when she was visiting a friend in tucson last year ms wade stumbled across the sky gypsies on the web she and her friend drove to the sky gypsy ranch and asked for a ride mr mcafee took her up himself and ms wade was so impressed she decided to abandon her new york life she hung around the ranch earned her pilots license and is now working as an instructor from may through october when winds and temperatures are most favorable as many as pilots and their aircraft descend on rodeo and the other airports and stay for weeks at a time at night mr mcafee and his compadres some of whom are retired engineers physicians and fellow multi millionaires often gather before the large television set on his villas patio to watch a selection of the dvds in his personal library one night a group of gypsies including mr mcafee decided they wanted tattoos they drove miles to a seedy parlor and festooned themselves with tattoos of the ornate celtic wing the sky gypsies adopted as their logo the groups quirky web site describes mr mcafee and his year old girlfriend as "john and jen " the "two derelicts" who "didnt lose their last names but have never divulged them " "we dont have a clue about them " it adds construction is almost complete on a sky gypsies coffee shop and a seat movie theater that will specialize in foreign flicks and pre hollywood movies when the winds are favorable the gypsies take off on any given day in the summer a colorful flying circus of as many as or aircraft might strike out from the base toward another of their airports sometimes as far as miles away if the winds permit they head for a quick run through the canyons sometimes following the rivers that run through them after completing his roadside breakfast one recent morning mr mcafee set out across the countryside dropping to just a few feet above the surface of a gently climbing hillside a few yards ahead a small herd of deer bounded ahead of the planes shadow before taking cover in a ravine "get ready youre about to see what aerotrekking is all about " mr mcafee said seconds later the plane soared over the edge of a foot cliff and into the valley where the sky gypsy airport is located as mr mcafee piloted his craft back home the excited whoops of other flyers could be heard over the in flight radio as they plunged over the cliff "i never get tired of doing that " said one
