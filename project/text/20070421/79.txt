unicredit societe generale talk creation of worlds fourth biggest bank faces many hurdles milan italys unicredit spa said it is in contact with frances societe generale sa to explore a possible tie up potentially accelerating consolidation in europes fragmented banking sector and testing national governments willingness to allow cross border mergers amid a rising tide of protectionism together unicredit and societe generale would create a pan european banking titan with about billion euros &# billion of market capitalization with more than million clients and almost branches with large operations in italy germany france and eastern europe it would also finally create the type of pan european banking presence that policy makers in brussels have envisioned for ages however attempts to clinch cross border deals such as this one have in the past hit political snags as governments were loath to see their national champions become part of bigger more global entities if talks progress it would serve as a test of whether european politicians can resist the temptation to meddle in major deals governments recently have been eager to throw their weight around when it comes to sectors such as telecommunications energy and banking two years ago bank of italy then governor antonio fazio fought what was ultimately a losing battle to prevent two italian banks from being bought by european competitors for such reasons negotiations must be handled cautiously making sure not to upset politicians in either rome or paris a person familiar with the situation said talks are in a "very preliminary stage" and could be called off at any moment the two banks held informal merger talks in but the milan based lender instead began an ultimately successful billion euro acquisition of germanys hvb group ag unicredit chief executive alessandro profumo and top executives at societe generale have maintained informal contact since then according to a person familiar with the matter on friday afternoon after speculation of a deal drove its stock price up to euros the paris based bank issued a statement denying that it was in negotiations unicredit subsequently issued a statement saying that while no formal negotiations were taking place the two banks were holding preliminary contacts one person familiar with the situation said "unicredit and societe generale are exploring a merger of equals structure" and added "such a deal must be friendly the two banks have to agree on every single detail in order to reach an agreement " one key issue they must resolve is where a combined bank might be based unicredit has a market capitalization of about billion euros a bit larger than the billion euro market value of societe generale yesterday and therefore a tie up would technically be an acquisition by unicredit however moving the headquarters of one of frances largest banks to milan where unicredit is based could create friction with french politicians news of unicredits renewed interest in societe generale comes at a delicate moment for french politics just two days ahead of the first round of voting to elect frances next president all three of the major candidates have professed some brand of economic nationalism in which they believe that strategically important french companies should be protected from foreign takeovers conservative candidate nicolas sarkozy currently the races front runner was instrumental in putting together a deal that blocked italian utility enel spa from making an offer for french water and power company suez sa such moves run counter to european union regulations but brussels has been ineffective in reining in national governments that seek to protect their own industries nonetheless the continents large banks telecom and energy firms have been responding to investors who demand that they strike cross border deals and partnerships in order to grow and find synergies that make them more competitive that is particularly the case in banking where several recent deals have catapulted some european banks into the top tier of the global rankings and put them in a better position to challenge some of the american titans such as citigroup inc and bank of america corp unicredits acquisition of germanys hvb nearly two years ago for example made it the worlds th largest bank by market capitalization the recent merger of italys intesa sanpaolo spa with banca intesa spa made that bank the worlds th largest by market cap the market value of a combined unicredit and societe generale would place it ahead of j p morgan chase &amp co currently the worlds fourth largest but still considerably smaller than citigroup bank of america and hsbc holdings plc the top three respectively the merger if it can be worked out would give societe generale a broad new expanse for its investment bank and capital markets unit which specializes in derivative products unicredits acquisition of hvb forged a strong banking presence in the faster growing economies of eastern europe as that region continues to mature societe generale could gain access to new corporate and consumer clients that would give the combined bank a jump on french rival bnp paribas sa which also has worked toward expanding in eastern europe and in countries such as turkey shareholders of unicredit are likely to have concerns though about mr profumos aggressive move given that he is still working through the acquisition of hvb unicredits interest while preliminary could also spark a fight with bnp paribas which was long seen as the right merger partner for societe generale banking shares have run up in recent weeks amid a continuing bidding war for dutch bank abn amro holding nv which may trigger europe wide sector consolidation carrick mollenkamp in london and anne sylvaine chassany in new york contributed to this article
