pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations cold standard i saw an old friend on the acela on the way to washington and he told me of the glum grim faces at the station hed left all the commuters with newspapers in their hands and under their arms this was the day after virginia tech we talked about what was different this time in this tragedy i told him i felt people were stricken because they werent stricken when columbine happened it was weird and terrible and now there have been some incidents since and now its not weird anymore and that is whats so terrible its the difference between "that doesnt happen " and "that happens " actually i thought of thoreau he said he didnt have to read newspapers because if youre familiar with a principle you dont have to be familiar with its numerous applications if you know lightning hits trees you dont have to know every time a tree is struck by lightning in terms of school shootings we are now familiar with the principle dennis miller the other night said something compassionate and sensible on tv invited to criticize some famous persons stupid response to a past tragedy he said he sort of applied a hour grace period after a tragedy and didnt hold anyone to the things theyd said people get rattled and say things that are extreme but more than hours have passed so some impressions there seems to me a sort of broad national diminution of common sense in our country that we dont notice in the day to day but that become obvious after a story like this common sense says a person like cho seung hui who was obviously dangerous and unstable should have been separated from the college population common sense says someone should have stepped in like an adult like a person in authority and taken him away it is only common sense that if a person like cho leaves a self aggrandizing self celebrating self pitying video diary of himself to be played by the mass media the mass media should not play it and not publicize it not make it famous common sense says that wont help and all those big cops scores of them hundreds with the latest heaviest most sophisticated gear all the weapons and helmets and safety vests and belts it looked like the brute force of the state coming up against uncontrollable human will but it also looked muscle bound and the schools themselves more and more look muscle bound weighed down with laws and legal assumptions and strange prohibitions the school officials i saw especially the head of the campus psychological services seemed to me endearing losers but endearing is too strong i mean "not obviously and vividly offensive " the school officials who gave all the highly competent almost smooth and practiced news conferences seemed to me like white bearded people who were educated in softness cho was "troubled" he clearly had "issues" it would have been good if someone had "reached out" its too bad america doesnt have better "support services " they dont use direct clear words because if theyre blunt theyre implicated the literally white bearded academic who was head of the campus counseling center was on paula zahn wednesday night suggesting the utter incompetence of officials to stop a man who had stalked two women set a fire in his room written morbid and violent plays and poems been expelled from one class and been declared by a judge to be "mentally ill" was due to the lack of a government "safety net " in a news conference he decried inadequate "funding for mental health services in the united states " way to take responsibility way to show the kids how to dodge the anxiety of our politicians that there may be an issue that goes unexploited was almost almost comic they mean to seem sensitive and yet wind up only stroking their supporters i believe rep jim moran was first out of the gate with the charge that what cho did was president bushs fault i believe sen barack obama was second equating the literal killing of humans with verbal coarseness wednesday there was sen barbara boxer equating the violence of the shootings with the "global warming challenge" and "todays supreme court decision" upholding a ban on partial birth abortion one watches all of this and wonders where are the grown ups i wondered about the emptiness of the phrases used by the media and by political figures and how pro forma and lifeless and cold they are the formalized language of loss hasnt kept up with the number of tragedies "a nation mourns " "our prayers are with you " the latter is both self complimenting and of dubious believability did you really pray or is it just a phrase and this as opposed to the honest things normal people say "oh no " "i am so sorry " "im sad " "its horrible " with all the therapy in our great therapized nation with all our devotion to emotions and feelings one senses we are becoming a colder culture and a colder country we purport to be compassionate we must respect mr chos privacy rights and personal autonomy but of course it is cold not to have protected others from him it is cold not to have protected him from himself the last testament cho sent to nbc seemed more clear evidence of mental illness posing with his pistols big tough gangsta gonna take you out what is it evidence of when nbc news a great pillar of the mainstream media runs the videos and pictures on the nightly news brian williams introduced the cho collection as "what can only be described as a multi media manifesto " but it can be described in other ways "the self serving meanderings of a crazy self indulgent narcissist" is one but if you called it that you couldnt lead with it you couldnt rationalize the decision such pictures are inspiring to the unstable the minute you saw them you probably thought what i did well be seeing more of that the most common sensical thing i heard said came thursday morning in a hospital interview with a student whod been shot and was recovering garrett evans said of the man whod shot him "an evil spirit was going through that boy i could feel it " it was one of the few things i heard the past few days that sounded completely true whatever else cho was he was also a walking infestation of evil too bad nobody stopped him too bad nobody moved
