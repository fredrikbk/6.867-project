pursuits sports golf journal how to become a beginner lessons can help a struggling veteran too just forget all you think you know last weeks column on taking up golf at midlife attracted a goodly amount of email several readers wrote of their experiences learning the game in ways similar to the intense six month program outlined in the column one retired long island psychiatrist who plays in florida in the winter wrote that the breakthrough for her was finally learning to relax her "death grip" on the club and that she would have benefited from even more on course lessons focused on club selection and strategy most of the emails however concerned how to locate a good teacher more about that later and the frustrations of established golfers who despite years of effort still cant come close to breaking a few expressed outright skepticism that beginners could learn to do so in the course of just one season "maybe you are describing someone who does not follow the rules and takes a mulligan on every other hole " suggested one on their behalf i returned for advice to some of the instructors i spoke with last week as well as a couple of new ones what the skeptics fail to recognize i was informed is the advantage beginners have over seasoned players whose bad habits are entrenched "golf is different than a lot of things in that simply practicing a lot isnt necessarily going to make you better " says hank gardner of whisper rock golf club in scottsdale ariz "even working with a teacher changing one thing results in a compensation somewhere else which also must be addressed and sometimes isnt golf works in twos like that and if a student doesnt ask questions and truly understand what the changes are trying to accomplish long term progress simply isnt going to happen " in short they can get stuck in an endless loop of changes for the majority of golfers mired north of the easiest and quickest route to better scores is forgetting entirely about the full swing and concentrating on the short game janet davis ortega the head professional at pajaro valley golf club in royal oaks calif said she learned that lesson early in life from her father who transformed himself from a despairing longtime handicapper into a handicapper this way in just a few seasons "its amazing to me how resistant experienced players are to this strategy " she said "they just seem to want to hit the ball farther " but to do that consistently usually requires a full bore revamping of the swing to which most players are even more resistant "its very hard for a human being to say i stink so im going to forget everything i know and start over " ms davis ortega says "but thats what it takes you have to be willing to take things down to the raw basics and work back up from there " the instructors i spoke with say that anyone hoping to fundamentally change his swing must expect to get worse perhaps a lot worse before getting better a typical scenario according to jonathan gibbs of the banbury golf club in eagle idaho would be for such a shooters scores to rocket briefly into the range before returning to the original level or better "but thats our biggest problem point because often the player gets so excited about the new ball flight that he quits working on his new technique and goes back to what he was doing before " he says a stalled golfer of this type should be able to solidify substantial swing changes within two to three months of focused effort if he sticks to the program but the approaches suggested differed in their particulars mr gibbss emphasis for example would be to make the student feel the golf swing as an athletic move perhaps working initially without a club "i want them to understand that the purpose of the golf swing is to get to the finish position and to think of the ball as something that just gets in the way " he says ms ortegas approach is to start with tiny swings feet together so that the student gets the feel of making proper contact mr gardner says he would start by getting a confirmed slicer to hook the ball one way or another in the first minutes of the first lesson "i would want to shock him into thinking wow i really can do something completely different than i am used to " he says but as the variety of these approaches shows finding and trusting the right teacher is vital and theyre not all worthy of that trust many club pros who say they teach actually spend most of their time behind the counter some can hardly break themselves others who might be decent technically are poor communicators unfortunately theres no zagat guide to teachers and no way around having to work to find the right person just as you must to identify a good internist or more appropriately perhaps a good psychiatrist local word of mouth is still the most reliable guide as a starting place the web site golfdigest com maintains a state by state listing of top instructors as voted on by their peers links at playgolfamerica com can lead you by zip code to candidates certified by the professional golf association it lists teachers who have signed up to give free minute lessons in may a possible strategy for interviewing several likely instructors at no cost in launching a long term relationship the main things you want to establish are that the instructors style of teaching seems to match your style of learning that he understands your goals and can lay out a plan that makes sense to you that plan especially for beginners should include a very significant short game element video analysis and on course instruction in addition the teacher should work at or have access to a course that allows lessons and a good short game practice facility including bunkers and pitching areas "stay away from anyone who guarantees youll drop strokes in x amount of time " advises mr gibbs "the right response to a question about what to expect is that youll get out of it what you put into it because thats the way it is " email me at golfjournal wsj com
