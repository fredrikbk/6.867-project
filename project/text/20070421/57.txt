pursuits sports basketball who really performs in the clutch as close games proliferate in the nba playoffs scoring in tight spots is key ranking basketballs best pressure players heading into the postseason the denver nuggets dont look like a serious contender they have a record fragile chemistry and a soft defense but they do have a secret weapon steve blake a skinny guard playing for his fourth team in as many seasons as a pro is unusually effective when the game is on the line clutch players this is your moment as the nba playoffs kick off this weekend the ability to come through in the final minutes of a close game has become more important last year playoff games were decided by points or less and a record of those games went to overtime thats up from games decided by points or less a year ago and games in the previous year but it turns out the nbas best clutch players on offense arent always the stars cleveland cavaliers sensation lebron james sees his free throw shooting percentage fall to about when it counts the most meanwhile despite a reputation among some fans as a choker dallass foot forward dirk nowitzki thrives in crunch time when mr nowitzki scores some more points than usual and if either the houston rockets or the san antonio spurs find themselves in close games they may have more of an edge than you think of the playoff bound players who perform best in the clutch these teams have three apiece more than any other team some league watchers think this year could see even more squeakers thats because the teams within the two conferences appear so evenly matched the western conference is packed with powerhouses including the dallas mavericks and phoenix suns the eastern conference meanwhile is evenly matched in a different way it has a bigger proportion of less than likely contenders to go all the way "almost every series has the possibility of being very competitive " says rod thorn president of the new jersey nets to look at clutch performance the houston rockets begin by analyzing statistics only from games against the top four or five teams in the league then they compare those numbers with the players overall stats to see which team members shine when faced with the toughest competitors daryl morey the assistant general manager of the rockets declines to discuss details of this statistical approach but says most players play to worse against top teams the entire concept of the clutch player whether some athletes consistently perform better in the most pressure filled situations continues to be one of the most debated subjects among sports fans in baseball for example some statisticians have long argued that theres no such thing as a clutch hitter because the list of players who perform best in those situations changes from year to year many basketball statisticians feel the same way at least when it comes to game winning shots but some of the skepticism has been countered by further numbers crunching in basketball many executives and coaches say they believe certain players possess an innate clutch skill our look at clutch players focused on six key offensive categories for players on the playoff teams five from each team the analysis started by looking at their statistics in those categories field goal attempts field goal percentage points free throw attempts free throw percentage and assists in crunch time data came from the web site games com which isolates players performance in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter and overtime when neither team leads by more than five points the analysis also factored in season averages for those players in the same categories and compared them to their "clutch" statistics to measure how much each player improves or folds when it counts the most all stats were calculated per minutes the length of an nba game brigham young university statistics professor shane reese used this data to come up with a master ranking mr reese used dimension reduction the statistical technique of cramming all the information from many variables into a smaller set of numbers the leagues most clutch players at least by this measure include some of the usual suspects dwyane wade the miami heat guard and the most valuable player of last years nba finals vince carter the nets guard known more for his acrobatic dunks and kobe bryant the lakers guard who last season scored points in a single game but there are some surprises ben gordon the chicago bulls third year guard has quietly emerged as one of the leagues best clutch performers among the well known players who regress the most when the stakes are highest is tony parker the spurs guard who may be better known for his engagement to eva longoria of the show "desperate housewives " jason kidd the nets star point guard only makes about one quarter of his shots late in close games the figures suggest that at least one defining characteristic of a clutch performer is a willingness to shoot and miss most of the leagues top clutch players overall also take the most shots in those key moments and most of the time they miss their target mr bryant and gilbert arenas the injured washington wizards guard who made a string of game winning shots this season both make fewer than of their shots in the clutch to be fair thats not too shoddy given they frequently shoot from outside the three point line the same goes for ben gordon the chicago bulls third year guard mr gordon who led his high school and college teams to state and national championships perhaps has the perfect mix of confidence and ignorance required in a pressure performer "i never think im going to miss " says mr gordon "the guy whos not scared to miss should be the one to take it " see
