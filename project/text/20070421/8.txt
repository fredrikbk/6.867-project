felon to star government witness ben glisan jr says he faced aggressive prosecutors hostile prison officials and "mikey " in late mr glisan was locked up in houstons federal detention center he was nervous government "snitches" arent well treated by other inmates and the next day mr glisan whod been given the prison nickname "benron " was scheduled to testify against his former colleagues mikey who described himself as a member of the mafia was mr glisans cellmate the heavy metal cell door clanged shut for the night and the interrogation began mr glisan recalls did enron dump him mikey asked essentially mr glisan replied did enron owe mr glisan money it did did enron promise to take care of him when the dust settled no "so they basically threw you under the bus " in that case mikey said testifying was ok mr glisan breathed a silent sigh of relief until then "i thought i was going to have to fight this guy to get to the panic button" and call the guards in september mr glisan became the first in a long line of enron executives to enter prison the energy giants december collapse marked the beginning of an era of corporate criminal cases that continued to play out this week with the conviction of former qwest communications international inc chief executive joseph nacchio on counts of insider trading during mr glisans three years on the inside he worried about his physical safety especially as he became an important government witness to protect himself he applied the same types of skills that helped him climb the corporate ladder he formed relationships with prison gang leaders he negotiated with federal officials over the conditions of his incarceration mr glisan even won over mikey after approving of the decision to testify mikey mr glisan doesnt recall the mans real name offered to find someone who would collect the onetime accountants money from enron mr glisan demurred but made sure to say thanks after that encounter "going on the witness stand was easy " he says the son of a financial planner mr glisan years old was raised in an upper middle class home in the same suburban houston area where he now lives south of downtown in college he gravitated to business he joined enron in armed with an mba from the university of texas and experience working at accounting firms he quickly became part of the inner circle of enron chief financial officer andrew fastow in mr fastow tapped mr glisan then to be corporate treasurer with a staff over annual compensation of &# million and bigger paydays on the horizon some enron executives even his admirers thought mr glisan at times tried too hard to ingratiate himself to his superiors even mimicking one natty dresser if that happened mr glisan says it was inadvertent mr glisan commuted back and forth to his two story brick home in an upscale neighborhood dotted with pines he and his wife barbara didnt get into the kind of lavish lifestyle enjoyed by some other top enron officials in part because mr glisan didnt start making really big money until shortly before enrons collapse yet he routinely put in hour days and often didnt see his daughter and son then age six and four much before their bedtime much of his work was with mr fastow and others setting up the complex financial structures that enron used to illegally hide losses from some of its businesses on some nights when dining with enrons bankers mr glisan recalls personally downing a bottle of wine or more before making the mile drive home despite this soaring career mr glisan became increasingly uncomfortable ahead of many of his colleagues with enrons efforts to hide its weakening financial condition fellow workers remember him as agitated amid the burgeoning negative press coverage and government investigations at one point after a particularly damaging financial revelation he was heard to say "were toast " mrs glisan had long pressed him to quit "you are missing your kids grow up were not spending as much time together as we should youre not paying attention to the important things in life " she told him he says loyalty ambition and greed kept him on board with enrons collapse the government embarked on what would become its biggest ever criminal investigation of a company when mr glisan met with the justice departments special enron task force the encounter did not go well prosecutors thought he was lying about the extent of his involvement with the companys collapse they felt "ben was still drinking his own kool aid " says tom allen one of mr glisans attorneys though mr glisan maintained his innocence even some friends thought he was lying at enron "this mans life had been built on dishonesty" and it took him time to come to grips with that says baker duncan a san antonio investment banker who met mr glisan in through work they were doing at a houston charter school during later court testimony mr glisan admitted as much in may the government indicted mr glisan on counts of conspiracy and fraud it alleged in its indictment that mr glisan illegally enriched himself to the tune of &# million through his connection to a fastow run partnership as part of his arraignment mr glisan spent several hours in a holding cell in downtown houston it was the first time he had spent time behind bars the cell had two long metal benches attached to the walls and one filthy unenclosed toilet prisoners shuffled in and out during the day free on bail mr glisan wrestled with what to do next going to trial could cost millions in legal fees losing at trial could land him in prison for over a decade he received advice from others including three men fathers of friends who also had legal problems one harvin c moore iii spent two years in federal prison in the early s for committing fraud at a savings and loan association he co owned "i told him i knew what he was struggling with and that he needed to go deep into his heart and find the right thing to do " recalls mr moore now a real estate developer mr moore told mr glisan that taking the right course which could mean prison time "wouldnt be easy but it would work out he would still have family and friends there would be life on the other side " in september mr glisan pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit fraud often such a plea is accompanied by an agreement in which the defendant helps prosecutors nab others in hopes of leniency prosecutors wouldnt give mr glisan such a deal they still didnt believe he was fully forthcoming say people familiar with the matter mr glisan had an unusual request to be immediately sentenced and imprisoned so he could return to his family as soon as possible he received five years the maximum mr glisan and his attorneys tried persuading the federal bureau of prisons to assign him to a minimum security facility known as a "camp " camps house low risk prisoners usually with relatively short sentences bastrops camp looks like an aging high school campus across the road sits a higher security prison housing many inmates who had committed more serious crimes usually involving drugs bands of gleaming razor wire surround the facility suggesting that the population inside was more dangerous when the government car carrying mr glisan arrived at bastrop it turned into the prison thats when he learned his request had been denied after he entered the compound mr glisan began the physical process of becoming an inmate he took off the black designer suit hed worn for the ride boxed it up and mailed it home his new attire was a light green prison issue jumpsuit prison officials immediately put him into "solitary confinement " also known as "the hole " a prison official "told me that i was the worst criminal at bastrop and they were going to make my life difficult " says mr glisan this person "made it very clear that it was because i was an enron guy " he estimates that his cell measured feet by feet and contained three bunks a sink a toilet and one small window with a view of nothing much traci billingsley a bureau of prisons spokeswoman says the agency doesnt discuss matters involving individual prisoners in general if a new prisoners paperwork hasnt arrived its routine to put him temporarily into the facilitys "special housing unit " she says calling "solitary confinement" an outdated term the spokeswoman says the agency "treats all prisoners fairly equitably and consistently " on his first day in prison mr glisan says he received notes from two hispanic prison gangs which were delivered by a foot pound man covered with tattoos the notes offered words of welcome although mr glisan feared more sinister motives some fellow inmates in the hole slept during the day and stayed up through the night yelling and screaming mr glisan recalls he guesses this was possibly their way of exercising power in a world where they had little after about days he was transferred into the general prison population during his first walk across the prison mr glisan encountered one of the gang leaders whod sent a note the man loomed a couple of inches over the foot inch accountant who braced for the worst "but he was very friendly " says mr glisan who concluded that the note really was a sort of neighborhood "welcome wagon " another former bastrop inmate and friend of mr glisan who received similar notes says the welcomes are an effort on the gangs part to let newcomers know they have real if unofficial power mr glisan says other inmates knew about his enron connection either from watching tv or reading one of the books about the company "benron" quickly developed some survival rules dont disrespect anybody dont get on anyones bad side be friendly especially toward powerful people he shared some of his books with a black gang leader including dan browns vatican thriller "angels &amp demons " soon after settling in mr glisan joined the prisons underground economy while each prisoner officially had access to washers and dryers for their clothes a small group of inmates handled the laundry chores of others for &# a month payable in postage stamps or commissary items such as bags of tortilla chips prisoners dont have access to money mr glisan handed over his wash in part to avoid potential scrapes with other inmates jockeying to use the facilities mr glisan says his days typically looked like this he awoke a little after six a m and had a cup of coffee while other inmates were eating breakfast mr glisan walked around the compound one of the few times of the day when inmates movements were relatively unrestricted set in rolling countryside dotted with pines bastrops grounds were well landscaped aside from the razor wire after a few weeks mr glisan successfully applied for a prison job doing clerical work for about six hours a day it consisted of keeping schedules and work records for inmate tasks ranging from plumbing to gardening to cooking all inmates had to be back in their cells at p m for a head count after that mr glisan exercised in early he faced a crossroads in his relationship with the government task force prosecutors resumed questioning mr glisan but given their past doubts about his forthrightness they werent sure his answers would be of much value mr glisan says that as he moved through the justice system first as a defendant and then as a prisoner he dropped his defensive stance prison taught him "a greater sense of acceptance" of his wrongdoing mr glisan says prosecutors say that white collar criminals even after they enter a guilty plea often take months or more to fully accept their guilt having spent most of their lives viewing themselves as law abiding citizens mr glisans coming to terms with his sentence was a gradual affair during his incarceration mr glisan met frequently with john kieschnick senior pastor at the gloria dei lutheran church in houston where mr glisan remains a parishioner mr glisan has always been "a driven individual " the pastor says but the past several years taught him "you have to check the demon to make sure it doesnt destroy you " as a result when he sat down with prosecutors mr glisan "opened doors into enron that we didnt think would be opened " particularly concerning former enron chairman kenneth lay and former president jeffrey skilling says john hueston a former senior task force prosecutor for the first time "i thought we might have a case against lay " says mr hueston now a partner with irell &amp manella llp adds kathryn ruemmler the task forces former deputy director mr glisan finally "had gotten rid of the why me rationalizations " of all the governments witnesses mr glisan probably had the best understanding of the financial and accounting intricacies that were a big part of enrons finances and the criminal case against messrs skilling and lay he also took part in some crucial conversations with mr lay concerning enrons financial health in the weeks before the companys bankruptcy filing moreover his clean cut and courteous manner gave him credibility with jurors a few months after those glisan sessions the government indicted mr lay prosecutors tapped him to be a witness in an enron criminal trial involving former merrill lynch &amp co officials worried about being labeled a snitch mr glisan says he sought out the leader of the white prison gang mr glisan and his inmate friend say prisoners typically took problems to the gang of their own race he explained that the government required him to testify and that he could face a longer sentence if he refused the gang leader and his lieutenant assured him he wouldnt face retaliation for his testimony mr glisan says after also passing muster with mikey mr glisan proved an effective witness at the merrill trial five of the six defendants were convicted several had at least part of their convictions overturned on appeal the government plans to re try them after the trial mr glisan says bastrop authorities wanted to put him back in solitary for protection he said he could manage the risk and assured officials that if problems surfaced he would check himself into the unit he didnt mention his contacts with gang leaders mr glisan later heard they nixed one inmates effort to retaliate against him for testifying as he continued working closely with prosecutors in the ongoing probe mr glisan renewed his push for a transfer to a lower security camp so did ms ruemmler the prosecutor now a partner at latham &amp watkins llp the move came months later in mid the tough treatment however continued instead of traveling directly to his new home in beaumont miles away mr glisan rode a prison bus over miles to a federal transfer facility in oklahoma city for a roughly one week stay he says he rode with shackled prison gang members he was given the task of passing out the bag lunches bologna sandwiches and apples the prison bureau spokeswoman says prisoners are regularly transferred through that facility in oklahoma city he shared a cell with an inmate who was being moved to take part in an anger management program one night the cellmate became extremely agitated turning red and cursing after another prisoner accused him of cheating at cards mr glisan says he stuck his face in the book he was reading until the storm passed mr glisan and ms ruemmler began preparing for the january trial of messrs skilling and lay but meeting regularly at beaumont became a pain it was roughly two hours away from the task forces houston offices after researching prison rules mr glisan suggested he be given "furloughs" to meet the task force in houston during the day spending evenings at home with his family mr glisan eventually had several such monday to friday furloughs before the first one ms ruemmler phoned mrs glisan to confirm that the prisoner was in fact welcome back home and that he needed to stay indoors mrs glisan replied that she had hoped her husband would mow the lawn the furloughs gave mr glisan a chance to ease back into family life after some two years away he his wife and the two kids spent evenings watching movies playing board games and talking mr glisan and his year old daughter made lots of italian dishes together when mr glisan testified at the skilling lay trial defense attorneys recognized his importance referring to him as the governments "clean up hitter " to discredit him they argued that the government doled out privileges such as furloughs only when he gave answers they wanted one lay attorney likened mr glisan to a "performing monkey " however jurors convicted messrs skilling and lay on multiple felony counts and cited mr glisans testimony as a major factor mr skilling who is serving a year sentence at a minnesota federal prison plans to appeal his conviction mr lay died shortly after the trial age from heart related problems last september mr glisan was released to home confinement which lasted until january when he was freed he remains on probation for three years that month mr glisan and his son attended their first pro basketball game together a week later his daughter cooked his birthday dinner by herself a three course meal that included seared tuna garlic mashed potatoes and homemade tiramisu it was he declares "the best birthday i will ever have " mr glisan occasionally still runs through a mental list of former colleagues he feels were more culpable many of whom were never indicted now hes trying to build a financial consulting business he thinks hell be especially sensitive to when aggressive financial tactics verge on fraud
