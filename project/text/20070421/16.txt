deal breaker land swap plan causes trouble for congressman mr renzi offers field to mining companies grand jury is active superior ariz as they dig for nickel copper and other commodities in the far corners of the earth the worlds largest mining companies rio tinto plc and bhp billiton ltd are used to solving geological problems here though the problems they encountered were political north americas largest copper lode is believed to be buried more than a mile beneath apache leap the stark red cliffs that loom above this storied old west town about an hour east of phoenix resolution copper co a joint venture between rio tinto and bhp billiton wants to mine it but first it needs congress to approve a federal land exchange under which resolution would swap acres of private land for acres of public land near its planned mine in exchange for supporting the bill the local congressman rick renzi a republican insisted on something in return he wanted resolution to buy as part of the land swap a acre alfalfa field near his hometown of sierra vista according to documents and people involved in the deal resolution executives refused for starters they thought the land was overpriced people close to the deal say more troubling they discovered it was owned by mr renzis former business partner these people say resolution wasnt the only party troubled by the congressmans demands his chief of staff resigned and began cooperating secretly with the federal bureau of investigation according to witnesses and others close to the case the fbi began a preliminary inquiry that was first reported in october just before mr renzi was elected to a third term that investigation has now become a formal public corruption probe by a federal grand jury in tucson on thursday the grand jury authorized a search warrant of a renzi family business investigators have uncovered evidence that mr renzi received a cash payment from his former business partner funneled through a family wine company after a second investor group pursuing an unrelated land swap agreed to pay &# million for the alfalfa field according to people contacted in the course of the two year investigation mr renzi denies any wrongdoing and says that he intends to cooperate with the investigation the search of the family business he said in a statement friday is "the first step toward getting the truth out " his lawyer says the cash payment he received was to settle an unrelated debt the case could add fuel to the firestorm over the bush administrations firing of federal prosecutors late last year paul charlton the u s attorney who had been overseeing the case was among those dismissed at the behest of the white house a spokesman for mr renzi dismissed as "a political hatchet job" the suggestion that mr charltons firing was connected to the probe of mr renzi on thursday attorney general alberto gonzales told congress that none of the dismissals were politically motivated and said the justice department is committed to battling corruption the renzi case is the latest in a wave of public corruption investigations of local and federal officials at least five members of congress three republicans and two democrats are now under federal criminal scrutiny two former members both republicans have gone to prison in the past year voter polls have suggested that the investigations were one reason republicans lost control of congress last november the renzi case spotlights the potential for abuse in the murky world of legislated land swaps which have become more common in recent years thousands of acres of public land worth hundreds of millions of dollars change hands each year through narrow special interest bills there is little public scrutiny and often no vote is recorded in congress some swaps serve public goals such as protecting wild habitat others enrich private interests at taxpayers expense sometimes sidestepping federal rules in the process the proposed arizona land exchange would sweep aside a order by president eisenhower protecting national forest in the area including oak flats a campground located above the proposed mine "yet another piece of land that was being permanently protected is being put on the block because a private interest has use for it " janine blaeloch director of the nonprofit western lands project complained to congress last year resolution which declined to comment about its contacts with mr renzi has said it hopes to sink foot shafts into the ground to reach the rich vein of copper ore it has worked for years to win support for the mine reaching out to local officials environmentalists and rock climbing groups arizonas governor and most members of its congressional delegation are backers the governor told a senate hearing last year the project could bring jobs and &# billion or more to the states economy although superior has long been a mining town it has escaped some of the ravages of open pit mining that have scarred nearby towns it is rich in natural beauty including otherworldly rock formations and steep cliffs that draw thousands of climbers each year mayor michael hing sees the new mine as a way to escape the boom and bust cycles that have whipsawed the town for more than a century ever since silver was discovered in at the silver queen mine and hundreds flocked to town including famed gunslingers doc holliday and wyatt earp in order to secure the use of the government land for mining resolution has proposed buying a number of parcels elsewhere and transferring them to government entities for uses completely unrelated to mining the town of superior for example would get title to the town graveyard now on federal land climbers would get another place to explore resolution says the vast apache leap rock escarpment so named because apache warriors on horseback are said to have jumped to their deaths to evade capture would be protected the san carlos apache tribe opposes the mine citing concerns that culturally significant areas would be disturbed mr renzi told resolution in that his support for the land swap would hinge in part on whether it helped fulfill a goal to cut water consumption along the san carlos river which slices through the desert far from the mining area in southern arizona participants in the deal say fort huachuca a big u s army base nearby was under court order to cut water consumption and it had been seeking help to retire farmland near the river mr renzi has longstanding ties to the base the economic engine of the area he grew up near it and his father retired u s army gen eugene renzi is its former commandant now employed by one of its largest contractors mantech corp resolution proposed buying and handing over to the government thousands of acres of bird and wildlife habitat along the banks of the san carlos which would further the water conservation goal in early however resolution balked at buying the acre alfalfa field owned by mr renzis business partner james sandlin mr renzi then turned to another investment group called the petrified forest group that was looking to put together a unrelated land swap that group which included bruce babbitt the former governor agreed that april to buy the patch of farmland for nearly &# million says philip aries a land swap expert that was part of the group "congressman renzi told me that the purchase of the sandlin parcel was a matter of national security and that it was key to ensuring the viability of fort huachuca " mr aries says "he said that if we were to buy it before" upcoming hearings about the possible closure of the base "he would give our swap priority a free pass he said would be sure to get through the natural resources committee " thereby ensuring its approval mr aries says that after his groups purchase of the alfalfa field went through in resolution complained that the petrified forest group had gotten priority treatment and mr renzi dropped his support for that groups land swap mr aries resolution executives and others involved in the proposed transactions have been interviewed about the matter by the fbi people close to the case say mr aries declines to discuss those conversations or other details of his groups dealings with mr renzi mr sandlin the former owner of the alfalfa field declines to comment public records show that mr sandlin and mr renzi became business partners in when mr sandlin bought shares of fountain realty &amp development one of mr renzis companies in and mr sandlin paid his partner between &# million and &# million for mr renzis stake in that business according to house financial disclosure records in a federal election commission audit found that mr renzi had received a total of &# in illegal corporate funds from fountain in the election cycle it found that fountain had shifted &# of this through mr renzis personal accounts to the renzi for congress campaign account and that at least &# of it was put back into mr renzis personal account mr sandlin bought the alfalfa field in for about &# million land records show the farmland more than a mile wide with mountains rising on two sides lies fallow today one focus of the fbis current investigation is whether mr renzi profited from the sale of mr sandlins land to the petrified forest group people close to the case say federal investigators have been asking questions about a may payment of &# from mr sandlin to mr renzi which was sent the same day that mr sandlin received the first payment from the petrified forest group these people say the payment went to a wine company owned by mr renzi which was sold to his father days later public records show phoenix lawyer grant woods one of mr renzis attorneys said friday that mr sandlin sent mr renzi the &# to settle a debt stemming from a previous business transaction involving land in northeast arizona "the note was due and he had to pay it off " mr wood said he said mr renzi was not pushing the sale of the sandlin property to help his former business partner "he was working to solve the water problems of the san pedro river and help save fort huachuca " mr woods said when mr renzi was pressing resolution and then the petrified forest group to buy the land "he did not know mr sandlin had an interest in that land " mr wood said executives of resolution and participants in the petrified forest group are cooperating with the fbi in its investigation people close to the case said the petrified forest group is not being investigated for any possible wrongdoing the fbi is also looking into the congressmans dealings with fort huachuca these people say mr renzi said friday he would take a leave of absence from the house intelligence committee "until the matter is resolved " john boehner the house republican leader had warned colleagues in a letter earlier this year that "clear likelihood of serious transgressions will lead to suspension from important committee positions guilt will lead to immediate and severe consequences " according to congressional quarterly mr renzi continues to serve on the house natural resources committee which handles land swap legislation resolution is pressing ahead with its effort to line up congressional support for a land swap bruno hegner who was resolutions president when mr renzi proposed that the company buy the alfalfa field was so troubled by the incident that he wrote a letter detailing what happened and mailed it to himself people close to the case said he wanted a postmarked record of what occurred these people say that letter is now in the hands of the fbi they say
