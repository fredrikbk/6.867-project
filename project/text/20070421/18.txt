earnings news delivers dow to near marker the dow jones industrial average stands within reach of another important milestone a close above after registering its seventh straight gain friday its latest winning streak has come with a new puzzle for wall street pros why with the economy apparently slowing are corporate earnings coming in so strongly a slew of big companies reported surprisingly robust earnings during the week prompting analysts to ratchet up their expectations for growth in the process analysts have admitted genuine surprise distinct from the faux surprises earnings usually generate on wall street at the numbers pouring in from some bellwether companies "i think that the notion that the economy is on wobbly legs has been put to rest " said ashwani kaul of reuters estimates which tracks corporate earnings "it turns out the first quarter wasnt that bad thats really the theme in the market today " the blue chip dow on friday jumped points or to a record led by components honeywell which announced better than expected earnings and caterpillar which announced a decline in first quarter net but raised its growth forecast for the rest of the year due to demand for its machinery overseas both companies jumped more than for the week the dow gained it is now up for the year a variety of factors are behind the latest earnings news including strong growth for many companies overseas share buybacks and strong earnings in the financial sector tied to investment banking outside of the dow google led the way higher after posting a rise in first quarter earnings the search engine companys shares rose helping the tech stock focused nasdaq composite index to climb or points to up for the week the broad based standard &amp poors stock index rallied or points to up on the week recently wall streets worst fears about corporate profits have been allayed with first quarter reports still due in for more than two thirds of the s&amp p wall street analysts expect to see aggregate profits up that is not as much as the double digit profit gains registered for several years but so far at least the slowdown isnt proving as bad as many feared earlier this month analysts were looking for growth for the quarter according to reuters estimates data even more striking the companies that have reported first quarter results so far have beaten analysts expectations by more than double the usual rate since corporate executives routinely gear their public statements to keep expectations low and make their actual results seem more impressive it is not unusual for announcements to beat consensus numbers but mr kaul and other analysts say that even by that standard the recent announcements seem to show that both executives and wall street pros have underrated how favorable conditions still are for companies particularly those with significant overseas revenue streams deutsche bank strategist binky chadha sees a rotation taking place for many companies as they source more of their profits abroad "i expect this rotation story to continue " he says "also the dollar will probably get weaker " which will make earnings generated in foreign currencies even more impressive in dollar terms despite a slight rally friday the dollar has fallen nearly against the euro so far this year and barely held its own against the yen there could be a steeper decline in the dollar against major foreign currencies if the federal reserve cuts its key interest rate target later this year as many wall street pros expect such a move would effectively increase the supply of dollars the european central bank is among those expected to raise rates in the months ahead bolstering the value of their local currencies "a lot of people in the u s are focused on the fed and whether it will or wont move " said ashraf laidi chief currency strategist at cmc markets "but what theyre underestimating is that even without a fed move these overseas currencies are going to be supported by their central banks " fridays stock rally came in spite of a rise in crude oil prices driven in part by worries about political violence in nigeria expiring
