hot topic guns politics and the law that the virginia tech massacre did not occasion a widespread round of political hand wringing over gun control is as one newspaper put it a silent testimony to how far the gun control debate has shifted in the past decade and a half yes the usual suspects have attempted to use the murder spree on campus as evidence of the danger of guns in america but as unlikely a combination of leaders from harry reid to george bush has been as one in warning we should avoid a "rush to judgment" in the wake of the killings thats progress of a sort even if the democrats abandonment of the issue flows more from political calculation than principle political calculation after all is based on something beyond mere politics the democratic party may have decided that gun control became a political liability in the and elections but that doesnt go far toward explaining why that is so first as we noted earlier this week what happened in blacksburg was evidence more than anything of the fact that there are sick and evil people in the world willing to do harm to others for no earthly reason pushing much beyond that point is political opportunism but over the past decade and a half evidence of another sort has been accumulating violent crime rates peaked in according to the justice department and have fallen steeply since over the same period gun control laws in many states have been relaxed correlation does not equal causation but it does make it difficult to argue that greater legal access to guns drives up levels of violent crime whether concealed carry laws and the like have held down crime rates remains a hotly debated subject certainly more aggressive and effective policing especially in big cities has been a major force in driving down crime one irony of this is that law enforcement types have long been a major pro gun control force even though it would seem that how their job is defined and performed has much more to do with crime levels than whether guns are available legally when violent crime rates were rising as they did steadily from the mid s through the s it was easy to get political traction with calls to "do something" about gun control this was true whether legally available guns had anything to do with those crime rates but with crime rates falling even as legal gun access expanded the argument has lost much of its plausibility and so its force which isnt to say no one makes the argument any more the nearly uniform reaction in europe to the virginia tech shootings has been to pin it on americas gun culture related to this is the charge that america is prevented from taking sensible steps to prevent gun violence by the invidious influence of groups such as the national rifle association quite apart from the fact that this implies american politicians and voters alike are dupes of the "gun lobby " it ignores the evidence noted above that violent crime and legal gun access either have nothing to do with one another or are if anything inversely correlated as this political debate evolves it appears that the supreme court may finally get a case in which to weigh in on the constitutional question of the right to bear arms last month judge laurence silberman on the d c circuit court of appeals ruled in favor of plaintiffs who claimed that their second amendment rights were violated by washingtons strict gun control laws the supreme court has not heard a second amendment case in decades but federal appeals courts have generally taken a very restricted view of citizens rights under the second amendment the d c circuits decision sets up a direct conflict with other circuits and could wind up at the supreme court this could be a defining moment for gun control as judge silbermans ruling unequivocally declares that "the right to keep and bear arms" under the second amendment belongs to individuals and not as some have argued only to national guardsmen or members of government organized "militias " "the phrase the right of the people " judge silberman wrote " leads us to conclude that the right in question is individual " he added "the wording also indicates that the right to keep and bear arms was not created by government but rather preserved by it " in all the decision is as clear a statement of the right to keep and bear arms as one could want the mayor of d c has requested a rehearing of the case by the full d c circuit if that is denied or if the full court sides with judge silberman the next stop would be the supremes a supreme court decision on what the second amendment means could transform the gun control debate in this country for now the relatively muted political response to the virginia tech killings may be taken as a sign that on this issue at least our politics have become a little less reactive and a little more rational see related letters "letters to the editor privacy laws guns and the university as protective parent" wsj april see
