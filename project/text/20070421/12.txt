democrats move ahead on minimum wage rise washington house and senate democrats reached agreement on a &# billion package of business tax breaks that the party hopes will clear the way for a &# an hour increase in the federal minimum wage the wage increase the first in almost a decade has been a signature issue for the democratic majority and would raise the hourly rate to &# over the next two years in three cent increments both the house and senate approved the increase soon after democrats took over congress in january but to the partys growing embarrassment the bill has been stalled because of differences over the level of business tax breaks first added by the senate to get past a republican filibuster the package now tilts more toward the house in its total cost and makeup depreciation tax breaks favored by the restaurant industry were dropped to keep the cost within the &# billion year limit set by democrats more than half or almost &# billion will pay for an extended work opportunity tax credit to encourage companies to hire disabled veterans and low wage workers who are sometimes transitioning from welfare more generous expensing and s corp tax rules targeted to small businesses would cost about &# million over years but the near term impact is far greater when viewed through a five year window the expensing provision which would raise the annual maximum to &# this year from &# comes to about &# billion senate republican tax writers are sure to oppose the deal but democrats will add the entire wage and tax package to a high profile iraq war spending bill slated to be approved by congress in the coming week that measure faces its own perils because of differences over iraq but the democratic leadership calculates that some version of the wartime spending bill ultimately will be signed before memorial day and it is the best legislative train to enact the wage increase labor economists estimate that the six million workers who are directly affected by the wage increase represent about of the work force compared with the directly affected when congress last approved an increase in democrats have argued that there is less need for tax breaks to help employers but the senate approved almost &# billion over years compared with just &# billion in the house bill new budget rules require revenue offsets to pay for these tax cuts and house republicans were skittish of the larger loophole closings proposed by the senate the smaller package largely rests on two provisions one expands the definition of minor children whose unearned income is taxed as if a parents the second gives the internal revenue service as many as months rather than today in which it can charge interest without having given a taxpayer notice of his or her potential liability
