pursuits leisure &amp arts sol lewitt thought inside the cube yet he made his cerebral artistic language speak with passion most of the obituaries of sol lewitt who died at age on april led by describing him as "the father of conceptual art " accurate as it is the phrase risks doing him a grave injustice as one of many younger artists in the s who reacted against what they perceived as the emotional excesses of abstract expressionism lewitt brought about a fundamental shift in taste with sculptures and drawings that put thought rather than feeling ideas rather than aesthetics at the forefront making the artists initial conception more important than the finished product or as lewitt himself put it in a essay "in conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work all planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair the idea becomes the machine that makes the art " yet it would be a pity if readers concluded from those obituaries that lewitt shared the anything goes attitude of many younger conceptual artists working today he was one of the most hardheaded intellectually rigorous artists of the th century an artist who made his seemingly remote coldly cerebral artistic language speak with richness even passion modern artists are broadly divided into representational and abstract those who want to depict what they see and the rest who aim to evoke the appearance and experience of the external world through their invented language but theres a small subset who dedicated their lives to probing the very structure of art itself josef albers for example spent his career trying to understand how color works in his "homage to the square" paintings he juxtaposed different colors to see how they acted on each other one would make the one next to it appear lighter or darker more or less intense advance or recede though works of art his paintings are first and foremost tools to help him understand one of the building blocks of art lewitt pursued a similar path at the beginning of his career in the mid s he took an elemental form the cube and in a series of works over the succeeding years made its form and structure the subject of an extended artistic inquiry what more was there to learn about so familiar and basic a form quite a lot as it turned out first that it wasnt always a solid mass lewitt began by stripping off its skin so he had an open cube formed by a skeleton of a dozen struts out of this he made free standing sculptures in which he combined multiple open cubes according to laws of logic based on numerical sequences or proportion he even went further dismantling the open cube seeing how many parts of the skeleton could be removed without it losing all semblance of three dimensionality one work "variations of incomplete open cubes " is a chart showing every conceivable permutation on this idea a kind of periodic table of the possibilities inherent in a single geometric form he also realized this "chart" as a large floor sculpture all this might have amounted to so much navel gazing makework certainly a great deal of conceptual art did and still does but lewitts open cubes have deep resonances across the art not only of his own time but of earlier eras artists have always been involved with geometry as a route to greater clarity and purity in their work whether in the form of the abstract grids of piet mondrian or the simplified forms in giorgio morandis still lifes and piero della francescas religious narratives cezanne famously observed that all nature could be distilled into "the cylinder the sphere the cone " but lewitt seemed driven to go beyond that kind of simplification and reductionism to explore the very structure of this artistic language itself lewitt took the same probing approach to drawing he concluded that centuries of graphic art could be boiled down into a handful of basic marks horizontal vertical diagonal and curved having thus summarily disassembled the art of drawing he proceeded to redefine it as a series of instructions given to assistants to arrange and combine these marks in specific ways but on a wall rather than a piece of paper traditionally the most spontaneous intimate form of artistic expression drawing was transformed in lewitts hands into something predetermined impersonal and mechanical a typical title "wall drawing gbp on a black wall all two part combinations of white arcs from corners and sides and white straight not straight and broken lines " but to read the artists instructions is one thing to see the finished product is another and frequently lewitts wall drawings attain an independent life a beauty and spontaneity that belies their origins as a series of rationalized predetermined procedures in other words lewitt came full circle by stripping art down to its essential elements he arrived not at a dead end the reductio ad absurdum of so many of his contemporaries who did the same but a renewal like a poet writing a sonnet or a musician composing a fugue lewitt achieved the fullest degree of expression within the severest of self imposed limitations mr gibson
