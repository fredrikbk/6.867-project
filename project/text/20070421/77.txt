whats the frequency nab ever since satellite radio companies xm and sirius announced plans to merge back in february the national association of broadcasters which represents commercial am and fm radio stations has been urging federal regulators to quash the deal on antitrust grounds the nabs argument is a remarkably weak one and the government would be remiss if it became a party to the groups transparent agenda which is to stop satellite radio from luring away any more of its listeners than it already has which isnt much otherwise the two satellite radio companies wouldnt be merging in the name of preventing some phantom "monopoly" from forming the nab is effectively asking regulators at justice and the federal communications commission to help it keep the competition in check and thus deprive consumers of figuring out whether this is a viable alternative radio service dont take our word for it by the way last october just months before xm and sirius unveiled their plans to combine nab president david rehr spoke openly about the make up of the current marketplace for audio news and entertainment "we still must address new competitors " he said in a speech to the national press club in washington "on the radio side we have satellite radio internet radio ipods other mp players cell phones and many many other things how will we compete " not much we can add to that apparently that argument was fine so long as xm and sirius were lost in space losing money today mr rehr is saying that regulators should consider satellite radio a unique and separate market when assessing the competitive impact of the merger in testimony before congress mr rehr said xm and sirius are seeking to form a monopoly that "would undermine audio content competition not enhance it " the nab has also commissioned several analyses of the merger that employ sophisticated herfindahl hirschman index measures and the like to determine that xm sirius would dominate the market for satellite radio its true that a xm sirius merger would leave us with one satellite radio provider but opposing the deal on those grounds is wide of the mark sometimes the best response to what a person is saying today is what that person has said in the past and despite mr rehrs efforts of late to take it all back the reality is that he had it right the first time monopolies are harmful when they are the sole seller of a product or service with no close substitutes and as mr rehr acknowledged substitutes competitors abound in the marketplace xm and sirius whose subscribers currently represent less than of total radio listeners arent merely competing for each others customers blocking the merger on that assumption makes little sense the real objective of xm and sirius is to lure listeners from free radio the internet mp players music channels on cable television cell phones and who knows what other options coming down the pike xm and sirius which have a combined million subscribers continue to lose money more than million people tune into free radio each week no one knows whether the public will ever really take to the pay model but its not the role of the government to help the nab smother a fledgling competitor in the crib this appears to be a merger of desperation more than anything and blocking it could well result in no satellite radio providers and thus fewer listening options for consumers consumers not the government should decide whether one satellite radio provider is one too many this isnt the first time the nab has tried to forestall competition from xm and sirius the group opposed granting them radio licenses and urged the fcc and congress to ban satellite providers from offering local weather and traffic reports this is more of the same telecom policy should not be about picking winners and losers but about encouraging investment and innovation for that to happen whats most important is competition among technological platforms cable telephone wireless and satellite for now policy makers and regulators would do better to focus less on static models of market share within one platform and more on making sure rival platforms continue to exist consumers will happily take care of the rest
