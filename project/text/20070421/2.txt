black box backfire on her popular blog arianna huffington stopped just short of blaming antidepressant medications for cho seung huis lethal rampage at virginia tech this week anti pharmaceutical demagogues love to blame drugs for all societys ills yet if antidepressants had anything to do with the massacre its likelier that it was the premature cessation of medication that led to chos violently disturbed state of mind thats one conclusion that can be drawn from a new analysis on the benefits and risks of antidepressants for children and adolescents published by the journal of the american medical association the analysis found that the risks of these medicines are much lower by a factor of two or more than the fda previously thought it had concluded from a previous study that young people had a risk of having aberrant thoughts if they took antidepressants the rate is only further the study found that these drugs are effective in treating depression and other mental illnesses found in children and teens the new study by the way was undertaken by the national institutes of health and the robert wood johnson foundation not big pharma this isnt the what the fda led us to believe in when it released an analysis indicating that young people on antidepressants had about a risk not of suicide but of "suicidal thoughts " anti pharmaceutical activists and some politicians immediately called for major restrictions on antidepressants simply ignoring that since the introduction of modern ssri type medications in the late s teen suicide rates had steadily fallen no the drumbeat from the "no risk allowed" crowd got the attention of the always risk averse fda the result was a "black box" warning the strongest possible warning short of an outright ban slapped onto the antidepressants remember this was provoked by an alleged increase in thoughts not deeds there were no actual suicides zero in the fda studies and none in the latest more extensive analysis guess what happened next parents naturally as frightened by this new warning as they would be by a skull and crossbones decided to forego giving these medicines to their children many family doctors spooked by the prospect of lawsuits suddenly found other less effective treatment options more appealing primary care physicians are the ones who prescribe most treatments for depression not psychiatrists since this warning label was introduced usage of ssri medications declined by more than from to among patients under years old and no surprise actual suicides not hypothetical ones increased among youngsters during the first year of the black box warnings the first such increase in many years when the fda was quizzed by renowned psychiatrists many of whom had disparaged the original warning spokespersons for the fda said in effect that the new study wasnt surprising and that they werent forbidding the drugs merely asking doctors to warn patients and monitor them really thats not what parents and treating physicians took away from the black box warning as for monitoring when i was in medical school many many years ago we learned that the most dangerous time for depressed patients was when therapy was initiated a previously immobile depressed person when treatment got started might mobilize just enough to become self destructive because of that doctors already know that careful monitoring of seriously depressed patients is mandatory neither parents nor doctors need the fda to tell them that they took the new warning to be something more dire so why is the fda stonewalling on modifying or eliminating the black box warning in the face of the new data about its effects simple they have painted themselves into a "safety" corner calls for more and more safety seeing only risks and not benefits from drugs make the regulators twist in any direction that allows them to avoid having to backtrack if they remove the warning and some teen actually does self destruct imagine the outcry but the director of the new york university child study center dr harold s koplewicz said it best "what is the risk of your child not taking the medicine " when risks and benefits of medications are discussed this topic never seems to be broached drugs have significant benefits or they wouldnt be developed approved and marketed what happens when a beneficial drug is avoided out of needless fears raised by some demagogue or plaintiffs attorney people die we shouldnt forget that dr ross is the executive and medical director of the american council on science and health acsh org healthfactsandfears com
