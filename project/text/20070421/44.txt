pursuits books the story of a pastor who ran into satan the testament of gideon mack by james robertson viking pages &# at one point in "the testament of gideon mack " we find ourselves in a kind of library suddenly a book on elves and fairies falls from the shelves which are otherwise crammed with christian works the owner the narrators father calls it "a curious book written by a curious man i use the word curious in both its senses " the description is almost a precise fit for the novel in which it appears james robertson who has published two previous novels in britain became in the scottish parliaments first writer in residence his american debut takes up a range of topics including religious belief the supernatural the trustworthiness of our senses and the nature of storytelling the tale is engaging enough even if its big ideas too often feel like the product of a detached and whimsical interest rather than of passion or true intellectual engagement the book begins with a prologue supposedly written by a scottish publisher who has come into possession of a manuscript written by a recently deceased clergyman named gideon mack as it happens the found manuscript framing is reminiscent of "the private memoirs and confessions of a justified sinner " by james hogg a th century scottish author the manuscript constitutes the bulk of the novel gideon takes the reader through his life from its beginnings in an emotionally frigid home through his years as an effective though secretly nonbelieving minister in a small town in scotland the big pivotal moment in gideons life comes when he tumbles from a high cliff into a rushing river below to everyones amazement three days later he emerges from the experience and the river very much alive he explains his survival in an odd way though he was he says rescued and tended to by the devil himself the deranged story does not go over well he is ostracized by his friends his fellow townsfolk and his church from the outset gideon is presented as an unreliable narrator the prologue of the "publisher" warns us that what follows "is not a fiction for gideon mack undoubtedly existed yet nor surely can it be treated as fact " as if to underline the point an epilogue offers the supposed report of a freelance journalist who has been asked to interview the people mentioned in gideons account reliable or not mr robertsons unlikely hero has a charmingly dry sense of humor even before his dramatic descent he tells us his dour flock did not entirely approve of him among other things there was the problem of his enthusiasm for jogging in shorts one female parishioner would "recognize me but pretend not to embarrassed by the ministerial knees " but gideon displays a tender tone in other scenes he suspects that a nearby female minister harbors unrequited feelings for him when she gets to the cusp of confessing her love and then pulls back he finds himself unexpectedly moved "she could see the rejection in my eyes and that all shed achieved by forcing herself to advance this far was to make a retreat inevitable and i saw that shed probably known all along how hopeless her planned confession was how doomed " and what of gideons great devil encounter it is played mostly for comedy satan is well dressed and wry amusingly disconsolate over how superfluous his brand of evil has become in a world plenty bad on its own "my hearts not in it " satan confesses he heals gideons broken leg with a hot touch of his hand and then sends the now former unbeliever on his way gideon returns to the village impassioned with the story of his revelation but the scenario is so bizarre and "curious" that it undercuts any serious effort on mr robertsons part to explore the nature of faith "the testament of gideon mack" takes a surprising twist at the end as the journalists report hints that gideons unreliability may have taken unexpected forms ultimately the novel amounts to a well wrought literary ghost story there is no shame in that of course but the suspicion lingers that mr robertson was striving for something more mr stanage writes for the new york observer
