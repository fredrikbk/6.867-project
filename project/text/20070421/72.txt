the weekend interview with shinzo abe yes prime minister tokyo margaret thatcher john major ronald reagan george bush junichiro koizumi shinzo abe the japanese prime minister who came after koizumi has big shoes to fill mr koizumi hacked away at the cozy relations between the ruling liberal democratic party japans insidious tentacle like bureaucracy and its geriatric corporate titans he was a refreshing change after a string of faceless prime ministers that trip off the tongue like ticker tape hata murayama hashimoto obushi mori and he was too a crucial jumpstart for japans economic and political revival which given its the worlds second largest economy and a keystone democracy in asia matters for the world at large too so expectations are high as i stood in a pastel tinted receiving room at the kantei the prime ministers residence earlier this week waiting for mr abes arrival ive come to survey his thoughts and agenda before his first trip to the u s as prime minister which starts thursday after that mr abe will visit five middle eastern countries a schedule that shows just how much japan has changed apres koizumi tokyo is now expected to be an active vibrant force for good abroad and its strategic goals often mirror that of the west the camp david summit is a solid chance for mr abe to convince mr bush and the u s public that hes a serious reformer and still americas strongest asian ally "im so sorry i kept you waiting " he says in staccato carefully rehearsed american english trailing a string of public relations minders and a security detail behind him the pr brigade is obviously worried about this interview mr abe made a serious gaffe last month claiming the japanese military played no role in the forced prostitution of chinese korean and other women in occupied territories during world war ii the so called "comfort women " he later apologized but too late to stop the media furor the foreign ministry rang me daily for a week to ask for everything from a list of prearranged questions just six please to my personal resume various members of the foreign ministry took me out for sushi and a quiet chat and when i finally arrived in japan for the interview messages started piling up at my hotel the wall street journal news bureau and my hong kong office they even rolled out tv tokyo to interview me as i walked into the kantei i declined not quotidian treatment but is mr abe just another puffed up prime minister or is he mr koizumis true successor that remains an open question mr abe set his own expectations high last september sweeping into office on the mantle of a "beautiful japan" a vision of civic nationalism that would engender national pride in japans economic and military revival without this belief in the worthiness and goodness of the nation the logic runs tokyo cant convince its timid citizens to pass constitutional reform open up the economy to foreign competition or garner enough public backing to take a more proactive diplomatic role in international institutions nothing wimpish or equivocal about that mr abe has a strong background in foreign policy so to warm him up i start with the issue catching headlines out here north korea mr abe cut his political teeth in the s publicizing the plight of japanese citizens abducted by the north at a time when no one much knew or cared about them he wears a blue pin on his lapel during our interview a constant reminder so given that the north koreans broke their promise to start decommissioning their nuclear facilities last week "are there any incentives in your opinion that would persuade north korea to give up nuclear weapons and to transform its society " in rapid fire japanese through a translator i get a platitude "realizing that we need to get north korea to abandon its nuclear programs we came up with the six party agreement the important question is whether north korea has the will to live up to their promise under that agreement or not " but theyre not "so what will you do " now mr abe though with legs still crossed and reclining in his chair starts to look serious tokyo will continue "harsh sanctions " he says acknowledging that u s efforts to squeeze kim jong ils dirty bank accounts were "very effective " in the polite parlance of japanese diplomacy this is an implicit criticism of the bush administrations decision last month to release &# million of north koreans funds frozen in macau by doing so washington has boxed mr abe into a very uncomfortable corner japan is the only country that has refused to send aid or money to the north until they show verifiable progress on the nuclear issue and send back japans abductees tokyos diplomats are worried that theyre getting left out of the really important discussions in the six party talks even though japan is the country most physically threatened by pyongyang mr abe says hell "discuss fully" with president bush "what well do if north korea doesnt live up to its promises " which seems likely if history is any guide mr abe too enjoyed early foreign policy plaudits vis a vis china a relationship strained by mr koizumi who like the chinese played to his domestic audience with historical nose thumbing a favorite political game on both sides mr abes tack is more practical he understands the relationship will never be abortive thanks to the economic co dependence of the two nations but equally it will never be ideal so long as the communist party retains power in beijing so he traveled to china immediately after taking office last year and offered better relations chinas premier wen jiabao reciprocated last week speaking to the diet with a speech peppered with words like "melting ice" and "win win relationship " this improving relationship was obliquely on display last month with the comfort woman drama members of the u s congress drafted a resolution demanding an apology which will be put to a vote only after mr abes visit while beijing remained relatively reserved a nod to the slimming of the gulf between tokyo and beijing mr abes foreign policy successes however have been marred obscured even by a series of domestic missteps driven by his tendency to please not confront hearkening back to japanese prime ministers of old this regression has taken attention away from significant diet successes such as passing a law that sets the stage for constitutional reform and its raised questions about his belief in the systems that mr koizumi fought so hard to topple theres historical irony here mr abes grandfather nobusuke kishi a former prime minister was one of the creators of the ldp kishi formed the coalition party to prevent the socialists from winning power successful but simultaneously corrosive the ties the ldp created with the bureaucracy and the captains of industry bred corruption and stasis mr abe spent weekends with kishi as a youth in particular mr abes readmission of the ldp "rebels" whom mr koizumi booted out of the party for opposing reform was hailed as a major misstep "do you think the japanese people want a consensus style of leadership or an aggressive style of leadership " i ask "i think the japanese people now realize that with that sort of consensual leadership we will not be able to catch up in this age of a globalized economy so we need to really exert aggressive leadership " that shows you just how much mr koizumi changed the rules of the game in japan mr abe however isnt yet following his own advice the lack of a decisive economic agenda and his choice of a cabinet filled with "yes men" that please various factions not visionaries coupled with a string of embarrassing comedowns from his staff all made him look weak and emboldened the left leaning factions of the ldp to push for redistributionist economic policy touting "income inequality" as their objective mr abes poll numbers and the nikkei tumbled dramatically though the former improved a touch after the recent wen trip to tokyo so what will mr abe commit to reform in what resembled one long breath and after the only time he glanced at his notes mr abe said hed like to deregulate the japanese economy double foreign investment within five years slash the bureaucracy reform the tax base and open up the labor market "isnt that a lot to chew " i wonder "what are the one or two things that you want to achieve " i ask "there is no single area that will be sufficient to work on because to achieve what ive just said that we need to work on tax reform deregulation administrative reform et cetera " he replies limply and therein lies the problem mr koizumi succeeded because he zeroed in on the wheezing banking sector and the privatization of the postal service which is effectively the worlds largest bank he wasnt perfect he didnt touch the heavily protected agricultural sector for instance but in picking his battles carefully he won a few contrary to popular belief mr abe isnt an economic innocent he worked briefly in the private sector and under mr koizumi formed ties with tokyo academics he also attended regular briefings by former economics minister heizo takenaka from onward mr abe might yet surprise on the domestic front he deliberately mentioned that japans tax rates are higher than the oecd average a signal corporate tax burdens could ease his team could aim for something small perhaps by resolving a long running dispute over u s beef imports or by cracking open immigration but in the long run thats not the kind of sweeping reform japan so desperately cries out for mr abe needs to make japan an easier place to do business for foreigners break down regulatory barriers to trade and keep plugging away at the anti reform base in the ldp period its still too early to tell if mr abe will fade into obscurity or if hell carry on where mr koizumi left off but the time is fast approaching for a referendum on his leadership in july japan holds upper house elections and if the ldp loses badly mr abes leadership could be up for grabs lucky for him the opposition is weak the ldp coalitions grip on power is strong and the party doesnt have a clear successor so mr abe may indeed have a second chance to show hes mr koizumis real heir but his softly softly approach says to the japanese public trust me ill do more after you re elect me and given his record at home so far thats a lot to ask we are running out of time the public relations keepers cut my interview slot from an hour to minutes to and a discreet man suddenly sidles up to my chair and whispers in my ear around minute that its "time for the last question " so i ask "is there anything that the prime minister would like to discuss that i didnt ask " "my administration will continue with our efforts to work on reforms energetically " he says "and in my upcoming meeting with president bush id like to really cement our mutual trust and make the u s japan alliance unshakable " laudable but dull just like his policies at home so far the tv cameras werent there when i left ms kissel is editorial page editor of the wall street journal asia
