pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink a rustic refreshment in the summer of samuel clemens boarded a steamship for a "pleasure excursion to europe and the holy land " the trip exotic and extravagant in its day became the stuff of mark twains first best seller the comic travelogue "innocents abroad or the new pilgrims progress " whether in morocco turkey gibraltar italy or france twain finds a superabundance of cons frauds and deceits meant to separate credulous tourists from their cash nowhere is twain more outraged than in a paris bar promising cocktails wandering through paris twain and his fellow pilgrims soon discovered that resolutely francophone shopkeepers regularly placed signs reading "english spoken here" in their windows "it was a base fraud a snare to trap the unwary chaff to catch fledglings with " twain wrote "they had no english murdering clerk they trusted to the sign to inveigle foreigners into their lairs " but that dodge was nothing compared to bars with signs claiming "all manner of american drinks artistically prepared here " twain and his pals bundled into one such bar "a bowing aproned frenchman skipped forward and said que voulez les messieurs " the men asked for simple whiskey straight "a stare from the frenchman " so they called for champagne cocktails "a stare and a shrug " sherry cobbler brandy smash the garcon retreated "shrugging his shoulders and spreading his hands apologetically " "the uneducated foreigner could not even furnish a santa cruz punch an eye opener a stone fence or an earthquake " twain harrumphed "it was plain that he was a wicked impostor " the vast majority of modern american bartenders would also have to be declared impostors in that no one nowadays remembers how to make any of those drinks beyond the straight whiskey and the champagne cocktail but they were the favorites of twains day the glasses that originally won fame for "american drinks " twain ought not to have been so hard on the frenchmen for that was the first season that anyone in paris had even heard of american drinks yet cocktails were suddenly all the rage thanks to the great paris exposition that summer of frances grand fair displayed the products and peoples of the globe engendering no small amount of competition the new york times correspondent was dismayed to find america outclassed the french had "the whole machinery" of a battleship in one huge room running at full bore with "a great bright three bladed brazen propeller driving aft a gale of wind as under water it would drive the foaming sea " looking for some american ships on display the reporter spied a sign "on which i read english and american something but on getting nearer i found the word was drinks there were cobblers and juleps and cocktails plenty of spirit craft but no water craft " he sniffed the reporter underestimated the impact that the american bar had on the french imagination "if you asked any question of the stranger about paris " said the peripatetic american politician samuel s cox "he dilated upon the noggs cobblers smashes cocktails eye openers moustache twisters and corpse revivers of the american restaurant " "every country had its restaurant where the drinks native to its soil were drunk " william joseph flagg wrote in his book "three seasons in european vineyards " but it was the iced drinks in the american pavilion including cobblers juleps and cocktails hail storms smiles and stone fences that "not only astonished but delighted multitudes who took the first glass from curiosity but the second from appreciation " if as flagg declared the exposition was a "grand and magnificent" battle where "all the nations of the round world met in the contest " the iced american drink was the victor among the beverages that won the day was the stone fence in truth a less than exotic concoction as its name implied it was rustic a rural tipple which is fitting for a drink that happened to be "buffalo bill" codys favorite there is no one settled recipe but the stone fence was generally made by combining whiskey and hard cider in equal proportions in a glass full of cracked or shaved ice in new jersey applejack replaced the whiskey according to an article in the new york mail and express southerners called a combination of applejack and cider "junk " sometimes lemon peel was added sometimes orange slices studded with cloves if you got the drink from a proper bartender a dash of bitters went into the glass the "gentlemans table guide" recommended topping ones stone fence with a splash of pink noyeau liqueur a cousin to amaretto in australia the stone fence evolved into a drink every bit as unique to the continent as the northern hairy nosed wombat the oz stone fence is traditionally made of brandy and ginger beer though one definition listed the drink as a mix of ginger beer and ale not unlike a shandy i think the old stone fence could stand to be revived but it needs a little doctoring whiskey and fizzy hard cider on the rocks isnt bad but adding a dollop of creme de cassis works wonders and if you dont like that then just try it "barefooted " which was once an elaborate way of asking for a glass of straight whiskey email me at eric felten wsj com stone fence  oz bourbon or rye whiskey oz hard cider oz creme de cassis dash angostura bitters build on the rocks in a highball or double old fashioned glass garnish with a slice of lemon peel
