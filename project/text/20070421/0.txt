ask encore focus on retirement no loopholes for minimum ira distributions suppose i have a traditional ira have reached age and would prefer not to take the required minimum distribution or "rmd" is there something wrong with my thinking that this is possible there appears to be a loophole in the rules governing these intended annual distributions namely in years in which one doesnt wish to take a rmd one transfers the traditional ira into a roth ira before dec and after jan does a recharacterization back into the traditional ira based on the dec zero balance of the traditional ira the report from the institution handling the account to the internal revenue service indicates no distribution needs to be taken granted this scenario shouldnt be used year after year because of the tax consequences of insufficient withdrawals upon ones demise but it does seem to allow some leeway from taking distributions each and every year after age john nichol greenville ill nice try but no way this can be done " says ed slott an ira consultant in rockville centre n y in fact financial advisers have asked him if they can use this strategy to avoid taking required withdrawals so many times that he has written up the answer in a training manual under federal tax rules you have to make an adjustment to the year end balance of your traditional individual retirement account to reflect the return of any outstanding roth ira recharacterizations and failing to do so can result in a penalty on any shortfall in the required distribution that you should have withdrawn based on that adjusted balance mr slott adds lets say you convert all of your traditional ira to a roth ira on dec so on dec the balance of your traditional ira balance is zero but if later in you undo the conversion to a roth technically called a "recharacterization" the funds would be transferred back to your traditional ira at that point you would have to add back those funds to your traditional ira balance for dec and the adjusted balance is the figure you would use to calculate your required minimum distribution for but if you convert your traditional ira to a roth and then you experience a loss in the roth account you can move the assets back to the traditional ira to avoid paying tax on the account value youve lost it sounds complicated until you hear an example lets say you convert your traditional ira valued at &# to a roth on dec again on dec your traditional ira balance is zero in your roth performs poorly by aug the balance has sunk to &# so you recharacterize that amount back to your traditional ira "so you are not stuck paying tax on a &# conversion which is now only worth &# " mr slott says how do you figure out what to use as the balance for your distribution you would use the balance in the roth on dec since the roth ira assets are deemed to have never left the traditional ira after the recharacterization if the roth balance was still &# on dec you would use that figure to calculate your required distribution if the roth balance had dropped to a smaller amount such as &# thats the figure you would use send your question to encore wsj com ask encore focus on retirement is a weekly column answering readers questions about retirement and personal finance from annuities and bonds to trusts and inheritance issues please include your full name and city and state
