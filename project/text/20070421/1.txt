biologics lawmakers may find that science is a law unto itself in regard to your april editorial "dr waxmans drug lab" it is sad and ironic that at the critical moment when biologic therapies are finally bearing the fruit of decades of research and providing hope for cancer patients lawmakers on capitol hill are considering legislation that would undermine the development of such life saving biologics it is because of this research promise that candlelighters childhood cancer foundation has been working with the foundation for the nih and americas biotech industry to support biologic research for childhood cancer this patient population sadly continues to be treated with highly toxic cancer drugs that were developed to years ago these traditional toxic chemotherapy drugs have not provided a cure for many childhood cancer tumors and leave those children who do survive facing lifelong late effects including secondary cancers our nations cancer children and their families are depending on innovative biotech companies to develop improved and more effective treatments rep waxmans short sighted approach to cost cutting ignores the engineering and safety challenges of developing and testing biologics and reduces the incentive for the biotech industry to develop targeted therapies or "smart drugs " for children with cancer and orphan diseases ruth i hoffman m p h executive director candlelighters childhood cancer foundation kensington md we should be skeptical of legislators attempts "to fit a new problem into a framework for which it wasnt designed " the scientific questions involved in "follow on" biologics are even more complex than that stated in your editorial "long protein chains in biologics are less well understood than traditional drug molecules " and "a generic will not be biochemically identical to the original " even minuscule differences in the substances that inevitably accompany or contaminate the active drug substance can be clinically significant and because the same biologic drug may be purified from very different substrates bacteria yeast or cultured mammalian cells for example the contaminants may be very variable when i was a medical reviewer at the fda in the early s a completely unexpected side effect occurred in the clinical testing of a new formulation of gene spliced human growth hormone synthesized in bacteria at the outset of the initial clinical studies on healthy human volunteers who happened to be executives of the drug company the drug caused extreme pain at the injection site fever and blood chemistry abnormalities that indicated an inflammatory process the problem was not in the growth hormone molecule itself but with a low level contaminant that stimulated human white blood cells to release a substance that caused the signs and symptoms the contaminant had not been detected in the standard sophisticated screening tests that are supposed to assure a drugs purity and quality nor was it found in preclinical animal studies because of the indirect mechanism of its toxicity and its specificity for human cells thus prior to injection into humans the problem was exceedingly difficult to predict and avoid like the epogen example in your editorial these kinds of potential problems confound the production andregulation of follow on biologics some things cannot be dictated by legislators rep waxman and his colleagues must learn that science is a law unto itself henry i miller m d the hoover institution stanford calif dr miller was an fda official from to you blast rep waxmans bill to establish a less burdensome approval pathway for generic or "follow on " biotech medicines as motivated by animus toward the pharmaceutical industry even if the claim is true it doesnt follow that shortening the follow on approval process is the wrong thing to do copying biopharmaceuticals is more difficult than copying conventional drugs but todays highly sophisticated protein mapping technology makes it possible to duplicate many such products safely and the food and drug administration has the expertise and technological capacity to determine when and how much human testing is needed to ensure that copies of biopharmaceuticals work as well as the originals the waxman bill merely allows the fda to exercise its discretion in a way that could do away with many costly wasteful and potentially unethical clinical trials of course it is important to protect the industrys incentives for innovation and the waxman bills intellectual property provisions may or may not strike the most appropriate balance between access and innovation but it is worth noting that innovation is also driven by competition which is why patent terms expire once the patent and data exclusivity protection for a biopharmaceutical ends consumers would benefit from an abbreviated regulatory pathway that lets follow on products get to market gregory conko senior fellow competitive enterprise institute washington
