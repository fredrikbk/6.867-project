house clears an executive pay measure washington the house overwhelmingly passed a bill that would give shareholders a greater voice in setting executive compensation but a law is far from certain due to opposition by the white house the bill which passed by a margin in the house friday would give shareholders a nonbinding vote on executive pay packages and a separate vote on any compensation negotiated as part of a purchase or sale of a company a so called golden parachute shareholders wouldnt set pay "there are unfortunately a lot of examples of excessive compensation for ceos " said barney frank chairman of the house financial services committee and author of the bill shortly after the bill passed in the house democratic presidential hopeful sen barack obama of illinois jumped on the bandwagon with a promise to introduce what an aide described as an "identical" bill in the senate the senator is expected to take on the matter over the next several weeks in an apparent move to get out front on a populist issue an executive compensation bill "would allow shareholders to hold executives to similar performance standards that workers are held to " the obama aide said rising executive compensation has become a touchy issue and could become more central as the presidential race picks up in recent years the gap between the countrys rich and poor has widened by almost every measure and generous pay packages for executives have become lightning rods for income inequality issues whether the bill gains momentum in the senate is uncertain sen christopher dodd a democrat from connecticut and a rival of mr obamas for their partys presidential nomination heads the senate banking committee which would process an executive pay bill through the senate mr dodd said in a statement friday that the issue is "important and that he intends "to take a close look at the house legislation consider all pertinent views and then determine the most appropriate course of action " getting republicans on board may also pose a challenge earlier this year president bush spoke out about excessive chief executives compensation in his state of the economy address but the administration wednesday said it was against the "say on pay" bill it advised lawmakers to give other overhauls time to take effect these include a move toward independent compensation committees and new rules requiring greater disclosure of pay packages the house legislation would require the securities and exchange commission to write rules under which investors could use company issued ballot forms to vote on executive pay on an advisory basis starting in the bill builds on sec rules written last year that require more disclosure of executive compensation including a total compensation number the sec chairman has suggested that a goal was to force directors to think more carefully about pay saying that "when people are forced to undress in public they will pay more attention to their figures " businesses and investors such as union sponsored pension funds are sharply divided over the measure while investors say the goal is to prod board directors to engage in dialogue with investors u s companies fret over possible repercussions business is concerned that labor unions could try to influence executive pay on inequality measures instead of basing it on the future financial performance of the company see related letter "letters to the editor a vote id love to cast" wsj april
