the buzz marketwatch weekend investor chinese solar energy companies may be next stocks to burn investors years ago when the disk drive industry was booming and seagate technology couldnt add capacity fast enough the companys chief executive the late alan shugart was asked what would happen when capacity exceeded demand his answer was akin to "well worry about it then " indeed they did with layoffs plant closings and price cuts something investors who watched the share price slide likely wont forget such is life maneuvering amid the boom bust boom world of technology where the experience of seagate is more the norm than the exception next on tap to learn that supply demand lesson the hard way just might be investors in the handful of chinese solar companies that have gone public in the u s in the past year these companies have come out of nowhere some reformulated from industries unrelated to solar to become stock market darlings amid the recent infatuation with alternative energy the solar crowd includes such companies as trina solar ltd which has been in the solar business since late it originally made aluminum siding and now has a market value of more than &# billion after going public late last year ja solar holdings co in business since may making products since april publicly traded in the u s since february and now with &# billion plus market value solarfun power holdings co which went public late last year and is now valued at nearly &# billion and canadian solar inc another recent initial public offering with china roots that started in as a maker of solar car chargers ja chief executive samuel yang says a few more chinese solar upstarts are believed to be waiting in the wings to do an ipo plenty more he says are looking for ways to cash in on the boom including companies that used to make clothing and shoes "everybody thinks it is such a lucrative industry " he says to a large extent it has been most of the young publicly traded companies have posted impressive sales and profit growth thats right they are posting profits lots of it but before investors get too excited consider that much of that growth has been tied to sales in germany the largest market for solar energy where purchases for large fields of solar panels have been subsidized by the government piper jaffray &amp co analyst jesse pichel regarded as one of the most seasoned in a rapidly growing field of solar analysts says that is why he regards much of the sales and profit at these companies as "funny money" and "welfare " "theres a lot of risk that the subsidies dont continue in germany and i think they will get reduced " he says that in turn will cause demand to slow that gets us back to this whole supply demand thing when supply outstrips demand prices tend to fall that is something to keep in mind because even as demand is slowing many of these companies are pulling out all stops to expand capacity and they are doing it as more competitors are springing up consider canadian solar which makes solar panels which contain solar cells that absorb sunlight it attributed a fourth quarter loss in part to a decline in prices even as plants are running around the clock "were expanding capacity but were expanding to meet firm orders " chief executive shawn qu says while demand in such countries as spain south korea and the u s may strengthen and the business as a whole may get much stronger in future years mr pichel says it isnt rising as fast as the growth in capacity as a result he believes profit margins will continue to come under pressure for the time being as companies start selling below market prices to gain share mr yang and mr qu believe there will be a shakeout in the industry and that their companies as low cost providers will be among the survivors executives of solarfun and trina couldnt be reached still between here and there wherever there is a lot will happen before it gets sorted out meantime there is likely to be a comeuppance that investors in these companies will wish they had anticipated as was the case with internet stocks memory chip stocks and oh yes disk drive stocks history on wall street has a way of repeating itself the forgotten financial fraud the trial in u s court for the southern district of california started april for the remaining top executives and an outside auditor of peregrine systems inc who havent already pleaded guilty peregrine you may recall is the san diego software company that was alleged to have overstated revenue by &# million and understated losses by &# billion over a month period starting in because of the timing it was overshadowed as a national story by the enron collapse and relegated to a footnote in the annals of corporate fraud it is a tale however that deserves not to be forgotten herb greenberg is senior columnist for marketwatch he doesnt own stocks except those of his employer and doesnt sell individual stocks short or invest in hedge funds marketwatch is
