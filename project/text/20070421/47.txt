pursuits food &amp drink eating out the continental divide the reason some of europes biggest culinary stars dont make it here last fall gordon ramsay stormed into new york to reconquer america for england reactions in the former colonies were not much warmer than the queens handshake indeed the chill may have scared off thames side biggie alan yau who backed out of a plan to bring his neo chinese fare to manhattan meanwhile mr ramsays french rival joel robuchon hit a courir maison home run at a gotham branch of his global chain of ateliers is there some kind of pro french anti brit bias over here we dont think so after all the most successful french chef of this era alain ducasse had to close his super splashy new york outpost this winter but there is something to the theory that this country now has so many first rate elite restaurants run by homegrown lads that even the best of the eurochefs cant impress us any more with their cuisine de noblesse oblige mr robuchon is the exception that proves the rule there are several other successful european chefs who have lived here long enough to qualify as naturalized cooks joachim splichal whose patina helped make los angeles a culinary destination jean georges vongerichten with his american empire spread from new york to minneapolis and daniel boulud who added foie gras to the hamburger guy savoy has simply created an exact replica of his paris restaurant at caesars palace in las vegas but its looking unlikely that any new arrivistes will join them in the stiff competition with americas leading homegrown chefs thomas keller bestrides the new york food scene like a colossus with per se but he has dozens of compatriots nipping at his heels and barely a serious foreign rival at a local stove this is not because of xenophobia american epicures still flock to michelins favorite european addresses we would love to throw cash at taillevent in paris if only we could get a table there and those of us who have thrown off antiquated prejudices about british food plan far ahead to dine at world class tables such as heston blumenthals fat duck in bray on thames or especially at gordon ramsays eponymous flagship in a cheerful houselike setting in londons chelsea neighborhood the whole experience at this serenely successful modern british french pinnacle of cooking and service is one of giddy pleasure you feel you are in a very special place but one firmly anchored in the english present take one "starter" a fricassee of english snails from essex with baby spinach wild mushrooms cauliflower pancetta and jerusalem artichoke puree the list of ingredients does not predict the intricate but unpretentious food sculpture they come in or their remarkable blend of distinct tastes on pluck alone we thought the guy who could make such miracles in london deserved a second look so we went back to the sleek seat sterile dining room in a lavishly rehabbed hotel on west th street we had had no trouble making a prime time reservation at gordon ramsay at the london so called because its located at manhattan hotel the london nyc at the last minute and sat down full of optimism until we knocked over a glass of water were ushered to another table and found ourselves in some kind of service black hole but lets overlook the delays and other glitches the food was as elaborate and tasty as a spoiled gourmand could ask for but even if a skilled brigade of cooks can tackle fantastically intricate yet earthy dishes you never feel transported to a special place this windowless exercise in perfection left its soul in london perhaps the main problem is the hotel setting which so many eurochefs opt for the plutocratic hedge fund blackstone put something like &# million into transforming the deadly rihga hotel into an elegant hostelry just off the lobby is a capacious bar lounge dining area through which you are escorted to the dining room half the bar area is reserved for more casual feeding but on a recent night most of those tables were empty the drinking side was full however and you could tangle with a hard charging investment banker who was saving the only empty seat at the actual bar for a late arriving client inside was an imported staff of well trained ramsayites doing their best to transfer nirvana to a lesser place would i go back there sure i am not the sort to boycott an apricot souffle but if i had to choose i would quickly opt for dinner at bouley downtown this new york institution shows just how much a great restaurant depends on a settled sense of itself it isnt just skillet skill that makes david bouleys foie gras with prunes the best foie gras around in a world awash with foie gras the basic idea is french the prunes are actually french but eating that dish in that vaulted rathskeller space we couldnt be anywhere else but west broadway in the manic hands of david bouley even he couldnt translate this special brilliance to the foreign soil of miami beach last year but in tribeca hes at home like robert de niro in the american express ad mr ramsay calls his tv show "gordon ramsays f word " and whats mr bouleys f word fuhgeddaboutit
