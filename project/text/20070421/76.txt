what the cold war taught us the international human rights regime has fallen on hard times kenneth roth executive director of human rights watch wrote recently that "since the u s cant provide credible leadership on human rights european countries must pick up the slack " but the europeans mr roth notes are no more enthusiastic about pressuring foreign countries than is the u s the united nations human rights council is in no position to pick up the slack either the human rights council has performed even more dismally than its much maligned predecessor the u n commission on human rights the latter was disbanded because it had become a platform dominated by human rights abusers who used it mostly for criticizing israel the human rights council by contrast is a platform dominated by human rights abusers who use it exclusively for criticizing israel late last month the commission finally issued a weak resolution on the genocide in darfur one in the words of u n watch that "failed to condemn or even to cite the sudanese government " at the same time it urged governments "to prohibit the dissemination of racist and xenophobic ideas and material aimed at any religion" a reference to the danish cartoon controversy and a sentiment deeply in conflict with western ideals of freedom of expression so if americans europeans and the u n will not lead on human rights who will nobody and maybe that is not such a bad thing human rights were supposed to be special unlike most international law which governs the relations of states with each other international human rights law regulates the internal workings of states the relationship between a government and its citizens this gives human rights law a rigidity that is absent from most international law when the u s and another country disagree about flyover rights or trade they can renegotiate the relevant treaty regime and bring it into alignment with their joint interests but when a country decides that its human rights commitments interfere with law enforcement or counterinsurgency operations it cannot renegotiate its commitments with minor exceptions its commitments are to all the theory is that human rights are universal and so states have no excuse for committing human rights abuses the practice however has been different states must worry about their security even when an existential threat is not imminent if they do not they lose the support of their citizens or subjects and thus they risk their own political stability and states must cater to local religious and cultural values at odds with western human rights accordingly most states have paid no more than lip service to their human rights commitments during the cold war the u s used human rights as a cudgel against the soviet union and its satellites but gave a free pass to friendly dictators the end of the cold war was supposed to change all this under american leadership countries would finally live up to their human rights commitments and international human rights would continue to advance several forces have conspired to ruin this pretty picture first genuine disagreement exists about the proper moral ordering of society where once it could be thought that totalitarian regimes suppressed peoples natural instinct in favor of human rights it has become clear as electoral democracies have replaced authoritarian regimes that this is simply not true people also care about tribal ethnic and religious ties they care about order and security an islamic democracy will not necessarily endorse religious pluralism or womens rights a country with a long history of tribal dispute resolution practices will reject western style law enforcement the tension between promoting democracy and promoting human rights when newly enfranchised peoples turn out not to subscribe to the ideals of the enlightenment is the dirty secret of the human rights movement as the expanding franchise continues to expose the fissure between the two ideals human rights advocates are finally going to have to choose between them second the idea that the u s with or without european support could impose its conception of human rights on other countries has taken a beating in recent years and this beating will only become worse over the next few decades as regional powers like china russia india south africa and brazil continue to rise and assert themselves whatever leverage the west has had for pressuring human rights violators will continue to decline the new powers will offer alternative cultural religious or ideological standards that are more attractive than western human rights to subsets of nations and they will offer trade and securities ties if the west tries to withdraw them already we observe china snapping up oil leases in sudan and russia exploiting its economic ties with iran third the ideology of human rights advancement relies on a false picture of human motivation and global politics human rights advocates seem to think that closing guantanamo bay would improve the behavior of governments in other countries but foreign governments have no reason to think that they should do whatever the u s does indeed if the u s closed guantanamo bay and some of the freed detainees returned to afghanistan as some reportedly have and killed american troops the lesson learned by the world is not one that would advance the cause of human rights today the future of the international human rights legal regime is bleak and yet if what matters is not conformity with the rules of the human rights treaties but the well being of the worlds population things have never been better mortality rates are down per capita income is up literacy has spread democracy is flourishing economic growth in china and india which together account for a third of the worlds population largely accounts for improvement in overall well being but there is also good news in latin america south africa eastern europe and southeast asia how can this be as technology and trade have advanced and spread so has wealth and education and with wealth and education has come political reform and the expansion of civil and political rights this is part of a long term trend that goes back centuries there is no guarantee that it will continue but one central fact needs to be recognized the role of legalized international human rights in this process has been minimal or nil much more important in the th century were the determined efforts of liberal democracies to oppose powerful dangerous expansionist states that rejected markets and democracy and imposed their views on small countries these efforts required pragmatic accommodation of unsavory allies and even compromising of western values for the sake of the greater goal of keeping dangerous forces in check for the conflict with radical islam this history holds important lessons mr posner is a professor
