pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece rembrandts drama in d the work often called the night watch is action packed anatomy of a classic amsterdam his larger than life statue stands on the central square named in his honor rembrandtplein from his pedestal the great artist calmly looks down on the recently installed bronze reproduction of his most iconic painting "the company of frans banning cocq and willem van ruytenburch " dont worry if you have never heard of it the two dimensional original from the highlight of the nearby rijksmuseum is better known under its slight misnomer "the night watch " by the th century the canvas was so dimmed by dirt and varnish it appeared to depict a nocturnal scene later cleanings revealed that the party of civic guards portrayed against a mysteriously dark background an arch symbolizing the city walls was flooded in an intricate fusion of light shadow and colors but rembrandt probably never really meant to depict a bright sunny day one of his pupils van hoogstraeten wished his former teacher "would have kindled more lights in it " critical words yet van hoogstraeten recognized the paintings greatness "the night watch" was one of seven works the guards had commissioned from various artists and displayed in their guild house the kloveniersdoelen before they also found their current resting place in the rijksmuseum van hoogstraeten was certain that "the night watch" "will outlast all of its competitors because it is so painterly in thought so dashing in the effortless placement of the figures and so forceful that according to some in comparison all other militia pieces there in the kloveniersdoelen look like playing cards " standing in front the complex and gigantic painting feet inches by feet inches it is difficult to comprehend its concept and all its intricate details at once and it was originally even larger part of the canvas was cut off in to make the work fit on a wall in the amsterdam town hall group portraits of civic guards were often boring lineups of individuals in geometric rows not so in rembrandts setting here the guards are part of a drama with a supporting cast of extras including a drummer a dog and two girls added for theatrical effect the painting explodes in action literally so as we can see a muzzle flash and smoke from a gun fired directly behind the white feather of the lieutenants hat an older soldier to the right of the lieutenant blows the unexploded powder from his gun meaning we enter the scene just after he fired his musket rembrandt paints captain cocq and his men in motion their weapons askew as they get ready it all projects a sense of the importance of their mission cocq dressed in shining black his rank identified by his red sash and baton is captured as hes stepping toward the viewer his mouth open issuing orders to his lieutenant van ruytenburch the lieutenant in a dazzling golden outfit hasnt yet passed those orders on so the other soldiers are oblivious to them and remain preoccupied with their own preparations rembrandt captured a very particular moment just as this group of individuals is about to become a company ready to defend the city he manages to suggest the drama of possible combat without showing an actual battle let alone the enemy the works bold contrast between light and dark is a renaissance method chiaroscuro which rembrandt adapted perfected and turned into a signature technique he uses his light effects like spotlights in a modern theater production accentuating individual figures and thus conveying the idea of action the light focuses on the works central figures the captain and his lieutenant and more mysteriously on one of the extras a child like figure with a strangely old face shes probably an allegorical figure dressed in the guards heraldic colors what also sets rembrandt apart from his "competitors" is that in his portrait he sometimes ignores the faithful depiction of his models features to capture the spirit of the scene to make it look real he simply had to sacrifice a few of the faces one mans head for instance is half hidden by another guards outstretched arm one such obscured face may be that of rembrandt himself it is the telltale painters beret that suggests a cameo appearance by the master it was certainly not for lack of virtuosity that not all faces were faithfully portrayed just consider the exquisite detail of the gleaming metal the spectacular light effects and the intense portraits of those lucky or powerful enough such as cocq and van ruytenburch to be rendered for posterity the officers belonged to the citys ruling merchant class and rembrandt could not have obscured their faces for any artistic reason most mesmerizing might be rembrandts virtuoso use of perspective since the renaissance artists have learned how to create the illusion of space on flat surfaces the most difficult illusion is to reproduce long objects that point to the viewer using a technique called foreshortening rembrandts command of it is unparalleled cocqs outstretched hand and van ruytenburchs spear appear to break through the painting one is almost tempted to try to touch them rembrandts life neatly overlapped with the netherlands"golden age " when the dutch republic its commerce navy politics philosophy arts and sciences shaped the world when rembrandt finished "the night watch " new york was still new amsterdam whats striking is that everyone in this portrait is more than just a link in the chain of command yes the captain is giving orders which the men have to obey but this is an army of volunteers and ultimately these men are marching out because they want to not because they are told to although largely reduced to ceremonial functions by the time "the night watch" was painted the civic guard could still expect to be mobilized in time of danger as the th century dutch poet jan jansz starter wrote "when the land is in peril every citizen is a soldier " and so "the company of captain frans banning cocq and willem van ruytenburch" is more than a just great piece of art it not only captures the spirit of a military company but that of an era when dutch burghers were bearing arms to defend themselves as free men long before the concepts of civic duty or civic rights for that matter spread to the rest of europe mr
