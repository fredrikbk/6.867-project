the week ahead our take on coming events oil profit may fall but u s drivers help to keep it from hurting by russell gold the half dozen western companies that put the "big" in big oil are to report their first quarter earnings starting this coming week beginning with bp plc tuesday and followed by exxon mobil corp thursday profits are expected to be down about from a year earlier largely because of crude oil and natural gas prices that have eased a bit from their highs profits easily could have fallen more but big oil has received a major assist from u s drivers who have kept the pedal to the metal even as gasoline prices have climbed since the beginning of the year brisk demand in the u s combined with refinery outages has slashed gasoline inventory levels and is pushing pump prices over &# a gallon in some markets all this means that results from oil companies refining operations which turn crude oil into gasoline heating oil and diesel and jet fuel are likely to be strong bruce lanni an a g edwards energy analyst forecast that earnings from pumping oil and natural gas out of the ground would be down for the sector but earnings from refining and marketing the gasoline would be up this is good news for big oils investors because the companies exploration and production units which traditionally have provided the bulk of profits are being squeezed by a combination of lower commodity prices and higher costs to drill new wells perhaps even more threatening to future profitability foreign producer nations such as venezuela and algeria are demanding a bigger cut of the action as they negotiate new contracts or renegotiate old ones with western companies by contrast conditions for oil companies continue to improve on the refining side there has been "outrageously bullish" data on u s gasoline supplies according to barclays capital analysts paul horsnell and kevin norrish gasoline inventory has fallen for straight weeks including most of the first quarter barclays estimates a rise in gasoline demand in the first quarter compared with a year earlier gasoline prices also are being lifted by supply constraints several refinery problems in california texas and elsewhere held down production of gasoline and other refined products for example a fire knocked valero energy corp s barrel a day mckee refinery in sunray texas out of action for two months and it is only now coming back on line refinery profitability "is definitely going to be the only bright spot for the entire sector " says neil mcmahon a london based analyst at sanford c bernstein the first quarter traditionally generates strong margins because of seasonal factors he says of course this wont last forever u s drivers begin to slow down their fuel consumption once regular gasoline prices top &# a gallon which they did in early march this easing of demand coupled with the refinery restarts and a changing slate of available crude oil likely will mean refining profits will ease up on the accelerator in the second quarter the u s gas price meanwhile currently &# a gallon after a rapid climb is expected to pull back and average &# a gallon this summer economy fitting growth data into the unemployment puzzle by greg ip when the commerce department publishes first quarter growth estimates friday it will accentuate a puzzle with implications for interest rates growth and u s living standards with the economy growing so slowly why is unemployment falling explanations range from measurement problems to the peculiar behavior of construction jobs to the possibility that productivity growth is easing wall street estimates the economy grew at an annual rate in the first quarter the slowest in more than a year that would bring growth for the past four quarters down to a sluggish below most economists estimates of the economys potential growth rate which hovers around potential is the rate at which the economy can grow over the long term given growth in the work force and worker productivity a year of below potential growth ordinarily would push up unemployment because the economy isnt growing fast enough to employ all the new entrants to the work force instead the unemployment rate has fallen to in march from a year earlier the answer to this puzzle has huge implications for inflation and interest rates for the federal reserve the most troubling explanation is that potential growth is closer to than that may be because the work force is growing more slowly for demographic reasons or because productivity growth has slowed perhaps because companies are investing less in labor saving technology if so that would mean the economic slowdown has failed to create the spare economic capacity the fed is counting on to damp inflation indeed inflation excluding food and energy rose to in march from a year earlier although fed officials attribute that principally to the indirect effect of higher energy prices and to the behavior of rents slower productivity growth also would mean a slower advance in living standards fed gov frederic mishkin said friday that the recent slowdown in productivity growth is probably not fundamental but "a normal cyclical transition " he added "i also recognize a potential downside risk given the weakness in business investment " a more benign explanation for the puzzle is that growth may be underestimated theoretically gross domestic product the sum of total spending should equal gross domestic income the sum of all income but in the four quarters through december gdi grew percentage point faster than gdp on the other hand income may be overestimated a third explanation is that the link between growth and unemployment may have broken down in construction but remained intact in the rest of the economy housing starts have plunged in the past months but in the same period construction payrolls have risen that suggests productivity is plummeting in construction but growing solidly elsewhere fed officials suspect construction employment is bound to decline it is possible it already has but the data dont show it the payroll survey may not adequately capture many small unincorporated construction companies and doesnt cover the self employed the separate survey of households finds the unemployment rate among construction workers has risen to from in the past months but even that survey may undercount illegal workers politics candidates set for a showdown by jackie calmes try as presidential candidates might to control a campaigns "message " recent events have thrust a range of hot issues onto the nations front burners abortion rights thanks to this past weeks supreme court ruling gun control and mental health care in the wake of the virginia tech slaughter and race relations after shock jock don imuss firing and the collapse of the assault case against duke university lacrosse players these issues join the ever simmering one the war in iraq where this past weeks bombings have challenged bush administration claims that its new security strategy for baghdad is working "its a fascinating time to have a debate " says democratic consultant jenny backus and that is just what her partys presidential candidates are preparing for next thursday night in the early primary state of south carolina "its their first big showdown " says ms backus who is helping with preparations "you are going to see hints of how this race is going to play out down the line " the democratic debate at historically black south carolina state university in orangeburg will put the focus on the eight candidates ideas and positions after weeks of attention to both parties first "money primary " in that fund raising contest as measured by the candidates first quarter reports earlier this month illinois sen barack obama came out the winner among democrats for exceeding expectations to match the take of the partys front runner new york sen hillary clinton next weeks televised debate to be broadcast nationally p m edt on msnbc coincides with an expected showdown between the democratic led congress and president bush over a timetable for withdrawal from iraq which the democrats are attaching to a war spending measure for presidential candidates the two events "will force the race to quickly turn to substance " says democratic strategist stephanie cutter who is uncommitted on the headline issues abortion gun control health care race and iraq the differences between the democrats are relatively small compared with the chasms separating them from most republicans but democratic activists will be listening for variances in tone and emphasis when it comes to the newly prominent issues for example while liberals favor gun control others in the party have come to see it as a loser issue in the south the west and in rural districts several past events have brought the democrats together but next weeks debate will be the first at which they speak with the others on stage at the same time suggesting the potential for interplay nbc news anchor brian williams will moderate what will be the first of a series of debates running through this year up to next januarys early nominating contests for all the attention to the top tier contenders sens clinton and obama and former north carolina sen john edwards the coming debates are singular opportunities for the races media starved dark horses notably sens chris dodd of connecticut and joe biden of delaware and new mexico gov bill richardson there for at least a couple of hours they can compete on a level playing field and hope to score
