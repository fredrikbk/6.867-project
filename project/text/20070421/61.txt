opportunities to groom children family vacations are going hard core some parents are loading their kids onto hour flights to sub saharan africa or asia others are packing itineraries with extreme experiences sending their children rocketing down zip lines in the jungle or bicycling through rice paddies in thailand they are being inspired by or some say competing with other parents who are busy padding out their childrens passports kids are starting to feel the pressure too "everyone wants to one up each other " says carlos barroso a spokesman at the saint andrews school in boca raton fla mr barroso says that five years ago many of the vacations he heard about centered around classic european destinations like spain now he says children want to go to places like honduras cambodia and vietnam elliot baines age has been busy racking up his own globe trotting adventures hes already cleared customs in israel argentina uruguay mexico france and canada his parents corinne and keith baines of guttenberg n j say they believe the experiences are shaping elliots personality even at this early age for instance when elliot and a group of children were pretending to fly in their gymnastics class other youngsters said they were going to florida while elliot said he was en route to paris but not all trips go smoothly especially when they include extra long flights or a round of vaccinations confronted with too exotic surroundings some kids would rather eat at the nearest mcdonalds than sample the local cuisine for others the novelty of spotting lions and giraffes on safari in africa can wear off quickly "after you see the animals its not that exciting to see them again " says year old amanda johnston who traveled to tanzania with her parents and year old brother michael last christmas to prepare for swallowing the required anti malaria pills michael practiced with skittles kim johnston amandas mom says the safari was a fascinating experience for the family but she

brought a portable dvd player so the kids could watch "high school musical" and other movies on the plane when they got there they fought jet lag feeling wide awake at p m and the next day ate shrimp dumplings for breakfast climbed a lookout tower at a park near their hotel and watched people doing tai chi not everything centered around asian culture the bankers took their children to a hong kong outpost of toys "r" us where they purchased nintendo games and rubber balls decorated with disney characters some nights instead of venturing out for chinese food they stayed ensconced on the club level of the j w marriott madison banker says she didnt see many other american children her age in hong kong and she often noticed locals staring at her "the first couple of minutes i liked it but then it got really annoying " says madison who also passed on a chance to sample authentic shark fin soup ms banker says some friends thought it was crazy to spend &# on the trip and keep the girls out of school for a week but she doesnt agree "they learned more on this trip than they did in school " she says some children require coaxing the marcus children in needham mass were skeptical that costa rica would be as much fun as past family trips sam wanted to return to a theme park while year old caleb worried about alligators "i think my little one was a little concerned about being eaten

jungle sound effects the family also booked through adventures by disney one of the tour operators pushing into the market for family adventure travel the guided tour offered by walt disney co promises exotic excursions to places like the arenal volcano and the hidalgo hot springs but tempered with pizza parties and movie nights "the only thing i didnt like was the hiking because it went uphill and i was tired and a little bit cranky " says sam but zip lining which involves wearing a harness and zipping down a cable was a hit "we were going so fast that dead bugs flew in my face " figuring out just how extreme to go is one of the big challenges for families planning these trips psychologists say parents sometimes gloss over childrens anxieties about leaving home they recommend hearing the kids out and talking about the destination beforehand dr phil fischer the medical director of the childrens hospital at the mayo clinic in minnesota warns parents who are planning trips that their little ones might not remember things like pre columbian ruins when they grow up "are the parents taking the child because its good for the child or is it good for the parents " he says before heading off some experts recommend parents show their children realistic but not scary images of the country theyre visiting if a child is going to africa show him or her actual photos of the continent instead of watching "the lion king " travel companies trying to court the family business are taking steps to make it seem more routine shinde safari camp in botswana last year changed its minimum age limit to from a subtle difference but one that means elementary school kids can now go on safari uncharted outposts safari &amp travel co s "flying wildebeest feast" lets kids sleep in yurts and watch herds of wildebeest migrate across the serengeti rei adventures the travel arm of the outdoor outfitter says it may create a second families only east africa safari this year since the first one sold out to keep childrens attention theyve made shorter game drives and designed childrens meals with chicken fruit and vegetables instead of the exotic meats adults can order like warthog and impala when something goes wrong being in a remote area is a challenge for anyone but for parents traveling with little children it can be especially worrisome the grabowski family of jacksonville fla found that out when year old jacob started vomiting on the plane to costa rica they set off on the trip with plans to go whitewater rafting and watch an erupting volcano but just getting to the hotel became an ordeal after a hour bus ride and a minute boat ride jacob arrived weak and dehydrated by day three rod and julie grabowski debated going home talking in hushed tones so their three children couldnt hear they decided to stay after running into a group of american doctors who checked out the boy keeping jacob hydrated meant the family had to take a boat ride across a river four times for electrolyte drinks despite their ordeal mr grabowski says hed do it again "im a firm believer that you cant make a change in the world until youre aware of what the world is like " when he started feeling better jacob enjoyed doing the zip lines without help from his parents but he says the sound of the howler monkeys made him jump into his parents bed "they scared me when i first woke up " he says to prepare from a health standpoint doctors say trekking to remote spots can be risky if good medical care is hard to reach and being up close to wildlife carries inherent dangers in a incident an year old boy from the u s was killed by a hyena on safari in botswana even when trips involve staying inside a vehicle most travel experts recommend caution and dont suggest animal trips for children younger than trips to high elevations can be difficult because young children cant always monitor themselves for the signs of altitude sickness one precaution is buying a travel insurance policy that covers emergency medical evacuation some policies offer &# for emergency transportation while others offer &# million when traveling to a spot that requires shots pediatricians recommend consulting a doctor knowledgable in travel medicine to protect their families in case of emergency some parents take satellite phones first aid kits sometimes even their own iv tubing and since one of the most common ailments among children is diarrhea packing pedialyte can be a good idea travel agent rebecca falkenberry tells parents to keep the flight as short as possible and the activities fun for kids shes not recommending china or japan for example because just getting there takes nearly a full day of travel and many of the attractions are historical "i dont see china as being particularly kid friendly " says ms falkenberry an agent at hills travel in st petersburg fla lately shes pitching panama which is only a three hour flight from miami and has bird life beaches and chances to learn about the indigenous culture for some parents no spot on the globe is too remote stephanie forsman a new york city teacher took her sons year old will and year old jack to mali last year during their day trip in a dilapidated land rover with no radio or air conditioning the family bounced on dirt roads to spots that included the ancient city of timbuktu the boys enjoyed playing whiffle ball with village children and riding camels in the sahara jack says hes "proud" of himself for making it through the trip but will says the conditions took some getting used to "sleeping on the floor and just not eating a lot of food was the hardest part " says will who spent a night on a straw mat his least favorite meal "rice and peanut butter sauce "
