 plans lower costs bettter choices improvements to college savings plans and changes in the tax laws have made these state overseen programs the clear choice for most families saving for higher education in recent years as the assets in accounts have grown many states have negotiated with investment providers for lower fees and better investment choices the plans also received a boost from the pension protection act of which made permanent the federal tax benefits of s but did not extend some benefits of coverdell education savings accounts at the same time more families using custodial accounts to save for college are facing higher taxes with a recent expansion of the "kiddie tax " the plans named for the section of the internal revenue code under which they were created were first established in the s they took off in popularity after a tax law provided that money withdrawn from the plans to pay higher education expenses would be free of federal income tax without last years pension legislation that federal tax provision would have expired by "the pension protection act eliminated a lot of uncertainty " says jackie williams executive director of the ohio tuition trust authority and chairwoman of the college savings plans network an association of state plans families many of whom were using other savings vehicles have jumped into the market in the last year "were seeing people put money into accounts rather than custodial accounts " says john heywood a principal at vanguard group which has plans in states reflecting those inflows and also investment gains assets are likely to reach nearly &# billion at the end of this year estimates financial research corp in boston up from &# billion at the end of last year and &# billion at year end mutual funds are the primary investment options offered within plans during the last few years states "have taken to heart" earlier criticism of their offerings says kerry oboyle an analyst for chicago investment research firm morningstar states have eliminated some of the high priced plans and replaced more expensive investment providers with lower cost options "typically what youre seeing is better investments because of increased pressure from states " says brian boswell an analyst at financial research "the plans have evolved to the point where theyre much higher quality than even two or three years ago " indicative of a price war within the last year fidelity investments introduced aged based portfolios in california with annual expenses of just of assets a year the underlying holdings are all index funds indexing giant vanguard group followed with fee cuts to its nevada plan bringing half of the investment choices to that same expense level in march oppenheimerfunds became the new program manager in illinois introducing even lower fees that states bright start program offered directly to investors has index portfolios with fees ranging from to and actively managed portfolios ranging from to most plans now offer age based investments which automatically become more conservatively invested as the child gets older meanwhile some states have added or plan to add federally insured bank products to their lineup for conservative investors these offer guaranteed returns but may deliver lower returns over time than stock market investments investments in the ohio cd program which is available through fifth third bancorp more than tripled in the last year to over &# million other states that have or are working on cd options include virginia and arizona almost every state offers a plan and some offer more than one joe hurley founder of savingforcollege com an independent web site that provides information about plans says families should first consider their own states plans thats because more than states offer tax or other benefits to residents who invest in an in state plan states including maine kansas and pennsylvania have begun to pass on those benefits to residents who invest in out of state plans take time to compare investors should then compare the home state plan to other offerings in some cases they may decide to go with a better performing plan with lower costs from out of state thats what illinois resident mark merlet did early this year before that states new program was introduced he compared a number of plans for his two young sons and chose a t rowe price group plan in alaska because its performance and fees were better than the plan that was then available in illinois in going with the alaska plan mr merlet gave up a substantial deduction on his illinois return he says he would consider opening an illinois account in the future now that his home states program has lower fees consumers also need to decide whether they want a direct sold program or one distributed through brokers which would typically have higher fees many states offer both varieties its not just parents who are opening up accounts for their kids mr heywood of vanguard says grandparents also are using plans for estate planning and to ensure that money is set aside for grandchildren in a separate account available for college expenses he says about a quarter to a third of the assets are funded by grandparents some older people are making very large contributions for their grandkids under tax rules you can give up to &# this year to another individual without any federal tax consequences a couple can together give &# to one recipient but under the rules for plans you can give up to five years contributions at once up to &# per beneficiary or &# per beneficiary from a married couple without generating a taxable gift assuming that no other gift is made to the same person during the five year period saving for college even if you start early is intimidating "sometimes families decide theres no way ill meet that goal so i wont try " says ms williams of the college savings plans network instead she says "were trying to get people to invest and save in a systematic fashion " there are a number of online sites to help consumers compare plans two of the most popular ones are savingforcollege com and www collegesavings org which is coordinated by the college savings plans network
