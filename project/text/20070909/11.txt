love &amp money update soccer a shower and a dog time again to update readers on how various issues have played out this week ill revisit previous columns on a bathroom remodeling project an injury i sustained playing soccer and how much i was willing to spend on my dogs medical care earlier this year my wife amy and i decided to remodel our master bathroom the tub had broken in and wasnt reparable but instead of replacing the tub we replaced the entire bathroom which we never liked to begin with out went the stark look with lots of brass and white faux marble in came the warm asian theme with lots of slate and bamboo and mood lighting its a style i originally wrote not very common in my home state of louisiana and i wondered whether personal tastes should be tempered in a remodeling since it might affect resale at some point i wont know the answer to that question for a long time since our house isnt up for sale however another question has emerged was the cost worth the end result now let me say that we love our new bath it turned out even better than i envisioned when i designed it i love my new shower with the trio of body jets when the glassworker came to install the shower doors he walked into the bathroom and within seconds said "this might be the coolest bath ive ever been in " but we overspent our budget by about a large part of that came in the fine print of our contract the two sentences noting that "all material necessary for electrical plumbing tile and flooring" were excluded from the quote and that the "total price may change due to the time and labor required for specific material " i read that originally and had no worries i was buying all the material myself however i wasnt thinking about supplies needed for the internal plumbing or for laying a ton of slate i was stunned by the final cost amy thought that while the "end result is gorgeous the cost was too high did we really need all those jets in the shower and i would have gone with a simpler faucet system there are ways to cut costs but we made the decision to spend on what we did " by "we" she means me i took control of this project and amy said little because i was so forceful in my vision "i just went along with it " she says "if i had to do it all over again though i would not spend this much money " neither would i actually so i see this experience as a lesson learned when it comes to remodeling and our kitchen is next never equate your spouses silence with acceptance your passion about a project may overwhelm your partner into submission in early july i was injured in a soccer game and nearly had to have emergency surgery on my leg fortunately i ended up in an immobilizing leg brace for a while and then had to endure a month of physical therapy as i wrote in a column amy wanted me to hang up my goalie gloves for good because of her concerns that since i play with the abandon of a year old a future injury particularly a blow to my head or hands could damage my career as a writer and my ability to support my family i asked in that column what say spouses have over hobbies that potentially affect the familys livelihood for readers who saw the weekly love &amp money video that amy and i posted online a few weeks ago viewable at wsj com loveandmoney youll already know how i answered that question i am returning to the soccer field ive stepped down in class skipping division in my over mens league for a spot on a new team in division that concession however means nothing to amy as was also clear to anybody who watched the video and saw how annoyed she was with me as she told me "its not what division you play in its how you play the game you only know how to play one way and thats all out i dont want you coming to me and complaining the next time you get hurt " at the risk of sounding callous it isnt her happiness thats in question its mine as i noted in the original column soccer has been my passion since about sixth grade im as eager today to get out on the field every week as i was as a kid i see no reason to walk away from the only athletic activity i pursue while i am still physically capable of playing amy and i didnt necessarily discuss my return as we would typically do with other issues i knew her stance she knew mine and there was no common ground either i quit or i didnt i didnt finally a note about my siberian husky misha she has died several years ago i asked in a column if because of rising medical costs there comes a point at which a family pet is just another animal and you stop writing checks at that time misha then years old was having health issues related to a couple of tumors over the ensuing years amy and i shelled out thousands of dollars to have tumors removed in mishas eye leg and abdomen thats money that we could have applied to college costs or retirement savings or any of a number of other financial priorities but at the end of the day misha was my buddy and i never gave a second thought to costs of her care when she fell ill again our vet told us it was ok not to pursue further treatment misha was approaching at that point so one painful night for her she collapsed unable to move i lay next to her and tried to comfort her while she howled and whined we fell asleep together and i awoke early in the morning to find that she had died lying on my arm her ashes sit in a wooden box on my desk
