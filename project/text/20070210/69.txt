payless stores in suburban areas and better malls by the time payless regained independence in a spinoff it was among the biggest footwear retailers in the world its longstanding ties to factories in china helped it keep costs down women looking for sensible work shoes and kids buying sneakers were its core customers but payless was ill prepared for wal marts onslaught the big retailer was also adept at squeezing chinese producers for low cost products its stores were often in the same areas as payless and many people preferred buying their shoes along with groceries and toys in one place sales dropped between fiscal and fiscal payless tapped mr rubel in in part for his experience developing the womens and handbag collections at cole haan he says he decided a dramatic shakeup was in order "nothing was off the plate " he says the company even considered changing its name to something other than payless the name stayed but assumptions about the companys target customer didnt instead of just women with children who wanted a low price on an easy to wear shoe the company also set its sights on a new shopper a year old woman as interested in fashion trends as in prices the shift was first reflected in advertising traditional payless campaigns played up bargains or featured endorsers such as star jones reynolds a former co host of the television talk show "the view " much of the ad budget was spent on daytime television and newspaper inserts payless tried another approach in an advertising campaign that began at the end of a few months before a new line of fashion focused shoes hit stores in the ad a young girl leaves her mothers party and slips into payless shoes before attending her own fun event underneath were the words "look again payless " the ad ran on

says payless was skittish about her winter shoe collection which included a wedge shoe with faux suede and gold piping "they said our customer wont understand this theyll be intimidated " she recalls in the end the line sold well the company says one style of the wedge shoe in brown sold nearly of half of its stock in nearly payless stores during the first week ms poretzky recently extended her contract to and is working on adding watches handbags and sunglasses to her abaete for payless collection molly kline a year old paralegal who recently visited the fifth avenue store in manhattan says

lauder to help get trendy products to stores faster payless said friday it will shut down its distribution center in topeka in the summer of and instead use a new facility in california and one east of the mississippi closing the topeka center will cost to jobs there the company said the plans will cut earnings this year and next year but start adding to the bottom line in it predicted merchandising meetings are getting a facelift mr rubel says executives used to make decisions on what styles to buy by looking through binders of sales data "there was very little product in the room and very little storytelling there was no talk of customers " mr rubel says now a broader range of employees meets for a week each quarter with shoes handbags and other accessories in front of them to judge payless is trying to include more brands in its stores not just in womens shoes but also in athletic and childrens shoes last fall it introduced a &# spalding running shoe that it says uses the same kind of technology as higher priced shoes it recently signed deals with walt disney co to sell childrens shoes featuring disney characters and with nike inc for womens sneakers to be sold under a subsidiary brand called tailwind the stores themselves are undergoing a makeover mr rubel knew he had to lay new carpet paint the walls and screw in better light fixtures at stores that hadnt had an update in more than a decade he started replacing year old cash registers he also hired retail design firm callison to help dream up two new store formats for the company last august the company introduced what it calls a fashion lab format which has expanded to locations including the store on fifth avenue in manhattan the goal was to highlight the new products in a shopping environment similar to upscale specialty stores the fronts of the stores are open with display racks highlighting the seasons trends for instance matching bags trimmed with colored patent leather polka dots or other details hang near the shoes one difference from high end retailers many racks are still self service another format called "hot zone " is a hybrid of the old and new stores payless rolled it out in locations by the end of last year it calls for an open front area similar to the fashion lab but keeps more products on the traditional self service racks david mann a retail analyst at johnson rice &amp co says the hot zone stores are posting sales increases in the mid to high single digit range and seeing more traffic paula stafford a principal at callison who worked on the redesigned stores says its important to back up the fashion focused advertising with a fresh look in stores that will impress customers "if you make this big promise and you dont deliver on it in the store you lose their trust " she says
