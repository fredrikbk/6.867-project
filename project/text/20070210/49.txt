pursuits books soldier birder writer faker the meinertzhagen mystery by brian garfield potomac pages &# among historys missed opportunities the most regrettable of all must be the one that richard meinertzhagen a british army colonel let slip through his fingers in berlin on june according to his diary on that day he paid his third and last visit to hitler with whom he pleaded as before on behalf of germanys jews having smuggled a pistol into the chancellery meinertzhagen could easily have taken out the fuhrer but he lost his nerve at the last moment if this dramatic scenario of failed derring do seems improbable it is worthwhile to remember that meinertzhagen was perhaps the one person who might have brought it off an ardent zionist though not jewish himself he also happened to be a founder of the anglo german fellowship which promoted stronger business ties between britain and germany thus he had access to hitler and he was known to pack heat even at london dinner parties so the pistol bit is plausible but in fact the tale is nonsense as is a great deal else that meinertzhagen set down in his diaries parts of which were published to acclaim in the s and s that at least is the contention of brian garfield in "the meinertzhagen mystery " mr garfield builds an entertainingly damning case against meinertzhagen showing him to be a self aggrandizing fraud though meinertzhagen died at age in england in his fabrications have only recently come to light one reason for the delay is that meinertzhagen was no walter mitty a milquetoast who merely dreamed of greatness meinertzhagen could rightly lay claim to a range of accomplishments his zionism for instance was real enough to get a square in jerusalem named after him as chief political officer in palestine during the british mandate he argued vociferously for jewish interests at a time when most british officials leaned toward the arabs he counted among his friends the likes of winston churchill t e lawrence and chaim weizmann in fact he attended the paris peace conference as part of the british delegation on the side he was a respected ornithologist who wrote definitive books in his field not least he exuded a piquant and slightly sinister charm it did not hurt that he stood a trim foot that won over ian fleming who saw him as a type and many others apparently this was not enough meinertzhagen amassed one of the largest bird specimen collections in the world but as reported in the new yorker magazine last year many of his prize "skins" birds stuffed for study rather than display turned out to be falsely labeled or stolen from other collections a disaster it seems for ornithology itself mr garfield writes "it has taken researchers many years and vast expenditures of labor and they still havent finished the job to redraw maps of bird distributions in order to undo meinertzhagens misinformation " mr garfield would appear to have caught meinertzhagen making other swerves into bogusness from his claim to have attempted a rescue of the russian czar and his family in to his insistence that on a visit to israel in at age he had picked up a rifle and joined a battle to help save the nascent state perhaps most damaging to his legend is mr garfields demolition of the story that first won him fame the celebrated "haversack ruse" of still considered a classic of military deception it supposedly involved meinertzhagen alone in the negev desert in palestine during the war drawing fire from ottoman soldiers by pretending to be hurt and dropping in his escape faked top secret plans these tricked the turks into diverting troops the legend went making beersheba and gaza vulnerable to british forces according to mr garfield who refers to meinertzhagen by his initials "the ruse was devised but not by rm the bag was dropped but not by rm it had no effect on the enemys plans or decisions " shredding his way through both meinertzhagens four million word diary and the layers of sensational anecdote that grew up around him mr garfield exposes countless self flattering inflations from meinertzhagens claim to own darwins pipe to his boasts of having casually killed any number of men with his bare hands the only murder mr garfield suspects meinertzhagen of actually having committed is one that the colonel denied namely that of his second wife annie who died in from a gunshot to the head that was ruled accidental a best selling mystery writer mr garfield is clearly drawn to meinertzhagen less for punitive reasons than for the pleasures of detection he admits that meinertzhagen "used to be one of my heroes " but he appears not to have an ax to grind he seems to have been consumed by the quest to pick apart his subjects elaborate self mythology in his extensive acknowledgments he thanks dozens of meinertzhagen debunkers including a researcher affiliated with the smithsonian institution who "continues to investigate and clarify the meinertzhagen bird frauds" and a publisher who withdrew a fast selling reprint of meinertzhagens "kenya diary" in the early s because mr garfield reports he "had suddenly come to believe it was full of lies " with such a subject the biographers dilemma is that he must be scrupulous in his debunkings without suffocating the reader in detail while mr garfield does occasionally lay the detail on with a trowel he manages both to prosecute meinertzhagen convincingly and by means of his lively prose to keep us engaged meinertzhagen was a person of genuine distinction he made many non fraudulent contributions to ornithology "he did his best to defend zionisms interests in the paris peace congress of " mr garfield observes and a handbook he wrote as an intelligence officer during world war i remains "to this day one of military intelligences most useful texts " why precisely this man felt the need to embellish his life story so extravagantly is despite mr garfields admirable labors destined to remain a mystery mr downing is the co editor of "parnassus poetry in review "
