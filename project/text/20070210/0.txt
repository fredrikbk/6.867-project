ask encore focus on retirement how would be executors should prepare for role my year old mother lives in oregon and has drawn up a "do it yourself" will naming me as the executor the will has been notarized and witnessed by her bank i am a resident of north carolina when my mother passes away can i be the executor since im not an oregon resident or does it make any difference what else should i know about being her executor beverly y maize weaverville n c oregon has no restrictions on out of state executors but youre wise to check because some states do says mary randolph an attorney author of "the executors guide" and vice president of editorial at nolo a berkeley calif publisher of self help legal information the rules vary from state to state with some requiring an out of state executor to post a bond or appoint a local agent to whom the probate court would send official papers florida for example generally allows out of state executors only when they are children parents and other close relatives of the deceased person some states including florida refer to executors as "personal representatives " your mother may want to think about naming an executor a little closer to home ms randolph says "because it might be easier for someone whos close to take care of things but everyones situation is different " do it yourself wills can make sense for some older adults she adds "at the end of life you shed some belongings people might not have a house anymore " nor are they likely to have dependent children in need of guardians or trusts the book or software you use to create your own will should highlight state specific rules "a will shouldnt be a complicated document its best to keep it simple most decisions are personal ones that dont require a lot of legal expertise " there can be one big complicating factor blended families "you have to think about being fair to your spouse and your children from a previous marriage one of the best ways to prevent animosity is to let everyone know what you are planning in advance " ms randolph says "with grown kids if they know what theyre getting in advance they cant get so angry later " if having that sort of conversation makes you uneasy she adds "you could leave a letter if you think people arent going to understand or be surprised by something but its better to be honest when youre alive " if you know in advance that youre going to be someones executor you can take steps to make sure things go smoothly when the time comes one question to ask is the will up to date and has the person made his or her wishes clear sometimes widows still have a will leaving everything to their now deceased husbands or there are no clear directions in the will about who gets what "if some relative comes in and says she always wanted me to have that chair as the executor youre going to have to sort it out " ms randolph says "you cant just let people cart things out of the house " in the role of executor you might suggest that the will maker title assets to avoid probate when it doesnt take much effort for example bank accounts can be made into "payable on death " or pod accounts "otherwise you might wind up with a bunch of paperwork for things that arent particularly valuable " ms randolph says and if there is something of value in the estate such as a collection of miniature trains ask for suggestions on where to get an appraisal "even if it stays in the family you need to get things appraised for probate " she says "its all just really practical stuff not fancy legal stuff "
