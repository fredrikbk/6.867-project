solar power heats up state and federal incentives help lure consumers special to the wsj the race is on to install solar energy panels in american homes thanks in part to generous government incentives such as californias &# billion solar initiative which was launched in january only about one thirtieth of of all the electricity produced in the u s is generated by solar power but recent technological advances and a continued decline in the price of solar power systems are prompting homeowners to ask if this renewable energy source is worth the investment other states with promising residential solar markets include new jersey new york arizona and texas analysts say these states are becoming more attractive through generous state rebates incentives offered by utilities willing to buy back solar power from residents in order to meet state renewable energy requirements and natural elements such as the days of available sunshine on the federal level homeowners are eligible for a one year tax credit for of the cost of a residential solar power system up to &# through but do residential solar power systems also called photovoltaic or pv systems make economic sense the answer hinges on how much and how fast solar energy can cut a homeowners utility bills and on how long it takes to pay off the initial investment to add solar panels to a home consumers considering solar power tend to focus on the upfront costs solar energy systems for homes begin around &# but can go higher depending on the size of a house and the amount of power generated says rhone resch president of the washington based solar energy industries association which represents manufacturers in new jersey a kilowatt residential solar power system is estimated to cost &# after a state rebate of &# and a &# federal tax credit the out of pocket cost to the homeowner is &# that will provide an estimated annual savings of &# on electricity bills the payback period for such a system is roughly years at current utility rates according to estimates provided by the new jersey board of public utilities the payback period can drop to about years if a system owner sold &# a year in solar renewable energy certificates which are doled out each time a solar energy system generates kilowatts of power to electric suppliers which are required to generate a certain portion of their power from renewable energy sources a key factor in any calculus is the cost of electricity rates for a homeowner says jeffrey bencik an analyst with jefferies &amp co in new york retail electricity prices can vary from a low of eight cents a kilowatt hour in some parts of the u s to as high as cents in san diego he says in some areas residents have seen rates rise as much as in recent years bp plc offers a cost calculator on its web site www bp com that uses a homeowners zip code and monthly electric bill to calculate what it would cost to install a system and the rebates that are available in a report released in january cibc world markets a unit of canadian imperial bank of commerce looked at the likely payback for residential solar power systems installed in california and considered the cost of solar energy systems government sponsored incentive programs and electric rates the returns it says werent "stellar " cibc estimates that the cost to install a system in california is about &# per watt but after a &# per watt state rebate and a &# federal tax credit the net cost drops to &# per watt this means that buying a solar power system can yield homeowners a return on their investment it would take about years to pay the initial investment though the payback period can vary depending on peak electricity rates in the region the reports authors said in an interview many states also feature "net metering" programs which allow homeowners to sell extra power they produce back to their local utilities potentially lowering the payback period ideally the payback period needs to get down to the "lower double digits or the high single digits" to attract more investors says jeff osborne an analyst at cibc and co author of the report rebates and incentives vary by state new jersey offers homeowners as much as in rebates toward the purchase price and installation cost of a solar energy system the rebates used to be as high as but increased interest led the state to reduce them in order to accommodate more applications says doyle siddell a spokesman for the new jersey board of public utilities at the end of the third quarter of nearly residential and commercial solar power systems had been installed under new jerseys program compared with for all of according to the state in the first year of the states clean energy program there were only six solar power installations the increase "has been drastic and dramatic " says mr siddell in california close to pv systems were connected to the power grid as of the middle of last year representing about megawatts of power according to a report by the northern california solar energy association a nonprofit group the california energy commission processed pv incentives between and or an average of a month from january through june the commission processed incentives or about a month the report said the state has made a big solar wager gov arnold schwarzenegger last year signed legislation funding the installation of one million rooftop solar panels for homes businesses and schools these systems will generate megawatts of power for the state and eliminate three million tons of greenhouse gas emissions the governor said here comes the sun states are adding incentives for homeowners to install solar power panels but does it make sense financially solar energy systems for homes begin around &# but can easily go higher depending on the size of a house and the amount of power generated a key factor in any calculus is the cost of ones electricity rates retail electricity prices can vary from a low of eight cents a kilowatt hour to as high as cents in some areas residents have seen rates rise as much as in recent years
