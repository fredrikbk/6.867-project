is this the next president of france on sexiest list and populist fast track candidate reflects new distaste for old guard paris during her campaign to become frances first woman president segolene royal has been photographed in a turquoise bikini appeared in a gay magazine with a naked man on the cover and suspended a top campaign aide for poking fun at her longtime companion the year old mother of four has praised china for the efficiency of its justice system and criticized the most sacred of french cows the hour workweek many senior members of her socialist party arent sure whether to call ms royals campaign a bold or amateurish foray into the hallowed halls of french presidential politics even party boss francois hollande is often irked and for him its personal as well as political he is the father of ms royals children though the two never married and had his own designs on the french presidency "i should have been the candidate " he said in an interview "but i thought if segolene has more of a chance i wont stand in her way " when ms royal last year suggested ordinary citizens should oversee elected officials to improve french democracy mr hollande balked at his partners populist bent "i told her dont go around saying this why are you doing it " he recalled in an interview the french public had a different reaction he acknowledged "they all came to her defense " since she first hinted at a run for the presidency in a french gossip magazine paris match in ms royals crowd pleasing proposals and glamorous looks have transformed her from a back bench socialist politician into one of the two front runners for frances highest office "its the french people who have given me legitimacy " ms royal said during a recent car ride between campaign stops "after the paris match article there was a popular uprising the french people wanted me " her rapid rise speaks to the growing disconnect in france and throughout much of europe between an aging generation of leaders and voters who feel their economic and social concerns are going unheard by basing her campaign on a simple proposition of listening to the people she has tapped into a sense of public disaffection rooted particularly in frances inability to create jobs that is prompting voters to reach for something new and antipolitical even if they dont know quite what it is "i cant say how things will change " says nasser ledrac a year old university student who was handing out leaflets for ms royal in the poor paris suburb of bondy late last year "what i like about her is that she doesnt hesitate to shake things up " a recent series of personal and diplomatic gaffes has left ms royal trailing her main rival interior minister nicolas sarkozy by several percentage points in the latest polls mr sarkozy too is claiming rebel status within his party despite being a longtime force within the administration of current president jacques chirac with the first round of elections on april the race remains tight ms royal has come this far by tossing ideology out the window and by selling her personality instead of her beliefs a phenomenon rarely seen in continental europe an attractive brunette who favors white skirt suits made by french designer paule ka ms royal often has dodged policy debates asked during the car ride to discuss her record as current president of frances poitou charentes region ms royal snapped "havent you talked to my chief of staff about that " despite a year career in the socialist party she portrays herself as an outsider promising a break with the past she beat out elder statesmen known as "elephants" for the nomination and has all but ditched the partys official platform for her own version due to be unveiled this sunday her platform she says will be based largely on ideas gathered from some town hall meetings with voters smaller coffeehouse sessions dubbed "cafe segolene " and million visitors to her campaign web site in speeches she often evokes her own struggle between maternity and a career and recently noted how democracy is like amour the more there is the more it grows she said she recently decorated the hallway of socialist party headquarters in paris with red roses last summer she was voted the worlds sixth sexiest woman in a poll by the french edition of fhm mens magazine behind angelina jolie and ahead of elizabeth hurley so far ms royals popular appeal has given her the upper hand with her party and her partner mr hollande though flummoxed by some of her remarks most of the socialist elite concede shes their best shot at winning back power after years of mr chiracs conservative rule during this time france has not resolved key economic problems such as high unemployment among young people the increasing cost of a generous social welfare system and tensions in the fast growing immigrant population "i had no idea she would rise so fast " says mr hollande her approach isnt foolproof and her success is by no means guaranteed among her recent foreign policy gaffes was a diplomatic flap with canadas government after ms royal suggested last month that she supported sovereignty for quebec "shes very intelligent but she doesnt have a geopolitical grounding " said french economist and scholar jacques attali who first hired her as a presidential aide in in an interview late last year business leaders are concerned about her economic rhetoric so far including plans to give unions more power she rails against stock options "greedy profits" and "wild capitalism " and is likely to propose that french citizens abroad start to pay some taxes at home while managers are glad she has hinted at making the maximum hour workweek more expandable they would like her to explain how "what has she said about job contracts we havent heard anything " says paul hermelin the chief executive of the large french consulting and information technology company capgemini group at the same time strains in her not so private relationship with mr hollande the party leader have highlighted wider tensions between ms royal and the socialists over who is in charge "they think theyre professionals and that shes not " says zaki laidi a professor at the institute detudes politiques who has published a book called "emerging from social pessimism " ms royal dressed down her partner in public last month after he said the socialists wanted to raise income taxes for people who earn more than euros per month roughly &# a year after the spat a top aide to ms royal said on television that her only flaw was "her partner " she suspended the aide for a month but the episode fueled rumors in the french press that the couple have effectively split and are only keeping up appearances given a chance to clarify their personal relationship in the interview late last year mr hollande said only "whether we are a couple or were not is irrelevant " ms royal has declined to discuss the question the french also are puzzling over something else how after years in mr hollandes shadow ms royal has snatched away the life her partner had mapped out for himself and what consequences this might have on a socialist administration according to a poll last month in le parisien newspaper of french voters feel the couples respective roles in the party are unclear ms royals desire to break from the establishment dates back to her childhood in interviews ms royal who was born in the then french colony of senegal where she lived until she was eight has described a strict upbringing dominated by her father jacques a devoutly catholic conservative army colonel the fourth of eight children the young marie segolene and her two sisters were taught to tend to the home so they could find suitable husbands "i understood at an early age that i didnt want to end up like the other women at my house " ms royal said on french radio last summer marie segolenes good grades gained her entrance to the institut detudes politiques in paris an elite university she fled to the french capital ditched the "marie" in her name and spent the rest of her life rebelling against the patriarchal conservative values embodied by her father colleagues say ms royal inherited his exacting style however "she likes to control all decisions that are taken " says poitiers mayor and fellow socialist jacques santrot describing ms royals reign as regional president other socialists were shocked recently when she sent out detailed instructions on how to run a town hall meeting including photos on how to organize seats and a directive to invite times the holding capacity of the hall mr hollande says shes simply a strong willed thinker "shes not afraid of conflict shes not afraid of telling you youre wrong or if she doesnt like you of not shaking your hand " he says "she doesnt care about protocol " ms royal and mr hollande met at the elite graduate school that breeds french heads of state the ecole nationale dadministration the two started dating and mr hollande already a socialist activist introduced her to left wing political circles mr attali then a special adviser to socialist president francois mitterrand discovered the couple and hired them to work at the elysee frances presidential palace in mr hollande was the rising star he had graduated near the top of his class and joined president mitterrands council of economic advisers ms royal landed the less prominent portfolio of health environmental and youth issues yet mr attali was impressed by the young womans raw determination even compared to her partner "he has a sense of humor and would have succeeded in any other job " he recalls "she has no humor at all for her politics is vital and nothing has ever been unattainable " mr hollande agrees "shes tougher than i am " while at the elysee ms royal had the couples first two children thomas in and clemence in she sowed the seeds of a political career centered on family issues colleagues say ms royal believes children not couples form the family nucleus ms royal would go home to feed the children and then return to the elysee palace to work friends recall writing a book called "the baby channel surfers are fed up " ms royal decried violence in childrens television shows at the elysee ms royal befriended sophie bouchet petersen a feminist and left wing intellectual who remains the candidates sounding board "segolene was always a feminist before being a socialist " says ms bouchet petersen ms royals path diverged from mr hollandes he was promoted to spokesman for two socialist governments and was elected to the national assembly she remained at the elysee "our political lives have always been separate " says mr hollande "ive always said to her you try your lot without me " ms royals first big break came in when she ran for the national assembly in a small normally conservative constituency in the western poitou charentes region and won then during a brief stint as environmental affairs minister she won broader notice when she had flora her fourth child with mr hollande in she invited photographers into her hospital room to snap photos of her and the baby the stunt brought a normally private moment even for public women into french living rooms "she made herself known as a young woman who was accepting her maternity and talking about it openly while working " recalls mr hollande "this wasnt an ordinary thing in france " a year after floras birth ms royal was re elected in poitou charentes she wasnt rewarded with the cabinet post she wanted in when socialist lionel jospin became prime minister during a period of power sharing under mr chirac ms royals main female rival in her party martine aubry got the key labor ministry ms royal was given the less prominent post of minister for education and then for family affairs she thought she deserved more said mr hollande who became the socialist partys national secretary a key political post ms royal used her new position to introduce paternity leave and free distribution of the morning after pill in high schools friends and colleagues say she also began plotting her revenge for the slight a bid for frances highest office her launching pad came seven years later in when she ran for president of poitou charentes and again defeating forecasts she won "she became a symbol of victory for the left " says mr hollande "people started talking about her and she was on the covers of french magazines " before she adopted her current polished look he quips "she wasnt wearing white yet " in her new post ms royal revamped her appearance she cut her hair into a stylish bob wore heels and abandoned trousers for skirts that just skim the knee she summoned old friends ms bouchet petersen the feminist from the elysee and jean luc fulachier her former chief of staff at the family affairs ministry ms bouchet petersen handled the theory mr fulachier the practice and poitou charentes became the testing ground for democracy royal style ms royal has tried to give the people of poitou charentes a bigger role in government for example students parents and teachers decide via secret ballot how to spend of the regional budget for high schools last year their votes led to more garbage cans new school bell tones and a vegetable garden according to regional documents ms royal introduced financial aid for entrepreneurs and local "citizen juries " whereby residents are chosen randomly to evaluate laws for their community the measures have been hugely popular "she has applied the ideas of the people which is good " says rachel merlet a year old mother selected to a "citizen jury" in the town of cerizay in december ms royals outsider positioning drew socialists who felt marginalized one was gilbert roger mayor of the parisian suburb of bondy one of the mostly immigrant communities hit by violent rioting in october during the riots the socialist party agreed to imposing a curfew on bondy which mr roger thought would be ineffective "they didnt even ask me what i thought " recalls mr roger "there was a total gap between the political apparatchik and the reality of the land " in january ms royal went to chile to visit socialist presidential hopeful michelle bachelet accompanied by patrick menucci a former car salesman and restaurateur who was a socialist city councilman in marseilles the trip won big publicity for ms royal partly thanks to newspapers criticizing her wearing heels to a chilean slum it also won her a close aide in the boisterous mr menucci last year when a rival of ms royals was reported as saying "if she wins who will look after the children " mr menucci berated him publicly "im seen as a macho kind of man so it meant a lot to her that i defended her " he adds last april the center right government faced a crisis students and unions took to the streets to protest a labor reform law making it easier to fire young hires the law was aimed at making frances rigid job market more flexible but youths decried it as a path to insecurity the protests became a symbol of economic and social malaise in france particularly over the jobless rate among people under mr chirac eventually was forced to withdraw the law amid the protests ms royals promises to listen to peoples problems and her call for a "just order" resonated with voters "she understood the state of the people " says mr hollande "she portrayed an image that she could protect them from their fear of the future " by the summer mr hollande realized that he wouldnt have a chance himself against ms royal in the party primaries "i could have gone against her but the french people wouldnt have understood " in the november primaries ms royal trounced a former prime minister and finance minister speaking after her official nomination she evoked french revolution era feminist olympe de gouges and thanked socialists for choosing a woman candidate she also quoted her chilean friend by then elected president herself "as michelle bachelet says nothing would be possible without men " before the speech ms royal stood before the pink backdrop of the auditorium stage for several minutes basking in the applause now cracks are starting to appear in the royal campaign during a trip to beirut late last year ms royal was criticized at home for not immediately reacting when a hezbollah lawmaker compared israels former occupation of lebanon to that of the nazis in world war ii france ms royal aides claimed the remark was omitted by their translator and they brushed off the affair "if the television images of her today are as good as those yesterday itll be fine " francois rebsamen one of ms royals campaign managers reassured an aide on the phone shortly after the incident but the gaffes have been adding up in china last month ms royal said france could learn from the speed of the justice system in china a country often criticized for its human rights record days after her remarks on quebec sovereignty a famous french comedian called ms royal pretending to be quebecs prime minister during the call which he recorded and then aired on french radio he compared her comments to supporting independence for the french mediterranean island of corsica where sovereignty also is a divisive issue ms royal joked that the french wouldnt mind but then hurriedly added "dont repeat that it will create another incident in france " it did prompting derision from the sarkozy camp ms royal has acknowledged "a moment of tension" in the campaign she and aides are pinning much hope on sundays speech but bracing for more turbulence "i knew the battle would be tough " she said this week "and we havent seen everything yet "
