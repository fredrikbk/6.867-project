the fda and congress must heed the voices of patients and doctors in regard to your feb editorial "orthopedists for vioxx" concerning access to prescription drugs i am writing on behalf of the million americans including children who suffer from arthritis they perhaps more than any other group have been adversely affected by the withdrawal of vioxx and their future is at stake in the current debate about reform at fda and access to medication your editorial called upon members of congress to listen to what doctors have to say as they consider legislation on access to treatment the arthritis foundation urges congress and the fda to also listen to the voice of the patients the people whose very lives are at risk in this debate it is vital that federal agencies advocacy groups health care professionals and the public work together to address this problem more than a million people will develop arthritis this year and for many of these people treatment options are already very limited we must ensure that patients are given the opportunity to choose among the widest possible range of effective medications to both manage their pain and reduce their risk of disability john h klippel m d president and ceo arthritis foundation atlanta your editorial described the ever more binding regulations that directly affect an ever more burdened thus slower and more costly approval process in contrast the fda is putting in place rather than new layers of bureaucracy the pilot of a post marketing process that can spot problems of common drugs like vioxx that are initially only tested on less than idealized subjects and then released to be given to tens of millions of patients who are often elderly or chronically ill with many co drug therapies and co diseases without this process heres what happens when a rare major complication or death occurs in this high risk population of hundreds of thousands of people there are the usual "shock and awe" headlines that lead to company not fda in most cases drug withdrawal we dont need more regulations we need to understand what doctors best diagnose the problem and cure the cause we cannot rid drugs of all risks but we can determine who will be at what risk and ask the informed physician and patient to proceed accordingly sanford h roth m d ceo arizona research and education paradise valley ariz the writer was former fda arthritis advisory committee member and liaison consultant
