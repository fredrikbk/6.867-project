harvard expected to tap faust to lead female president may bring calm after time of strife harvard university seeking to close a period of management tumult is expected to choose faculty member drew gilpin faust as the first woman to lead the year old institution people familiar with the matter say the selection of a new president comes at a difficult time for americas richest university which is trying to stay at the forefront of higher education while coping with the aftermath of a faculty rebellion that led to lawrence summerss departure from the top post a year ago challengers to harvards preeminence such as stanford university and princeton university have eroded its lead in fund raising and its reputation in undergraduate education mr summers spearheaded plans for a massive facilities expansion and curricular changes aimed at a greater emphasis on the sciences but rankled faculty in the humanities who didnt subscribe to his agenda ms fausts nomination by an internal search committee is expected to be submitted to harvards board of overseers for ratification tomorrow she is a respected civil war historian and her presidency would mark a symbolic turning point for both harvard and higher education it would put women at the helm of half of the eight schools in the ivy league including princeton rhode islands brown university and the university of pennsylvania women also run the massachusetts institute of technology and the university of michigan overall the percentage of female college presidents reached last year from in according to a study to be released monday by the american council on education which noted that womens numbers remain rarer among elite research institutions news of ms fausts probable selection was reported friday in the harvard crimson and the boston globe ms faust dean of harvards radcliffe institute for advanced study also represents a striking departure from mr summers the former u s treasury secretary colleagues and friends describe ms faust years old as a diplomatic manager who has negotiated through a difficult time of change at radcliffe which was once harvards womens college but which has transformed into a research institute under the universitys umbrella judith rodin a former president of penn who was the first female president in the ivy league said ms faust had to deal with many "bristling" alumnae at radcliffe showing a "kind of dexterity " "shes got a great gift for bringing people together and consensus building " says ms rodin who now president of the rockefeller foundation spoke with the harvard search committee about ms faust mr summers turned to ms faust for help after the uproar over his suggestion that innate gender differences help explain the absence of women in the upper echelons of the sciences and mathematics tapping her to lead a committee to study the issue a person familiar with the matter called her "a calming influence" who moved quickly for effective changes but many are sure to note that ms fausts current administrative experience is leading an institute that hosts fellowships for professors in various disciplines with a budget of nearly &# million by contrast harvard has a &# billion budget a &# billion endowment students and non medical faculty in addition many at harvard felt mr summers was rightfully challenging the faculty to bring change to a hidebound institution that many fear is losing ground to schools such as princeton u s news and world report magazine recently ranked the new jersey school no among colleges surpassing harvard the two previously had been tied at the same time stanford with its ties to northern californias nearby silicon valley has become a more potent challenger to harvards traditional role as higher educations biggest fund raiser harvards ability to lead other schools to change has also been dimmed in some eyes in the fall harvard announced it was doing away with early admissions saying the practice favors affluent applicants though many felt others would followed suit most except for princeton and the university of virginia have stuck with the practice some have worried that various fiefdoms at harvard make it ungovernable leaving the new president in a less powerful position to effect change "one would hope that it would not be an appointment of pacification " said ruth wisse a professor of yiddish and comparative literature who supported mr summers "this should be someone who could be a strong leader and take on the faculty of arts and sciences when that would be required " peter gomes a professor of christian morals at harvard divinity school and harvard college who teaches courses in harvard history has publicly pushed for an outsider and said the search committee may have moved too quickly while voicing "great respect" for ms faust he said "the risk is that they havent looked widely enough " among others the search committee considered steven hyman a neurobiologist and harvards provost elena kagan dean of harvard law school and thomas cech ph d president of the howard hughes medical institute and a nobel prize winning chemist according to people familiar with the matter
