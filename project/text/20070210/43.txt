pursuits books a boy soldiers story a long way gone by ishmael beah farrar straus &amp giroux pages &# by age ishmael beah a child soldier in sierra leone in west africa was an accomplished killer who showed neither remorse nor pity even when committing terrible acts of violence in "a long way gone " he writes about how this happened losing his innocence and descending into savagery but then slowly and painfully regaining his humanity mr beah now speaks in a distinctive voice and he tells an important story hundreds of thousands of child soldiers fight in dozens of nasty conflicts in africa and elsewhere and while journalists and the occasional novelist may write about them "a long way gone" is a first person account when rebels in sierra leones civil war razed his familys village in january mr beah his older brother and two friends were miles away waiting to perform their rap music and dance act at a talent show mr beah then never saw his home or other members of his family again he and some other boys went on the run fleeing the mayhem all around them but paying a price as they did "every time people come at us with the intention of killing us i close my eyes and wait for death " mr beah remembers his friend saidu saying "even though i am still alive i feel like each time i accept death part of me dies very soon i will completely die and all that will be left is my empty body walking with you it will be quieter than i am " it is permissible to wonder whether mr beah is accurately recalling events and people and what they said perhaps to forestall questions like this the author says that he has a "photographic memory that enables me to remember details of the day to day moments of my life indelibly " the boys stop running when they reach a village occupied by sierra leones army but then they are given ak s fed drugs and sent out to kill rebels "lets go soldiers the holiday is over " a corporal says one of the soldiers is another is when they walk their rifles drag on the ground the child soldier life that mr beah describes is harrowing he slits a prisoners throat so efficiently that he is promoted to junior lieutenant wounded in the foot he retaliates by shooting six prisoners in their feet he watches them suffer for an entire day then shoots them in the head "so that they would stop crying " when he does he looks into their faces and finds their "somber eyes irritating " and so on horror after horror mr beahs recountings are unadorned believable and unsparing as he tells us about a conflict we never knew much about sierra leones civil war attracted little attention in the u s until the state department proudly announced in that jesse jackson and american diplomats had brokered a peace agreement between the revolutionary united front ruf and sierra leones central government the peace agreement however forced the government to hand over control of the nations diamond mines to the ruf and its murderous patron charles taylor of neighboring liberia moreover it did not stop the violence and the ruf continued its favorite tactic amputating the arms or legs of recalcitrant villagers and of boy soldiers who tried to escape the clinton administration presumably embarrassed reversed itself and made the breathtaking claim that it had not been responsible for brokering the peace agreement "a long way gone" makes clear that there were monsters on the governments side as well as on the rufs and that as always in african wars innocents were trapped between them it also makes clear that boy soldiers on all sides are victims as much as perpetrators and that they are not necessarily beyond redemption when mr beah turns he becomes in effect a unicef ward and begins the journey that allows him to escape his past obviously the process is not easy the teenage mr beah is belligerent angry suspicious and plagued by migraines and nightmares but kind people repeatedly tell him that the ordeal he has been through is not his fault and that in time his life will get better and it does mr beah is one of the lucky ones he moves to new york and finds a loving family he goes to high school graduates from college and of course writes a book it is good to know that his life is turning out well although it is sobering to think that few other child soldiers will ever be as fortunate mr corry a senior editor of the american spectator is the author of "my times adventures in the news trade " he has reported from west africa
