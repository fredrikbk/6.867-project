pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink the subtle sorts of sake in october kenichi yoshida was in new york where the japan sake exporters association was throwing a bash to promote its wares to americans yoshida was a literary scholar known for his translations of shakespeare into japanese and the son of japans first postwar prime minister he was also a high living eccentric and a noted connoisseur of japans national drink japanese newspapers would refer to yoshida approvingly as a "celebrated writer and drunkard " with his excellent if quirky english and his enthusiasm for the goods he would seem to have been the perfect sake pitchman only he wasnt at all happy with how his countrymen were trying to sell the stuff the sake exporters it seemed were struggling to get americans to drink sake straight thus that night in new york the sake salary men were serving up sake martinis sake manhattans and the awful sounding sake collins instead taking the podium to deliver a speech yoshida proceeded to denounce the cocktails as a downright "fraud " partygoers were already so deep in their saketinis few paid yoshida any mind perhaps the reason that the sake exporters had to resort to the cocktail scheme is that the "rice wine" of the day was rarely first rate even now the bulk of production comprises relatively cheap and utilitarian varieties known as "triple sake" and "standard sake" the equivalent of what a boxed red wine is to a carneros pinot noir i suspect that no small number of first time sake drinkers have been put off by the pungent scent of licorice and locker room socks not uncommon in the cheap stuff the better sakes come in a variety of styles but generally the more highly polished the rice used to make the sake the higher the sakes grade the varieties of rice developed for sake concentrate the purest starch in the core of the grain by milling away the outer layers the part that might contribute sour smells and bitter flavors is removed sake made from rice ground down to or less of the original grain is called ginjo or "special brew " if half or more of the grain is polished away the sake can be called daiginjo most daiginjo sakes are also junmai or "pure rice sake " made using only rice water a mold called koji and yeast back in the s there wasnt much of a market for daiginjo sake in japan let alone in the u s but over the past few decades many of japans or so sake breweries have turned to high end craft brewing to appeal to sophisticated drinkers in japan and to add luster to their more quotidian products that has meant an avalanche of ginjo and daiginjo sakes many of which have made it to america i recently bought eight daiginjo sakes to see what difference a little rice polishing makes and found they were definitely worth the fuss and they are a world away from the everyday sakes as they were drunk a century ago lafcadio hearn was a brit born in greece who worked as a reporter in the states he sailed for japan in and once there he soon went native hearns writings on life in japan were widely published and one of his letters to a friend gives us a glimpse of what sake was like at the time "it is extremely deceiving it looks like lemonade but it is heavy as sherry " he wrote "there is no liquor in the world upon which a man becomes so quickly intoxicated " hearn described his sake buzz as "a soft pleasant luminous exhilaration everything becomes brighter happier lighter then you get very sleepy " no doubt the sakes i tried were neither lemonade yellow nor sherry heavy the striking thing about daiginjo sakes is not their flavor but rather their near absence of flavor and color limpid in the extreme they are elusive to the nose and light on the tongue of the bunch i tried the kuromatsu hakushika daiginjo had perhaps the most flavor and a nice traditional sour sweet sake taste it was but the difference was a subtle one and that was the case with all the daiginjos i tried their defining characteristics were mere hints the "divine droplets" sake from takasago had a noticeable tang to it but just noticeable nothing pronounced the hoyo kura no hana was ever so slightly vinous my favorite of the lot was kirin zan which emphasized the elegant nothingness of daiginjo the nose had an almost impossibly delicate fruitiness and in the mouth the sake was sweet in the way mountain springwater can seem sweet i plan to buy another of kirin zans cerulean bottles come spring the japanese custom of contemplating cherry blossoms is best practiced reclining against a tree with a cup of sake when tokyo was digging its subways they found an abundance of old sake cups and flasks deep under an historic cherry grove i have an aged weeping cherry in my backyard that doesnt have many years left a few months from now i plan to enjoy what blossoms it can muster in style email me at eric felten wsj com sampling sakes very good delicious kirin zan daiginjo &# delicate fruity fragrance with a taste like mountain spring water kuromatsu hakushika "white deer" &# traditional but subtle sour sweet sake taste very good takasago "divine droplets" &# distinguished by a barely noticeable tang hoyo kura no hana "fair maiden" &# faint hints of dry white wine
