pursuits leisure &amp arts new york new york rudy vs hillary according to polls hillary clinton holds an early and significant lead among democratic voters compared with for barack obama in a fox news poll days ago she is of course the killer fund raiser of the race with one of her contributors crowing this week that shell raise more money than all the other candidates combined so lets call her the likely democratic nominee even though mr obama hasnt even announced yet on the republican side its giuliani time with fox news putting him at among gop voters and john mccain coming in second with he hasnt announced yet either but this week he filed all the papers so at the moment and with keen awareness that not a vote has been cast it is possible to say the state of new york is poised to become the home of both major party presidential candidates this is not unprecedented but it is unusual it happened in when new york was the home of the hero of oyster bay president theodore roosevelt and reluctant democratic nominee alton parker a judge on new yorks court of appeals who carried only the solid south it happened again in new york in when teddys cousin franklin sought a fourth term against the bland and mustachioed thomas dewey the new york district attorney unforgettably labeled by teddys daughter the chilly and amusing alice roosevelt longworth "the little man on the wedding cake " in both the democratic and republican nominees were from ohio sen warren harding who seemed boring but proved sprightly landslided democrat james cox a dreamy wilsonian who thought america wished to hear more about the league of nations illinois was the first state to enjoy dual nominees when republican abraham lincoln beat stephen douglas the official but not the only democratic candidate that year right now new york our beloved overtaxed postindustrial state is the red hot center of the political map these are exciting times with rival gangs roaming uptown and down looking for money and support the styles of the two tongs are different hillarys people are cool and give away nothing theyre all business theyre like a captain from an army about to crush you why should he bother to charm you rudys people are more like old style new yorkers they are pugnacious and if you express reservations about their guy they give you the chin they dont make the case or try to persuade they tilt their chins up and try to argue you into conceding he can win as if they think its all on them and if they can win the conversation he will win the nomination the city as we say in the state is full of people whove met both candidates know them had dealings with them the other night i bumped into a veteran journalist who talked about iran the journalist said "i wrote hillary and gave her good advice but she didnt write back " i went to the american israel public affairs committee speech mrs clinton gave last week and the higher geopolitical meanings of the event aside the crowd ate dinner as she spoke and didnt seem unduly impressed theyd seen her before and would see her again what a boon the race is for the tabloid press and the mainstream media if new yorks at the center theyre at the center the tabloids had fun with the formal debut via a harpers bazaar interview of judi giuliani the post famously front paged the kiss a posed and mildly creepy smooch it was a bigger story in new york than the mad astronaut and her recent reflections that the presidential race is "a journey" they can make "together " it left one observer that would be me saying "oh no please no " in politics in the world of political life the proper attitude of a third wife is modesty mrs clinton also has an interesting spouse mr giuliani and mrs clinton seem in a way to represent two different new yorks two different templates of what it is to be a new yorker rudy as mayor an embattled pol bickering with reporters trying to bait him a western european ethnic from the outer boroughs with a slight hunch to his shoulders he does the chin too or did his people probably got it from him he was the government prosecutor son of a brooklyn guy a republican in a democratic town a man who had ideas convictions about how to cut crime and stop the long slide and who had to move entire establishments and if theres one thing new york knows how to make its establishments to get his way and he pretty much did winning progress and enmity along the way on he was a bum on he was a man and on he was a hero life can change shift upend in an instant mrs clinton is not ethnic or outer borough shes suburban middle class she was raised in a handsome town in illinois and lived an adulthood in arkansas and washington she founded the original war room is called "the warrior" by some of her staff has been fierce and combative in private but obscures it all now under clouds of pink scarves she literally hides the chin both candidates seem now almost jarringly happy as if theyve arrived and its good which they have and it is but good fortune distances they are both rich now and both have spent the past six years being lauded and praised in both it seems to have softened their edges the easy ready smile well see if its softened their heads but it is significant that in mrs clintons case for the past years from through which is to say throughout most almost all of her adulthood her view of america and of american life came through the tinted window of a limousine now the view is mostly through the tinted window of an suv from first lady of arkansas through first lady of the united states to u s senator her life has been eased and cosseted by staff by aides drivers cooks secret service etc her life has been lived within a motorcade and so she didnt have to worry about crime the cost of things the culture status incubates rudy giuliani was fighting a deterioration she didnt have to face thats a big difference its the difference between the new yorker in the subway and the wall street titan in the town car
