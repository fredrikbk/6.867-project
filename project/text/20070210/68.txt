slippery legal situation in holland in regard to daniel schwammenthals "practically dutch in the heart of sin city" de gustibus taste page weekend journal feb i believe mr schwammenthal has not yet been in holland long enough to realize that the veneer of pragmatism and good sense in the dutch policy of "gedogen" is covering up something rather ugly one problem with the practice of officially "tolerating" things that were formally illegal is that it destroys the rule of law when toleration is practiced people know that the law says one thing but the reality is very different but just what the real rules are is not clear at all when something is "tolerated " what are the boundaries of that toleration and who has the authority to set or change them how can a democracy function when the actual rules as opposed to the rules in the lawbooks are made up on the fly by people and processes not governed by any law or constitution your editorials rightly criticize politicians who pretend to have strong beliefs but are unwilling to act on them the dutch situation is a perfect example politicians want the benefit of "allowing" something consumption of cannabis for example without going through the trouble of voting on a law to make it legal perish the thought that they would have to go on record on such a matter a closely related problem is that the toleration of cannabis does not eliminate drug crime at all the reason is simple cannabis is not legal and its "toleration" only applies to the retail side so the "coffee shop" operator is in the absurd situation of being allowed to sell at retail a product he cannot legally buy wholesale his store is tolerated by the authorities but his loading dock is a criminal enterprise similarly growers are explicitly considered and treated as criminals and they act as criminals too stealing power for their lights for example and causing fire hazards in the process paul koning new boston n h had mr schwammenthals gaze fallen on the prostitutes displaying themselves in the windows of the houses in amsterdams special red light district he would have realized that none of these women are dutch the are either russian eastern european or latin american it seems likely that various ethnic mafias may be involved in the transport and employment of these sex workers mr schwammenthals observation that the dutch are in the process of closing down perhaps of the windows that are used as a front for money laundering supports this view the dutch seem to largely inhabit a post "cesspool of sin" mentality in which they realize that for the most part having a good time by going to a brothel or smoking pot at a cafe is simply not worth it and leave this commerce to the tourists this is similar to what happened in denmark after all pornography except child pornography was legalized after a brief initial spike fueled by the forbidden fruit becoming suddenly available consumption of pornography greatly decreased the danes got over it and their porn industry exists almost exclusively for export michael g brautigam cincinnati
