the week ahead our take on coming events technology with iphone release fast approaching apple and cisco near dispute settlement by nick wingfield the great iphone dust up between apple inc and cisco systems inc could be coming to an end as soon as next week on jan days after apple had introduced a new cellphone dubbed the iphone networking equipment titan cisco sued its high tech neighbor up the road in silicon valley cisco alleged that apple had infringed on a trademark that cisco holds for the term iphone while both sides initially seemed to dig in their heels apple called ciscos lawsuit "silly" and said it was confident it would win in court they eventually sat down at the bargaining table and agreed to extend a deadline by which apple had to respond to ciscos lawsuit in a federal court in san francisco meanwhile the parties tried to hash out a deal to resolve their dispute apples new deadline to respond to the cisco lawsuit is thursday while both sides could agree to extend the deadline again cisco and apple are signaling an eagerness to put the fight behind them soon "we hope to resolve this issue amicably " says john noh a cisco spokesman apple cupertino calif unveiled its iphone last month at the macworld conference in san francisco wowing the digerati with its touch screen controls dazzling color display and music playing capabilities cisco though has held the iphone trademark since when it acquired a company called infogear technology that made an internet connected telephone cisco san jose calif freshened up its own iphone product line last spring with a handful of gadgets that use voice over internet protocol or voip technology to transmit phone calls over the net its widely believed that apple has a big incentive to come to an agreement with cisco well before its own iphone product goes on sale in the u s this june "settlement appears to be in the interest of both sides " says alan fisch an intellectual property attorney at kaye scholer llp in washington d c cisco executives in the past have said they arent after money from apple but rather want apple to agree to make its products "interoperate" or be compatible with cisco products both sides say interoperability is one of the issues theyre discussing now coincidentally apple chief executive steve jobs made big news this past week on the interoperability front when he released an essay encouraging the music industry to consider dropping its insistence that online tune sellers like apple place copy protection software on their songs the lack of a common standard for copy protection software is one thing that prevents music products from different companies like cisco and apple from working together ciscos linksys division for instance makes products that play music via a wireless home network through a living room stereo system while the songs are stored on a personal computer interoperability with apple products could allow the linksys devices to play say songs purchased through apples itunes store if music companies eventually heed the call from mr jobs to ditch copy protection cisco and apple products may play well together after all corporate governance coke likely to hit mark for board payday by betsy mckay nearly a year after coca cola co adopted a radical plan under which board members would be compensated only if the beverage behemoth hit key

"equity share units" that they are awarded each year championed by former director warren buffett who stepped down from cokes board last year the plan is meant to align the interests of the board more closely with those of shareholders and executives greeted with skepticism by some compensation experts who worried in part that it could induce directors to focus too much on short term gains similar plans havent been widely adopted but so far it seems to be working for cokes star studded board which includes internet mogul barry diller investment banker herbert a allen and james d robinson iii the former head of american express co after posting a mere rise in earnings per share in coke appears likely to hit its mark in according to a survey of analysts by thomson financial coke will have to post similar results in both and for its directors to see a dime but the companys anticipated results show that a turnaround under chairman and chief executive officer neville isdell appears to be gathering momentum growth in markets outside the u s last year has helped the company to offset declining sales of soda domestically where aging baby boomers and fickle younger consumers are eschewing big soda brands for funky teas coffees juices and bottled water while coke does have offerings in those categories carbonated soft drinks account for about of its global volume and theyre more profitable than noncarbonated brands soda sales rose globally in the third quarter more than they had in any quarter since an increase in annual earnings per share is admittedly modest companies in

there is a good chance he will be closed for the lunar new year and most of his staff will be packed onto trains heading back to their hometowns you think traffic is tough around thanksgiving try getting stuck among the million chinese taking trains around the weeklong lunar new year holiday which this year starts on feb every year there is a flood of humanity around the lunar new year as migrant workers in the cities who labor in the factories construction and service industries that are powering chinas astonishing growth scramble to find a way home on top of all the rail passengers the government estimates that two billion trips are taken by road around the weeklong holiday this huge annual migration offers an insight into many of the strengths weaknesses and worries that underlie chinas transformation into a global economic superpower one change the government isnt raising rail ticket prices as it usually does around the holiday period in part because of complaints about price gouging and a growing recognition of the hardships the migrants face the vast majority of migrants going home will be packing chinas trains in journeys that can easily last two days after years of neglect the chinese government is spending billions of dollars on improving rail lines and is promising more comfortable and faster trips on new bullet trains beijing intends to spend trillion yuan or about &# billion between now and the riders may have hao jinsong to thank for the decision not to raise ticket prices a graduate student at the china university of politics and laws mr hao sued the ministry of railways to get it to stop raising ticket prices during the holiday rush he claimed that prices were raised without the required public hearing but he also sought to show that people could use the court system to seek redress "we needed a test case we found a target and then went for it " mr hao said the problem of prices is particularly acute for the migrants who depend on trains which are a cheaper alternative to buses and planes whose ticket prices are simply unattainable for many people the salaries of construction workers are sometimes withheld by foremen who fear they wont come back after the holiday this year the government organized a special train to carry home people who work on olympics projects in beijing all that mass movement leaves a big gap
