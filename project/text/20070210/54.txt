rivets " says andy mcgrew owner of mr mcgroovys which offers free blueprints for the homemade pirate ships and other projects the next time you visit a buzzy web site see a funny video clip online or read an unusual take on the news chances are you owe it to someone like mr worthington a new generation of hidden influencers is taking root online fueled by a growing love affair among web sites with letting users vote on their favorite submissions these sites are the next wave in the social networking craze popularized by myspace and facebook digg is one of the most prominent of these sites which are variously labeled social bookmarking or social news others include reddit com recently purchased by conde nast del icio us bought by yahoo newsvine com and stumbleupon com netscape relaunched last june with a similar format the opinions of these key users have implications for advertisers shelling out money for internet ads trend watchers trying to understand whats cool among young people and companies whose products or services get plucked for notice its even sparking a new form of payola as marketers try to buy votes its also giving rise to an obsessive subculture of ordinary but surprisingly influential people who usually without pay and purely for the thrill of it are trolling cyberspace for news and ideas to share with their network they include people like year old smaran dayal a high school student who submits some stories a week on digg and has become a go to source there for news about apple diane put a nutritionist in idyllwild calif known to netscape users by her handle "idyll " has become a major source for health related news on that site which is viewed by more than million people daily a reddit user known for scoping out striking images on the web amardeep sahota recently helped drive about unique visitors to one amateur photographers site most sites are based on a voting model members look around the web for interesting items such as video clips blog entries or news articles a member then writes a catchy description and posts it along with a link to the material on the site in hopes that other members find it just as interesting and show their approval with an electronic thumbs up vote items that receive enough votes rise in the rankings and appear on the front page which can be seen by hundreds of thousands of people when an item is submitted by a popular or influential member one whose postings are closely followed by fellow members it can have a much better shot at making the front page marketers and the merely curious have long tried to pin down how phenomena from beanie babies to cardio boxing get popular sites like reddit and digg now raise the possibility that you can home in on the specific people who generated the early or in some cases the first buzz but identifying these influencers is complicated to find the key influencers the wall street journal analyzed more than submissions across six major sites with the help of dapper a company that designs software to track information published on the web this analysis sifted through snapshots of the sites home pages every minutes over three weeks the data included which users posted the submissions and the number of votes each received from fellow users we then contacted scores of individual users to find which ones are tracked by the wider community though it can take hundreds or thousands of votes to make it onto the hot list at these sites the journals analysis found that a substantial number of submissions originated with a handful of users at digg which has registered users people were responsible for submitting one third of postings on the home page at netscape com a single user named "stoners" in real life computer programmer ed southwood of dayton ohio was behind fully stories over the two week period or of all stories that reached the most popular list netscape which gained fame with its namesake browser is now owned by time warners aol unit and operates a news site on reddit one of the most influential users is year old adam fuhrer at his desktop computer in his parents home in the quiet northern toronto suburb of thornhill mr fuhrer monitors more than web sites looking for news on criminal justice software releases and the toronto maple leafs his favorite hockey team when microsoft launched its vista operating system this year he submitted stories that discussed its security flaws and price tag which attracted approving votes from more than users besides an electric guitar and an ipod "my favorite thing in the whole world is my computer " says mr fuhrer who has lately also been studying for his bar mitzvah in june in spite of a content filter his parents use to block him from viewing certain sites including youtube he has managed to consistently make it onto the list of reddits highest performers "i watch my sons page while im at work " says his father gerald fuhrer and "gush about his achievements to my co workers " pulling back the curtain on these hidden influencers is a controversial subject many of these sites say it can heighten the risk of payola and attempts to game the system last summer some bloggers posted accusations that a cabal of top digg users were banding together to vote for one anothers stories thereby boosting their profiles payola schemes depend on the voting system these sites employ some marketing companies promise clients they can get a client front page exposure on digg or one of the other social bookmarking sites in exchange for a fee according to marketers to deliver on that promise the company then recruits members at the site offering to pay them for thumbs up votes on the posting that links to the client if enough paid off members all vote for that posting it could theoretically push the clients link onto the front where it receives wide exposure digg and other sites say their systems have safeguards that can detect concerted attempts ground zero of this cat and mouse game is the headquarters of digg in san franciscos potrero hill neighborhood here dedicated site monitors track every submission that comes in looking for restricted content and evidence of users colluding to drive up an entrys popularity or plugging services for pay jay adelson diggs year old co founder and chief executive says refining the algorithms that analyze users votes and determines a submissions popularity rank is a constant process last week digg took a more dramatic step pulling down the user rankings that had served as a prod to people on the site to post their best findings "it became a target for those trying to manipulate the system " mr adelson says on the other side of this battle are companies like user submitter com the site promises to pay users "easy money" for "digging " or voting on links on digg com its offer is simple pay user submitter &# for every "digg " or vote you request and in turn itll pay a user users can earn cents for every three "diggs " and user submitter pockets the difference at any given time a top submission on digg has anywhere from to votes meaning a successful campaign could cost thousands of dollars when contacted by the journal representatives of user submitter com declined to identify themselves but said the company has successfully placed items on diggs home page on behalf of its clients in december digg user karim yergaliyev was banned from the site after submitting a link to jetnumbers an international phone service provider other users who said they were offered compensation by the company to plug it but didnt accept had previously notified digg of the offer mr yergaliyev who uses the name "supernova" online says he didnt actually receive any compensation from the company digg agreed to reinstate him jetnumbers says it offered a free trial to digg users in exchange for a mention on the site "its my job to get our name out " says nathan schorr business development manager for the company though these sites are undeniably popular theres ongoing debate about whether the model of filtering content through voting ultimately will pose a challenge to traditional media some say the voting site approach can more quickly distill whats important for busy readers but critics say its simply an aggregate of borrowed content and links to a relatively small pool of blogs and while they sometimes drive traffic to web sites that are spotlighted the spike can be temporary "influence implies that i can change your mind and theyre not necessarily doing that " says duncan watts a professor of sociology at columbia university for year old henry wang the job of finding compelling information for diggs million monthly users starts when tennis practice ends mr wang a senior at illinois mathematics and science academy in aurora ill says he spends three hours a day doing his digg work and highlighted his success on the site at one point he was ranked the no user on his college applications after first posting some duds three months after joining he says he finally figured out what works focus primarily on science and technology fields that a bigger percentage of digg users are naturally interested in but throw in the occasional oddball story to stand out his link to a site that explains the formula behind randomness in computer science earned more than diggs and a spot on the front page his next post a visual comparison of the diameter between objects protons vs electrons among others also rose quickly last year mr wang took his skills to netscape which pays him &# a month to do what he was already doing for free elsewhere its his first paying job mr wang says he doesnt talk about the gig with his friends very often because he doesnt want to rub it in "theyre working long hours at starbucks and im at the computer all day " one site that says it has a lot to thank henry wang for is famster com similar to myspace com but aimed primarily at families famster allows people to set up their own sites to keep track of everything from photos to family trees and blog entries when it went live on august of last year the site says it had only a trickle of visitors five days later mr wang posted a link to it on digg with the comment "i cant believe that this site isnt widely known even with all its features share photos stream videos create a blog upload files keep track of rss feeds all in flash and for free ridiculous " more than users voted on the link driving traffic to famster up to unique visitors per day
