cross country help for the intrepid san antonio the word "sacrifice " like the word "war " lends itself to political and rhetorical excess there are symbolic sacrifices in metaphorical wars then there are genuine sacrifices in real wars the latter was on display last week at fort sam houston in san antonio as representatives of a grateful nation dedicated the center for the intrepid and two new fisher houses to those wounded in the global war on terror the center is a square foot state of the art physical rehabilitation facility the fisher houses are homes away from home for the families of military personnel being treated at military medical centers and veterans administration hospitals the center and the houses were built entirely with private funds more than americans contributed &# million to construct the center for the intrepid thousands more donated the &# million needed to build the new fisher houses for brooke army medical center home to the sole army burn center and one of two army amputee care centers bamc has treated more than service members injured in afghanistan and iraq only walter reed army medical center in washington d c has cared for more casualties as the dedication ceremonies commenced wounded military personnel walked staggered and rolled beneath the drawn swords of an honor guard to take their seats in the front rows one of them was staff sgt jon arnold garcia staff sgt arnold garcia of the st airborne division lost the lower half of his right leg to a grenade when insurgents struck his convoy in hawija iraq not yet fitted with a prosthesis staff sgt arnold garcia was on crutches as the joint service color guard of the military district of washington presented colors staff sgt arnold garcia rose to attention without crutches on one leg next to him was a soldier i knew staff sgt steve bosson of the st cavalry division is a bear of a man looking at his frame you wouldnt know hes been through three years of surgeries prosthetic fittings and rehabilitation staff sgt bosson lost the lower half of his left leg to a grenade in an ambush west of baghdad at moments during the national anthem staff sgt arnold garcia would teeter a bit to keep his balance he would occasionally touch the elbow of his right arm drawn up in salute to the shoulder of staff sgt bosson it was a fleeting yet moving portrait of genuine sacrifice representatives of the intrepid fallen heroes fund and the fisher house foundation spoke at the ceremony as did secretary of veterans affairs jim nicholson and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen peter pace so did sens hillary clinton and john mccain the speakers however were merely paying tribute the true dignitaries were the wounded warriors who sat in the front rows mr mccains comments were stately "what you have done for us we can never do for you " he told the injured "but we are mindful of that distinction and humbled by it and our appreciation for your service demands us all to do what we can in less trying circumstances to help keep this nation a place and an idea worthy of the hardships danger and sacrifices you have born for us so valiantly " some critics have questioned the propriety of individuals and businesses rather than the government building the center for the intrepid and the fisher houses democratic strategist paul begala told my colleague scott huddleston "it is an obscenity that a government that can find billions in no bid contracts for halliburton and trillions in tax cuts for the wealthy cannot find a few million dollars to bind up the wounds of its heroes " mr begala is of course correct that the government has an inviolable obligation to care for military personnel and veterans but do the thanks of citizens end with the filing of tax returns arnold fisher the philanthropic force behind the center who saw it through from groundbreaking to completion in fewer than months provided a rhetorical answer "why would we want our government to do that which we could do ourselves in half the time at half the cost and twice the quality " everywhere one turned were examples of men and women inspired to give of their own accord to show gratitude worthy of the sacrifice of the citizen soldiers of the volunteer military john melia is a marine veteran who was severely wounded in a helicopter crash in somalia in after his recuperation at bamc he began the wounded warrior project a nonprofit organization that places veterans at the bedside of wounded military personnel to support them and their families kirk bauer is an army veteran who lost a leg in a grenade attack in vietnam in a year later he began working with disabled sports usa a nonprofit that provides adaptive sports opportunities for individuals military or civilian with permanent physical disabilities today mr bauer is executive director of the organization which now has chapters in states janis roznowski is a flight attendant for american airlines after volunteering on a government chartered flight bringing troops home from the middle east ms roznowski felt compelled to follow up on the needs of the wounded she started operation comfort a nonprofit organization that plans recreational projects and events for convalescing personnel and their families "were not done yet " mr fisher told me in the gleaming lobby of the center for the intrepid with more combat troops headed for iraq and a spring offensive expected from the taliban in afghanistan the ranks of the wounded will grow have these men and women earned the governments commitment to provide them the finest care available of course do they also deserve beyond the payment of taxes and vapid talk about national sacrifice some measure of support from the american people "we can never give them back what they lost " said richard santulli chairman and ceo of netjets and chairman of the board of trustees of the intrepid fallen heroes fund "but it is our duty as americans to give them back as much normalcy in their lives as we can that will be the best legacy this center can provide " mr gurwitz is a member of the editorial board of the san antonio express news
