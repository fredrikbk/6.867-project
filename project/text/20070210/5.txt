breakingviews financial insight goldman sachss war chest buyout firms may resist &# billion fund but fees and returns are alluring goldman sachs group has always said its strategy in the buyout business is to help clients make deals happen by co investing alongside them not competing against them that doesnt entirely square with its decision to raise &# billion for the third biggest fund ever its not clear why goldman needs such awesome firepower if its just nibbling up bits of equity to help clients finance deals so why is the bank raising such a megafund first because it can and the potential fees are enormous more on this later and second because doing so gives it enormous clout in the private equity playground do deals with us it can say to buyout shops or we might help finance your rivals and hey if no one wants to talk to us we always have the firepower to go it alone but why risk the ire of buyout firms such as blackstone group and texas pacific group which are the biggest fee generators on wall street after all they wont just mind the competition theyll also be irked that so much money has been taken out of the market at a time when they may also want to raise capital the reason is clear goldman sachs group has done staggeringly well from private equity investing goldmans private equity funds have produced as much as a gross internal rate of return since of course ruffling the feathers of the buyout industry isnt risk free as a strategy some buyout firms may not be keen to take goldmans equity they may also starve the firm of merger assignments goldman must figure its ideas and access to corporate chiefs are strong enough that the key firms will keep coming back and if they dont well whats a few lost advisory mandates compared with super returns on &# billion of cash its the fees stupid and its those returns that answer a broader question why are so many private equity firms from goldman to blackstone to providence equity partners raising mega buyout funds many say they are complying with the wishes of investors who want to put huge chunks of capital to work buying big undervalued companies maybe but the fees these funds will generate for their managers offer an even greater motivation consider the compensation structure of a fund like the one goldman is building typically it will take about years for that money to be deployed and then returned to investors now lets assume the fund chalks up a annual return on its investments the fund manager may take a fifth of those profits each year in the final years of the fund after meeting certain minimum return hurdles but wait theres more private equity firms also charge management fees of as much as on the money they put to work for a &# billion fund that would be &# million a year most firms also charge transaction fees for putting together their deals though a chunk of this is returned to investors in the funds still the numbers are staggering blackstone charged a &# million fee for completing the &# billion takeover of equity office properties trust using a model developed by private equity manager a trade publication it is possible to project how these taxes on investors money add up over years a fund like the one goldman is launching could throw off a huge &# billion to its managers thats equal to about of the assets committed to the fund to be fair the big pension funds and institutional investors that commit their money to buyout funds are happy to pay fees like these if they can double their money as has been the case historically yet with so much money chasing outsize returns its not clear that will be the case in the future nicole lee and lauren silva this column is written by breakingviews com an online financial commentary site
