the weekend interview with greg waldorf the matchmaker pasadena calif roughly ten days before valentines day i find myself at the headquarters of the internet matchmakers eharmony com peering into labs "dedicated to the study of human relationships " the brand new labs which look more like miniature living rooms are equipped with couches stylish armchairs and video cameras this is all part of the companys greater mission to understand what makes two people "click " and thus forge more compatible matches among their subscribers eharmonys r&amp d team jokingly refer to meeting offline as meeting "in the wild " "i believe in measuring things " eharmony ceo greg waldorf says cheerfully when i meet him in his office in a room nearby academics with expertise ranging from marriage to "loneliness" attend an advisory board meeting "i love the challenge that people think how could you possibly measure interpersonal chemistry i like the idea of research and measurement around these things that seem so impossible to quantify " of course this only leads one to wonder how does one measure interpersonal chemistry while eharmony is launching an ambitious research project to do just that mr waldorf admits that they still havent solved the puzzle "we can help them figure out their compatibility but individuals have to figure out their chemistry the nice thing is that on eharmony youre starting out with a pool of matches with whom you at least have compatibility " the site "matches" individuals based on their answers to a lengthy personality questionnaire what about "opposites attract" "in general " mr waldorf says "its a really bad idea " upstairs walking through the sun filled office and looking at the pictures on the walls of beaming couples eharmony success stories its hard not to feel charmed by this mission to create happy lasting unions but really finding your soulmate with the internet relationship research labs whatever happened to traditional courtship spontaneity their eyes met across a crowded room when i ask these questions its clear that mr waldorf doesnt see anything inherently "unromantic" about meeting online "i dont mean to be argumentative " he says "but talk to the couple who talk about their first date through eharmony and the first time they walked in and they saw each other " after all eharmony is just keeping up with the times noting that im a something journalist mr waldorf draws an analogy to online news sites "how many of your friends read the print paper " he asks me "but do they not get the benefit of news " his larger point is that maybe its about time we stopped mourning lost conventions and just went with the technological flow mr waldorf now has been an entrepreneur since the age of when he started his own software and consulting company in l a "families would get a computer and theyd say oh i think greg waldorf knows a lot about how to set up a computer and so i was that kid in the neighborhood who knew that " his mom signed him up to take a programming class but he was so advanced he ended up teaching it one of his "students" was in the real estate industry and asked mr waldorf to do some work for him soon enough mr waldorf was doing work for the whole firm and by the time he was in college he had clients in new york and honolulu "i have a business card that just says greg waldorf computer consultant and its my parents phone number " he says laughing in mr waldorf became a founding investor of eharmony joining forces with founders greg forgatch and neil clark warren a clinical psychologist with three decades of experience counseling married couples dr warrens research shaped the companys scientific approach compatible singles are matched based on their answers to an elaborate questionnaire the site with its relatively lengthy process and subscription rates of around &# a month almost twice the price of other dating sites reaches out to users who are clearly looking for much more than just a date it seemed like a good business idea " mr waldorf explained and also "it seemed meaningful " it was certainly a daring investment even now when you can find just about anything on the internet many remain skeptical that they will meet their true love online so just imagine how much more outlandish this seemed seven years ago when the company first got started "at that time the people who were online were somewhere between " mr waldorf checks himself "at least the perception was they were somewhere between the undatable to the interested in the one night kind of affair " then along comes dr warren a year old entrepreneur with a business idea that challenged the conventional wisdom of the industry which was do not talk about marriage "and the worst thing you could possibly do would be to have a question questionnaire that would take an hour and a half to finish " he adds and indeed the early years were rough the company almost ran out of money in and even then took a few years to get off the ground "between and no one took us seriously people used to describe eharmony to me as the niche player like serious relationships were the niche and i would just chuckle " he now estimates revenue to approach &# million for with business to be "gangbusters" through valentines day the company boasts million registrants since its founding perhaps most important at a time when there seems to be great cynicism about marriage mr waldorf is confident that americans still place a high premium on lasting commitment just look at the economics "im very respectful of people who pull out their credit card to pay for our service " he says "i think theyre getting a good opportunity to meet the right person but this is real money this could be the same cost as your cellphone plan and im not trying to equate cellphone plans with finding a soulmate but its real money to people " why are they willing to pay so much because "people associate the highest value with long term relationships " mr waldorf an investor entrepreneur with a stanford mba doesnt strike me as the type who lived for elaborate "how we met" stories or relationship details and hes the first to admit it "i didnt normally go there " he describes himself "i wasnt the guy a friend calls up and says let me tell you the really long version of my weekend " yet now mr waldorf may have unexpectedly fallen into his own niche "if you want to call it the dinner party test people are fascinated by talking about relationships its an addictive business think about it from my point of view ive been involved in a lot of companies enterprise software mobile application deployment then all of a sudden youre involved in a business like this how do you get involved with another business after this whats the next thing to relationships in terms of involvement with the customer " mr waldorf who often mentions a friend who met his wife on eharmony claims to have surprised himself by how meaningful he finds his work "were not just selling phone systems or internet advertising everyday we spend in the office actually makes a big difference to a lot of people " there is some evidence of this an independent poll found that in the month period ending aug some eharmony members tied the knot averaging around per day the vision behind the company is not simply to create marriages but to create happy marriages by using scientific research to unite compatible individuals "i know it sounds corny when im talking about this " mr waldorf says but "if you can lower the divorce rate by it could affect a million people in a generation i dont know if thats an exact number but it gives you a sense of how many peoples lives are impacted " the popularity and financial success of sites like eharmony underscores what perhaps should have been obvious people care about relationships "i can not tell you how many businesspeople i meet who tell me that the first thing they read in the sunday times is the vows column " he says and the evidence hardly ends there "i used to spend a lot of time in manhattan years ago way before i ever even thought about eharmony whenever youd pass people on a run particularly women what were they talking about relationships " peoples willingness to pay for eharmony would seem to support his point consumers mr waldorf explains are far more disposed to pay for goods rather than services on the internet "people expect things on the internet to be free " he says "so how have we built a business that will have nearly &# million in revenue this year we grew our subscriber base by about a third from to how because this is something that people care a lot about " its also something people care about across the age spectrum while never married somethings do form a huge part of eharmonys business about of users have a child at home and many are divorced in the fastest growing segment was the and over set "theres wisdom you get from going through adversity in life " mr waldorf explains "so i think the appeal of a compatible mate really resonates to people who have not had that " mr waldorf explains that unlike some other dating sites eharmony emphasizes quality over quantity so potential subscribers can be turned away for reasons ranging from marital status you cant be married more than three times to lack of thought in filling out the questionnaire someone who rates themselves as a "" in every category in total the company has rejected more than a million potential users "from our business point of view weve given away tons of revenue " mr waldorf says "weve left a lot on the table but the idea is to keep the quality of our pool really healthy " this screening process has led to a lawsuit pending in a california court filed by a man indignant about rejection by eharmony on account of the fact that he was still married when he tried to sign up of course while inconsistency on the questionnaire can sometimes reveal dishonesty mr waldorf admits that he has no surefire way to detect when people are misrepresenting themselves online "i cant tell if someone is lying about whether or not theyre outgoing " he admits "i mean what am i going to do say hey lets go to lunch " the popularity of internet dating is just one more sign that were witnessing a fundamental change in the way people interact a difference that can be particularly pronounced across generations "im " mr waldorf says "i ask my friends kids this "if you had to give up email text messaging or im which would you give up and i have yet to meet a person whos under who would not give up email first i find this fascinating i find this unbelievable "do i think that means young people will not be able to communicate and obtain relationships " he continues "no not at all but this is where innovation comes in additional waves of people will come up they may want different ways to interact but they will want compatible relationships that will be the constant part i might have to change the way you have your first open communication to figure out something to do on a cell phone but i dont think its possible that years after me when people are theyll be saying i dont want a serious relationship " perhaps you dont have to meet "in the wild" to feel that certain spark mr waldorf describes the besotted who were introduced on his site "when they talk about the first kiss or the first anything it was just as exciting when they got in their cars and drove miles from wherever to wherever for their first date but people dont make movies about it the same way " will they eventually "yeah " he says "because it will be a movie that mirrors whats going on in real life " ms parker is an assistant editorial features editor at the wall
