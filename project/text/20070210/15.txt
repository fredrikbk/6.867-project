does high yield debt face a comeuppance some analysts see troubling signs of increasing risk even as banks suffer a bad housing boom hangover brought on by risky loans to some customers who are suddenly unable to pay them back the lending bender continues in a similarly precarious market corporate high yield debt emboldened by default rates that keep moving improbably lower and a credit cycle that seemingly refuses to turn south investors keep lending their money to highly speculative companies that appear to exist solely at the mercy of the next refinancing "the assumption is that the broader underlying fundamentals remain strong " said john olert an analyst with fitch ratings "but typically assumptions are made about the broad market that may or may not hold water in a worse market " banks are finding out exactly how wrong some of their assumptions can be in recent weeks subprime lenders have been hit hard by mortgage defaults at levels that seemed like a distant possibility just a year ago in retrospect it may seem like it should have been obvious the scorching housing market was bound to cool off while rock bottom interest rates had nowhere to go but up and when that happened the riskiest subprime loans that appeared safe during the boom times would start to default yet an eerily similar scenario is still playing out in the high yield debt market particularly in the riskiest sectors of that market and many investors seem disinclined to believe that a day of reckoning is inevitable "i dont think its happening yet in high yield because liquidity is robust enough to delay any type of effect " mr olert said indeed many cite the influx of money into credit derivatives which has helped investors to spread out their risk and provided ballast for the high yield market as a whole some have even suggested that derivatives such as collateralized debt obligations have permanently altered the historical rhythms of the credit cycle but mr olert said the signs of increasing risk are apparent by the amount of companies shifting toward the riskiest end of the ratings spectrum bonds assigned a ccc rating by the three major rating agencies currently constitute of all junk bonds according to the merrill lynch high yield master ii index since the percentage of cccs has ranged between and investor confidence has been bolstered not only by low default rates but by historically high recovery rates of for bonds and nearly for leveraged loans when these companies do default according to edward altman a finance professor at new york universitys stern school of business "its not only the low default rate its also the high recovery rate weve never seen that before this is an indication to me that the situation will not persist " he said with many predicting an economic slowdown and a rising default rate in some analysts say investors in the riskiest junk bonds will be exposed to potentially severe losses when the companies that issue these bonds run into trouble but many market participants were sounding similar alarms a year ago and instead investors rode a booming junk bond market to double digit returns in the comeuppance has clearly begun for some dabbling in derivatives linked to subprime home loans on friday the riskiest bbb minus slice of the benchmark abx derivative index widened by percentage points to percentage points over the london interbank offered rate or libor less than a month ago that figure stood at percentage points the abx index which was created about a year ago to help investors hedge their exposure to the housing market includes five subindexes ranging from the highest aaa slice to the lowest and riskiest bbb minus slice investors such as hedge funds and banks wagering on the performance of subprime loans have focused their trades on the riskiest tranche of the index in recent months meanwhile risk premiums for highly speculative bonds have fallen to historic lows the index of ccc rated bonds posted a record low spread level of percentage points in late january according to merrill lynch well below the historical average of percentage points over year treasury notes friday the benchmark year note was down or &# per &# face value at its yield rose to from thursday as yields move inversely to prices the year bond was down at to yield auction results here are results of thursdays treasury auction of year bonds all bids are awarded at a single price at the market clearing yield rates are determined by the difference between that price and the face value applications &# accepted bids &# bids at market clearing yield accepted accepted noncompetitively &# " foreign noncompetitively auction price rate interest rate cusip number py the bonds are dated feb and mature feb
