theft in thailand the crusade against drug patents was once fought in the halls of the world trade organization no more by seizing patents for hiv aids treatments and heart disease thailand has asserted that governments have the right to take intellectual property whenever they please the thai ministry of public health announced recently that it would issue a "compulsory license" for abbott laboratories kaletra an hiv aids drug and clopidogrel the local thai brand of sanofi aventiss plavix heart medication meaning that thailand will eventually produce generic copies of these drugs its decision follows a similar move in november against mercks stocrin an antiretroviral hiv aids drug the ministry said wto rules give thailand "a right to issue a safeguard measure to protect public health especially for universal access to essential medicines using compulsory licensing on the patent of pharmaceutical products " thailands actions may be technically legal the wto language on compulsory licensing is regrettably vague and doesnt list specific causes for which governments can seize private patents the only hint of protection of private property lands in article which says "the proposed user has made efforts to obtain authorization from the right holder on reasonable commercial terms and conditions " however thailand did not bother to consult prior to issuing the compulsory licenses and the drug companies woke up to read about it in the papers so it clearly breached the spirit if not the letter of article in any case its hard to argue that thailand has an aids epidemic when its incidence is a little over and countries such as south africa are well over the same goes for heart disease until now governments have been careful to define disease outbreaks as "emergencies " primarily because they didnt want to dissuade drug companies from investing in their countries hong kong for example refrained from issuing a compulsory license during the sars outbreak drug companies spend billions of dollars in research development training and distribution without market based incentives theres little reason to invest in r&amp d its worth noting that thailands confiscations are also a boon for the government pharmaceutical organization the state owned monopoly until it can ramp up its own production gpo will be the sole importer and reseller of the products bangkok seized gpo says it will charge consumers lower prices but merck was already selling stocrin at cost in thailand as it does in other developing countries with over incidence of hiv aids gpos profits then must come from sourcing a cheaper producer of generics its likely to turn to india the worlds most prolific source of counterfeit generics how this is good for thai patients is anyones guess gpos production facilities have never met who standards hiv drug resistance in thailand is high most likely because of the reliance on faulty gpo generic copies now given the lack of patent protection foreign companies may hesitate to introduce newer more expensive and sophisticated second and third generation drugs into thailand if mercks new aids vaccine shows promising results for example you can bet it wont debut in bangkok thailands decision is already reverberating world wide brazil which has used the threat of compulsory licensing to extract lower prices from drug companies is paying attention full credit then to world health organization director general margaret chan for criticizing thailands move and defending ip protection "id like to underline that we have to find a right balance for compulsory licensing " the bangkok post quoted her as saying last week "we cant be naive about this there is no perfect solution for accessing drugs in both quality and quantity " thailands military junta has embraced bad economics in the name of populism since taking power last october so far these decisions have mostly hit investor pocketbooks now the government is toying with its citizens lives
