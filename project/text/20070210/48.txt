pursuits books kunderas novel explanation fiction makes a noble effort to understand that ineluctable defeat called life the curtain by milan kundera harpercollins pages &# drama had aristotle and poetry had horace and many others after him but the novel has had no great theorist or theory unlike other literary forms it also has no strict rules a sonnet isnt a sonnet if it isnt lines the villanelle and sestina must meet strict prosodic specifications but nowhere is the length or form of the novel prescribed it is usually more than pages yet it can also run as with the works of marcel proust or robert musil into the thousands the novel is supposed to be a made up imagined thing but often it isnt even quite that many a roman a clef is so obviously based on real people that readers can blithely toss away the clef the only obligation under which novelists work some "only" is to be continuously interesting what the novel does have is a multitude of traditions they are usually viewed from a national perspective but they turn out to be better viewed internationally even in the current cant word globally for the novel milan kundera writes in "the curtain " there are "no state borders " thus a line of influence and development can be drawn from rabelais french to cervantes spanish to henry fielding and laurence sterne british to kafka czech german to gabriel garcia marquez colombian lots of lines can drawn over the novels historical map connecting scattered dots of technique and craft and forming hitherto unimagined patterns of invention the drawing of these lines is at the heart of "the curtain " a work of sophisticated literary cartography mr kundera the author of "the unbearable lightness of being" and "the book of laughter and forgetting " writes out of love for his chosen form "the curtain" is an extended essay in which a novelist talks about the novel after a lifetime of contemplating its wonders in an earlier work "the art of the novel " he praised the form as one of the great inventions of western culture an invention that is itself a means of further discovery in "the curtain " he sets out to define what it is exactly that the novel attempts to discover at its best mr kundera argues the novel discovers human nature in action and more recently the conditions of quotidian existence that the social sciences often take a great deal longer to understand the poet tells you about himself the novelist brings knowledge of the world mr kundera notes that an obscure austrian named adalbert stifter in a novel of called "indian summer " was onto the subject of bureaucracy long before the sociologist max weber and that franz kafka may have understood the potential insidiousness of bureaucrats better than any sociologist since "all we can do in the face of that ineluctable defeat called life " writes mr kundera "is to try to understand it that that is the raison detre of the art of the novel " born in czechoslovakia mr kundera came of age under communism and wrote his early novels against the grain of his countrys ridiculous yet tyrannical rulers he has resided since in france and is now described as a franco czech writer he wrote "the curtain" in french his own reading is impressively wide ranging provincialism he writes is "the inability to see ones own culture in the large context " the view informing "the curtain" is chiefly continental the books title refers to the act of all serious novelists tearing "through the curtain of pre interpretation " seeing events conduct and conventional morality as they are taking the longer larger and truer view of life the novelists hope is in flauberts phrase to "get at the soul of things" or as mr kundera puts it to attend "the ball of the great enigma of existence" and return with more than an empty glass slipper written in aphoristic style "the curtain" is agreeably studded with insights that may have been overlooked even by veteran readers of the novel mr kundera remarks that the novel in its modern version is deliberately anti lyrical and also not at its best with tragedy "for since its birth the novel is suspicious of tragedy of its cult of grandeur of its theatrical orientation of its blindness to the prose of life " again "the novel alone could reveal the immense mysterious power of the pointless " cool and comic is the most comfortable tone of the modern novel mr kundera holds existential and surreal in the sense of departing from plausibility where aesthetically useful its interest and method the prose of life its ordinariness is at the heart of the novelistic enterprise "oedipus rex" succeeds as a play but in a novel the need to fill in the prosaic details would kill it straightaway how is it that this man oedipus marries a woman whose hometown he never inquires about why does he never ask if she has been married before or might have had children perhaps one his own age the situation would be preposterous in a novel while the play has enjoyed a run of more than two millennia mr kunderas preference is for novels that show an interest in a social or political situation in capturing a time spirit this is what he means by the "existential " he is less keen on those whose main concentration is on character or personal relations hence the greater emphasis in his book on french and central european novels and the relatively marginal status of the anglo american tradition no mention is made of dickens or george eliot herman melville or theodore dreiser henry james the anglo american novelist who thought more about form than any other is also missing from mr kunderas pages henry james would have been the perfect reviewer for "the curtain " one can easily imagine him subtly eviscerating mr kunderas literary predilections suggesting that his too great interest in ideas detracts from the true task of the novel chronicling the longings of the human heart "drapes" is the title james might have given to such a review mr kundera closes on a note of threnody for the literary culture of europe he quotes friedrich schlegel writing at the end of the th century "the french revolution goethes wilhelm meister and fichtes epistemology are the most important trends of our era " no comparable figure would write anything similar about the beginning of the st century "the europe we live in " mr kundera writes "no longer looks for its identity in the mirrors of its philosophy and its arts " the same of course applies to the u s where literary culture has also lost its centrality might it not be time to redraw the lines of the novelistic tradition reconnect the dots and discover in this most fructifying of literary forms a subtler new map by which to find our way to that never ending ball "of the great enigma of existence" mr epstein is the author most recently of "alexis de tocqueville democracys guide" harpercollins
