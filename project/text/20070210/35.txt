modeling themselves after jack bauer the ruthless antiterrorism agent on the fox tv series "" the u s military is increasingly worried that the popular shows use of torture as an essential tactic to fight terrorists is having a toxic effect on the training of real life soldiers jane mayer reports but the shows creator insists he serves as a valuable conservative counterpoint to hollywoods entrenched liberalism in " " each high voltage season traces a single day in which bauer grapples with evil forces threatening to annihilate america bauer frequently faces a dilemma treat a suspect within the law and risk allowing a terrorist plan to succeed or torture a suspect in the hope of breaking a nefarious plot he invariably opts for torture for the u s military the drama glamorizes torture to an extent that some young soldiers have come to believe that illegal and immoral behavior is necessary even patriotic u s army brig gen patrick finnegan the dean of the military academy at

pollution credits could cut the need for foreign aid if developing nations are offered a fair way to sell pollution credits to richer countries the proceeds could be large enough to replace foreign aid while reducing global warming in the process alex evans says the gap between richer and poorer nations is one of the main reasons the kyoto climate change treaty hasnt succeeded in slowing global warming developing countries rejected a blanket emissions cap that could put the brakes on their growth before they had an opportunity to catch up to industrialized countries while the u s currently the worlds biggest contributor of greenhouse gases feared immediate curbs would severely crimp its economy of the nations that have ratified the kyoto protocol only the industrialized participants are required to reduce their emissions the u s never ratified the treaty mr evans a senior policy associate at new york universitys center on international cooperation notes that the u s has opposed setting limits on carbon emissions based on population something the developing world has sought but what if per person limits were phased in over a period of decades rather than all at once this would give poorer countries an opportunity to catch up economically without forcing the u s and other developed countries to immediately make drastic cuts once developing countries sign on to the idea of caps they can begin selling their unused pollution credits to other countries creating a potential revenue windfall global foreign aid including debt relief currently totals about &# million an amount that mr evans says could quickly become dwarfed by income from emissions trading whats more he says developing countries would have "every incentive to invest the proceeds of emission permit sales in renewable energy and clean technology " since it would keep their emissions down and allow them to continue selling permits foreign policy february campaigning iowa politicians home field

relatively low national profile but the year old mr vilsack has struggled to raise money and has barely registered in early polling placing third or fourth among likely iowa caucus goers so why is mr vilsack running mr zengerle wonders whether being a host governor in the state where presidential hopefuls continuously court local politicians has left its mark "perhaps it is inevitable that the kingmaker would start thinking that he himself should be king " for now mr vilsack is hoping that iowans pride in one of their own coupled with the appeal of politics he advocates cutting off funding for the iraq war and he has aggressively championed his states role in ethanol production will carry him forward "im not a rock star " he tells a gathering of potential voters "but im rock solid " the
