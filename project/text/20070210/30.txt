hot topic the gop field now is the season of republican discontent extending even to the partys presidential candidates for the first time in decades no dominant candidate has emerged and gop voters seem to be in a missouri state of mind show us what you really believe we know exactly how they feel john mccain has been considered the front runner having lost a rough nomination fight in to president bush in the normal gop habit of presidential primogeniture hed be the likeliest nominee the arizona senator has an inspiring personal story and a strong record on national security his fortitude on iraq has been all the more impressive since the war has become unpopular and threatens the media adulation he has long enjoyed tenacity is a presidential asset especially in dangerous times but among many republicans mr mccain is also paying a price for his years as a policy "maverick " social conservatives hate his signature achievement of campaign finance reform which limits public ability to influence politicians he also grandstanded on rules for interrogating terrorists our own doubts relate to his economic instincts hes a bulwark against spending earmarks no question but mr mccain turned against the reagan tax cut agenda in and he voted against the bush tax cuts of now that those tax cuts have proven to be a spectacular success the senator says he wants them made permanent but his justification is the political one that he has "never voted for a tax increase " not that he now understands his opposition was wrong on the merits with likely to be a tax watershed the gop needs a candidate who can articulate a pro growth agenda maybe his estimable economic advisers former senator phil gramm and former ftc chairman tim muris can steer him right mitt romney the former massachusetts governor has had some success exploiting conservative unease with mr mccain he has shown he can win votes in a blue state and he was successful both as a capitalist and as manager of the salt lake city olympics however he too is something of an empty policy slate the former business consultant made a big deal of the health care "reform" he steered through the massachusetts legislature last year and we suppose he deserves credit for trying but he oversold the results to the applause of the national health care lobby and imposed an insurance mandate without reforming the state insurance market as it unfolds this law is turning out to be far from a free market success and so now mr romney is distancing himself from it never mind that he upbraided his critics last year for not understanding its virtues the episode suggests a thin political skin and perhaps a too malleable policy core filling out the current top tier of candidates is the anomaly of former new york city mayor rudy giuliani we say anomaly because a northeasterner who favors gun control and abortion rights isnt supposed to have a ralph naders chance in the gop primaries yet today mr giuliani leads in the national polls and is all but tied with mr mccain in new hampshire some of this is no doubt due to name recognition after his heroics on the other hand maybe cultural conservatives arent the single issue voters of media lore mr giuliani can point to the revival of the previously ungovernable new york and his temerity and experience in a crisis are qualities that voters look for in a commander in chief the competition will attack his social liberalism and our guess is that mr giuliani could help himself if he came out solidly for appointing judges like antonin scalia and clarence thomas todays cultural disputes all end up in the courts and what most conservatives want above all is to know that their views will get a democratic hearing rather than be pre empted by judicial fiat as always there are a pack of other potential candidates one or two of whom could make a splash along the way newt gingrich is famous as the former house speaker and ubiquitous on fox news he is also a font of ideas some of them sensible but he will have to persuade republicans that he can win given the baggage of his beltway days and low favorability ratings theres always room for a strong anti abortion voice in any gop race and kansas senator sam brownback is bidding for that slot though little known nationally hes done impressive and often bipartisan work on everything from malaria to immigration so we are astounded by his recent remarks from baghdad distancing himself a la hillary clinton from the war he voted for millions of republicans are frustrated with the war but if he sustains this antiwar theme someone will note that he co sponsored the iraq liberation act all in all this looks like the most wide open republican race in years that may be a good thing if it forces the candidates to battle over ideas and revive the gop reform agenda that got lost in the fog of the th congress
