pursuits sports golf journal nice putt kenny g for amateurs playing with the pros and celebs at pebble beach is a thrill until they blow a shot pebble beach calif harris barton has three super bowl rings but nothing in his career as an offensive tackle for the san francisco ers prepared him for teeing off as an amateur at the at&amp t pebble beach national pro am here "it scares the stuffing out of you " mr barton now an investment fund manager in woodside calif said thursday at the end of his first round "they call your name and your hometown and there are people standing all around and all youre hoping is to get the ball airborne " for amateur golfers playing in the at&amp t is the ultimate thrill partly its the general glamour of the week the world famous courses over which the tournament is played the national tv coverage the presence of high octane celebrities both from the entertainment and business worlds partly its the accomplishment simply of being invited to play the invitation arrives in an expensive leather bound portfolio but mostly its the heart thumping fear inducing challenge of competing inside the ropes with a pro partner in a bona fide if modified pga tour event "oh yes absolutely on every shot " the stockbroker king charles schwab said when i asked if after years playing in the tournament he still gets nervous "and the pressure really intensifies when you have a chance to actually help your pro its so much fun when you do just exhilarating almost like having a stock go up " most pga tour events feature a one day pro am the day before the real tournament starts usually on a wednesday in those three or four amateurs pay &# to &# each to play with a tour pro in a competition that is mostly just for fun some pros at wednesday pro ams have been known to spend most of their between shot times talking on cellphones "this is completely different " says david perdue jr the five handicap ceo of dollar general who was paired this week with jim mcgovern "here you and your pro are real partners but youre also extremely aware of not messing things up for your pro because hes out there legitimately trying to win the event on his own ball " the pros are actually playing in two competitions the main tour event using his ball only and the best ball pro am competition in which the amateurs get to subtract strokes from their scores on designated holes according to their handicaps and so can actually meaningfully contribute to the team score it is true that the pros are more concerned about the main event which has a &# million purse compared with only &# for the pro am but theres enough at stake to keep everybodys nerves on edge especially since the pro am field is cut to approximately teams after three rounds just as the pro field is cut to the top players and ties and every amateurs dream is to play in the final round on sunday at pebble beach something actor jack lemmon famously failed to do in tries television coverage of the at&amp t tends to focus on the two dozen or so celebrities hamming it up for the cameras this years crop includes kevin costner george lopez kenny g and bill murray whom i encountered wednesday during a practice round at spyglass one of the three courses used in the tournament he was wearing knee length shorts and gabbing with the crowd and was the only player on the course even to have a gallery "very nutty very cool " he said of the fans at the at&amp t which from his unique perspective are the best in golf "i love them here except for the professional autograph creeps " he said grabbing the lapel of my jacket as if i might be one "you know what i mean " but for regular amateurs the at&amp t is a much less of a goof al annexstad the ceo of federated insurance companies in minnesota is neither the worlds most avid golfer he plays maybe a dozen times a year and has an handicap nor the type of man generally given to frivolity but when he received an invitation nine months ago to play this week as a guest of gulfstream he quickly cleared his calendar and retained jock olson the head pro at his golf club interlachen to caddie for him "jock is here to keep me calm " he said as intimidating as the golf can be you only have to observe the beaming faces of the countrys industrial captains coming off the course to recognize how turbo charged the atmosphere is during at&amp t week the bonding is intense the invitations themselves of course are instruments of that bonding most go to clients of the plus sponsoring corporations and organizations ollie nutt who runs the tournament for the monterey peninsula foundation which will distribute the &# million in charitable funds raised by this years event said anyone can write a letter requesting an invitation and it will be reviewed but in practice you have to know somebody if youre interested in playing next year your best bet would be to cozy up to someone at monterey which usually has about invitations to offer or someone at at&amp t the title sponsor since the cost per participant is &# not including lodging meals or transportation since most of the sponsoring companies rotate their invitees roughly one third of the field each year is comprised of first timers and surprisingly few noncelebrity amateurs perhaps only about play year in and year out but the regulars and even some newcomers form lasting friendships looking at it this way im tempted to say that golf at the at&amp t is no different than golf anywhere else you have fun you make friends but if i did i know you wouldnt believe me email me
