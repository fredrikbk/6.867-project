pursuits leisure &amp arts in the fray pardon my skepticism is music copy protection really no longer the apple of jobss eye as supposed deathbed conversions go this one was more unusual than most midweek we had apple ceo steve jobs the current king of media sorry howard stern under pressure and releasing an online essay "thoughts on music " where he seemingly recanted on his former fondness for music copy protection generally called drm as most apple fans know a copy protection technology called fairplay is at the core of apples wildly successful itunes digital download service while fairplay has largely prevented apple related music piracy thus satisfying music companies nervous about a copying fueled collapse in their declining business it also means that apples customers are treated like criminals they are prevented from making more than a small number of copies of their music more insidiously and more important from apples point of view they are also prevented from playing music purchased on itunes on anything other than apple ipods that microsoft style lock in to itunes ipod has been good for apple and its shareholders the company sold more than million ipods in the christmas quarter but others have been less impressed first up has been norway an admittedly tiny market which last month gave apple until march to explain how it would untangle itunes and ipod and open up the music market similar complaints have now come from groups in france germany and the netherlands enter mr jobs with this weeks anti drm essay were less than a month from when mr jobs needed to respond to european complaints so he seemingly had a deathbed conversion lets open it all up he says eliminating drm altogether whoa steve jobs saves us from online copy protection happy days hang on however people have a tendency to temporarily find religion while in extremis only to forget later does he really want to get rid of fairplay and open up ipod based music collections to all players or is this just a transient conversion or even a diversionary tactic consider his arguments first mr jobs notes that it is the record companies that made him impose drm on itunes downloadable music true enough but thats hardly the point being ordered to do something objectionable is not an excuse and further mr jobs hasnt exactly had the high rhetorical ground here not having fought the good fight on this subject publicly in the past more important mr jobs has options he could license his fairplay drm to other music player companies that way they could play apple music on their players thus breaking down the itunes wall he argues however that if he did there is a chance that some of the tricky bits that make fairplay work would become public thus opening it up to piracy and forcing music companies to pull their entire collections from his itunes and everywhere else for that matter so no music for you ah steve saves us once again wait a minute there are many technological fixes to this problem not to mention an industry group called coral pushing drm interoperability and few serious people in the security community buy the argument that apple is really just making the music industry safe for all of us by keeping its fairplay technology to itself worried seemingly that the above argument wouldnt take mr jobs goes on to say that the music is out of the player so to speak citing industry statistics he says that the average ipod has only about of its songs drm ed the rest he implies are pirated or otherwise unprotected in other words most digital music isnt copy protected anyway nothing sold on cds is copy protected in any meaningful sense so he argues why not stop pretending and just tear down the whole drm edifice steve saves us again apple uber alles then again hang on mr jobss statistics are misleading he is overzealous in the number of ipods in use and so a much higher proportion of ipod music than he cites is actually copy protected further if the recording industry could copy protect cd music it would but the industry is prevented from doing so by a massive installed base of cd players that dont support such technology besides if copy protection in general and fairplay in particular are so fundamental to mr jobss lock in and current music media hegemony this raises an obvious question why would he argue in favor of eliminating drm altogether it starts to seem well nuts it is of course a straight out of clausewitz exercise in diversionary tactics while many people are uneasy about beating up on the successful and innovative apple gang tackling the nasty old music companies is something everyone can really get behind and mr jobs knows that there is pretty much zero chance the music industry will eliminate drm that move would sound a death ringtone for their struggling business making online piracy dead simple and destroy the livelihood of an entire generation of artists for now however he is happy to play up the cynical drm deathbed conversion and keep peoples attention focused on rhetoric instead whats good for apple is good for america mr kedrosky is a venture capitalist and editor of the popular
