streets and antebellum mansions he learned to play trumpet there and high school football and became a federal judge now at years old judge senter has become a defining figure in the coastal south of the state presiding over a deluge of legal cases that grew out of hurricane katrina the storm triggered more than million claims from homeowners for &# billion in damage says the insurance information institute a trade group most claims have been resolved but thousands of homeowners in the gulf region are still suing their insurers and billions are still at stake at issue in many of these cases is a messy question were homes destroyed by the ferocious winds of the storm or the surging gulf waters that came with them insurers typically cover wind damage but exclude water damage because its covered under the federal governments flood insurance program yet who knows whats behind the damage when a house has been wiped off the map judge senter has been at the core of several recent critical turns in cases in mississippi which have generally moved faster than in louisiana in part because hes one of the few federal judges there whose own home wasnt damaged by the storm at least two other judges have sued their insurers he owns a condo in nearby new orleans that was unharmed and stays in a hotel when in mississippi judge senter who has declined interviews has ruled against the insurance industry in some important ways in late january he ruled against state farm insurance cos the nations largest home insurer in one case involving one mississippi couple setting the stage for a &# million punitive damage award against the company a few days later he tossed aside a proposed settlement that would have had state farm pay at least &# million to thousands of mississippi homeowners helping it clean the slate of katrina related conflicts in the area he said he needed more information hell be holding a hearing on the settlement important to residents desperate for rebuilding funds on feb "i would like nothing more than to approve a settlement procedure that is fair balanced and reasonable " he wrote in an order thursday that set that coming hearing hes handed the insurance industry some important victories last march he upheld a standard provision in many policies that frees them from the responsibility of covering damage caused by floods the industry considers the "flood exclusion" sacred but beyond upholding flood exclusions his rulings have put the onus on insurers not homeowners to prove which damage was caused by wind and to pay for it or risk costly penalties "judge senter has laid out a framework that is likely to be followed by most courts" in future hurricane related cases says john ellison an attorney with new york based anderson kill &amp olick pc who is representing louisiana plaintiffs in other katrina related cases judge senter is not the first to address the wind vs water issue but this is "the first time were seeing it on a massive scale " says tom baker director of the insurance law center at the university of connecticut law school judge senter himself is a relative newcomer to the gulf coast having grown up in aberdeen in the north it is a once prosperous town on the tombigbee river where the movie house on commerce street still sells popcorn for &# he was a sure footed high school quarterback until he was stricken with polio which later forced him to walk with a leg brace and crutches he now uses a wheelchair after working as an attorney and serving as a state judge he was nominated to the federal bench by president carter in he later became chief of the northern district sitting in aberdeen where he garnered a reputation as a thoughtful fair and even tempered jurist who combines small town practicality with a scholarly interpretation of the law "this is a guy that sees both sides to everything " says danny mckittrick a probation officer at the district court "he never claims to know it all and works hard to get the information necessary to understand what hes hearing " the judge who sometimes introduces himself as "tommy" outside the courtroom played trumpet with a jazz band in college he once used the trumpet to ease tensions in a case recalls ron welch a mississippi lawyer mr welch and another attorney were in chambers strenuously arguing a point when judge senter began asking about their personal interests and then steered the conversation to music he then suggested they take a break and they wound up at judge senters house where he pulled out his trumpet and played "summertime " the lullaby from "porgy and bess " "we ended up settling that point " says mr welch in judge senter became a senior judge and he relocated to the southern district of mississippi in when katrina hit judge senter rode out the storm with friends in pensacola fla and took over katrina related cases afterward some of the judges recent rulings could have added import as katrina cases work their way through the system in the gulf among those rulings was his call on how insurers should proceed when both wind and water cause damage to a home the insurer not the policyholder bears the burden of proving which part should be excluded that came into play last month in the case brought against state farm by norman and genevieve broussard of biloxi miss their home was wiped away state farm denied the claim "state farm attempted to shift its burden of proof to the plaintiffs to establish the portion of their losses that were caused by wind " judge senter said in his ruling he ordered the insurer to pay to the limits of the policy &# for the home and its contents a jury then awarded the couple &# million in punitive damages which judge senter later reduced to &# million "if thats the law then that will have a huge impact on how future cases are handled " says randy maniloff an attorney for insurance companies at white &amp williams llc in philadelphia who has written about judge senters rulings state farm which is based in bloomington ill says it is likely to appeal the entire case and adds that the company is working on answering the judges questions about the proposed settlement
