pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece hugos truly magnum opus the genius of les miserables is best savored at length anatomy of a classic a sequel to "les miserables" isnt the original "wretched ones" enough apparently the french journalist francois ceresa thought not and penned "cosette ou le temps des illusions" cosette or the time of illusions which critics predictably christened "les mis ii " for six years pierre hugo a great great grandson of victor hugo has been battling to have it banned in late january the highest french court handed him a defeat upholding the principle that thought is free mr hugo might have spared himself the trouble adaptations and abridgments of his ancestors magnum opus have been legion the musical may never close but only the novel all plus pages of it is "les miserables " you must wrestle it as jacob wrestled the angel hanging on for the sake of your very soul the first edition to show up on a search of french amazon comes in at a sleek pages if all you want is the story line however words will do it we come in as the saintly monseigneur bienvenu a bishop in provence takes in an outcast wanderer for the night the man is jean valjean just released from prison after years for stealing a loaf of bread before daybreak valjean makes off with the bishops silver the bishop assures the disbelieving police that the silver was a gift "jean valjean my brother " says the bishop sending valjean on his way "you no longer belong to evil but to good it is your soul i am buying for you i withdraw it from dark thoughts and from the spirit of perdition and i give it to god " hours later on the road the dark thoughts return and valjean steals a coin from a beggar lad years pass valjean now under an assumed name has founded a bead factory bringing prosperity to an entire town one of his workers is the waif fantine an unwed mother her daughter cosette is in the care of the predatory innkeeper thenardier whose demands for money eventually drive fantine to prostitution and an early grave learning of these woes valjean resolves to save cosette by now however his true identity has come to the attention of inspector javert who knows about the stolen coin and is determined to bring him to justice valjean and cosette hide out in paris where cosette attracts the eye of marius pontmercy a student uprisings turn the city into a battlefield valjean saves the mortally wounded marius bearing him on his shoulders through the labyrinthine sewers of paris javert is briefly in valjeans power but valjean spares him in consternation javert plunges to his death in the churning seine marius and cosette marry on his deathbed valjean reveals his secret past urges the young couple to love each other always and departs in peace missing from this synopsis are characters no reader will forget sister simplice who cannot tell a lie but tells one without flinching to save valjean eponine thenardiers gallant tomboy daughter who takes a bullet for marius and dies in his arms the charismatic enjolras student and revolutionary blazing like an exterminating angel the street urchin gavroche whose pluck embodies the spirit of paris in hugos prose even inanimate objects can take on a life of their own the bishops pair of silver candlesticks for instance or a doll whose beauty seems to cosette a vision of paradise let us also account as best we can for the virtual library of novelettes hugo drops into the saga the first chapters set the stage for valjeans entrance with an extended character sketch of monseigneur bienvenu a while later we meet three aging playboys from the provinces for whom the time has come to go home promising their latin quarter mistresses a surprise they treat them to a day in the country absconding as the crowning banquet winds down the surprise is that they are gone for good their airy adieus arrive by letter brought in by a waiter "p s the dinner is paid for " one of those left to shift for herself is fantine in her teens and pregnant with cosette the canvas hugo unfurls is of dickensian density like dickens he relishes coincidence a baffled double of valjeans triggers no end of trouble yet narrative detail swells the novel less than hugos marathon digressions as narrator he expounds at dissertation length on such topics as slang monasticism the topography of paris and the battle of waterloo sometimes someone in the cast of characters opens the floodgates when the mother superior mere innocente upholds a sisters dying wish to be buried at the altar of their convent in defiance of the laws of france she cites obscure church fathers in learned argument that runs on for pages not that her caretaker the only one listening needs convincing throughout hugo puts himself on familiar terms with the almighty reading the inscrutable mind with something like nonchalance "this book is a drama whose first character is the infinite " he writes after some pages "man is the second " bienvenu valjean and especially javert are not so much characters as vessels for meditations on the mysteries of sin and grace the deeper hugo looks into them the further they recede valjeans capacity for right action is symbolized in part by his herculean physical power but by exercising that power he falls into the hands of the implacable javert bievenus blessing sets him on his path yet fails to make him whole cosette and marius owe valjean their happiness and even their lives yet he feels unworthy to share the air they breathe javert for his part is as much cipher as enigma we learn in passing that he was born in prison to a mother who tells fortunes and a father in the galleys origins in some way responsible for his maniacal allegiance to law though we think of him as vengeful he has no personal scores to settle his true obsession is universal accountability his own transgressions receive the same cold swift justice he metes out on the transgressions of anyone else retribution sets his world right mercy is its undoing and who has time for pages no one will deny that "les miserables" is too long but its eccentricities detours excrescences and contradictions are inseparable from its genius on an epic journey like this one a readers attention is sure to wander from time to time but every shortcut is a loss mr gurewitsch writes for the journal on the arts and philanthropy
