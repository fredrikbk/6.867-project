shooting messengers makes us feel better but work dumber it was a perfect case of shooting the messenger even if it seemed to elliott gordon like a protracted mugging last year the former sales associate watched the fallout after one of his colleagues made a big sale that faltered the salesman was assured that the goods would be shipped from a supplier but only half of the inventory arrived a receiving clerk had to tell the salesman who responded to the bad news by vowing to the clerk "i will ruin your life " and then throwing him against the wall he then kicked his own cubicle wall "which in turn collapsed onto his neighbors cubicle wall and thus started a domino effect of wrecking everyones office in the row " mr gordon recalls the salesman then threw the clerk on top of the collapsed wall and used his phone receiver to smash his own computer screen which popped like a blown light bulb "i just sat staring at my computer screen with the cubicle wall to my right tented over my head " says mr gordon everyone knows blaming the blameless bearer of bad news doesnt help but we do it anyway its a symptom of the ill aimed trigger happy nature of office blame and the gulf between knowing a problem and solving it among the unwanted consequences the shooter gets a one way ticket from reality we do it mostly because were stupid says management consultant marshall goldsmith for whom the issue is a pet peeve "its easy to know theories its hard to change behavior " he says great success in business he reminds us hasnt always included growing up "have you ever read a history book that indicates that when you give men lots of status and money and power they begin to act sane and rational " he asks "i never read that book " also some jobs are easier to mistake for skeet waiters customer service personnel employee relations and anyone who has to convey insurance policy information for example those middlemen arent responsible for disruptive decisions or business failures but theyre the poor souls held accountable pearl gabel who works part time as a medical clinic secretary has to tell people all day long that the clinic doesnt take their insurance she knows people are sick and exhausted so she takes whatever gets thrown at her usually "darts of guilt " she tells them "sorry im just a secretary i dont make the rules " but even ms gabel finds herself shooting messengers the week before last she went to a doctors office for a five minute visit it would cost &# the receptionist informed her "i huffed at her the doctor wasnt available to huff at " she says big bureaucracies are set up to place human barriers around decision makers today theres the added protection of automated phones and web sites that bury contact information for real people so the buck stops in the lower rungs of the hierarchy the government agency where andrew mentzer once worked sent lower level staffers to break the news to clients that they didnt get approved he used to beg them not to shoot the messenger "the true irony of the situation is sending in someone who is less qualified to address a hostile situation and that creates more hostility which makes it more likely for him to get shot " he says the biggest business mistake gerry langeler ever made was when he presided over a software company working on a new version of its main product which was increasingly late when one vice president notified him that the release would be delayed again mr langeler made an example of the vp and fired him "i finally got so exasperated that i let the word go out that i simply did not want to hear any more excuses about why the schedule could not be met " he says he got his wish and paid dearly for it "no one ever came forward to tell me the truth about the status of the program for a very long time thereafter " he says the software finally shipped two years later and its development cost &# million he began to solicit bad news with a "smokey the bear award" for employees who identified conflagrations before they spread "if i hadnt shot the messenger we still would have lost a lot of that money " he says "but not all of it " email me at jared sandberg wsj com for a discussion on todays column go to wsj com forums
