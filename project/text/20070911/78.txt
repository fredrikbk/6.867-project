nursing ambitions in shift auto workers flee to health care jobs many seek new starts in field that bled big detroits next migration detroit in the mid s horace warren joined one of the largest worker migrations in u s history he moved here from alabama to take a job in the booming auto industry and for more than years detroits big three provided jobs for mr warren and his children now his family is part of a huge new wave of migration away from the auto industry as manufacturers here attack bloated costs by trimming excess workers with expensive union jobs they have offered buyouts that have let tens of thousands of employees launch new careers among these former auto workers the most popular choice is the very field that auto industry executives have blamed for their competitive woes health care in the past year both of mr warrens daughters have left auto manufacturing jobs to attend nursing school his youngest angela davis built engines for years at a chrysler plant here but when chrysler group offered her a &# buyout she decided on nursing "we know a lot of money goes to health care from the auto makers " the year old mother of three says "they talk about it all the time especially during our contract talks " the detroit work forces massive transition is on display this week as the united auto workers union negotiates with the big three american manufacturers general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler llc on a labor deal to replace the four year uaw contract that expires friday detroits auto makers would like to replace many of their older employees with workers they hope can be hired under a cheaper labor agreement the manufacturers are seeking to offer new employees as well as thousands of temporary workers already on jobs at the plants a "second tier" wage and benefit package union representatives confirm those discussions people familiar with the talks say the uaw is more likely to agree to lower compensation for a limited number of jobs such as janitors or material handlers a centerpiece of the auto makers strategy is their bid to persuade younger workers to leave uaw jobs often helping them find professions that pay comparable amounts the manufacturers are holding up these efforts as an example of socially responsible cost cutting and perhaps as a key to restoring their labor competitiveness represented by the uaw detroits auto workers have long received wages and health care plus a " and out" retirement plan that provides a full pension and health care for retirees and their spouses after three decades of service those benefits have made detroits labor costs the highest in the auto business the three makers estimate that unionized workers cost them more than &# an hour factoring in benefits and retirement compared with &# to &# for honda and toyota health care costs alone increase the price of detroit brand vehicles by as much as &# to &# compared with a u s made toyota they estimate beginning last year with gm companies started offering early retirements or lump sum buyouts of up to &# in the past months gm has persuaded unionized workers to take early retirements or buyouts with ford and chrysler cutting and union jobs respectively since the last labor agreement went into effect in uaw membership at gm ford and chrysler has fallen from to about last year ford began offering a buyout package that covers schooling following an internal study that showed many of its younger workers would leave if given a chance to attend college under this plan ford agrees to pay former workers half of their annual pay for four years typically &# to &# annually plus health care benefits and up to &# each year for school workers surrender retiree health benefits but retain whatever ford pensions theyve earned ford says of its former workers who are going to school are studying in medical fields more than half specializing in nursing followed by radiology dental hygiene and pharmacology "health care is where the jobs are " says marty mulloy fords head of labor relations who helped develop fords education buyout plan and is handling this summers uaw contract talks gm and chrysler say they do not track their former hourly workers career choices but the uaw and michigan colleges say many gm and chrysler workers are applying for nursing and other health care programs both manufacturers have asked ford about its education buyout plan people familiar with the labor talks say former auto workers say they are drawn to health care because the jobs pay well and are less vulnerable to being outsourced registered nurses currently have an annual mean salary of nearly &# the bureau of labor statistics says dental hygienists earn about &# by comparison auto manufacturing jobs currently pay about &# workers say the jobs are also a welcome break from repetitive work chris pengov a year old native of norwalk ohio spent the past years with ford most recently tightening lug nuts and installing rims and tires on econoline vans and other vehicles at a plant in avon lake ohio "a mind is a terrible thing to waste " he says "thats what happens working on the line " mr pengov who has a year old daughter and a year old granddaughter says he had been researching a move to health care for the past few years in january he was among what he estimates were avon lake workers to accept a buyout or early retirement ford declined to provide plant by plant information on early worker departures mr pengov took an education buyout and is now in his second semester at mercy college of northwest ohio in toledo he says he is considering specializing in radiology or health information services "either way i will absolutely positively be happier " he says former uaw members are also being pushed toward health care by auto makers and government officials who note a growing demand in the field the american association of college nursing estimates the u s currently has nursing vacancies by the u s will require million new and replacement nurses according to the u s bureau of labor statistics as many of the nations million nurses retire and aging baby boomers need increasing amounts of care in michigan health care is the only industry in demand across the state says andy levin the deputy director of the states department of labor and economic growth michigan projects a shortage of nurses by "every hospital in michigan needs nurses and every school has a nursing waiting list " he says "the health care industry is a growth sector we want to foster " already demand for nursing courses exceeds the number of teachers to address a staffing shortfall michigan gov jennifer granholm is seeking &# million for a three year program to train nursing teachers a bid that is expected to encounter difficulties amid a state budget crunch health care has long been a huge budget item for detroits auto makers last year health care cost the three more than &# billion combined more than they spent on steel for their cars and trucks the manufacturers figure that over coming decades they will be obligated to pay about &# billion in retiree health care costs for current workers retirees and their spouses in this summers talks the manufacturers are proposing to eliminate the &# billion obligation from their books by providing some portion of it about those involved in the talks say to a uaw managed health care trust while union representatives have resisted the big threes proposal to pay new hires a lower wage the uaw says it is considering a health care proposal for new hires that would be cheaper for the auto makers under the existing agreement the auto makers guarantee certain benefits a system that has grown more expensive as health care prices have climbed under the new proposal manufacturers would instead guarantee newer hires a defined contribution to their health care plans those familiar with the talks say detroits manufacturers hope such changes will help them to reverse the high cost of decisions they made a decade or more ago ford and chrysler in particular went on a hiring spree in the s to feed a growing u s appetite for sport utility vehicles ford continues to employ thousands of extra uaw workers that it hired from to when truck sales were booming and ford hoped to pass gm as the countrys largest auto maker in recent years ford kept these workers on its payrolls even when there was no work kenneth kidd whose father moved north from alabama in the s for an auto job wound up on the line in a one time telecommunications operator for the u s army mr kidd took a job building ford suvs at the michigan truck plant in suburban detroit the work was so boring he took up smoking and brought books for idle moments but with earnings of up to &# a year he bought a four bedroom brick colonial home in ypsilanti mich and sent his wife to nursing school mr kidd says members of his fathers generation would have stuck things out but that younger workers are more likely to try new things "i knew from my first week on the job i couldnt stay forever " he says like other uaw workers who took buyouts he doesnt blame his ex employer for cutting costs "its business " he says mr kidd is now studying nursing and says he would like to work in an emergency room "its a job where you have to think fast act quick get it done right now " he says "exact opposite of life at the plant " horace warren has witnessed the migration into the auto business and now the massive flow back out mr warren and an older brother moved to michigan from selma ala part of the post world war ii wave that brought african americans to cities like detroit and cleveland "quite a few of us came there for the jobs you could just walk into the plant and get one " mr warren recalls he worked for chrysler group in detroit until he retired in his daughter angela davis joined the work force in the mid s an aunt with a uaw job told her chryslers detroit engine plants were hiring as the company ramped up production of jeeps and dodge ram pick ups "she said to the whole family go down and apply at the state employment office there are some openings " she recalls mrs davis says she had always thought about pursuing a nursing career but she took a job on a line at chrysler building v and v engines typically working a shift that kept her at the plant until after p m she attached oil caps belts or other parts to hundreds of engines a day mrs davis said she eventually made about &# an hour and as much as &# a year she bought a three bedroom brick colonial home in detroit "its a great paycheck " she says "but it was only a paycheck " as rising gasoline prices undermined sales of big chrysler trucks mrs davis lost her overtime she was laid off entirely for a few months early this year collecting a lesser salary when she did have work her shift kept her away at night from her children especially her year old daughter "the reality check was when i dropped my daughter off for first grade last year and she said see ya tomorrow mom it hit me that i never get to see her after school " she says "that sealed it when the buyout came i couldnt accept it fast enough " mrs davis is using some of the &# she received from chrysler to attend oakland university in rochester mich this summer she finished nursing prerequisite classes in humanities and english literature she received as and statistics she got a c now she is part of an incoming student nursing program at oakland called dawn or displace auto worker to nursing mrs davis hopes to become a pediatric nurse "health care feels more secure " she says "the ball will be in my court not with the uaw or the big three " mrs davis hopes to graduate in and then retrace her fathers journey relocating her family to the south where unemployment rates are lower than michigans the highest in the u s "every time i visit down there it just feels like home " she says mrs daviss older sister denise mcdonald also took a buyout from chrysler after five years and has enrolled in nursing school at a michigan community college their father says hes sorry to see that the auto industry isnt providing jobs that retain young workers hes also sad that his daughter and others are considering a move from michigan "every week at my church i hear about two or three more young people moving south or southwest " mr warren says "too bad because michigan needs to keep its young people "
