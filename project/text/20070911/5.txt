ad campaign fuels debate on breast cancer gene test critics say calling attention to a rare risk factor may create unnecessary fear a new direct to consumer ad campaign for a breast cancer gene test is reigniting a debate over who really needs the test and whether it will induce low risk women to take drastic measures to prevent the disease at issue is a series of ads to promote myriad genetics inc s test for so called brca and brca gene mutations the mutations while rare signal a high risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer in affected women women who find they carry the mutations often take steps to lessen their risk that can mean more frequent screenings and taking certain preventive drugs but also can include prophylactic surgical removal of a womans breasts or ovaries the gene tests arent foolproof however and some experts worry that a campaign calling attention to a rare condition could create unnecessary fear sending thousands of healthy women with no family history of cancer into the doctors office demanding tests that wont help them or lead others to a false sense of security about their results "marketing has the capacity to raise public awareness a good thing " says alan guttmacher deputy director of the national human genome research institute a unit of the national institutes of health in bethesda md but "with brca and people can get uncertain test results what do you do with that information " in salt lake city gregory critchfield president of myriad genetic laboratories inc myriads gene testing unit says the company vetted the awareness campaign with insurance companies and shared it with medical experts and government officials at the nih "we are confident that our materials represent the highest quality of information " he says dr guttmacher said his institute hasnt taken any official position on the test television commercials hit the airwaves yesterday in new york city boston hartford conn and providence r i as part of a multimedia blitz aimed at promoting awareness and use of myriads test the tv ads feature a half dozen women saying "breast cancer runs in my family " and vowing to "be ready against cancer " the slogan captures the trade name of the product known as "bracanalysis " in the background feminine touches like flowers or pink teddy bears dot the screen women can expect to see newspaper and magazine ads as well as posters in clinics and spas as part of the campaign myriad says it hopes to extend it to a national audience "the test is designed to save lives by raising public awareness " says dr critchfield the company estimates that only of individuals who carry brca and gene mutations have been identified he adds "its important to find these individuals because there are interventions that can lower their risk " the ads will urge women concerned about risk to contact their primary health care providers about the test rather than genetic counselors who are in short supply the cost can run anywhere from &# to over &# depending on the level of genetic sequencing performed in women with a verified family history strongly suggestive of risk most insurance companies will cover the test says dr critchfield however fear of insurance or employment discrimination already makes some women hesitate to take the test the genetic information nondiscrimination act or gina which would prohibit discrimination by insurers and employers based on a persons genetic history recently passed the house of representatives and is now awaiting senate action the new campaign is drawing the scrutiny of at least one state attorney general in the targeted area "we are doing an investigation to determine whether myriad is fairly and accurately representing claims for this test " richard blumenthal connecticuts attorney general said in an interview the attorney generals office has issued a subpoena for information about the myriad ads to assist in the inquiry and mr blumenthal said his office had heard from professional caregivers clinicians and scientists who believe there is "very high potential for misinterpretation and overreaction " myriads dr critchfield said the company is "cooperating fully" with connecticut officials for the american cancer society forecasts there will be cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed and an estimated deaths estimated ovarian cancer cases in will reach with deaths the society spokesman said researchers believe that only about of women with breast or ovarian cancer develop the diseases because of hereditary risk factors and not all of those involve the two mutations detected by myriads test especially at risk are women from an ashkenazi jewish ethnic background and those with a significant family history of breast cancer and ovarian cancer women with certain brca or brca gene mutations have a to risk of developing breast cancer by age compared with a risk in the general population myriad says women with brca or mutations have a to risk of developing ovarian cancer by age compared with less than a risk in the general population experts in oncology and genetics say the decision about whether a woman is at high enough risk to justify a test begins with a thorough family history this should focus not so much on a case of cancer in one elderly relative but multiple cases of cancer in females before menopause bilateral double sided breast cancer or breast cancer in male relatives then genetic testing should start with a family member who has cancer who should have a complete sequencing of the brca and genes these experts say such sequencing tests can cost over &# per person then once a brca mutation is confirmed other family members can be checked for that mutation a more limited test that typically costs &# or more some genetic counselors who prepare patients for the possible results emotional fallout and preventive steps involved with such tests are concerned that the myriad ads oversimplify the benefits of gene tests moreover primary care providers who often must squeeze in dozens of patient visits a day lack time and training to prepare patients for the tests says ellen matloff director of cancer genetic counseling of the yale cancer center myriad says it is developing a program to school primary care doctors about the test dr critchfield said the company is focusing on primary care doctors oncology specialists and tertiary care centers along with genetic counselors "to get the message out " gene screen advice for hunting for brca and brca mutations do a thorough family history brca mutations often occur in families with multiple premenopausal breast or ovarian cancers or breast cancer in male relatives families with a strong history should consider a complete sequencing of one relative diagnosed with cancer if a mutation is confirmed other family members can be checked for the mutation
