business technology web stores tap product reviews bazaarvoice others offer customer rating service more sales fewer returns retailers have long admired web pioneer amazon com inc s product reviews in which consumers rate books and other products for the way they help persuade shoppers to make online purchases now other companies are tapping new technology that generates similar product ratings and reviews specific to their own web stores early last year bass pro shops an outdoor gear retailer began displaying product ratings and reviews using an online software service from a company called bazaarvoice inc the software runs on bazaarvoices computers and bazaarvoice monitors the review content so bass pro didnt need to buy custom built software or add staff to handle reviews within six months of turning to the service bass pro had generated reviews for products ranging from &# fishing lures to &# propane gas grills on its web pages the springfield mo retailer ran fourth quarter promotions touting the top rated customer product picks and saw a increase in the rate that shoppers made purchases said david seifert director of operations in bass pros direct marketing unit that is significantly higher than the normal "conversion rate" of to when an average customer visits the site without a promotion and makes a purchase he said "the payback was huge " said mr seifert who had abandoned the idea of product ratings four years ago due to the high cost of hiring staff and buying in house software "im a happy camper " as online shopping matures retailers are turning their attention to building consumer loyalty which they hope translates into higher sales product ratings and reviews particularly when they are written by consumers whom prospective buyers appear to trust are a useful tool to meeting that goal merchants say ratings and reviews boost sales increase customer satisfaction and reduce returns twenty five percent of e commerce companies use customer ratings and reviews on their sites according to the latest state of retailing online a survey of about e commerce retailers by market research firm forrester research for shop org an online retail trade group of those respondents find ratings "very effective" on a three point scale and of retailers say it will be a priority in the next months new technology from companies like bazaarvoice in essence allows retailers to outsource the task of compiling those reviews investors are starting to notice founded in may the austin texas start up boasts customers and says it is profitable it recently raised about &# million in a second round of venture capital funding from battery ventures and austin ventures rival powerreviews inc based in millbrae calif recently raised &# million in additional funding from lehman brothers venture partners menlo ventures and draper richards bazaarvoice makes the process of producing and posting customer reviews easy for retailers consumers see a button on a product page or receive an email after making a web purchase inviting them to write a review after consumers answer questions such as how they would rate the product on a scale of to how they would use the product hobbyist or professional or write comments in their own words bazaarvoice formats the survey into ratings and reviews a software program screens those reviews for red flag key words such as profanity then they are screened twice by two bazaarvoice employees who look for other questionable content such as religious statements before they are posted on the merchants web site merchants do very little work other than downloading some web software code into their product pages during the initial setup some have one employee assigned to monitor the reviews or answer questions when problems arise bazaarvoice charges a monthly fee starting at &# for a small retailer and that increases depending on factors like the amount of user generated content said bazaarvoice chief executive brett hurt that is as much as half to a third less than what retailers would spend to build and support their own in house ratings system he said it isnt enough just to post reviews of course sucharita mulpuru a forrester research analyst warns that it is hard to produce incremental sales if there isnt a "critical mass" of reviews throughout the web site to benefit the customer bass pros mr seifert agrees to reach reviews on his web site he offered contests and gift card giveaways to encourage buyers to write reviews even then just having reviews on his site was "nice but it was not that great " he said the real payback came when he promoted the ratings and reviews highlighting what products were top rated by customers through email or on his home page he said product ratings and reviews instill loyalty merchants claim they help replicate online the expert advice that store employees offer customers said brad brown vice president of e commerce and web strategy at recreational equipment inc an outdoor gear retailer and a powerreviews customer consumers make better decisions by hearing from products users that can help temper expectations if a product receives an average rating which can lead to fewer returns even negative reviews benefit retailers about of the reviews on petco animal supplies inc s site are negative meaning the products received a or rating out of the pet supplies retailer uses that as a chance to re engage the customer by refunding his money instructing him how to use the product properly or talking to the vendor about fixing the product entirely said john lazarchic petcos vice president of e commerce petco which has displayed product ratings and reviews on its site since october using bazaarvoices service found that the more reviews it receives on a product the lower its return rate gets he said reducing returns saves merchants money by eliminating the expense of restocking an item or returning it to the manufacturer for credit "this is hard core savings " mr lazarchic said
