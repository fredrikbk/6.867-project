global economy growing consumer debt in u k fuels concern london british consumers are fueling an economic boom by taking on record levels of personal and mortgage debt but some economists are starting to warn that the activity is creating a bubble that could burst if property prices stagnate and interest rates rise at the end of june consumer debt in the united kingdom totaled more than forecast gross domestic product for this year and the ratio of debt to personal income surpassed even that of the u s where widespread defaults on subprime mortgages kicked off a credit crisis that has threatened banks around the world and undermined corporate earnings subprime mortgages are home loans geared to consumers with troubled or sketchy credit most economists said the probability of the same sort of widespread defaults happening in the u k is low because the u k subprime market has sounder foundations than does the u s market but many think the fresh highs in consumer debt levels are a cause for concern "the level of debt in the u k is absolutely unprecedented " said richard snook an economist at the center for economics and business research "its a large source of instability for the economy " if the trend continues he says it could hit consumer spending and confidence and ultimately curtail economic growth british borrowers owe gbp trillion &# trillion in mortgage and unsecured debt surpassing the nations gbp trillion expected gdp for this year according to consulting firm grant thornton the u k now has the highest ratio of household debt to personal income in the group of seven nations as the debt has risen so has its cost with the bank of england raising its key interest rate by about a third to from in a year londons prominence as a world wide financial center has attracted an international cadre of wealthy investors pushing housing prices to among the highest in the world with the costs of food energy and services rising in tandem but wages havent risen as quickly and that squeeze is starting to show up on bankers books the absolute numbers are small cast against the growth in the economy which by july had notched quarters of uninterrupted economic growth but because britain is one of the pillars supporting an increasingly integrated global economy even a slight tremor could have international consequences in the u k tipping points such as a fall in real estate prices or a rise in unemployment levels are still far off economic experts say much of the debt in the u k is secured against property which has shot up in price during the past years says geoffrey dicks economist at royal bank of scotland but unsecured borrowing is also rising showing a net increase of gbp billion in july its biggest rise in eight months taking the total lent to gbp billion bank of england figures show "the levels of bad debt are relatively contained at the moment but the trend is definitely going in the wrong direction " said global insight economist howard archer mark allen an insolvency specialist at grant thornton said it wouldnt take much to tip the balance "its not uncommon these days to see some individuals with unsecured debt upwards of gbp spread across four or five credit cards and a mortgage on top of that " he said "all it takes is an increase in costs or as is the present case a rise in mortgage premiums due to higher interest rates to force people to default on their repayments " home repossessions are rising currently making up a greater percentage of total mortgages than at any other time since the late s they had been on a downward trend but turned a corner in and have been steadily rising since
