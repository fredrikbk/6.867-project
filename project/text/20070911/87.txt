red terror green terror thirty years ago this month germanys red army faction better known as the baader meinhof gang kidnapped hanns martin schleyer president of the german employers association and murdered his driver and three bodyguards six weeks later on oct the raf murdered schleyer too after the west german government refused to give in to raf demands for the release of its imprisoned leaders that same day three of those leaders andreas baader gudrun ensslin and jan carl raspe committed suicide schleyers body was found the next day in the trunk of a car his mouth stuffed with pine needles an raf communique announced that "we have ended hanns martin schleyers pitiful and corrupt existence his death is meaningless for our pain and our rage " today germans remember these events collectively known as der deutscher herbst or german autumn with a degree of fascination that sometimes borders on nostalgia der spiegel devotes this weeks cover story to it they might remember them too for what they say about the present the sixth anniversary of the attacks of sept is upon us as is another manifesto from osama bin laden as is another foiled terrorist attack in germany is the autumn of so different from this one how significantly does the red terror of the raf differ from the green terror of radical islam in some respects it differs considerably the raf wanted to overthrow the west german government in favor of a marxist regime bin laden wants to overthrow the arab dictatorships in favor of a unified caliphate and convert the rest of the world to islam baader meinhof was mainly a domestic phenomenon although it had its links with other european and palestinian radicals al qaeda is a genuinely global organization in its years the raf murdered some odd people and maimed another just a short days work for al qaeda "collateral damage" aside baader and friends were selective about their targets sometimes cannily so schleyer for instance had a nazi past and seemed to personify what the baader meinhof gang believed was the fundamental linkage between the third reich and the federal republic al qaeda by contrast murders christians jews hindus shiites and even sunnis without discrimination yet as the details of last weeks foiled plot become clearer the contrast between the practitioners of red and green terrorism starts to blur often the similarities are personal just as ayman al zawahiri had been a doctor and mohamed atta an urban planner before turning to jihad ulrike meinhof and gudrun ensslin had each had prior careers in journalism and publishing these are not the wretched of the earth but the educated and disgruntled children of the bourgeoisie the similarities are also ideological islamism is a political doctrine no less than it is a religious one and in its critique of western society it is indistinguishable from the rhetoric of radical chic "the capitalist system seeks to turn the entire world into a fiefdom of the major corporations under the label of globalization " says bin laden in his latest sermon he also manages to cite noam chomsky on the subject of "the manufacturing of public opinion " while scolding the democrats for not putting a stop to the war in iraq and the bush administration for "not observing the kyoto accord " where have we heard this before anti americanism is the common thread the german terror plot of had as its targets the u s air force base at ramstein and the frankfurt airport which thousands of americans pass through on their way home for its part baader meinhof detonated car bombs at u s military bases in and in the last of these attacks raf cadres birgit hogefeld and eva haule lured american gi edward pimental from a bar murdered him and used his id to park a car bomb at the rhein main air base the bomb killed american airman frank scarton and civilian contractor becky bristol and injured others in march the german parliament held an art exhibit that included a set of photographs of "women under captivity " the portraits were the work of ms haule who had become an accomplished photographer in prison and was quietly released from prison last month the german state also considered the parole of christian klar an unrepentant accomplice in schleyers murder german president horst koehler ultimately decided against early release but claus peymann the director of the berliner ensemble has made it known that mr klar has a job waiting for him as a theater technician the moment he is freed no doubt the latent sympathy for klar haule and the others has something to do with the view that at bottom they are nothing worse than misguided idealists no doubt it also has to do with the fact that once upon a time they were the boy and the girl next door a similar fascination will likely be felt about the life stories of fritz martin gelowicz and daniel martin schneider german converts to islam who were among those planning this months attacks up to a point these reactions are fairly natural terrorists have always relied on the morbid fascination their actions tend to exert among ordinary people fascination which usually descends to "understanding" and often to a kind of romance despite its ultimate defeat the baader meinhof gang managed to accomplish that trick brilliantly and now its surviving members have earned clemency and become part of a certain folklore whether they deserve it is ultimately up to germans to decide however unjust that may be to their american victims but it might also be asked what effect a rose tinted view of the past has on a clear eyed view of the present todays anniversary makes for a dreadful foreboding
