an intimate look at a quattrocento master desiderio da settignano sculptor of renaissance florence national gallery washington through oct washington desiderio da settignano " the name suggests whats in store that cascade of rhythmic mellifluous syllables more seductive than the flat english "desire from settignano" hints at elegance refinement that dangerous notion beauty and even preciousness these expectations are all amply fulfilled by the works in "desiderio da settignano sculptor of renaissance florence " on view at the national gallery washington through oct organized jointly by the musee du louvre paris the museo nazionale del bargello florence and the national gallery this tightly focused survey is the first international exhibition devoted to the quattrocento master it brings together about sculptures many of them the exquisitely finished portrait busts for which desiderio was much praised during his short lifetime born about to a family of stone cutters in settignano a tuscan town known for its quarries he died in florence in theres a representative selection of devotional reliefs and a few hard to classify works such as a relief of julius caesar and a monumental freestanding marble "shrine" designed to hold the eucharist most of the exhibited works are by desiderio some we are cautiously told are "by the artist and his immediate circle " which included his brother geri its an intimate exhibition restricted of necessity to life size or smaller works the standing figure of a very slim very young st john the baptist clad in a silky sheepskin which may be desiderios best known work did not come to washington from the bargello the most recent scholarship according to the catalog for the current show suggests the sculpture once attributed to donatello then reassigned to the generation younger desiderio is a rare collaboration between the master and his disciple desiderios most important commissions a funerary monument for carlo marsuppini in santa croce florence and a tabernacle for the sacrament in the medici church of san lorenzo are represented by life size photographs desiderios enormous popularity in his own day is attested to by replicas and variants of his best loved works stucco casts of marble reliefs for example or painted plasters made during his lifetime many under his supervision the show reminds us too that many renaissance sculptures were polychromed as gothic ones were to heighten their life likeness while the excellent catalog offers both context and a broad overview it seems that not much is known about desiderio his brilliance at working marble which must have allowed him to leave the family trade is self evident the brother with whom he sometimes collaborated on sculptures a specialist in the warm gray tuscan stone called "pietra serena " was apparently almost as skilled desiderio was obviously very influenced by donatello the leading sculptor of the day he may even have studied with him and if scholars are right about the st john the baptist the two men certainly were well acquainted the exhibitions suavely modulated low reliefs youthful wide eyed madonnas supporting plump cheeked infant christs an ascetic st jerome threatened by a lion christ and st john the baptist as slightly goofy children are plainly responses to donatellos invention of the "rilievo schiacciato" "squeezed relief" what is entirely desiderios own in both the reliefs and the sculptures in the round is the hyper refinement of surface and form the subtle inflections that as the sculptors contemporaries said "bring the marble to life " without it should be noted wholly obscuring the geometry underlying every swelling cheek or slender neck yet theres something retardataire about desiderios sculptures they seem to spring from gothic sensibilities that is to say they seem to celebrate the world of appearances without taking into account the example of antiquity the profile relief of a laurel crowned julius caesar portrayed as a fine boned elderly florentine comes as a surprising reminder of the renaissance appetite for the classical past the most striking quality of virtually every work by desiderio in the show whether its a bust of an elaborately coiffed introspective young woman a chubby cheeked pouting toddler an adolescent saint or an affectionate madonna is the impossible delicacy of touch that allowed the sculptor to render convincingly tendrils of windblown hair aristocratically narrow noses and chiseled lips all without lapsing into finickiness well most of the time anyway the combination of near painful elegance sweetness and uncanny naturalism can make desiderios sculpture problematic after a while the relentless loveliness begins to cloy we become impatient with the lowered eyelids with the parted lips that suggest that the sculptures were drawing breath with the tilted heads that imply movement the perfection of every surface becomes exasperating yet just as we decide weve had enough adorable bambini and smiling madonnas we are ravished however reluctantly by the carving of a fold of drapery a lock of hair a cascading ribbon maybe thats what excited desiderios contemporaries its still quite remarkable ms wilkin is the curator of "color as field american painting " opening this fall at the denver art museum
