secular engineer how a muslim billionaire thrives in hindu india mr premji has wealth and clout as wipro chief the imam disapproves bangalore india the worlds richest muslim entrepreneur defies conventional wisdom about islamic tycoons he doesnt hail from the persian gulf he didnt make his money in petroleum and he definitely doesnt wear his faith on his sleeve a native of mumbai azim premji has tapped indias abundant engineering talent to transform a family vegetable oil firm wipro ltd into a technology and outsourcing giant by serving western manufacturers airlines and utilities the company has brought mr premji a fortune of some &# billion believed to be greater than that of any other muslim outside of persian gulf royalty such success mr premji says in an interview shows that globalization a force islamist activists decry as western neocolonialism is turning into "two way traffic" that can bring tangible benefits to developing countries mr premjis rise is already inspiring some indian muslims to embrace the modern globalized world "hes an icon he shows that excellence has no caste and no creed and that if one has excellence one can make it to the top " says mohamed javeed principal of bangalores predominantly muslim al ameen college one of the students mohammed nasseer enthuses "id love to become like premji one day " a role model like mr premji might seem to be what indias muslims need though the countrys economy is growing at a year the vast majority of indias estimated million muslims the largest islamic population in the world after indonesia and pakistan remain socially marginalized badly educated and mired in deep poverty by and large theyre left out of the social transformation that is propelling millions of their hindu compatriots into prosperity as barriers of caste disappear and indias new corporate giants provide opportunities that never existed before yet to many in indias muslim community mr premjis enormous wealth far from being inspiring shows that success comes at a price the truly faithful cannot accept they resent that mr premji plays down his religious roots and declines to embrace muslim causes in a nation where people are pegged by their religion and where hindus freely flaunt theirs "if you are a muslim and want to be rich in india you have to show you are very secular " says zafarul islam khan secretary general of the all india muslim majlis e mushawarat an umbrella group a muslim school a half hours drive from mr premjis bangalore home reveals the chasm between this globalist success story and the countrys muslim masses students sitting cross legged on the floor of the masjid e takwa madrassa spend their days memorizing the quran in arabic a language that neither they nor their teacher understand the classes are taught in urdu a tongue thats largely confined to muslims and uses the arabic script there is no science in the curriculum neither is there english the language in which wipro conducts business and interviews job applicants as it looks for westernized staff who can deal with international customers the madrassas imam munir ahmed says that for his students a future as self employed shopkeepers or peddlers is preferable to seeking formal work at a large company "a job is like being a slave " mr ahmed chuckles adding that his graduates are in great demand as teachers in other madrassas schoolboys in the streets nearby asked about wipro say theyve never heard of it or of mr premji the condition of indias muslims is rooted in the partition of the subcontinent along religious lines in amid horrendous massacres millions of muslims fled to the newly formed muslim majority state of pakistan just as most of pakistans hindus and sikhs escaped to india the muslims who abandoned india included large numbers of the most educated and successful those remaining after partition have become "economically socially educationally indias most backward community " says mahmood madani a parliament member who is secretary general of indias leading muslim religious organization jamiat ulema e hind by some economic and social measures muslims are even losing out to dalits the erstwhile "untouchables" who are at the very bottom of the hindu caste hierarchy illiteracy is higher among muslims than among dalits in the key to age group although muslims account for more than of indias population they make up only of undergraduates in indias version of the ivy league the seven indian institutes of technology the underrepresentation is just as severe in the nations bureaucratic elite muslims make up of staff in the indian administrative service and of the diplomatic corps only a few of the muslims who stayed behind in india after partition have managed to prosper including some bollywood stars and a p j abdul kalam who until recently held the largely ceremonial post of indian president "the muslims we have in india are mostly the poor and the laborers and a few very rich people like premji " says ramachandra guha a prominent historian with the country regularly rocked by bombings carried out by radicalized muslim groups such as the twin attacks that killed people in the technology hub of hyderabad in late august even many hindu politicians and academics see an urgent need to bridge the economic divide between the muslim minority and the hindu majority the indian government is considering measures to extend to most muslims the affirmative action benefits that have long reserved a large share of government jobs and university places for dalits and other underprivileged groups unlike those observers and muslim community leaders mr premji bristles impatiently when the plight of the broader muslim populace is cited "this whole issue of hindu muslim in india is completely overhyped " the year old executive says mr premji has mentioned his muslim background so rarely in public that many indian muslims dont even know he shares their heritage none of wipros senior managers aside from mr premji himself are muslims the company maintains normal working hours on islamic high holidays among its employees theres only a "sprinkling" of muslims according to sudip banerjee president of a division that accounts for a third of revenue mr premjis private philanthropy is dispensed through a foundation thats managed by a hindu former wipro executive and cuts across religious lines after the sept terrorist attacks u s officials asked the aziz premji foundation to help start an education program that would instill moderate values in islamic schools the foundation declined the religion focused project according to its chief executive because "we are working for all " in an interview at wipros sleek bangalore campus which had just been visited by a group of israeli businessmen mr premji scoffed at the idea he should display his muslim identity or champion the cause of muslim advancement in india "weve always seen ourselves as indian weve never seen ourselves as hindus or muslims or christians or buddhists " he said these secularist values came to him naturally there was no madrassa in mr premjis own education he attended a mumbai catholic school st marys and then studied electrical engineering at stanford university in palo alto calif as a prominent muslim businessman in the s mr premjis late father m h premji faced repeated requests for support from pakistans fiery founder mohammed ali jinnah who offered the father a cabinet minister job in the new muslim country but the premji family didnt believe in a religious state and refused to move "we did not think in these terms " mr premji says "there were roots in india there were roots in bombay why should one in any way dislodge these roots " while indias muslim groups complain about facing daily discrimination mr premji says the only time he has been singled out because of his muslim heritage wasnt in india but at a u s airport shortly after in doing business in india he maintains "i dont think being a muslim or being a non muslim has been an advantage or disadvantage its just been based on the merits of the opportunities " hes been adroit at seizing those after the death of his father in he took the helm at wipro at the age of against the wishes of board members who wanted seasoned management long publicly traded although controlled by the premji family with of the stock the company then had annual sales of only &# million it was known as western india vegetable product ltd and mostly produced a kind of sunflower oil called vanaspati a staple of indian cuisine mr premji set out to diversify and a break came in when a coalition of hindu nationalists socialists and others displaced the ruling congress party the new government clamped down on multinationals prompting the exodus of corporate giants like international business machines corp and coca cola co mr premji stepped in beginning to manufacture computers and other electronics "the space was opened because imports were banned into india or imports were very expensive because of duty tariffs " he recalls he set up shop in bangalore a southern city whose dry highland air is well suited for assembling electronics he hired managers and engineers from indias large military industry wipro became a major manufacturer of technology hardware the bonanza ended in the early s as a different indian government seeing capitalism rise in former eastern bloc nations abandoned socialism and eased import restrictions this created something of a crisis for wipro and other electronics manufacturers "the goods and services that we produced were no longer needed because customers could buy whats best and available on the global market " says wipros mr banerjee while many of wipros peers didnt survive the change mr premji spotted another opportunity in the upheaval wipro went to the foreign companies with which it did business when it was a manufacturer such as general electric co and sun microsystems inc and offered a new relationship at relatively low cost its high quality engineers could take on outsourced work such as design research and testing wipros outsourcing business now spans the gamut it has simple call center management but it also designs mobile phones for leading international brands it runs the computer systems of european utilities and does full service business consulting in the fiscal year ended march wipros profit surged to &# million as sales climbed to &# billion the shares which are also traded on the new york stock exchange have tripled in value over the past five years giving the company a market value of some &# billion as wipro becomes a global powerhouse company officials say they seek to hire the best regardless of creed they say that among the reasons few indian muslims meet wipros stringent standards is that they often study in urdu rather than english and rarely pursue engineering degrees urdu which is also the official language of pakistan is intertwined with islamic identity on the subcontinent in southern india where most of the countrys technology industry is based hindus speak a number of regional languages and are more likely to study english "all our hiring staff are trained to interview in english " mr premji says "theyre trained to look for westernized segments because we deal with global customers " out of every resumes received only one or two usually come from muslim applicants according to a former manager in wipros human resources department yet as outsourcing giants like wipro and infosys have grown and hired the attitudes of some muslims toward education are slowly beginning to change bangalores al ameen college is run by a movement that seeks to modernize the muslim community about graduate and undergraduate students both men and women are currently studying for computer science degrees most are muslims including pious young men with long beards and women with an islamic hejab that covers their hair though not their faces many graduates have already gotten jobs at companies like wipro and infosys says the colleges principal mr javeed and have started to earn salaries well above those offered outside the booming technology industry "this has brought awareness to the muslim community about the need to pursue higher education " he says "people are beginning to realize that education is power that education is money that education is an opportunity "
