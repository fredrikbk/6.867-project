petraeus pledges modest pullout but little more washington the two top u s officials in iraq sketched out a plan to end the troop surge by next summer but they left unanswered questions about how quickly the pullout would proceed beyond july and how u s strategy might shift if iraqs civil war continues gen david petraeus the top military commander in iraq said he would send home a marine unit of about troops later this month and pull out a soldier brigade in mid december by mid july of next year he predicted the u s would have about troops in iraq down from today he wouldnt give specifics beyond that date "our experience in iraq has repeatedly shown that projecting too far in the future is not just difficult it can be misleading and even hazardous " gen petraeus testified before congress despite attacks on gen petraeus and his report from antiwar critics on the left the modest drawdown appears sufficient to satisfy moderate republicans who have called for some kind of reduction by the end of the year the support of these lawmakers who were wavering earlier this summer likely means democrats wont have enough votes to override a presidential veto and force a change in course in almost six hours of testimony gen petraeus and ambassador ryan crocker did little to address issues that are likely to move to the forefront after the surge ends how will the mission of u s troops change as their numbers fall what happens if iraqi factions make no progress in reconciliation by next summer senior military officials have said for months that the badly strained military couldnt sustain the troop surge beyond this august without extending soldiers tours beyond months defense secretary robert gates has repeatedly said he isnt considering that option so the reduction outlined by gen petraeus over the next months is essentially the smallest he could offer democratic lawmakers complained the cuts outlined by gen petraeus were too modest rep tom lantos a california democrat who is chairman of the house foreign affairs committee branded them a "token withdrawal " gen petraeus swiftly rejected that notion calling it a "very substantial withdrawal " the generals plan reflects his belief that the extra u s forces have helped cut attacks on u s troops and iraqis since june he contends that if u s troops are pulled out too quickly the gains made in dismantling radical shiite and sunni insurgent organizations would be lost gen petraeus documented his views with charts showing big drops in the number of roadside bombs suicide car bombs and iraqi civilian deaths he acknowledged that progress in reconciliation is far murkier both president bush and democratic critics of the war in congress agree that continued feuding among iraqi factions in particular between shiite militias and sunni insurgents represents iraqs greatest challenge mr crocker who took over as the american ambassador in baghdad in january urged patience saying that the "seeds of reconciliation are being planted " mr crocker offered few new ideas on how the u s intends to use its dwindling leverage to promote political reconciliation he suggested progress at the local level could force movement at the national level he didnt endorse any of the tactics that some critics are putting forward such as threatening an imminent u s withdrawal to pressure iraqs government nor did he put any faith in the idea of an internationally brokered deal similar to the dayton agreements in that ended the fighting in the former yugoslavia rather he and gen petraeus said the best way to get the warring parties to reconcile was to reduce violence in the country and provide "breathing space" for negotiations "i do believe that iraqs leaders have the will to tackle the countrys pressing problems although it will take longer than we originally anticipated because of the environment and the gravity of the issues before them " mr crocker said democratic lawmakers rejected the notion that such a passive approach could force the iraqis to make painful compromises "why should we continue sending our young men and women to fight and die if the iraqis wont make the tough sacrifices leading to reconciliation " asked rep ike skelton a missouri democrat "are we merely beating a dead horse " sen carl levin a michigan democrat has long insisted that warring iraqis will only reach an accommodation if they believe that u s forces are leaving and they have no other choice to avoid widespread chaos still democratic lawmakers who questioned the current u s strategy went out of their way to praise gen petraeus and distance themselves from boisterous "code pink" protesters who periodically interrupted the proceedings gen petraeus and mr crocker delivered their testimony in a somnolent monotone buttressed with plenty of statistics and graphics in one of the graphics gen petraeus suggested that over time u s forces would shift from protecting iraqis and teaming up with iraqi troops tasks that require u s soldiers to operate deep inside some of the most dangerous iraqi neighborhoods to an "overwatch mission " in that role u s forces would be responsible for bailing out iraqi army and police forces if they were overwhelmed gen petraeus who previously was in charge of training and equipping iraqi security forces which include the army and police warned that the u s should proceed slowly on this score "we have learned before that there is a real danger in handing over tasks to iraqi security forces before their capacity and local conditions warrant " he said in iraq prime minister nouri al maliki who has come in for sharp criticism from both democratic and republican lawmakers over the lack of political progress agreed that iraqi troops werent ready to take over in the country "despite the security improvement we still need more efforts and time in order for our armed forces to be able to take over security in all iraqi provinces " he told iraqs parliament shortly before the u s officials testimony mr crocker meanwhile echoed recent suggestions by some democratic lawmakers that an iraq dominated by strong regional governments and a weak center might provide a way out of the sectarian violence in recent months u s officials have worked closely with tribal leaders to build security forces that can guard their communities the widespread cleansing campaigns of and early have also separated iraq into more homogenous regions "no longer is an all powerful baghdad seen as the panacea to iraqs problems " he said iraqs parliament has struggled for more than a year to draft and pass a national oil law that would lay out how the central government would share oil revenues with iraqs provinces here too mr crocker called for patience arguing that the oil law was a mirror of the larger debate about what kind of country the iraqis want he said iraqs political developments are now on an "upward" trajectory "although that line is not steep " in baghdad iraqi leaders counseled patience in other critical areas such as the effort to loosen laws banning members of iraqs former ruling baath party from returning to government work the draft of the law has just been submitted to parliament where it will likely encounter fierce debate in the coming days "its a very sensitive subject for the iraqi people " said humam hamoudi a senior shiite legislator "if we give benefits to baathists we also need to give benefits to those who suffered from them " see related letter "letters to the editor democrats power play" wsj september philip
