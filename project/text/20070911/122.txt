why wagoner is key in uaw talks gm chief seeks transforming labor deal that may be big three blueprint detroit general motors corp s chief executive has a lot on the line as talks enter the home stretch with the big three u s auto makers and the united auto workers union on a new collective bargaining agreement whereas ford motor co and chrysler llc are in the formative periods of massive reorganizations with a pair of industry outsiders gradually drawing blueprints for survival gms rick wagoner has been at the helm for more than seven years and gm has been in restructuring mode for two years gms financial performance has improved in recent quarters but an inability to generate profits in its core north american unit is a nagging problem the negotiations with the uaw are considered critical to trim the companys bloated cost structure and create the conditions for sustainable profitability mr wagoner declined to comment on negotiations citing a media blackout gm and its domestic rivals are entering the eighth week of negotiations with the uaw on a contract to replace the four year deal that expires friday as negotiators meet daily people familiar with the talks say the union has yet to give a definitive response on whether it will negotiate a proposal under which it would take responsibility for a trust or a collection of trusts that would manage the tens of billions of dollars worth of health care obligations the auto makers owe uaw retirees the lack of progress sets the stage for what could become a complicated dialogue over the big threes need for change and the uaws need to show strength in the face of unprecedented demands as gm walked into the negotiations the year old mr wagoners top priority was leaning on the union to further address the auto makers health care burden the company has about &# billion in retirement obligations for uaw retirees and their families and that liability results in &# billion in cash expenses annually or nearly &# per light vehicle sold last year in the u s as gm which already extracted concessions from the union on health care in sees sales in north america decline and medical expenses inflate at double digit rates the burden gets heavier by the day as part of the negotiations gm put two proposals on the table for the uaw according to people familiar with the proposals one involves the establishment of a union run health care trust or veba which would be funded by gm cash debt and possibly stock a veba which stands for voluntary employees beneficiary association would clean considerable risk off the balance sheet and significantly reduce the annual costs associated with the liability the other option excludes the veba but calls for deeper more painful cuts in several areas so that gm can inch closer to labor cost parity with its chief rival toyota motor corp gm has pushed the veba option hard telling the uaw that the arrangement would protect against unilateral retiree health care cuts by the auto maker in the future if needed uaw president ron gettelfinger entered the talks with the u s auto makers saying the union wasnt in a concessionary mood if there isnt an agreement by friday it is likely the auto makers and the uaw would continue negotiations and the current contract would be extended a strike is considered unlikely as it isnt uncommon for the talks to go past the deadline mr wagoners relationship with the uaw has been a complex balancing act while developing close ties with the union and earning the trust of union officials who are loath to cede ground to the auto makers mr wagoner has also taken steps to reduce gms reliance on the uaw significantly expanding sales in emerging markets and accelerating efforts to reorganize the companys manufacturing base into a global footprint in two years before becoming chief executive mr wagoner and fellow gm managers weathered a uaw strike in flint mich that cost the company &# billion according to jack smith mr wagoners predecessor at gm the strike reshaped the executive teams approach to union negotiations after the battle gm said it would "develop a relationship here and were going to stay very close " mr smith said in a recent interview mr wagoners trademark low profile style has served him well as he tackled that challenge mostly behind the scenes lunching with top union officials including mr gettelfinger on several occasions to explain the issues facing the business in the beginning of mr wagoners proficiency in the art of negotiation came under the spotlight as he took the unusual step of publicly demanding health care cost cuts in the middle of an existing contract gm had abruptly fallen into red ink as demand for the companys most profitable sport utility vehicles slowed in the u s after a summer of negotiations gm cut a deal saving the company billions while forcing uaw members to take relatively modest benefit cuts the uaw soon made similar concessions to ford but refused to do likewise for chrysler meantime gm has already begun using its expanding global footprint as a negotiating tool with the uaw mr wagoner who early in his career told superiors he wasnt really interested in working in international operations is now looking at india as the companys next frontier following success in brazil china and russia by the turn of the decade gm will be able to build most of its significant u s products outside the country greatly diminishing the uaws power to strike in the next round of contract talks according to people familiar with the strategy
