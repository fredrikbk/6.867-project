game over for a corruption battling videogame in china it seemed like a good idea at the time two years ago a group of officials in the bustling second tier chinese city of ningbo near shanghai took the initiative to battle government corruption at the grass roots level they enlisted chinas growing armies of online videogame players in the fight ningbo created an elaborate online role playing game called incorruptible warrior in which players wield weapons and supernatural powers to kill corrupt government officials their bikini clad mistresses and even their families players could pick off people with a single stroke or torture their quarry by striking repeated blows to the face they were guided by characters drawn from chinese history or legend and shepherded through a virtual world corresponding to real places in ningbo so it was that at the height of the humid shanghai summer wu jiabin a year old player found himself walking through virtual snow sword in hand hunting for any sign of a corrupt official in centuries old chinese clothing he had instructions from emperor kangxi who ruled china for real from to "turmoil is prevalent with countless corrupted officials to heal the world i order you to kill the major corrupted official called he shen who was extremely greedy has the historic record for bribes in history and committed significant crimes i order you to get heads of he shen " incorruptible warrior went live in july for about three weeks before it was taken down the ningbo government hasnt offered an explanation though at one point it posted a message on the games main web site citing technical difficulties officials of chinas ministry of culture which regulates the online games industry and normally would be the agency to shutter a game for excessive violence or other violations said they had nothing to do with shutting down incorruptible warrior other central government officials in beijing declined to comment or didnt respond to requests for an interview the game went live amid a rash of high level corruption cases from the july execution of the nations top drug watchdog for graft to last falls disgrace of the shanghai communist party boss for mismanaging pension funds it also sparked heated debate on the chinese internet which at million users is now the second largest following the u s still some players and industry analysts theorize that incorruptible warrior was less a victim of chinese politics than of shaky history slow speeds and bad design "lots of people laughed at the graphics " observes leon zhang a blogger from nanjing online gamers in china take their virtual lives seriously and "massive multiple player online role playing game " or mmorpgs are extremely popular in one game created by

central government is pushing to build up something called the online game fatigue system which seeks to shield young people from too much exposure to internet violence and pornography despite its short life and audience of only about players incorruptible warrior caused considerable discussion among bloggers and forum posters in china some applauded the idea of spreading the anticorruption message through a pop culture medium shun feng a technology blogger from yangzhou and author of "new theories on blogging" and "the kingdom of internet " said it was a "good try" by the ningbo government to get common people involved "the common practice in china is to leave the whole anticorruption thing to the government but the youngsters are the ones with the potential to become corruptible politicians that is why we need to educate them " said shun feng the bloggers pen name those who opposed the game warned it would be sending a misguided message to youth who are spending

games technical flaws may be still keener mr wu who works at a shanghai game company complained that incorruptible warrior was sluggish and that he spent "five minutes killing one he shen " players say incorruptible warrior was also riddled with chinese character mistakes and mismatched historical facts "he shen was an official under qianlongs rule " mr wu said "if qianlong is the grandson of kangxi how could kangxi know about he shen " in the end there were just too many technical issues for the game to take off said liu bin an analyst at bda "peak concurrent users were over but the game web site only supported " he said by contrast popular mmorpg games can support thousands and in some cases tens or hundreds of thousands of concurrent players local news reports cite a ningbo social affairs official as having created incorruptible warrior originally to play with his friends and after getting positive feedback being given a budget of chinese yuan about &# by his supervisors to
