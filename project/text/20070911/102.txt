the afternoon report opecs move online edition in opecs first meeting in six months the oil cartel moved tuesday to raise production quotas in bid to take energy price anxiety out of the mixture of concerns weighing on the global economy opec will raise production quotas by barrels a day qatars oil minister confirmed at midday establishing a new daily production ceiling of million barrels abdullah bin hamad al attiyah told reporters the increase would be based on its current production meaning the cartel would add actual oil to the market egypts oil minister samir fahmy had said earlier tuesday that opec ministers were concerned about current high oil prices which are once again flirting with record levels "they are discussing the price levels this and next year " he said "there is generally full agreement that they should stabilize the market and should have reasonable prices this year and next year " the decision which will take effect on nov emerged after members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries appeared mired in a factional dispute over oil prices saudi arabia was thought to have led a group of persian gulf nations that sought to increase production while a rival group of ministers had indicated their satisfaction with the current levels of production and a willingness to see how the economy reacted to recent turmoil analysts expect rising oil demand growth in the face of a potentially chilly winter in the u s europe and asia the opec decision came as oil prices flirted with record levels north of &# a barrel and the markets initial reaction suggests the modest amount of extra oil may not slow the bullish market the opec news eased prices slightly at midday with crude oil off cents to &# a barrel the proposal to lift production by equivalent from about from current actual production may prove largely symbolic as the cartel already produces more oil that existing official quota levels would allow and members routinely violate the cartels production caps but even if the new quota only brings a little fresh oil to the market some analysts saw the move as indicating a broader concern the higher quota is "not about justifying overproduction or meeting market demand " said mike rothman head of international strategy and investments integrated oil research "its about the saudis signaling they want oil prices down from where they are " but brian hicks fund manager at u s global investors global resources fund said the increase "is not enough to change the tightness in the market going into the fourth quarter " the decision came as a surprise for oil markets which have been pushing benchmark crude futures towards record territory in recent weeks kuwaits acting oil minister mohammad al olaim said the move reflected opecs shared concern with energy consumers over prices "we think that the market price is little bit high so were supporting sustained economic growth " he said simon wardell an analyst at global insight in london said the u s subprime mortgage crisis may have crystallized the issue for saudi arabia "with prices so high the saudis may now be more willing to take the risk in their eyes of an increase in oil production " he said despite political talk about energy independence the saudi sensitivity to a weakening u s economy underscores americas continued dependence on
