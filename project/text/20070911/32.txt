drinks at home heres looking at you kids in regard to "a toast to the family" by stanton peele editorial page aug about parents who allow teens to drink alcohol at home and the laws targeting the parents my parents allowed my friends and me to drink at my house it is only now years later that i understand and respect how brave and protective my parents actions were i say "brave" because they were breaking the law and could have been prosecuted i say "protective" because they knew that having us in the backyard kept us safe away from the much more risky activity of drinking and driving around town like so many other teens while most parents hope that their teenagers will not drink alcohol or smoke marijuana the reality is that of high school seniors will have tried alcohol by the time they graduate and will have tried marijuana in addition to allowing us to drink beer in the backyard my parents made it clear that my friends and i could always call them for a ride home from a party i understood clearly that they much preferred a call from an intoxicated teenager asking for a ride home than a drunken teenager driving his drunken friends home my parents goal for their two kids was not to practice the unrealistic mission of abstinence but to keep us safe by encouraging responsibility in this regard they were incredibly successful we never got into trouble with the law and never got into an accident or a fight that involved alcohol we learned how to drink in a way that didnt lead to injury to others or ourselves tony newman communications director drug policy alliance new york
