business day sign up for the e mail here last fridays gloomy government report on the lack of u s job creation may have shifted debate at the federal reserve from the question of whether to lower interest rates to whether a quarter point cut is enough but it hasnt added much certainty to the cloudy economic waters fed officials are trying to understand and navigate the key issue remains how much the housing market downturn has sapped consumers ability and willingness to spend and how much this will reverberate through business spending and hiring and that was a topic several senior fed officials discussed without reaching conclusions in previously scheduled speeches yesterday the most concern was expressed by janet yellen president of the federal reserve bank of san francisco the wall street journal reports she noted that downside risks to the economy had risen "appreciably" because of the recent turbulence in credit and housing markets but reiterated what has become a fed tenet in recent months that the fallout of such disruptions "can turn out to be surprisingly small " "a big issue is whether developments in the relatively small housing sector will spread to the large consumption sector perhaps through declines in house prices " ms yellen said "should the decline in house prices occur in the context of rising unemployment the risks could be significant " like other regional fed bank presidents speaking yesterday ms yellen doesnt currently have one of the rotating voting slots on the federal open market committee though she participates in fomc meetings fed governor frederic mishkin who also spoke yesterday and does vote and who has longstanding ties to fed chairman ben bernanke as the new york times notes seemed more vigilant than pessimistic at the best of times government economic statistics are estimates that look backward and only over time capture what truly happens across a broad diverse u s economy and mr mishkin noted the fed right now has to make "real time judgments" about how a lowering of its short term interest rates will affect the situation the summer retrenchment in stock markets and housing prices had both psychological and bankbook effects he added "at least some households are likely to find it more difficult or expensive to borrow and consumer sentiment which turned down in august could soften further if households become more anxious about recent financial market developments " he said and while some august surveys suggested businesses are still confident enough to spend "all this could change noticeably if many firms were to face significantly tighter credit conditions or if business sentiment were to soften appreciably " moreover mr mishkin indicated fed worries about potential inflation risks until recently the dominant concern have subsided a bit "given the greater downside risks to real growth " fridays u s payroll report showing a decline of jobs in august rather than a generally predicted increase of came as such a jolt because previous fed readings on employment like last weeks beige book painted a much rosier picture the timing made clear the report wasnt a result of the market turmoil but rather a symptom of the same underlying economic problems that probably stem from the housing market and it wasnt the jobs that were cut much of them in construction or housing related manufacturing like the furniture industry that were so worrying as the jobs that werent created thats a more difficult area to measure and one that fed officials will likely be wrestling with when they meet next week managing import risks a panel appointed by president bush to find better ways of policing the safety of imported products recommended that what it called "smarter " risk based precautions replace the safeguards currently in place for the likes of food and toys "one way to think about this is that our current strategy is really a snapshot at the border " said health and human services secretary mike leavitt who led the agency task force as the los angeles times reports "were recommending a change that would create a video in essence through the entire process " in the new system "the government would collect data from private and public sources identify safety hazards along the entire life cycle of the imported products and manage the risk earlier in the import process " the wall street journal explains adding that such a database is already under development and that its implementation could be moved up to from the bush administration the journal notes "has been grappling with import safety issues in the wake of a string of recalls and problem products including toys tires seafood and tainted pet food ingredients almost all from china " a deadline nears for detroit and uaw in their eighth week of negotiations and after days of what the detroit news describes as tense bargaining the united auto workers union and the big three car makers still arent close to agreement on one of the key provisions in any new contracts the creation of trusts that would assume the health care and retirement liabilities weighing down the auto industry such a transfer of responsibility to the union from the companies would be financed by billions of dollars from general motors ford motor and chrysler and insiders tell the news that the chances of reaching a deal by friday when the old contracts expire are "getting dicey with so much work to be done " the health care provisions aside the uaw will also have "a hard time winning promises of new work from detroit auto makers which experts say still have too many plants in north america " the detroit free press reports "even after announcing the closure of factories and other facilities in the past few years detroit auto makers will have to get the uaw to agree to close even more under" the new contract also of note wall street joural the two top u s officials in iraq sketched out a plan to end the troop
