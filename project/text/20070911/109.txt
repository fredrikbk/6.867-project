the game fear the roller coaster embrace it in these markets everyones afraid its your response to the fear that matters most are you going to crack up like howard dean in or detach yourself analyze and respond like neil armstrong in astronauts firefighters and soldiers train to respond to moments of duress the rest of us are left on our own and in most cases the results arent good we generally underestimate the true dangers arrayed against us overplaying the dramatically violent outcomes over the more insidious ones and in times when we lack information were prone to imagine the worst scientists say we are only as effective as our emotions allow us which is precisely why this current market is so daunting consider the unknowns still in play the choked market for short term corporate funding the impossible to value mounds of lbo debt and equity the daisy chain effect between liquidating hedge funds and the broader market its a far different situation than the market drop of when the downturn was spurred by the relatively simple concept that technology stocks were broadly overvalued whats the best way to handle all of this lingering fear some inspiration comes from a group of researchers who have been applying new techniques to get an answer the researchers have begun studying professional traders as if they were chimps even using mri machines to divine how fear affects the brain "we are responding from a different part of the brain when we are in the midst of calm clear thought " says brett steenbarger a psychiatry professor at the state university of new yorks upstate medical university who also trains traders and hedge fund managers that area is the prefrontal cortex what he calls the "executive" node of the brain that plans and reasons when we are fearful blood flows away from the area toward the motor areas of the brain the ones that produce a flight or fight sensation this is great if youre confronting a saber toothed tiger but not so great if youre mulling your daughters college fund "you end up making decisions rashly without engaging in research and planning that you might otherwise do " he explains dr steenbarger has found that the most important step is to get back to basics to methodically check whether the hypothesis that got you into an investment still applies or not the next step of controlling market fear may be to eliminate as much borrowing as possible he adds leverage he says magnifies financial results and therefore emotional swings during times of high volatility this can become an especially dangerous trap for bad decision making andrew lo a professor at massachusetts institute of technology has observed professional traders in their natural habitats hes found that there is some truth to the idea of the cool hand luke palms of veteran traders get less sweaty than novice ones after especially stressful moments these traders return to a standard physiological baseline the novices "are all over the map " dr lo says he recommends two other means of coping with financial fear the first sounds simple but is essential training yourself to recognize fear in the first place for example your habit may be to avoid the markets altogether by shunning the newspaper or online stock quotes the second approach is to prepare for a busted or volatile market much like an astronaut rehearsing emergency procedures this helps neutralize the fear in your decision making especially in those moments when it seems so easy to succumb thats why it might make sense to decide ahead of time your range of responses if your portfolio loses say to of its value research has shown that unsurprisingly retail investors are usually the worst at this adds dr lo neil armstrongs cool is on vivid display in the wonderful new movie "in the shadow of the moon " about the apollo lunar missions in one fraught moment mr armstrong is running low on fuel as he pilots the spacecraft to the moons surface the cameras pan to the smoking sweating wonks in mission control piped in by radio mr armstrongs voice sounds unshaken almost blase his best human trait his intellect has subdued his most animal one his fear thats been the experience of year old lewis van amerongen formerly of private equity firm gibbons green goodwin &amp van amerongen having pioneered the buyout business the firm got bogged down in the now infamous "burning bed" purchase of ohio mattress co in the late s when the junk bond market collapsed soon afterward bank first boston couldnt refinance a &# million bridge loan and ended up owning most of the company "each generation has to go through it and has to emotionally experience it " mr van amerongen said in an interview "without that its just an academic exercise " in other words there is no substitute for having survived other fearful experiences the best antidote for fear just may be fear itself email dennis berman wsj com
