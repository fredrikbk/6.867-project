in defense of mattel what is going on at mattel ive heard this question many times over the course of the past few weeks as weve conducted three voluntary recalls of products due to impermissible levels of lead in paint ive heard from concerned parents employees my neighbors former colleagues and even my own children i think just about everyone knows weve had recalls thats good it means we have achieved our main goal of successfully communicating widely and openly with our many constituents media coverage of the recalls overall has been helpful in spreading the news to consumers unfortunately in some cases opinions have been attributed to me that ive never held let alone expressed more seriously the character of mattel has been maligned weve even been accused of being "unapologetic" by the very same newspaper in which we ran full page ads apologizing i apologize again i want to make clear where i stand and look forward to doing the same before congress i fully support the u s consumer product safety commission and the vital work that it does we have worked closely and respectfully with the cpsc throughout this difficult period and i applaud its prompt actions and professionalism as a father of four i am intimately aware of the expectations of parents they want safe toys and they want assurances that those toys have been tested to make sure that theyre safe currently lead paint is topmost on parents minds i want parents to be assured that we are taking action to complement our many existing safeguards we have implemented a strengthened three stage safety check system to prevent lead in paint first we require that only paint from certified suppliers be used and that every single batch of paint at every single vendor be tested if it doesnt pass it doesnt get used no exceptions second we have significantly increased testing and unannounced inspections at every stage of the production process finally finished toys from every production run must be tested for lead to ensure they are safe before reaching store shelves mattel is conducting a thorough investigation combing through our products to ensure that we identify and recall any product affected by lead paint no matter how tiny the area the level of detail in our findings is indicative of how intensively we are searching for example we identified lead paint on the headlights of a three inch train car and we recalled it if there is a needle in the proverbial haystack we aim to find it i encourage other companies to do the same our toys are overwhelmingly safe to date our lead related recalls of toys produced in the past months represent less than half of of our production id rather the number was zero as we continue our lead paint testing its possible that we could find more items that have parts that may not meet our specifications obviously i hope we dont find anything else but if we find any issue no matter how small we will work closely with authorities world wide to inform consumers quickly and take prompt corrective action there has been quite a lot of talk about toy testing in past weeks i also want to talk about this test of mattel as an organization and what people can expect from us moving forward it is my sincere pledge that we will face this challenge with integrity and reaffirm that we will do the right thing we will embrace this test of our company and the opportunity to become better when i was a young man growing up in suburban chicago my father encouraged me to earn his trust through my actions rather than just talk about what i was going to do today i tell my children "deeds not words " and it is on this principle that mattel will move forward we will earn back your trust with our deeds not just with our words mr eckert is chairman and ceo of mattel see related letter "letters to the editor big monster supports mattel ceo bob eckert" wsj sept
