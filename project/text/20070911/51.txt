hotel chains grapple with meaning of green marriott starwood face confusing products standards in bids to make lodging environmentally friendly as director of element a brand of environmentally conscious hotels being developed by starwood hotels &amp resorts world wide inc nicholas lakas picks his way across a landscape of so called green products each time he steps into his office among the items salt and pepper shakers billed as recyclable piles of towels and sheets made with organically grown fibers boxes of organic snacks and a countertop slab made from recycled materials "we get so many products so many phone calls " mr lakas says "i have nowhere to put it and we are always looking at it and evaluating it " he is shopping for environmentally friendly products from plates and light bulbs to heating and air conditioning systems to be used in the first hotel in the planned chain of starwood announced the brand a year ago pitching it as an environmentally and socially conscious hotel room at a reasonable price as more hotels try to become more environmentally friendly in part to satisfy customers they say are increasingly demanding it they find themselves in unfamiliar territory cluttered with "green" products and hype but without many reliable guideposts for whats effective major corporations including marriott international inc and hilton hotels corp are studying options as they make decisions on far reaching environmental initiatives intended to appeal to consumers with a conscience and at the same time save on water energy and waste without downgrading the quality of service "were currently in what you might call a discovery phase " says kendra walker vice president of brand communications for hilton "were looking at best practices were looking at energy saving light bulbs water saving features " one problem is that there isnt any single standard in the u s for what makes a hotel green nevertheless a myriad of products organizations and consultants are offering their services or stamps of approval to hotels "this is uncharted territory for us " says steve samson vice president of rooms operations for marriott international "you go on the web and you see hotels are selling green hotel rooms but what does that really mean what is it thats what were trying to figure out " marriott which this year established an internal "green council" led by two executives is examining its suppliers and supply chain looking at everything from the kind of toilet paper they buy to how far towels travel from cotton field to factory to hotel which determines how much of a carbon footprint they leave marriott is also asking its suppliers to demonstrate how they save energy or use recycled products in essence to prove they are green vendors are scrambling to make their case to marriott or risk being dropped but confirming the alleged benefits of green products and methods is tricky mr samson says "it seems like once you make a decision about something someone comes back to you and says yeah its okay on that end but its not so great in this other way " he says adding that marriott is considering hiring a third party consultant with environmental expertise sensing strong interest and much confusion from the hotel sector the hotel developers conference a professional organization that hosts an annual industry meeting plans a conference on environmentally friendly hotels in march some hotels have turned to established programs in their efforts to go green marriott for example in joined the u s environmental protection agencys energy star program which has given it public recognition for using lower energy flourescent lighting and reducing greenhouse gas emissions marriott touts its accomplishments on its web site under the heading "green marriott " a handful of hotels have gotten certification from the u s green building council a non profit group in washington that grades commercial buildings on areas such as water efficiency energy use building materials and indoor air quality among them are a hilton in vancouver wash and a marriott at the university of maryland but the standards arent designed specifically for hotels and retrofitting older hotels to qualify can be prohibitively expensive among other options starwood is considering getting certification for its first element hotel scheduled to open next july in lexington mass depending on whats decided green measures could add to to the planned &# millon budget for the hotel mr lakas estimates green seal another non profit organization in washington has an extensive certification program for hotels and motels the evaluation takes up to three months and costs from &# to &# annually depending on the size of the hotel only hotels nationwide have the certification the group says interest is picking up and it is hoping to have another hotels in chicago certified by this fall the "green" hotels association a houston based professional group that charges hotels &# &# a year to join offers a list of approved vendors for products including water saving toilets and chlorine alternatives but they arent vetted beyond a requirement that they send company literature explaining how the product is green "we take their word for it " says patty griffin president and founder of the association which has also since sold a cards to hotels that nudge guests to reuse towels but many lodging operators in the group report mixed results in their efforts to go green even though customers like it "there are so many companies promoting green products the challenge is doing enough research to identify which products are truly green " says dean crane vice president of engineering for aramark harrison lodging with properties in settings from lake powell in arizona to glacier bay national park in alaska "there are many cleaning products that just dont hold up or achieve what they are marketed for " see related letter
