a forest of core curriculum universities hidden by critics trees peter berkowitz dramatically weakens his case for a core liberal arts curriculum with his own lack of thorough research and reporting of data in his sept editorial page commentary "our compassless colleges " as he attempts to argue that his critiques of harvard colleges general education requirements are applicable to all u s higher education he repeatedly uses the vague and imprecise word "many " according to mr berkowitz "many" professors mock the idea of a standard for defining an educated person he asserts that "many" faculty and administrators will simply dismiss his suggestions for a standard core curriculum including two years of a foreign language american government economics biology physics political philosophy european literature american literature and u s history european and classical history he claims that the major obstacles to curriculum reform are professors "many" of whom will fight not to adopt general education requirements that include a common core of courses how many is "many" if among the million faculty members who were teaching in u s higher education in the fall of disagreed with his proposal would that be "many" or would it be just of the approximately liberal arts colleges in the u s how "many" have a core curriculum similar to the one he advocates my colleges mission statement is to "produce good men and good citizens" a goal that requires a sound schooling in the liberal arts to achieve that goal among the courses required in our core curriculum are a common three semester western culture course a two semester rhetoric course a four semester course in a foreign language two semesters of science including biology or physics or chemistry mathematics fine arts literature and either religion or philosophy not a very good example of a "compassless college " is it saranna thornton ph d professor of economics hampden sydney college hampden sydney va mr berkowitz understates the problem liberal arts institutions have not just watered down core curriculum studies they have demonized even the semblance of core studies as subversive rants by dead white males which have not been properly cleansed through the filters of oppression and victimization studies wesleyan university which i entered in actually had an undergraduate curriculum that students were required to complete successfully before selecting a major course of study but today core studies is a nonstarter because of fierce faculty hostility for most faculty cutting edge work is everything and liberal learning pre dating their dissertation is largely irrelevant and thats too bad because a more coherent exposure to the history philosophy literature and other influences that have contributed to our current condition would greatly benefit a nation which is both increasingly diverse and lacking in common roots william n walker new york mr berkowitz neglected to mention the many fine colleges in this country that already offer exactly the type of "core" he is suggesting and that have long appreciated fully what a true "liberal" education requires columbia university in new york and st johns college in annapolis and santa fe are two outstanding examples mr berkowitzs quite predictable focus on harvard is disappointing since harvards undergraduate education has been renowned for decades as decidedly sub par martin j newhouse winchester mass mr berkowitzs commentary makes some valid criticisms of harvards new general education curriculum but unfortunately his solution is far from adequate his proposal is heavy on western history and politics his specialty but leaves out important subjects such as math and statistics which i would argue are particularly critical art and music and psychology and his "dream core" is heavily proscribed and adds up to a whopping courses far more than harvards current eight which is about average this would reduce student freedom considerably and pigeonhole students into taking lots of poorly taught but required courses which is the biggest student complaint about harvards current core curriculum adam guren cambridge mass the writer is a senior at harvard college mr berkowitz seems unaware of a major national movement to provide just the kind of liberal education he advocates to many more students on hundreds of campuses harvard does not represent the leading edge of educational reform in america hundreds of colleges and universities are now actively involved in my organizations liberal education and americas promise leap campaign www aacu org leap through this campaign colleges of all sorts are working to provide their students with a more coherent curriculum and also more engaged learning practices e g community based research and projects through which they are exploring some of the very important issues mr berkowitz raises in fact the report that is guiding the leap initiative college learning for the new global century suggests a new set of principles of excellence including the idea that all colleges should "give students a compass" for their educational journey a compass that will help them obtain the most important outcomes of a good liberal education regardless of their institution or choice of major carol geary schneider president association of american colleges and universities
