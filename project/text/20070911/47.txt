glass artistry in full flower botanical wonders corning museum of glass through nov corning n y jamaica kincaid once called harvard universitys celebrated glass flowers "a genus onto themselves " the late evolutionary biologist stephen jay gould called those staggeringly faithful reproductions of nature the equal of the greatest musical performance hed ever heard then there was the middle aged fellow walking with arms defiantly crossed through "botanical wonders " the corning museum of glass exhibition that celebrates those flowers he called them a very very big disappointment the gentleman and his companion had made a special trip to the museum here in the empire states finger lakes region had paid good money &# each for a close look at the spectacular crystalline specimens on loan from harvard they include the salvia with its gracile spikes and fat indigo buds an apricot plant in luxurious bloom the purple flowering plant succisa and "they dont even look like glass " he fumed other visitors to the museum have been far more appreciative theyve admired the beautiful flowers that look ready to blossom right before their eyes yup theyre lovely all right really gorgeous but where they want to know are the glass flowers theyve heard so much about have come so far to see these reactions are the greatest possible testament to the achievement of leopold blaschka and his son rudolf the th and early th century dresden artisans who created the flowers to aid in the teaching of botany for david whitehouse executive director of the corning museum and co curator of "botanical wonders " transplanting the glass flowers however briefly from cambridge mass to upstate new york was something of a personal crusade he first learned of the blaschkas while in attendance at an archaeology convention in boston in singularly uninspired by the afternoons program offerings "i thought what can i do and because the corning is a museum of glass and id heard of the glass flowers i hopped on the transit system and went to harvard to see them and they just blew me away they are quite extraordinary " the english born dr whitehouse said of the collection pieces made by lampwork employing a flame to melt and shape glass over a year period from the s to the s "just to cap that " he continued "i came back here after the conference and went into our library and naively said do we have anything on the glass flowers i can read up on and the librarians looked at me in a pitying kind of way and said dont you know weve got a blaschka archive " for the record its one that includes original letters order books invoices and what dr whitehouse describes as "a miraculous" collection of sketches and drawings "so that really got me intrigued " he said leopold blaschka was in the family costume jewelry business but for his own enjoyment made glass flowers and plants it was an avocation that got him a commission from a prague prince and horticulturist who wanted some models of orchids that hobby also brought leopold to the attention of the director of the dresden natural history museum who wanted models of invertebrate animals the then standard practice of pickling the creatures in a jar of alcohol didnt exactly cut it "the color leeched out and you ended up with a kind of ghostly thing and because it had no hard parts it collapsed " noted dr whitehouse "you ended up with a container that had a gray blob at the bottom " the prince for whom leopold had made the orchid models told the director of the natural history museum about the existence of a dresden craftsman "who makes wonderful models of flowers " continued dr whitehouse "he told him i imagine he could make you wonderful models of sea anemones " well yes he could and after a bit of persuading he did moving from gems to jelly fish leopold with the eventual participation of rudolf fashioned a thriving mail order business out of the glass animals supplying models to museums in europe india japan and the u s specifically cambridge mass there george lincoln goodale a harvard professor of botany took a short cut through the universitys zoology museum one day and saw some blaschka models of invertebrates the then standard practice of pressing dried plants wasnt really cutting it they were two dimensional and over time lost their true colors if they can make invertebrate animal models that are so lifelike and perfect for teaching went goodales thinking maybe they could make plant models too well yes they could and after some considerable persuading they did ultimately closing their mail order invertebrate model business and devoting their capacious energies exclusively to harvard as much as anything else the blaschkas models chart the development of botany as an academic discipline and limn its role in agribusiness "what drove the blaschkas is hard to know " said dr whitehouse "leopold had a fascination with nature and he clearly had a completely unforgiving single minded kind of calvinist work ethic that he passed on to his son " the corning museum is just the right setting for these delicate glass jewels while the collection has been on view at harvard for decades its existence surprisingly is little known to the general public according to dr whitehouse more people saw the models at the corning museum over the summer the show runs through nov than will see them at harvard over the course of a year "i think theres a very wide lack of awareness about leopold and rudolf " he said "thats why an exhibition like this is so important " the blaschkas themselves certainly made no great claim for immortality "leopold said were not artists were model makers " noted dr whitehouse "their great selling point was that they could make models as close to living animals or plants as you can get the fact that we think many are beautiful would have been incidental to him and his son " panic grass a wild plant native to the upper reaches of north america is captured in astonishing detail down to the fine hairs on the leaf sheaths and blades one can hardly blame a bee who mistakes the blaschkas devils bit scabiosa succisa with its globular head of deep purple flowers for a devils bit one might stumble on in an open meadow its "anatomically correct" right down to the filament thin stamen topped by a pollen producing sac theres no glassy gleam to give the game away at the end of their visit to "botanical wonders " folks are offered a challenge to determine whether the tall white elegant moth orchid in the last vitrine is real or a blaschka creation diligently these visitors examine the bloom from all angles yes its real some say firmly no it absolutely isnt say others with equal certainty because it couldnt possibly survive without natural light "one gentleman looked me in the eye " recalled dr whitehouse "and said of course its real you wouldnt put it there unless it was real and i said what if its a trick " with enviable authority a woman announced to the museum director that the orchid was the genuine article all right no question about it "how do you know " dr whitehouse asked "because " she replied "i was on your wednesday tour of the exhibition last week and last week the orchid was pink " ms kaufman writes about culture and the arts for the journal
