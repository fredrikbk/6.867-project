japans abe stakes his job on outcome of war role vote tokyo prime minister shinzo abe is staking his government on an effort to keep japan part of the u s led war effort in afghanistan mr abe yesterday kicked off a new session of parliament with a plea to renew a law that allows japans military to give aid such as supplying fuel from ships in the indian ocean if parliament fails to do so he said it would "throw away the responsibility" of japan to help fight terrorism the previous day he said he was "betting my job" on renewing the law which expires nov mr abe has been hanging by a thread since the defeat of his ruling liberal democratic party in parliamentary elections in july opposition parties captured a majority in parliaments less powerful upper chamber accusing the prime minister of weak leadership and lack of focus on voters economic security economic worries have arrived along with mr abes troubles gross domestic product contracted in the second quarter from the previous quarter according to revised data released yesterday and the economy faces a head wind from the debt market troubles in the u s still the second quarter contraction followed two quarters of strong growth and economists think the economy is expanding again this quarter the growth figures contributed to a decline in japanese stocks yesterday with the benchmark nikkei stock average of companies down if mr abe resigns the most likely successor would be taro aso who was foreign minister until last month and is secretary general of the liberal democratic party or ldp he like mr abe believes in deregulation and holding down taxes but he is a more experienced political operator and might have more success at executing his policies while japans support role for the war in afghanistan has mainly symbolic significance it has represented a way for tokyo to strengthen its military alliance with the u s the antiterrorism law was needed because japans constitution precludes most military operations overseas the ldp argues that fighting terrorism is essential for japanese security but opposition leader ichiro ozawa says japan should participate in operations run only by the united nations the japanese operations are part of the countrys slow emergence from its post world war ii pacifism in the s it began to participate in u n peacekeeping operations and it sent troops to help reconstruction efforts in iraq after the u s led invasion the lower house in which mr abes ruling coalition holds a large majority can sometimes overrule the upper house but this process takes time and likely wouldnt be completed before the nov deadline should the upper house vote against renewal of the antiterrorism law
