dartmouth diminished given the bad habits of contemporary academia it was probably an historical accident that the agreement allowing dartmouth college alumni to elect half of the schools governing board of trustees lasted as long as it did the decision this weekend by dartmouths board to bulldoze that arrangement is nonetheless breathtaking for its audacity elections at dartmouth were tolerated for years so long as the alumni were electing rubber stamps as trustees in recent years however reform minded candidates began to use a petition provision to get on the ballot they bucked the status quo by focusing on issues like academic standards and free speech and they were forthright in their views since there have been four open and fair trustee elections and independent candidates won all of them a year ago the college tried to rig the process to make it more difficult for petition trustees to be elected and alumni rejected that effort in a referendum too and so unable to convince through argument and persuasion dartmouth president james wright and a band of trustee loyalists forced through a governance plan that will allow them to run the place as they please t j rodgers the ceo of cypress semiconductor and one of the alumnus trustee dissenters had predicted as much on these pages days ago the exercise went ahead as he had guessed behind closed doors with minimal public debate or alumni consultation its safe to say the vote wasnt unanimous but the college is even barring trustees from disclosing that detail your average banana republic is more transparent the plan will pack the member board with eight more trustees selected by the board itself with the influence of elected trustees thus diluted power will be further consolidated in a small executive committee that will control the agenda for good measure the college also declared that it will run future trustee elections on its own terms the architects at least had the courtesy to acknowledge the real motivations behind this putsch "we do not believe that having more elections is in the best interests of the college " they wrote because of "divisiveness " in other words the independent trustees were willing to dissent from the insular uniformity of modern higher education so they had to be neutered before they might actually make a difference elite academia loathes oversight or accountability president wright a product and wholly owned subsidiary of the dartmouth faculty may have made himself the new mascot for this attitude but we doubt charles haldeman the chairman of the dartmouth board and ceo of putnam investments could ever run his own company this way even if he wanted to at least this fracas strips bare the pretense that alumni have any college role beyond writing checks dartmouths reigning lords no doubt believe they can ride out any lawsuits or alumni anger that arise from their power play and they may be right there are always rich alumni donors who care more about getting their name on a building or getting their kid admitted than they care about budget accountability or student access to tenured professors its nonetheless a sad sign of the times that another institution of allegedly higher learning has exhibited such hostility to critical inquiry and debate see related article "the weekend interview with t j rodgers mr rodgers goes to dartmouth" wsj sept see related letter "letters to the editor how to win while losing" wsj sept see related letters "letters to the editor dartmouth lets avoid divisive politics" wsj sept
