politics &amp economics california health plan in peril hospitals boost stalled proposal voters may decide california gov arnold schwarzeneggers ambitious proposal for universal statewide health care coverage announced in january is hanging by a thread as the regular legislative session ends this week the plans fate could rest with california voters in a ballot initiative next year policy makers around the country have been watching california to see whether a way can be found to extend insurance coverage to all citizens while massachusetts did that last year california has more uninsured residents than any other state so overhauling its &# billion health care industry could be an important national model but the republican governors &# billion plan hasnt garnered support from any republican lawmakers who reject its taxes on employers hospitals and doctors to pay for health coverage for million uninsured residents many democrats balk at its mandate requiring everyone without employer insurance to buy individual coverage because there isnt any guarantee that such coverage would be affordable over the summer negotiations stalled as lawmakers battled with the governor over the state budget and other issues mr schwarzeneggers health care proposal never has been formally introduced as legislation however in recent days momentum for the initiative got a boost from the california hospital association which agreed for the first time to support a revenue tax on the states more than hospitals in another surprising turn some business groups are backing a general sales tax increase to help fund coverage for the uninsured one of mr schwarzeneggers senior advisers daniel zingale said yesterday "here in the capitol building people are more bullish than for a long time " meanwhile a democratic plan was expected yesterday to pass both legislative houses in sacramento mr schwarzenegger has said he will veto the bill because he says it puts too big a burden on employers the bill would extend coverage to about of the states uninsured and would be funded by a payroll tax on employers who dont provide insurance nearly twice the levy proposed by the governor there isnt any individual mandate or financial contribution from doctors or hospitals which violates mr schwarzeneggers guiding principle of "shared responsibility" among all stakeholders who stand to benefit from an overhaul "the most significant distinction from the governors plan is that it doesnt cover all californians but its a goal we believe the authors share " said kim belshe secretary of the california health and human services agency mr schwarzeneggers advisers have been working closely with those of legislative leaders especially assembly speaker fabian nunez an author of the democratic bill to craft a compromise mr nunez has hinted publicly that a breakthrough could emerge and that both sides are edging closer to agreement for now the bill doesnt include a hospital tax the governors proposed tax along with federal matching funds would bring into state coffers more than &# billion for the states medicaid program for the poor the bill also lacks a requirement that everyone buy insurance inclusion of a hospital tax and possibly a sales tax increase could reduce the burden on employers california lawmakers are barred from enacting any new taxes without a two thirds majority vote which cant be achieved without republican votes to circumvent this obstacle mr schwarzenegger yesterday called for a special legislative session to pursue a two pronged approach lawmakers would hammer out a compromise blueprint in coming days followed by a ballot initiative in voters would be asked to approve new taxes to cover the costs mr schwarzeneggers supporters have said they believe there is widespread public support for such a plan even among many business groups and republicans who traditionally oppose tax increases
