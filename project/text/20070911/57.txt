global economy chinas second tier cities catch investors eyes dalian wins intel chip plant with cheaper labor fresh air but expat amenities are fewer dalian china a decade ago this northern port city was known mainly for its spectacular seaside scenery and rust belt industries about workers a year here were losing their jobs while business was booming in bigger chinese coastal cities like shanghai and shenzhen dalian remained relatively obscure now thanks to its own promotional efforts as well as the bottlenecks and rising labor costs plaguing some of chinas better known industrial centers dalian is beginning to share more fully in the benefits of chinas rapid economic growth this past weekend u s computer chip giant intel corp broke ground here on a new &# billion factory that will employ workers the facility which is expected to make chips for both domestic use and export is the first such plant intel has built in a developing country last week dalian hosted one of the world economic forums biggest gatherings outside its home base in davos switzerland the three day conference attracted business leaders from around the globe these events show how chinas second tier cities like dalian with its population of six million have succeeded in raising their international profiles and are vying for foreign investors who might previously have bypassed them for a more established hotspot "the competition among chinese cities right now is fierce " says denis fred simon provost at the state university of new yorks levin graduate institute of international relations and commerce and an adviser to the dalian city government "there is a sense that if you win i lose " early in chinas economic boom investment was concentrated in cities like beijing shanghai and the guangzhou shenzhen area near hong kong these cities which have dozens of institutions of higher learning offered a steady stream of qualified employees relatively good transportation links and more experience in dealing with foreigners but the scope of their success in attracting investment has eroded some of their appeal labor costs have risen local officials are more jaded about investment and transportation problems are sometimes staggering cities like beijing are so congested that executives sometimes cant manage more than two or three appointments a day these problems plus efforts by smaller cities to make themselves more attractive have caused a shift in some investors attitudes cities that most foreigners didnt know existed have been gaining ground dalian is at their forefront with ambitions of supplanting indias bangalore as an outsourcing and information technology center situated on a peninsula that juts out into the bohai sea dalians deep sea harbor was better known abroad as port arthur during the th and early th centuries when it was occupied by russia and then japan it served mainly as a military base after china regained sovereignty over the city with the founding of the peoples republic in dalian became a center for heavy industry such as shipbuilding steel and chemicals mayor xia deren says that when he took office four years ago unemployment was rising years of central planning had left the city with polluting industries it had also however endowed the city with more than postsecondary institutes of learning many in technology and engineering "we knew we had to make information technologies a key to our growth " says the year old mr xia "we needed a new economic structure " his predecessor a dynamic politician who now heads the foreign trade ministry in beijing had begun the transformation under his administration dalian added to the european style broad boulevards and public squares left by russian colonizers the city planted trees and built huge traffic circles to ease congestion and showcase public art the city also sought to exploit its japanese past in part by making contacts with japanese businesses "we arent trying to compete directly with cities like shanghai which are international centers " says mr xia "instead we want to be a regional center " at first local companies fueled the citys technology ambitions neusoft group ltd a software and call center company from the nearby metropolis of shenyang opened a research campus in dalian to take advantage of local talent the company now has employees in dalian and plans to boost the number to when it completes a new research campus on the edge of town next year "our goal simply is to go where the talent is " says neusoft chief executive liu jiren "its harder and harder to find talented people in the big cities " intel had similar thoughts when it was looking for a site for its chip factory kirby jefferson general manager of intels dalian operations says the company looked at shanghai where it already has an assembly plant and research center expanding there would have made it easy for intel to find suppliers shanghai also has an extensive expatriate population meaning intel wouldnt have to worry about services for the roughly foreigners it would need to bring in to set up the factory "we looked at the tier one cities but dalian had a lot of advantages " mr jefferson says the local universities for example guaranteed a steady flow of workers the relative lack of other foreign investors meant workers wouldnt be as likely to jump to another company also he says city officials were sophisticated and energetic mayor xia says intel researched the city extensively "they sent a list of something like questions " he says "we tried to answer them all as thoroughly but as quickly as possible " unlike the u s where states can get into bidding wars when a big company dangles an investment chinas central government in beijing sets nationwide incentive policies for major investments dalian was able to waive some local administrative fees to show its enthusiasm it also promised to upgrade its power grid to prevent brownouts for intel and other information technology companies another significant advantage was the citys environment unlike smoggy beijing where blue skies have become a rarity dalian has sea breezes that guarantee it relatively fresh air that will make it easier for intel to attract expats mr jefferson says the downside for intel was dalians lack of amenities for foreign workers beijing shanghai and other big coastal cities have districts where visitors can get by with english and many diversions for their trailing spouses mr jefferson says intel is looking for ways to keep spouses occupied such as setting up a volunteering program cities like dalian still face challenges even though they are cheaper than the likes of beijing or shanghai they cant rely indefinitely on cheap labor costs are lower further inland and other countries such as myanmar and cambodia offer even lower costs than china dalian officials recognize this and say they are betting their future on information technology because it demands higher skills but some forms of it work may be just a different version of cheap labor says mr simon the citys adviser call centers for example have sprung up across dalian and account for a large chunk of revenues for companies like neusoft wages in this sector are low and there isnt much value added to the local economy moreover unlike some of its potential competitors dalian lacks the critical mass of big companies that would allow it to win contracts to take over the back office operations of large multinationals mr simon says dalian also has a limited supply of young students to keep them flowing neusoft founded a technical school that teaches programming and other information technology skills it now has students intel is also teaming up with a local university to train students in semiconductor development and assembly "we have to keep moving forward " says mayor xia "china has so many cities "
