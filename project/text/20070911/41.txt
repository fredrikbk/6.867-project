eyes on the road fuel economy label has long overdue makeover modern life comes with many disclaimers "results not typical" and "some restrictions apply" without such caveats commerce might grind to a halt the car business has one of the classics "actual mileage will vary " for nearly three decades the auto industry has benefited from government sanctioned hype in the form of the mileage estimates displayed on the window stickers of new cars now as models roll out into showrooms the window sticker information about mileage is getting an overdue makeover in both style and substance the style part is a redesigned fuel economy label required for all vehicles built after sept the new label prominently displays more detailed information about a vehicles likely annual fuel costs and how a given models estimated fuel economy compares with other vehicles in its class instead of just relying on small print to convey data the new labels use simple graphical devices the more important change is in the method used to produce the city and highway mileage figures for models for about as long as the government has been requiring car makers to publish mileage estimates for new vehicles almost everyone involved has recognized that the figures were essentially bogus as prescribed by law the "driving" used in the environmental protection agencys fuel economy tests bore little resemblance to the behavior of motorists in the real world the highway mileage test for example used a top speed of just miles an hour and the average speed during the test was mph the temperature for the test was degrees the cars were run without the use of energy sapping accessories such as air conditioning to account for the discrepancy between the test conditions and real life the government would "adjust" the mileage results the last time the formula was changed was in the epa concluded that it should reduce the city miles per gallon figures by and the highway number by but even that wasnt enough for many models or many drivers the easy test might have seemed like a good idea to the auto makers at one time but grade inflation did as much harm as good consider the annoyance of enthusiastic buyers of the toyota prius dazzled by the models mpg city figure and mpg highway number some prius owners knew how to drive their cars to get close to these estimates many however didnt creating a customer relations challenge for toyota albeit one that hasnt seriously damaged enthusiasm for the car the mileage estimates for the new model window stickers reflect a new more rigorous approach to testing instead of relying solely on the old city highway mileage test protocols the epa is now factoring in the way cars perform in three other tests designed originally to determine whether vehicles met tailpipe pollution standards epa scientists a few years ago got some residents of kansas city mo to agree to have their cars outfitted with testing gear and concluded from the results that the emissions tests could be used to gauge fuel consumption as well epa spokesman john millett says the new method epa says takes into account high speed driving and hard acceleration the effects of cold which tends to degrade mileage and the use of air conditioning the result the mileage ratings for most models are lower than they were for the same car in the model toyota camry for example will have a city estimate of mpg compared with mpg the year before the camrys highway figure will drop to mpg in from on the sticker by visiting www fueleconomy gov you can compare the mileage ratings for cars using both the old and new systems under the old mileage test method the camry would have rated mpg highway toyotas official stance on this "we are totally supportive of the new epa calculations " says spokesman bill kwong the new numbers "are closer to the real world " he says the prius he said is still going to get a better fuel economy rating than any car in its class the epa says city mileage estimates will drop by about on average while highway estimates will decline by on average some vehicles will suffer as much as a drop for city and some will get a cut for highway in most cases cars that had the highest mileage ratings under the old system will decline the most by contrast the big gmc yukon four wheel drive sport utility vehicle will stay fairly close to its old ratings in the yukon was rated at city highway for models those figures drop to mpg car makers are still getting some breaks the biggest suvs those weighing more than pounds still arent required to come with mileage estimates displayed on their stickers that wont happen until when car makers must get their vehicles ready to do well on additional tests designed to predict mileage during high speed driving in cold weather and under loads such as air conditioning another reason the car makers arent squawking too much is that these epa figures have no bearing on the system that calculates the fuel economy scores used to determine a companys compliance with the federal corporate average fuel economy rules currently new cars are required to average mpg under the cafe testing regime the current truck standard is mpg this battle isnt about what consumers are told in advertisements its about what car makers can build and sell meanwhile more technically minded motorists can have fun
