seeking loyal devoted workers let them stay home asked to identify the most devoted loyal employees at their company many people would probably point to colleagues who are at their desks before everyone else arrives and who remain there after everyone else leaves but that answer may be wrong a recent survey finds that workers who telecommute from home or elsewhere while still a very small portion of the work force report the highest levels of satisfaction with their jobs and loyalty to their employers in the poll of about u s workers of remote and home based workers said they were satisfied with their company as a place to work compared with of office workers in addition of the telecommuters said they were "proud to tell people i work for my company " while only of office workers agreed with that statement the survey was conducted by the kenexa research institute a unit of kenexa corp a recruitment and retention consulting firm "when companies allow employees to work remotely or from home they are explicitly communicating to them that i trust you to be dedicated to the accomplishment of the work even if im not able to observe you doing it " says jack wiley executive director of the institute which is in minneapolis "it boils down to respect " he says "i respect you and i have confidence in your commitment to the work to do this under the conditions and at the time you feel will be most productive for you " that rings true to scott berry a senior mutual fund analyst at morningstar inc in chicago mr berry has worked for the firm for eight years for the past six he has telecommuted from his home in rochester mich going into the office just two or three days a month "i always had a good perception of the firm but obviously it enhances my perception in that theyre willing to trust their employees to get their job done without any direct supervision that theyre willing to allow somebody like me to move for family reasons and not business reasons " says mr berry who started telecommuting when he and his wife started their family and wanted to be closer to relatives in michigan the perks of his current job he says include time saved not commuting enjoying meals with his family and not having colleagues interrupt him as they walk by his desk the downsides include not getting to know colleagues as well he also says his family can be a distraction "but i think productivity is better not worse " he says "there are distractions being a telecommuter but there are distractions in the office too " leila langlois a recruiter at a large tech company in silicon valley says her productivity has improved since she started telecommuting about a year ago from her home in san francisco "im way more productive working from home " says ms langlois who works in the office once a week to stay connected to co workers she says she has "received more awards in the last year" than in any other of her years at the company "i go above and beyond trying to do really well to make sure i keep this job forever " says ms langlois who is married with two children in the kenexa research institute survey some of the differences between the two groups were striking mr wiley says pointing to the percentage point gap between the of telecommuters who said there is "open honest two way communication" at their company and the of office workers who said that fifty three percent of the remote workers said they werent considering leaving the company within months while only of the office workers said leaving wasnt a consideration in addition of the telecommuters said "senior management demonstrates that employees are important to the success of the company " compared with of the office workers and of the telecommuters said they believed senior management speaks honestly versus of the office workers despite their higher job satisfaction only a very small portion of the workers surveyed actually work outside the cubicle just said they work from home or remotely a percentage that has remained fairly steady for years to some degree mr wiley says thats because companies dont embrace work at home policies "for many companies there is still a command and control mentality " he says "its based on the notion that if you cant see the employee at work or cant walk down the hall and stick your head into the office then you dont have a sense of just how productive they are " there are other concerns he adds companies may worry "about how they administer a policy like this in a fair way across the board for employees " in addition some companies worry about the costs involved including the expense of buying laptop computers and other tools when similar equipment has already been purchased for the office but companies do reap benefits from employing workers who are satisfied and committed to them "we have a significant amount of experience and research thats shown a link between employee engagement and a whole host of very desirable outcomes including an employees willingness to expend discretionary effort to get the job done and their intention to stay with their employer " mr wiley says in addition "theres a substantial amount of research that shows that higher levels of employee engagement are predictive of higher levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and improvement in market share " he says mr wiley says other research shows that when people are asked to name the most important things they want from an employer besides compensation they say they want appreciation for the work they contribute and to be treated respectfully "this desire escapes the attention of many managers and employers " he adds he also says the survey has a message for employees it shows that "there are employers out there who do provide this flexibility " he says and "for most people thats a huge plus "
