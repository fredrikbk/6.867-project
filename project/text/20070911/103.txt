the daily fix devastating injury for everett clouds nfls first weekend online edition kevin everett a tight end for the buffalo bills sustained a catastrophic spinal cord injury in the teams season opener against the denver broncos sunday mr everett was hurt in the second half kickoff when he ducked his head while diving to tackle denvers domenik hikon hitting mr hikon in the left shoulder and helmet the bills team orthopedist called the chances of a full recovery "bleak dismal" and warned that the year olds injury should still be considered life threatening in the rochester democrat and chronicle sal maiorana has a good explanation of the injury and the surgery in the rocky mountain news dave krieger remembers mike utley and darryl stingley nfl players paralyzed by similar injuries and ponders how mere inches can be the difference between a hard hit and a tragedy "why that hit " he asks "there was nothing exceptional about it everett led with his head which youre not supposed to do but football players at every level do all the time just the same whats the difference between a hit that produces a stinger the temporary loss of feeling in the arms or legs and a hit that destroys a mans life as he knows it kevin everett is only at foot pounds he was the picture of youth and size and strength hours ago none of that helped him when his helmeted head hit an oncoming object just so " in the buffalo news jerry sullivan checks in with the shaken bills "nearly hours later brian moorman still had trouble talking about it " he writes "he still sees kevin everett slumping to the turf after making a hit on sundays second half kickoff moorman and his bills teammates stand together bonded in dread and silence waiting for their fallen teammate to move to give them some small sign that hell be ok " sadly the bills are left to ponder the likelihood that "a quiet kid who never had a chance to prove himself in the nfl will likely become the utley or darryl stingley of his generation football is a violent game the prospect of serious injury is always there a faint whisper the glory and riches come at a steep physical price but the players learn to ignore it otherwise you could never survive in a game that is played at such remarkably high speeds by large agile men with menace in their hearts " monday night footballs debut was a gridiron doubleheader beginning with the cincinnati bengals win over the baltimore ravens a victory keyed by six baltimore turnovers and a bengals goal line stand in the cincinnati post lonnie wheeler warns that "it might have to be this way for a while well not exactly this way the way it was monday night when the bengals scarfed down six out of character turnovers from the baltimore ravens including at the end a diving game saving interception by a pound substitute defensive lineman on the division favorites seventh crack at the goal line from between the yard and inch lines that probably wont happen again but if the bengals are to find their way in the early portion at least of the season it might have to be with means heretofore unfamiliar to them and the rest of us read defense " "sure you couldve suffered through the three plus hours of visual torture last night but the ravens actually packaged everything you needed to know into a nice little two minute bundle late in the game " rick maese grumps in the baltimore sun "we had an injured starting quarterback on the sideline in pain an inept offense that reached the yard line and failed in six tries to cross the goal line a running back who couldnt move the ball and a second string quarterback who couldnt complete a pass plus there was a penalty that negated a game tying touchdown and a turnover that ended the drive " the ravens wretched performance was taxing for their fans but the game between the arizona cardinals and the san francisco ers was taxing for both sides the two offenses traded ineffectual blows like blindfolded drunks in a bar fight until the niners alex smith found himself in the final minutes authoring an yard scoring drive for a win "of the minutes in which the ers had the ball monday night against arizona of them were uniformly dreadful " ray ratto writes in the san francisco chronicle "but the other the last saved smith and the ers a weeks full of grisly recriminations oh and an opening night loss if that matters to you " mr smiths eventual command of the game mr ratto writes "means i guess that smith can be trusted with the offense kinda sorta if you believe that minutes of inspirational work trumps the other his guidance in the ers winning drive maxed out by arnaz battles yard run with seconds remaining showed what he is being paid to do the rest of it showed how little he is actually trusted to do those things over the course of a game " "the cardinals have a pope on their roster " muses dan bickley in the arizona republic "they also have a moses and should they ever draft a player named noah theyve already got his shipp in tow alas a little divine intervention may be necessary after yet another monday night debacle sorry but this heart wrenching loss to the ers wasnt as bad as that meltdown against the bears last year the one that made dennis green a national buffoon it was worse " the best division race in baseball is in the nl central where the milwaukee brewers chicago cubs and st louis cardinals are three games apart and a collective three games over yesterday the cubs shellacked the cards moving them back into a first place tie with the brewers the pittsburgh pirates shellackees can the cardinals stay in the race the world champions have endured an astonishing streak of bad news and bad luck in the death of josh hancock injuries to chris carpenter juan encarnacion scott rolen and chris duncan and the whirlwind of hgh talk around rick ankiel "at some point the strain is too much " muses bernie miklasz in the st louis post dispatch "the bandages wont hold the shortages cant be overcome the conditions begin to overwhelm and overtake even the most determined of competitors and theres no rest for the weary the combination of injuries fatigue and frustration seems to make this less of a fair fight with each passing day in the nl central race " whats a homer player in the prime of his career worth tim marchman of the new york sun thinks the new york yankees alex rodriguez will find out in a couple of months when he opts out of his current contract and that a rod will wind up getting his money from another team but if mr marchman is right who will be a rods new employer those in the bronx might want to sit down before reading further "yankees fans arent going to want to hear this but the boston red sox the second richest team in baseball have an enormous amount of money to spend " he writes adding "in they demonstrated their willingness to go to near absurd lengths to lay hands on rodriguez and of course little could be a more worthy expenditure than grabbing their top rivals best player to fill a position of need it sounds sensational but there truly isnt a better fit for rodriguez and the smart money looks to be either on him making his way to boston or on the threat of his doing so forcing the yankee chieftains to relent and make a liar out of their gm this will cause great glee for sox fans either way " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well consider your find for inclusion in the daily fix
