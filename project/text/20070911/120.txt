why we still must fight world war iv by norman podhoretz doubelday pages &# in all the grand speeches and requiem tributes today commemorating the events of sept there are likely to be few references to whittaker chambers but norman podhoretz rightly reminds us of chambers in "world war iv " his bracingly mordant account of the wests battle against islamofascism it is a battle that entered a critical phase six years ago with the carnage in new york washington and rural pennsylvania in the dark days of the cold war mr podhoretz notes chambers was "sure we lacked the stomach the heart the will and the wit to stand effectively against the true believers of the soviet union and its allies and sympathizers " and indeed when chambers gave his testimony against alger hiss in the late s charging hiss with having spied for the soviet union the soviet enterprise was beginning to look like an unstoppable force it seemed all the more so in the decade that followed when that force was finally spent and the cold war i e world war iii ended some long years later the west owed its victory to the unrelenting resistance of free and yearning to be free people on both sides of the iron curtain for mr podhoretz political will is again the crucial question will the american people have the strength and staying power for the current conflict the leading indicators from the presidents cratering poll numbers to public doubts about the war in iraq provide ample grounds for pessimism mr podhoretz says that he remains hopeful but adds "the jury is still out and it will not return a final verdict for some time to come " the premise of "world war iv" is that we are in a global conflict that will not end any time soon to win it we will have to make radical changes to our military diplomatic and legal theory and practice whereas terrorism was formerly treated as a problem for the police and "first responders " the scale of the threat today and the technologies potentially available to evildoers demand a long term large scale military commitment its purpose to go after terror networks and if necessary the political regimes offering such networks support by definition this strategy implies pre emptive military strikes as mr podhoretz pithily documents much of the debate over faulty intelligence over surveillance and detention practices over executive authority and secrecy everything that has tied up the investigatory committees of congress since the democrats took control last year divides along a single fault line are we really at war against a deadly foe or are we fighting small bands of deluded fanatics whose probability of even minor success is pitifully low should we prepare to defend our civilization against an existential threat or engage in a series of improvisations in response to terrorist attacks mr podhoretz stands unambiguously with president bush on that question and he is enough of a street fighter to give generous space to self damning quotes from the opposition here is hapless john kerry running for president two years after "we have to get back to the place where we were where terrorists are not the focus of our lives but theyre a nuisance as a former law enforcement person i know were never going to end prostitution were never going to end illegal gambling but were going to reduce it organized crime to a level where it isnt on the rise it isnt threatening peoples lives every day and fundamentally its something that you continue to fight but its not threatening the fabric of your life " this kind of claim lends itself to easy ridicule but it doesnt differ substantially from the policy prescriptions of respectable think tanks or the statements of various right of center foreign policy advisers who oppose what has come to be called the bush doctrine one such oppositional group the so called realists is well represented in this volume by brent scowcroft who in the authors best jugular gripping form is described as thinking the biggest obstacle to peace in the middle east is not saddam hussein but ariel sharon as if anticipating mr bushs recent attempt to draw parallels between american policy in vietnam and the dangers of precipitate withdrawal in iraq mr podhoretz contrasts the antiwar movements of both conflicts the sentiments are similar he argues but the pace has quickened in the s the antiwar left began on the fringes of respectable opinion and managed to overtake it only slowly with iraq it achieved quick success already having so many friends in the universities mainstream media and foreign policy establishment mr podhoretz handles the swift radicalization of top democrats with gusto quoting most of them as ferocious saddam critics before the invasion and as the war became difficult newly ferocious critics of the u s invasion teddy kennedy leaves the rails completely when he reacts to the serious abuses at abu ghraib prison by declaring on the senate floor that "the torture chamber of saddam hussein has been reopened under new management american management " it is precisely such rhetoric and the moral equivalence reasoning behind it that makes it especially appropriate to remember whittaker chamberss cold war doubts about the wests capacity to defend itself mr podhoretz believes that the west may face an even more formidable foe today this time it lurks in shadowy networks of oil enabled jihadists mullahs and despots who are at war with modernity and can count on the support of millions of militant islamists if such people succeed in getting their hands on weapons of mass destruction they will surely use them pre emption may thus turn out to be a compelling option for whoever wins the presidency in if so the bush doctrine like harry trumans earlier doctrine of containment will have a longer life than its critics imagine and yes mr podhoretz reminds us harry truman had some pretty lousy poll numbers when he left office too mr willcox a
