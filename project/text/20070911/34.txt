energy mexican gas pipelines attacked again mexico city a new round of attacks on mexican natural gas pipelines appears to be the work of leftist guerrillas who had previously been dismissed as ineffectual posing an increased security challenge to the government and petroleos de mexico the state owned energy monopoly known as pemex the popular revolutionary army or epr a shadowy group the government claims is controlled by three oaxaca families claimed credit for the attacks in a note left by an unexploded bomb a mexican official told the associated press yesterday the government didnt immediately confirm those claims the group which operates in the poor and conflict ridden southwestern states of oaxaca and guerrero also claimed credit for four similar explosions two months ago to the day at the time the group released a communique saying it would continue the violence until it won the release of two leaders who it claimed had "been disappeared" kidnapped or killed by security officials working for either the federal government or the oaxaca state government mexican federal officials say they know nothing about the fate of the two epr leaders three weeks ago mexicos attorney generals office opened a probe into the disappearance of the two men the previous epr action was largely dismissed as an isolated event but yesterdays repeat performance is evidence of the groups potential to become a major security headache for the mexican government and possibly even a threat to u s oil supplies pemex said there were no injuries from yesterdays blasts most of which were in veracruz on the gulf of mexico but chief executive jesus reyes heroles said they would cost the company "hundreds of millions of dollars " the pipeline damage would cut off around of the countrys natural gas supply for to hours mr reyes heroles told mexican radio he said the fact gas cant be easily stored made the situation more serious than for gasoline where ample inventory would have cushioned the blow he said it could take four or five days from today to completely restore supply interior secretary francisco ramirez said the federal attorney generals office was trying to determine who was responsible for the "premeditated acts " mr ramirez insisted that "pemexs fundamental installations are adequately protected by our armed forces and we will do our utmost to find those responsible " the six blasts in veracruz caused thousands to flee their homes mexican soldiers scrambled to reinforce security in the oil companys facilities in response to the resulting lack of gas vitro sa a glassmaker based in monterrey mexico said it would stop work temporarily at six plants the attacks also helped drive the mexican stock market down mexican president felipe calderon traveling in india called the bombings "an attack on democracy and on mexico " since assuming power last december mr calderon has made improving the countrys security which is threatened by powerful drug cartels and gangs of kidnappers and criminals a centerpiece of his government program he urged legislators to approve a stalled tax overhaul that would provide more resources for improving the countrys security and intelligence capacity the epr appeared on the scene in the mid s vowing to punish the rich as well as corrupt government officials it blames for southern mexicos poverty the group is believed to have kidnapped one of mexicos richest bankers who was later released after laying low for some years mexican analysts said the epr was revitalized by mass protests in oaxaca last year in which striking teachers joined by other leftist groups occupied the state capital according to a mexican intelligence report between and the epr is believed responsible for more than kidnappings which netted them some &# million one mexican official said despite the poverty that afflicts the region the epr is unlikely to develop a broad based appeal given the tight control exercised by the three oaxaca families and the groups tendency to splinter into smaller groups
