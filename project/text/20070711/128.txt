the informed patient to reduce risks hospitals enlist proceduralists awaiting both kidney and liver transplants last year larry pritchard suffered from fluid build up so severe it sometimes leaked from the skin on his stomach the condition required a procedure known as paracentesis to drain the fluid but at the first hospital where he was treated he says emergency room doctors didnt even know about the procedure and tried to seal the leaks with medical glue after switching to cedars sinai medical center in los angeles he found something he hadnt heard of before a dedicated procedure center where doctors were expert at inserting a needle deep into the abdominal wall to drain fluid "the doctor knew exactly where to put that needle and everyone at the procedure center was a pro at what they were doing " says the year old retired attorney at cedars sinais center experts performed the paracentesis procedure on mr pritchard more than times over six months as frequently as three times a week and inserted and removed dialyses catheters before his dual transplant last august "they literally kept me alive " he says with a steady decline in the number of doctors trained to perform such skills intensive medical procedures in recent years cedars and other large academic medical centers are looking for ways to fill the gap they are creating special procedure services and new procedure training programs for medical residents teams of doctors known as proceduralists are now available at some centers with special expertise in tunneling a catheter into a vein slicing an incision in the neck for an airway or plunging a needle into a patients back for a spinal tap while not a medical specialty in its own right procedural medicine is emerging as an important new role for physicians with the manual dexterity and steady nerves to perform risky procedures and hospitals say they see reduced complication rates when services are performed by physicians who are very well versed in the procedures medical schools including yale university and northwestern university are using lifelike mannequins and virtual computer technology to teach clinical skills such as inserting chest tubes or performing rectal exams on a patient medical specialty societies are providing skills training in their own continuing education courses and the new england journal of medicine last year began offering five to eight minute streaming videos of procedures that subscribers can download in a version compatible with hand held digital devices including arterial line placement pelvic exams and male urethral catheterization behind the efforts is a growing concern about patient safety and the risk of malpractice claims from botched procedures "this is the scary underbelly of health care doing these procedures ad hoc without somebody really saying are you sure you know how to do this " says larry wellikson chief executive of the society of hospital medicine which represents doctors whose sole responsibility is the care of hospitalized patients dr welliksons group is developing procedure training courses for its members for decades performing medical procedures was a standard part of medical residency training for internists but according to a survey of members of the american college of physicians internists on average perform fewer procedures today than they did years ago in part because other specialists including hospitalists and radiologists do more procedures and new technology such as ultrasound equipment has eliminated the need for some invasive procedures or changed they way they are done cuts in insurance reimbursement have also made it less lucrative to do many common procedures meanwhile medical groups are also concluding that the traditional method of training residents known as "see one do one teach one" is dangerously inadequate eric holmboe senior vice president of evaluation and quality research at the american board of internal medicine which certifies internists says the method doesnt provide enough hands on opportunities to practice skills and relies on doctors who arent necessarily expert themselves at doing procedures moreover he adds patients shouldnt be the subjects on which novice doctors practice their skills last year the abim eliminated some of the more complicated procedures formerly required for certification such as spinal taps saying that internists should focus on a core group of five procedures they can master in everyday practice such as drawing blood and performing pap smears at cedars sinai demand for the medical procedures performed at the procedure center has grown steadily in the decade since it was opened in september the hospital will open a new &# million center that is double the size of the original and add a fifth proceduralist to the staff at present the four doctors who rotate through the proceduralist service each perform more than procedures annually with the aid of one nurse practitioner and nurses bradley t rosen assistant director of the procedure center says it has helped lower the hospitals complication rate for medical procedures to less than compared with a national average of to wait times for patients are less than hours as opposed to sometimes two to three days for patients who have to wait for their own doctor the hospital is reimbursed at a low rate for many procedure services and some doctors such as surgeons have to forgo some income from doing their own procedures but dr rosen says the procedure center frees up surgeons to perform the more expensive procedures that are reimbursed at a higher rate michael lill director of cedars sinais blood and marrow transplant program says his group uses the procedure center for central line placement and other procedures such as using a needle to drain fluid from the lungs "thats something most of us in internal medicine and surgery were trained to do as residents and while it isnt an enormously complicated procedure it can have severe complications " dr lill says "i havent done one in years and they are doing six or seven a week " moreover the proceduralists use new ultrasound technology to guide the needle "instead of the old fashioned blind way we used to do it " dr lill says northwestern university in chicago meanwhile started an advanced cardiac life support training program in using a simulated patient mannequin for residents to practice skills such as the insertion of breathing tubes and central lines in a study published last month in the journal chest residents trained on the simulator showed significantly higher adherence to standards for performing the procedures compared with traditionally trained residents northwestern is expanding rigorous training programs to cover all major medical procedures "if we follow the see one do one teach one philosophy we will just hand down our mistakes from one set of residents to the next " says jeffrey barsuk assistant professor at northwesterns feinberg school of medicine the university of chicago created a procedure service staffed by a pulmonary critical care faculty physician and a critical care nurse available to perform or supervise residents performing procedures medical residents often elect to rotate through the service says vineet arora associate program director of internal medicine residency bostons beth israel deaconess medical center affiliated with the harvard medical school also uses a simulation center to train residents on mannequins joseph li who runs a group of hospitalists at beth israel deaconess who staff a full time procedure service still shudders when he remembers how he was taught to remove fluid from the lungs "i vividly remember thinking ive never done this and its almost like a dirty little secret that this patient doesnt know that " dr li says "we fumbled our way through it with no issues but it just highlighted for me what an awful way it was to teach "
