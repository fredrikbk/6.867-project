plane orders boost tire makers paris tire makers stand to reap rich rewards from a steep rise in aircraft production in coming years commercial aircraft builders airbus a unit of european aeronautic defence &amp space co and boeing co and their component suppliers should profit handsomely from a rise in new aircraft orders during the past year at last months paris air show for example the two producers announced new orders for about planes with a list value of about &# billion but the makers of tires for those planes michelin sa of france japans bridgestone corp goodyear tire &amp rubber co of akron ohio and britains dunlop aircraft tyres ltd are likely to benefit even more that is because they make a lot more money from replacement tires than from supplying original equipment to car and plane makers most aircraft need to replace their tires about four times a year depending on how often they takeoff and land accounting for about million euros or roughly &# million in annual sales the aviation tire industry is tiny by comparison with the overall civil jetliner business but it is growing at a robust rate of about to annually in line with the rise in air traffic it is a lucrative business too though tire manufacturers are coy about breaking out sales or profit data for their aviation businesses "thats sensitive information " says francois corbin head of michelins aviation tires division adding "id be really interested to see my competitors figures " eric varndell global marketing manager for goodyear aviation tires agrees "its quite a small industry and any information is well guarded " michelins sr business segment which lumps together aviation and other specialty tires as well as maps and guides and sales of branded goods saw a rise in sales last year to just less than billion euros but its operating margin was better than that of its car tire operations and almost double that of truck tires goodyear gives regional breakdowns of its overall operations not by business segments "id be very surprised if michelins aviation tire margins arent greater than the average" of its sr segment says stephen cheetham automotive analyst at sanford bernstein in london he said it is difficult to make sensible estimates because michelin and other companies keep their data so close to their chests aircraft tires are built to much higher standards than truck tires and their production is highly labor intensive higher production costs mean that a single tire can sell for euros aviation tires suffer extreme stresses compared with their ground bound equivalents military jet tires are designed to carry loads equivalent to two heavy trucks and are inflated up to atmospheres as opposed to around two atmospheres for car tires and they have to be capable of going from minus degrees fahrenheit to boiling point at the end of a landing rollout without losing any of their attributes goodyear claims to be the market leader in volume sales but michelin says it has a share of the fast growing radial tire segment that accounts for about of the overall aviation tire market the market leaders now offer a service to customer airlines especially those in the u s in which they provide either new or retreaded tires to the carriers based on the number of landings their planes make that way airlines dont need to keep track of managing all the tires on their aircraft and ordering replacements as they are used the supply management system makes it easier for the airlines and the tire makers to predict needs the surge in demand is prompting tire makers to increase production capacity last month bridgestone started construction on a second production plant for radial aircraft tires in tokyo and michelin is investing million euros over five years to expand output at its main facility at bourges in central france thomas besson who follows michelin from london for merrill lynch agrees that "capacity constraints are starting to emerge" and are bolstering the pricing power of tire makers so business is becoming increasingly profitable mr corbin says however that there is no supply shortage "no planes are being grounded because they dont have tires " because of the labor intensive nature of the business adding physical production capacity also implies adding and training more personnel sanford bernsteins mr cheetham says "michelin may not be exactly dragging its feet but its a clever company and it knows that the aviation industry is cyclical so any new investment will be cautious " he says until the s aircraft tires were made using a "bias" or crossply technique but the gradual introduction of radial technology over the last two decades has given aircraft owners tires that are to lighter and offer up to more tread life
