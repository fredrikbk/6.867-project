a triumph of music or hype as pop music fans are well aware this is the th anniversary of the summer of love anointed as the seminal year in rock history by boomers who cite as evidence the beatles"sgt peppers lonely hearts club band" and the monterey international pop festival in june we slogged our way through medias celebration of "sgt pepper " and starbucks is now hawking a song collection of performances at monterey by jefferson airplane the jimi hendrix experience the mamas and the papas otis redding and others since media and marketing had as much to do with the veneration of as did the music the "sgt pepper" and monterey revivals seem in the right hands other discs and events mark the anniversary perhaps in unintended ways time lifes song "summer of love the hits of " is a cloying set of musty radio minded pop while rhinos four disk "love is the song we sing san francisco nuggets " reminds us that for every grateful dead santana and sly and the family stone there was also frumious bandersnatch fifty foot hose and the chocolate watchband "hippiefest " a city tour that kicks off in toronto on july will feature mountain whose bassist and sweet voiced singer felix pappalardi was shot and killed in badfinger whose leader pete ham committed suicide in and iron butterfly without the long retired doug ingle the singer and organist on its only hit "in a gadda da vida " however according to a press release "a full line of flower power paraphernalia such as tie dye t shirts skirts caps bags stickers and posters will be available " fair minded boomers will concede that a lot of their favorite music of is caught in its time and holds up best as soundtrack to memory the re releases dont present much evidence to suggest that was any more important in the development of pop music than many of the subsequent years some of the music of is worth celebrating "axis bold as love" by hendrix "the velvet underground and nico" aretha franklins "i never loved a man the way i love you" albert kings "born under a bad sign" "songs of leonard cohen" and miles daviss "nefertiti" come to mind but the real breakthrough was in the commercialization of rock and hippie culture that continues to this day in his notes in the monterey pop package andrew loog oldham an early manager of the rolling stones writes that the festival "changed the course of popular music and in particular the relationship between music its creators and consumers " thats true and not just because the mamas and the papas john phillips wrote "san francisco be sure to wear flowers in your hair " to help promote monterey pop thus giving the hippie movement an alluring anthem that won free radio airplay beginning in artists were portrayed not merely as hip and talented but as paragons of a new virtuous culture its a clever marketing concept that some boomers still believe to be true you need a whole lot of hype to sell the music at monterey pop in as more than mediocre at least by the standards of whats on the latest set only three performances two by simon and garfunkel one by buffalo springfield havent appeared over the years on other monterey pop albums eric burdons "san franciscan nights" is so bad that a listener might take it for caricature of late s smug self referential rock an out of tune guitar mars scott mckenzies version of "san francisco " the jefferson airplane rush through their two biggest hits "somebody to love" and "white rabbit" they come off much better in d a pennebakers documentary "monterey pop " which shows the well dressed audience as glassy eyed enough to see everything as groovy up on stage there are lots of fingernails on the blackboard guitar solos racing tempos and flat singing youd have found more musical competency at any of the recent bonnaroo or coachella festivals as for "sgt pepper" an exceedingly clever and dynamic piece of pop music its often referred to as the greatest album in rock history which in turn may make it the genres most overrated disc it may not even be the best beatles album its said to capture the summer of love zeitgeist and certainly there are moments that evoke the year in which psychedelic drugs intrigued the mainstream but several paul mccartney compositions belong to an earlier era "lovely rita " about a meter maid "when im sixty four " which he wrote as a teen and "shes leaving home " which features a sturdy arrangement for strings and is told from the point of view of the runaways parents further "sgt pepper" supporters credit it as rocks first concept album its not frank zappa released the satirical concept album "freak out " in june its not even a concept album if such a work is defined by having a unifying theme the u s version of the bands release "rubber soul" is closer to a concept album than is "sgt pepper" every song it contains is about romantic love regarding the innovative album jacket of "sgt pepper" a pretty nifty piece of market minded packaging what does that mean in an era of downloading music straight to a computer ive never seen the packaging for some of my favorite new music for that matter does an album concept or not matter in an era where the shuffle mode on an ipod determines the order in which we hear music many of us cling to the cliche that "sgt pepper" is rocks high point which denies claim to the title to every other album released since june its another myth we boomers perpetuate about the music of our youth were part of the marketing machine we always were that seems to have condemned our entire generation to look backward for its thrills how disheartening it is to think that this mentality and the kind of forced festivities it encourages will follow us to the grave mr fusilli writes on rock and pop music for the journal
