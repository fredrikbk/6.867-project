underlying mortgages subprime mortgages are made to borrowers with shaky credit profiles s&amp p said its action reflected several factors including persistent mortgage delinquencies weak home prices and lax loan underwriting standards it also cited mortgage fraud a concern highlighted yesterday when the u s attorney for the southern district in new york charged people with taking part in "a wide

bonds issued in "the level of losses continues to exceed historical precedents and our expectations " said susan barnes an s&amp p managing director in a conference call with investors to discuss the looming downgrades the ratings actions come after months of intensifying turmoil in the market they drew howls from some investors who have complained that s&amp p and moodys put excessively high ratings on many classes of bonds backed by subprime mortgages during the housing boom and then were too slow to lower those ratings when the housing market started sinking "why now " said steve eisman managing director at hedge fund frontpoint partners in the s&amp p conference call "delinquencies have been a disaster for many months it couldnt be that you just woke up to it the rest of the world
