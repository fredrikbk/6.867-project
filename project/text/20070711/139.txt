where senators see flaws nymex defends oversight the new york mercantile exchange the worlds main regulated energy trading market seized on a senate investigation this week to warn of the dangers of rival electronic markets that are largely unregulated however the senates hearings and exhibits also suggest that nymex arguably failed to address warning signs involving amaranth advisors the collapsed hedge fund that the senate contends distorted natural gas prices last year the commodity futures trading commission which regulates nymex backs the exchange saying that the commissions staff "was satisfied that nymex was properly monitoring amaranths position " and properly enforcing its rules the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations which is investigating excessive speculation in the energy markets concluded in a recent report that the energy trading regulatory system was broken among other things its calling for electronic energy trading exchanges primarily intercontinentalexchange inc or ice to be subjected to the same level of regulatory oversight as traditional energy futures exchanges like nymex a unit of nymex holdings inc at a senate hearing monday nymex chief executive james newsome defended the tools the exchange uses to keep large traders from distorting its markets "im very confident of nymexs ability to manage risks that we can see " according to senate exhibits in several instances amaranth violated strict limits placed on trading designed to keep one player from dominating the market for futures contracts that are about to come due several times amaranth also blew through trading thresholds known as "accountability levels" set by nymex these thresholds which are more flexible measure the size of an investors role in the market for futures contracts that are months or years away from expiration exceeding the threshold triggers a review to decide whether it would disrupt the market to let the trader get bigger but rather than ordering amaranth to reduce its size at least eight times in nymex increased amaranths accountability allowances so it could trade in bigger quantities that helped amaranth amass close to or more of the nymex contracts outstanding in some markets although nymex issued warning letters to amaranth last year for violating strict limits near a contract expiration it rescinded one of the violations the reversal wasnt explained in the exhibits nymex also didnt ask the hedge fund to reduce its positions until august according to a senate exhibit by that time amaranth was so deeply entrenched in huge market bets that getting out of the rest of them a month later triggered billions of dollars in losses and volatility for other traders the senate subcommittee contended michael greenberger a former cftc official who oversaw exchange trading in the late s and who now is a professor at the university of maryland school of law said in an interview nymex should have done more to rein in amaranth he added that nymex is "making a lot of money off these trades and theyre very conflicted about what to do " attracting trading revenue has taken on added significance now that nymex and other exchanges have transformed themselves into publicly traded companies which can bring pressure from shareholders for solid quarterly earnings growth mr newsome the nymex ceo said that nymex has "taken corrective steps" since amaranths collapse to look more carefully at big trading positions in contracts that arent near expiration it is amaranths dominance in such contracts that the senate report said helped inflate prices and run up trading losses at electric utilities that buy gas traditionally market regulators have applied much more scrutiny to contracts that are close to expiration because they can be settled by physical delivery of a commodity as a result a dominant trader could for example be in a position to demand more of a commodity than is actually available triggering a spike in prices in an interview nymex compliance and risk management head thomas lasala said his staff examined positions that amaranth held in aggregate across various nymex natural gas options and instruments not just in nymexs main benchmark futures contract some bets canceled others out and didnt appear to pose "horribly excessive" concentrations in retrospect he said amaranths holdings in nymexs main futures contract were "a bit heavy " nymex has since started focusing more on traders concentrations just in its main contracts he said but the chief executive of ice nymexs primary competitor argued in written testimony monday that nymex enabled amaranths trading tactics "nymex increased the limits applicable to amaranth apparently based solely on amaranths unsubstantiated requests and without seeking information about amaranths trading on ice or other markets despite its ability to request and obtain such information from market participants " said ice ceo jeffrey sprecher nymex disputes that characterization saying it conducted a review before making its decisions the federal energy regulatory commission is taking a tougher line with nymex even as the cftc is defending it ferc has authority to police certain natural gas transactions and mr newsome told the senate that at fercs urging nymex this february began asking traders seeking to hold positions over the regulatory maximum in expiring gas contracts to reveal far more about all of their outstanding trades the day the contract expires
