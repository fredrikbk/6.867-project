a cultural conversation with roy blount jr a transplanted southerner celebrates his roots with caveats birmingham ala to paraphrase jacques barzuns famous remark on americans and baseball those who would know the hearts and minds of southerners had better learn about college football krispy kreme doughnuts and country music and to many americans the gateway to these and many more dixie delights is a resident of massachusetts named roy blount jr mr blount lives in the berkshires with his wife the painter joan griswold and has two children from a previous marriage and three grandchildren he was raised in decatur ga where part of the town square is named for his father roy a blount a leading citizen who was chairman of the metropolitan atlanta rapid transit authority and chairman of the board of education when the local schools were integrated he was also president of decatur federal savings and loan back when his son told me over a plate of ribs before an npr benefit in birmingham ala "it was a jimmy stewart sort of deal " the son is in his own words "not quite so solid a citizen as my father was i think both my parents were afraid that college was going to change me into someone they couldnt quite recognize and to an extent that was true im not sure they understood that i would have to live up north to appreciate growing up in the south " mr blount says he left the south in search of "enlightenment " but he found some northerners werent quite so enlightened after graduating from vanderbilt university in nashville tenn he studied at harvard "people would always say to me boy it must have been a culture shock for you to go to harvard i tell them no it wasnt quite as good as i expected " mr blount who is giving a reading at madison square park tomorrow evening has been a reporter novelist sportswriter screenwriter essayist radio star country songwriter and even rock musician with a group called the rock bottom remainders currently on its th anniversary "still younger than keith" tour the band draws from a pool of such author amateur musician talent as amy tan dave barry stephen king ridley pearson scott turow and mitch albom its a means of having fun and letting off steam as the remainders did in a benefit concert during the recent american book expo in new york "were not exactly rock stars " mr blount says "but weve had some groupies bruce springsteen played with us once his critique was you guys arent too bad but dont get any better or youll just be another lousy band " between gigs with the band mr blount is a panelist on nprs weekly radio news quiz show "wait wait dont tell me " and writes books his latest "long time leaving dispatches from up south " is his th or th if you include an anthology he edited "roy blounts book of southern humor" "long time leaving" is a collection of pieces from various publications including atlantic monthly sports illustrated american heritage and the new york times on all subjects southern a sampler "when i was a boy in georgia college sports was georgia tech coach bobby dodd vs alabama coach bear bryant immemorial compared to that the harvard yale game is a panel discussion " and "caring about college sports in the northeast is like caring about french food in south carolina " "room temperature krispy kreme doughnuts are not bad they are just not heavenly enough i find to beguile a lipid conscious adult into feeling that a few cant hurt you whereas eating krispy kremes fresh off the line is comparable to eating sweet corn fresh off the stalk one can no more expect that krispy kremes be hot all the time than that life be sweet all the time " "i will stipulate for the sake of argument that hank williams wasnt puccini so the met will charge about &# a ticket for a lavish performance of madame butterfly but with a ten foot pole it wont touch your cheating heart which is the same story boiled down and less expensive " "long time leaving" is a celebration of things southern with a few glaring exceptions soybeans for instance "the south started going wrong when it started getting so heavy into the cultivation of soybeans soy is not southern ham is southern everywhere you look its soy milk soy ice cream soy meat soy i dont know what all why cant there be ham milk and ham ice cream and ham this and that " living in the berkshires more than years has afforded mr blount a certain perspective on his heritage he remarked at dinner "i remember marshall frady writing about how lyndon johnson figured hed never get to the white house owing to the southern odor on him i guess i still stink a little i like to roll in it some but ive never gotten past the apprehension that people smell me the wrong way " one who apparently did was npr radio host leonard lopate a couple of years ago at the nd street y in manhattan introducing the members of a panel on the subject of humor writing mr lopate described mr blount as "the worlds most sophisticated redneck " "i didnt quite know how to respond to that " mr blount told the birmingham audience that night "i only know of two definitions for redneck one a disparaging term for someone from the white rural laboring class or and im quoting my dictionary from memory someone with a provincial often bigoted sociopolitical attitude "both my grandfathers worked with their hands and my father once told me that his grandfather was poor as owl dung but that didnt make him a redneck unless you just apply the term to a farmer whose job kept him outdoors in the sun i dont want to make much of this though because im a little tired of so called blue collar comics who wave an identity politics flag at a time when the country has had enough of hearing about any ethnic groups hardships the truth is if i were the most sophisticated redneck in the world id be a lot more interesting writer " most of mr blounts readers have found him more than interesting his first book about the super bowl champion pittsburgh steelers "about three bricks shy of a load" was called by adam gopnik of the new yorker "the best of all books about pro football" and has been reissued by the university of pittsburgh press his biography of robert e lee for the penguin lives series has also been reissued in paperback mr blounts biggest fans include the late film critic pauline kael norman mailer and garrison keillor who wrote in the paris review that mr blount can be "literate uncouth and soulful all in one sentence " american heritage editor richard snow calls him "the greatest american humorist since mark twain " like mr twain one of mr blounts constant themes is preserving the best of the old south while encouraging the best of the new south "race relations in the south are better than they used to be " he told his birmingham audience "which you could say makes them less southern but i think people are also generally friendlier more personal in the south than in the north you have to get past the shopping malls to find much thats local in the south but its worth the effort " "anyway people have been talking about the south getting less southern for as long as i remember and no doubt some people are right but in the past couple of weeks ive been in both massachusetts and alabama and i didnt have any trouble telling which was which " politically mr blount is now as he has always been "a yellow dog democrat as in id sooner vote for a yellow dog than a republican " this is more complicated though than it sounds he explained to the audience several of whose members nodded in recognition "the yellow dog democrats of my fathers generation were mostly that way because republicans still represented the party of abraham lincoln those of my generation come from a different direction we are yellow dog democrats because we resent all those old style yellow dog democrats who when the democrats started getting votes from black people became dixiecrats then wallace ites then jumped ship to richard nixon we are yellow dog democrats because it feels natural we combine the hard headedness of our ancestors while rejecting the taint of peckerwood separatism " there are thinks mr blount other species of "dog" democrats such as bird dog democrats "theyd vote for a republican dog only if he can make a good point" and red dog democrats who "vote for a dog who makes sudden unexpected attacks on republican quarterbacks " yellow dog democrats mr blount maintains reserve the right to scoff at certain democratic candidates "i think southerners bring to national politics an energy and visceral punch thats sorely lacking in a candidates like john kerry i like northern liberals a term that takes in quite a few of my neighbors but ive never been able to shake the feeling that running one for president is like letting harvard play in the orange bowl " mr barra is from birmingham ala and writes about the arts for salon com
