milberg &amp who milberg weiss &amp bershad became just plain milberg weiss on monday when david bershad copped a felony plea and agreed to testify against the law firm that once bore his name the firm promptly airbrushed him from its letterhead but cosmetic fixes may not save the notorious firm from what mr bershad now says he and other senior partners did to gin up securities class action suits prosecutors are due to reconvene the grand jury as soon as thursday raising the possibility that more indictments are on their way mr bershads statement to the court makes much of the involvement of "partner a" and "partner b " who are widely assumed to be melvyn weiss and bill lerach neither of whom have been charged in the kickback case mr lerach is a former name partner who has said hell soon retire the world did not mourn the prosecution alleges that for years milberg weiss made secret payments to certain clients in exchange for those clients posing as plaintiffs in class actions steven schulman another former partner whose name once trailed after milberg and weiss was also indicted but he claims to be innocent mr bershads statement asserts that other top lawyers were intimately involved in a scheme that seems to have been controlled at the very top if this is true it once again raises the question of why justice indicted the entire law firm as well as the culpable partners the law may allow for treating a firm or company as a legal person for the purposes of criminal liability but in all but the rarest cases the bad actors are people not businesses the lawyers at milberg weiss who are not personally implicated in the case will no doubt land on their feet the main losers will be low level employees who had no involvement in any conspiracy mr bershads plea is nonetheless a victory for the justice department and vindicates its charges about plaintiff lawyer corruption it also vindicates critics who have long claimed that the securities class action business is mostly a dishonest racket see related letter "letters to the editor bad for business the case for well founded lawsuits" wsj aug
