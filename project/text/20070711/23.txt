business smokeless tobaccos bet lights fire under foes a vast and fast growing sum is riding on hopes of a healthy future for nonsmoked tobacco this multibillion dollar gamble reflected in a recent flurry of smokeless tobacco start ups acquisitions and expansions may need the support of three constituencies to pay off science consumers and public health authorities so far two are obliging science is showing that smokeless tobacco is safer than cigarettes and consumers are displaying a growing taste for tobacco served cold ranging from snuff and chewing tobacco to tobacco lozenges and nicotine gel but the public health community still disapproves it is on the verge of dealing a possibly lethal blow to the growth of smokeless tobacco via a bill expected to clear a key senate committee next week the bill reflects the reluctance of many public health officials to let the industry that lied about the health effects of cigarettes tell the truth about smokeless tobacco that smokeless tobacco is much less dangerous than cigarettes is clear from reams of research including some out of sweden where a sharp decline in male smoking amid a rise in smokeless tobacco use has corresponded with a big drop in tobacco related deaths among men smokeless tobacco which is just as addictive as cigarettes is linked with mouth and pancreatic cancer though those afflictions are more common in smokers still the american cancer societys michael thun a foe of smokeless tobacco concedes "theres no question that switching to spit tobacco and quitting tobacco altogether are both far less lethal than continuing to smoke " but surveys show that most smokers believe smokeless tobacco is just as dangerous as cigarettes and the proposed bill would make it all but impossible for a purveyor of smokeless tobacco in the u s to set the record straight among other hurdles a company would have to prove to the food and drug administration that touting the lower risks of smokeless tobacco would make the product an appealing alternative to smokers without attracting new users from the population at large without fda approval a company couldnt mention in news releases on its web site or in conversations with journalists scientific research showing smokeless tobacco carries lower risks than smoking even in wooing smokers makers of smokeless products would face a new challenge the law would ban free samples to smokers in adult only venues such as bars "it is difficult to imagine a company gaining fda approval to market a modified risk tobacco product based on a reduced risk claim at least in the near term " concluded a recent report on the proposed legislation by the congressional research service an arm of the library of congress the fda already regulates nicotine gums and patches designed to help people stop smoking it requires those products to bear such elaborate warnings that many smokers according to surveys wrongly perceive them as no less dangerous than cigarettes in fact gums and patches are the safest available source of nicotine free of any association with cancer "we are proud of the role we have played in approving several products over the past few years to aid americans in smoking prevention and cessation " an fda spokeswoman says yet maybe american smokers suffering coughs and chest pains already are figuring out what many public health officials dont want them to know its the smoke as volume sales of cigarettes in the u s continue their long decline volume sales of smokeless tobacco are rising about a year in sweden the percentage of men who smoke has fallen to about the lowest in the industrialized world as the percentage using smokeless tobacco has risen to about without any government encouragement for a long deceitful industry whose cigarettes have killed legions a new host of legal impediments could be viewed as just desserts but among smokeless purveyors surviving regulation would likely prove hardest for tiny start ups that never lied about the dangers of tobacco that have created smokeless products with reduced risks and that unlike the cigarette giants now invading the smokeless market have no incentive to keep smokers smoking in an industry whose giants employ battalions of scientists tiny start ups such as star scientific inc have introduced the most innovative and arguably lowest risk tobacco products a dissolves in the mouth tobacco lozenge for instance or a nicotine gel that is rubbed on the skin such products can deliver a fix of nicotine the addictive and relatively benign agent in tobacco at a tiny fraction of the risk of cigarettes but the new legislation would impose costs that tiny companies likely couldnt afford of course winning fda approval has always been easier for big deep pocketed companies but while it may be unfair for a system to favor pharmaceutical giants over biotech start ups its somehow more unsettling for the advantage to go to a big tobacco player like altria group inc s philip morris usa although philip morris is experimenting with smokeless products it has yet to launch any nationally it remains the nations largest seller of cigarettes and it supports the proposed legislation philip morris declines to comment see related letters "letters to the editor where theres no smoke products theres fired up opposition" wsj july
