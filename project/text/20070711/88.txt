oil companies stake future on canada reversal of pipelines marks shift in outlook global warming clash the future of the u s oil industry arrived last year in cushing okla moving along at two miles an hour it was the first crude from the albertan oil sands to reach as far south as the giant cushing pipeline hub one of the locations where global oil prices are set to get there the crude traveled through a pipeline that for decades carried oil in the opposite direction a month later a second pipeline was reversed and canadian crude reached all the way down to southeast texas the worlds largest cluster of petrochemical plants and refineries and the traditional front door for much of the u s s oil supplies the pipelines operated by enbridge inc and exxon mobil corp represent long term multibillion dollar investments in infrastructure to enable canadian crude to keep cars running on u s roads but the shift requires billions of dollars in investment and could clash long term with efforts to curb global warming and still wont be enough to quench the thirst for oil in the u s which consumes roughly one out of every four of the more than million barrels produced daily around the world currently the u s pipeline grid is set up to import oil into the gulf coast some of that oil is sent north by pipeline or barge to refineries in the countrys midwest region but global supplies are increasingly unreliable as shown by exxons and conocophillipss decision last month to leave venezuela a major crude supplier to the u s rather than give up lucrative projects there to a nationalization wave canada is a reliable exporter free from the political turmoil that racks much of the oil producing world "its a big expansion of canadian supplies into the u s " says shirley j neff president of the association of oil pipe lines "there is no way a pipeline company will make an investment if it doesnt see a long term supply source and a market that needs to be served over the long term " albertas massive gunky oil sands deposits which yield a heavy oil that is dirtier and more difficult to turn into gasoline are about the same size as saudi arabias but cost more to process and turn into fuel the oil sands currently produce about million barrels a day but are expected to churn out million barrels a day by much of this new supply is expected to be exported to the u s however rising costs and labor constraints could hamper production and rising internal canadian demand could affect export levels producers are very interested in capturing more u s markets for canadian crude although exact figures arent compiled the amount being spent on canadian oil sands development new pipelines to bring the crude to the u s and to retrofit refineries is expected to top &# billion a year through the middle of the next decade this easily exceeds the amount being spent to build the u s ethanol industry according to london based consultant new energy finance "the people who understand the industry the best understand that long term the most substantive solution is in the oil sands " says charles swanson managing partner in the houston office of ernst &amp young "the fundamental economics are stronger than the stuff we hear about today that is trendy and sexy " he says referring to ethanol and other biofuels but that environmental push could pose a barrier extracting the heavy canadian crude and turning it into gasoline requires more energy and produces more carbon dioxide the main global warming gas than turning a barrel of conventional texas light oil into gasoline if regulators begin to tax carbon emissions that would put gasoline from oil sands at an economic disadvantage says peter tertzakian chief energy economist with arc financial corp a calgary alberta private equity investor the industry is also gambling that oil prices will stay high if they collapse expensive oil sands projects may not pay off during the past year canadian crude has pushed deeper into the u s than ever before capturing new markets as traditional sources of supply for the giant gulf coast refining complex fall off mexico a major crude exporter is facing falling output levels led by the rapid decline of its giant cantarell field the growing mexican economy is demanding more fuel lowering export levels further venezuela is in the process of booting out western oil companies and its unpredictable leader is talking about shipping oil to china not long ago plentiful venezuelan crude traveled by pipeline into illinois where it was turned into gasoline for midwestern drivers today there isnt enough venezuelan crude to create a need to pipe it to illinois the rising tide of canadian crude is subtly changing the political rhetoric in washington "energy independence" is being redefined so that canadian crude isnt really viewed as an import "the desire for independence is due to political instability throughout the world and that doesnt apply to canada " says patrick d daniel chief executive of enbridge the calgary based pipeline company in september bp plc said it would spend &# billion at its whiting ind refinery so that as much as of the crude it takes in will be canadian the next month conocophillips and encana corp said they would create a joint venture that matches oil sands production with u s refineries in may husky energy inc bought a refinery in lima ohio for &# billion the company expects to spend an additional &# billion to &# billion to add equipment so the refinery can process heavier canadian crudes meanwhile earlier this month enbridge and exxon said they are considering building a pipeline from illinois to the gulf coast to help bring even more canadian crude canada has a huge pool of untapped oil and the u s is the largest oil consumer in the world says enbridges mr daniel "this really is a perfect marriage we have two countries with the best relationship of any two countries in the world "
