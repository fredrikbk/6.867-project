based kb home "i love all her things " says menyon green a year old nurse who bought a martha stewart kb home in this atlanta suburb earlier this year "i just knew this was going to be a good

more martha homes its how can i get more lots in front of me " he says from march through june the two martha stewart developments alone drew of the people who visited kbs subdivisions in the atlanta metro area according to kb but the success of the martha kb venture launched months ago could pose a potential dilemma how to expand a successful product fast enough to boost profit but without weakening the brand from overexposure "right now its a unique type of offering " says rita rodriguez chief executive of enterprise ig in the u s a brand and design agency "you can invite someone to your home and say this is a martha stewart home but if its replicated and stamped across too many odd markets the uniqueness can be gone that cache and aspiration isnt there and you just become like everybody else " the martha kb partnership is a closely watched experiment in brand marketing the conventional wisdom among home builders was that home buying decisions were based on two primary considerations price and location while those factors are still extremely important for home buyers the success of the martha homes shows that branding also matters in some cases the martha homes
