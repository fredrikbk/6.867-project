camp teaches power of geekdom during the last week of june hundreds of chicago area girls learned how to be geeks at least that is the way best buy co s installation and repair business called geek squad hoped the girls will look at it while some kids attend summer camps with swimming and crafts these girls used games involving strings and balloons at a four day technology academy hosted by the electronics retailer to learn how a wireless home network works the camp could boost the sixth through th graders interest in a technology career or help them simply make the most of their personal electronic gadgets in the long run it might also strengthen best buys pipeline of workers for one of its expanding and most important businesses "these experiences are really pre employment experiences " said geek squad founder robert stephens "we need to find great people if were going to continue to grow this business " mr stephens sold his minneapolis based geek squad to best buy in as the retailer looked for ways to supplement in store service the hour support service is available through u s stores in about a dozen standalone outlets and through about "agents " as geek squad calls its workers who make house calls best buy also has about installers for home theater systems providing technical help for its customers is one way that best buy circuit city stores inc and other specialty electronics retailers are trying to separate themselves from discount retailers that has become especially important as wal mart stores inc costco wholesale corp and others tap into the explosive growth of high definition televisions with their flat screens and sleek designs the consumer electronics association estimates million high definition televisions will be sold in bringing u s household penetration to by the end of the year new gadgets are typically very profitable for retailers but those margins drop as the technology is adopted by more consumers excess production by tv manufacturers and market share battles among some retailers late last year led to a tv price war that accelerated that process the pricing battle has bruised profit margins at best buy and circuit city and has contributed to store closings by tweeter home entertainment group inc which filed for chapter bankruptcy protection compusa inc and others the loss of the tailwind from flat panel tv sales makes the impact of margin compression in other product categories more of an issue said bear stearns analyst christopher horvers "the key becomes services " mr horvers told clients in a research note geek squads moira hardek who has been with the firm since developed the summer program at her alma mater high school chicagos mother mcauley liberal arts high after working on some smaller workshops for students she wanted to focus on girls because they historically are under represented in the information technology field at the camp geek squad agents taught the girls how to build their own personal computers understand programming and tap into the high tech benefits of digital cameras some older girls got vouchers to continue their computer education at a local community college ms hardek said in addition to the classes the girls made jewelry out of computer parts and participated in the "wii olympics" using nintendo co s popular videogame system installing and repairing home computers high definition televisions and other complicated consumer electronic equipment is a multibillion dollar industry said steve baker a vice president with research firm npd research much of the work is done by independent installers with only of consumers in a recent npd survey reporting they purchased installation services from big box retailers manufacturers of the products and an increasing number of retailers also look to offer some help either through in home services or by software that allows them to access a customers computer remotely he said "services can be very profitable " mr baker said "it has a much higher profit margin than a product does and it builds some loyalty towards you as a company if you can fix peoples problems it generates traffic by bringing people into the store to have those problems taken care of " best buy and circuit city have taken different approaches to building services best buy acquired an established business and says it intends to expand geek squad into the largest north american provider of residential and business computer repair support and installation services last year it opened a centralized repair center in hillview ky that handles about pcs a day and it is conducting a test in charlotte and indianapolis of placing geek squad agents in fedex corp s fedex kinko stores meanwhile circuit city re launched its much smaller services group last year under the brand "firedog " and it is adding to the home theater and information technology services group as business warrants the richmond va retailer is expanding its services work force by to in fiscal but it also uses third parties for some of the work geek squad and other services from best buy generated about &# billion last year for best buy or less than of revenue according to deutsche bank estimates firedog meanwhile generated about &# million although that amount is expected to double this year in the first quarter sales of firedog services jumped one of a few bright spots in circuit citys otherwise weak quarter investments in firedog to expand that business are expected to offset some of the cost savings circuit city generated by layoffs and other changes this year prices for the services range from about &# for simple consultations to hundreds of dollars for installing networks or home theater equipment technology services are good for retailers business in other ways when best buy uses its force to install home theater systems it sees to fewer returns or exchanges and involving a geek squad employee on computer related transactions cuts the return rate by executives said during their most recent earnings conference call some of the returns are tied to the frustrations of installing or using the technology but industrywide plummeting prices on sleek flat screen tvs also has had some consumers returning products to get lower prices costco this year changed its unlimited policy on returning consumer electronics to days after huge numbers of flat screen tvs came back it has now set up a "concierge" technical support phone service for help with simple issues wal marts sams club warehouse chain also is testing some installation services office products retailers are also getting in to the services game officemax inc for example in april launched remote tech support services
