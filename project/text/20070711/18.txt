behind a bear analysts subprime call as the market for risky home loans was beginning to implode in february bear stearns cos analyst gyan sinha hosted a conference call for investors telling them they had little to worry about unfortunately there was a lot to worry about two weeks after his prediction a closely watched part of the abx a popular index that tracks securities made up of subprime or risky home loans would hit a new low yesterday amid warnings from rating companies standard &amp poors and moodys that hundreds of bonds backed by mortgage loans may be downgraded soon that same portion of the index hit its worst level ever for years mr sinha years old has been one of the most respected mortgage analysts on wall street garnering top rankings from investor trade magazines and has been renowned for a string of savvy calls but in the wake of two embarrassing mortgage related hedge fund meltdowns at bear mr sinha the firms top analyst covering asset backed securities is getting a bit of a beating "its time to buy the index " he told clients on the feb call according to a participant based on bears models "the market has overreacted " the participant says mr sinha added to events like the early february announcements from british bank hsbc holdings plc and mortgage lender new century financial corp that losses from risky mortgage defaults were mounting even then some found the assessment over the top "when you read the research bear put out you can think of one of two things " says independent housing economist thomas lawler who poked fun at mr sinhas bullish view in his own market commentary on feb "one is they werent getting it as fast as others or two they were really trying to talk the market back up i dont know which " but there is no evidence mr sinha was hyping the market to help bear responding in a written statement to inquiries about his february research mr sinha defended his call saying the point was to give investors a frank sense of the underlying value of the mortgage securities the index tracked he added that his research wasnt intended as "a prediction of where the index would trade in the future based on technical or other market forces " he said bear didnt pressure him to be bullish the firm said in a statement "gyan is a top analyst with a distinguished track record and we stand by the quality of his work " in mid june bear hired year old mortgage analyst peter dimartino who had been a managing director at rbs greenwich capital fueling speculation on wall street that mr sinhas responsibilities could be reduced in his statement mr sinha dismissed that notion saying he has no plans to leave bear and that mr dimartino will be reporting to him even some of the subprime bears acknowledge that unusual market conditions including the unprecedented combination of falling housing prices and stable unemployment figures have made the mortgage securities market difficult to assess "the first page of the presentation i give to investors these days is called uncharted territory " says karen weaver head of global securitization research for deutsche bank and a pessimist on the subprime housing market since the fall of mr sinhas views of the subprime market have garnered extra attention because bear is one of the biggest players in the origination and securitization of mortgages as well as the trading of mortgage backed securities and related products since bears asset management unit had also been running a very successful hedge fund called the high grade structured credit strategies fund which invested heavily in the subprime market with long term holdings of securities backed by pools of risky mortgages in august bear opened a second riskier fund that was based on the same general strategy mr sinha didnt work for the asset management unit or the hedge funds together the two funds would eventually control a total of &# billion in equity and borrowed capital but they turned out to be too big a gamble and hit the rocks last month after a series of fire sales of mortgage assets and a slew of margin calls or requests from lenders for additional cash or collateral that couldnt be met mr sinha started working at bear in born in india and educated both there and in the u s the young analyst quickly gained the respect of bear investors and associates on the street mr sinha frequently topped wall streets main lists for the best fixed income or bond analysts and the weekly report he contributed to "across the curve " was read closely by clients but with his bullish call on feb which was followed by a research report in which he said that negative housing scenarios should be taken "with a large grain of salt " some investors and fellow analysts started wondering if mr sinha was missing the boat their primary evidence his predictions for a particularly risky slice of the abx index tracking supbrime mortgages that were issued late in based on his teams models for the abx which assumed among other things that housing prices would be flat rather than down in mr sinha assigned a "fair value" of to the slice of the index on feb that slice fell to its low at the time of and according to markit group ltd its administrator after a rally later in march and april sank to a new low yesterday of mr sinha says a flat home price assumption for this year is "reasonable and consistent" with government data and that bear provides software that allows investors to create their own models deutsche banks ms weaver says there was a sound rationale for the bear researchers
