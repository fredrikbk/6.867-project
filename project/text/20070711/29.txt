china inc runs the bulls companies bets pay off for now but a market reversal could prove damaging beijing many chinese corporations are putting piles of cash into local stocks fueling the bull market and their own profits but the enthusiasm in corporate boardrooms for stock investing creates the potential for a nasty fallout if the market turns sour chinas benchmark stock index has quadrupled in value in less than two years and is up about this year even after cooling a bit in the past several weeks that is whetting the appetites of many company executives for investment profits china yangtze power co is a utility company involved in the three gorges dam project among its assets it lists investments in other big state owned firms like air china ltd china construction bank corp and industrial &amp commercial bank of china fu zhenbang china yangtzes board secretary said many of those stockholdings help cement china yangtzes business ties with others in the electric power industry about of the companys investments are geared toward reaping quick profits of that segment of its holdings mr fu said "the purpose is to get a return on investment in a short period of time so we dont really hold the shares for a long time " many companies are increasingly dependent on investment gains for profits according to estimates by goldman sachs and wind information corp a shanghai based financial data provider gains on investments including stocks contributed of overall profit at listed nonfinancial companies in the first quarter of that was up from in the previous quarter with chinese interest rates low the standard rate for a one year loan is some companies are even breaking regulatory rules and using borrowed money to juice their returns "its an unfortunate diversion from their core business " says michael kurtz asia strategist for bear stearns "what we see is chinese companies who have some available cash on the balance sheet deciding they can get a better return on that money by investing in the stock market rather than plowing it back into the business or returning it to shareholders " for now corporate investment gains are helping to propel chinas market upward as stock prices rise companies that turn investment profits on their stocks are reporting better earnings that gives investors confidence to bid stock prices even higher but the scenario could easily play out in reverse a drop in the market could feed through into reduced company profits which would then put added downward pressure on stock prices further hurting the bottom lines this virtuous circle where investment gains lead to higher profits which spur the market even higher is similar to what happened during the tech stock bubble when companies such as intel corp and chase manhattan bank now j p morgan chase reported higher earnings because of gains on their investments of course those gains turned to losses after the market turned south "this increases the overall risk of the market " says he chengying research director at guosen securities in shenzhen a regular government survey of chinas industrial companies shows their profits this year are as of the end of may running above last years level analysts are debating what is driving the profit growth and whether it can be sustained it isnt just investment gains chinas economy is booming strong earnings growth also reflects successful overhauls at state enterprises and the growing number of efficient private sector companies and profits include outsize contributions from sectors like oil steel and mining which have enjoyed windfall gains from high commodity prices still the focus on playing the stock market is unmistakable youngor group co which makes clothing is a major shareholder in citic securities co a brokerage firm and in zhejiang guangbo group co a maker of office supplies and recently bought into bank of ningbo co ahead of its initial public offering people at youngor declined to comment some companies are setting up separate units to handle stock investments jinling pharmaceutical co a drug maker and haima investment group co which owns part of a car making venture with japans mazda motor corp have both set up investment funds to buy into initial public offerings ipos in chinas market have typically performed very well at jinling and haima there are limits on the size of the investments each company asked for and received shareholder approval to use company funds for that purpose a sign investors may not be disturbed by the trend "the top priority for us is to control and minimize risks " a jinling official said haima investment couldnt be reached for comment it is hard to quantify the scope of corporate stockholdings because disclosure is so minimal guosen securities research unit sifted through annual reports for and found just listed companies out of more than broke down their investments in stocks or mutual funds "there is a lot of unseen or off balance sheet investment by corporations and institutions who do not want to be identified " says jerry lou china strategist for morgan stanley in hong kong there is also the risk that a regulatory crackdown could cause some companies to pull their money out of the market some suspect the china markets slump of the past month or so could be related to the toughening regulatory climate including new rules requiring brokerage firms to keep better records of stock transactions in june banking regulators said they found that china shipping group co used at least billion yuan &# million in borrowed funds to invest in the stock market last year because chinese law forbids banks from lending money for stock purchases the regulator said it disciplined the six banks that made the loans including fines and sanctions for personnel involved and restrictions on some of the branches involved in a statement after the investigation was publicized china shipping said it had improved internal controls over its use of funds to avoid a repeat of the problem sue feng contributed to this article
