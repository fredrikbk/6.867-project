parched outback in australia a drought spurs a radical remedy government proposal could shut farms wee waa feels the pain wee waa australia this tiny town thrived for the past few decades as a center of australias burgeoning cotton industry while the country became one of worlds largest exporters with government encouragement farmers moved in across the countrys biggest river system to grow the thirsty crop now australia is staggering through one of its worst ever droughts and cotton production has plummeted in wee waa the cotton fields motel that once was busy with seasonal workers now struggles to fill rooms elsewhere in the flat basin kangaroos hop along dry levees and the ends of giant water transport pipes poke out over empty reservoirs the droughts severity and impact are spurring australia the worlds driest inhabited continent to tackle a problem that also is starting to afflict more populous countries how to survive with less water australian leaders spent decades building reservoir systems to try to turn vast expanses of marginal cropland in its harsh interior into an agricultural mecca but recent years have brought record drought and predictions that climate changes from global warming could make australias interior even drier that has the government looking to change course while farmers protest that the droughts havent gotten worse only the politics surrounding them in the u s farmers and policy makers squabble over how to keep dwindling water resources like the ogallala aquifer from disappearing in china beijing is struggling to keep the yellow river known as the cradle of chinese civilization from drying out the australian governments proposal to preserve its murray darling river basin is one of the most far reaching anywhere it calls for taking over management of water rights from the local jurisdictions that share the basin something akin to washington taking over the mississippi river the government proposes buying out farmers from areas with too little water and upgrading irrigation systems to reduce waste from leaching channels or leaking pipes in all the budget is &# billion a significant sum in a nation of only million people the man in charge of selling the plan is malcolm turnbull a former goldman sachs banker turned politician a policy wonk who taught himself into an expert on water conservation issues australias minister of environment and water resources has succeeded in persuading three states and the capital territory that includes canberra to endorse the program but he is struggling with the last state that shares the basin region victoria officials there are due to propose demands for a compromise tomorrow the project faces a number of hurdles likely to come up in other water challenged countries farmers are skeptical over whether global warming has significant impact in an area that historically has suffered long droughts theyre also doubtful whether the federal government is qualified to run a water system essential to australias agricultural prosperity the murray darling river system spreads across one seventh of australias land and accounts for more than of the countrys agricultural production in aboriginal tales some of its waterways are said to have been laid out through the countrys southeastern corner by a mythological fish that dragged river channels across the parched outback its agricultural tradition which includes wheat and vegetable farming looms large in the australian psyche which celebrates the rugged individualism of frontier living though agriculture forms only of the economy communities like wee waa are surrounded by vast nearly desolate spaces covered in reddish soil and dotted with rocks small shrubs and occasional eucalyptus trees at certain times of the year cotton lint litters the dusty roadways near farms large rectangles of cotton pressed into the size and shape of freight containers punctuate the landscape as do ghost town remnants of previous farming booms and busts australias states have fought over the river basins unpredictable flows ever since they banded together to form a commonwealth in the early s they eventually formed a regional body now known as the murray darling basin commission to help oversee water planning but individual states can veto its policy initiatives making it difficult for the body to reach consensus on water disputes from the s to the s the australian government built huge reservoirs to make the water supply more predictable and promoted cotton growing to help distribute the countrys population more evenly across australias desolate interior farmers access to the water was regulated by "entitlements" that state governments issued many water officials now say australian states handed out too many entitlements in a bid to draw in more people and often states have had to limit them residents at the bottom of the basin also suspect farmers upstream take more water than they are supposed to under the rules paul kahl a farmer who emigrated from merced calif to wee waa with his family in the s arrived when the local grocery stores had no refrigeration and vegetables were sold from the back of a neighbors truck the kahls and their cotton farm prospered other growers flocked to the region where the soil and sunny weather were generally good for growing cotton when water was available wee waa grew from about people in the s to more than in recent years and became australias self described "cotton capital " by australia was producing more than three million bales of cotton a year on million acres for a time the third largest exporter far behind the u s at no it has since slipped to sixth at about a third of its peak production below average rains the past several years failed to refill the reservoirs and then the drought worsened last year rainfall in the murray darling region averaged just about inches the third lowest level since in some parts of southern australia rainfall levels were only a fraction of their all time lows prime minister john howard recently suggested residents "pray for rain " although some areas have received heavy rainfall in recent months suggesting to farmers the drought may be ending so far it has done little to reduce the longer term shortages on wee waas main thoroughfare an auto parts dealer a livestock company and several other businesses are boarded up seed companies are selling only a fifth of their peak seed volume mr kahls farm now run by his son james a lean year old produced just bales of cotton last year compared with normally some of his fields have been empty the past two years and a riverbed that runs through the property is reduced to a few stagnant pools james kahl doesnt doubt officials handed out too many water entitlements over the years but he doesnt think the federal government will necessarily manage water any better he says his familys first years on the farm were unusually wet and now the area is probably coming to the end of a year dry period driving across his property in a white suv he points out areas where huge floods swept across the farms black fields in past years bureaucrats may ignore such cycles he says and simply push to drive farmers out "there are people who really think we shouldnt make anything off these rivers " mr kahl said one recent afternoon as white cockatoos squawked around him and emus gathered on his empty fields theyd like "to let it all go back to kangaroos and wild pigs and then the world will be a happy place " three hours drive to the north the reservoirs at acre cubbie station are empty except for dried logs and other debris the farm grew cotton on just of its land last year its owners say their operation was designed to withstand fallow years at the farms headquarters in a low rise country house the walls are covered with maps showing rainfall back to the early s including decadelong stretches of dry weather mr turnbull the year old environment minister grew up in sydney and was a rhodes scholar in the s he served as an adviser to the late kerry packer once australias richest man he then ran his own investment bank for years and made a fortune now estimated at about &# million or more in part by selling an internet service provider he co founded meanwhile in the early s he led a group that tried to remove the queen of england as australias titular head of state and make australia a republic a bid that failed but gave mr turnbull a high profile mr turnbull was managing director of goldman sachs australia from until then in he was elected to australias parliament as a member of the liberal party of mr howard an ally of president bush mr turnbull a man with a patrician air and conservative suits represents a wealthy section of sydney and is often cited as a possible future prime minister he has long spoken out about climate change and australias water challenges peppering his speeches with references to thomas malthus an economist from the s who predicted the world would be unable to sustain its population growth he also has a cattle and sheep farm north of sydney where he says water levels have dropped distressingly low in wells and dams that serve the area mr howard tapped mr turnbull to become a special secretary for water issues and later promoted him to his current cabinet level post as australias drought worsened toward the end of last year the government came under increasing pressure to act one issue it had to deal with was whether the drought was being caused by global warming studies by climate change experts have suggested that some areas such as southeast asia will get wetter from changing dynamics connected to global warming but the interior of australia will get drier as weather patterns dump more rain elsewhere though rainfall patterns also are expected to become more varied and unpredictable mr howard had long played down the idea of climate change but mr turnbull was convinced it was real "the scientists will tell you that its hard to unpick how much is natural climate variability and how much is global warming " mr turnbull says in an interview in the cramped office in a shopping mall where he meets constituents he adds "theres lot more of us now theres a lot more hectares of irrigated agriculture theres a lot more people in the cities and the amount of water availability hasnt increased " mr howard too started to talk of himself as a "climate change realist " suggesting he believed australia should consider steps now in case global warming proved to be a bigger problem later the idea of taking control of murray darling had long held favor in canberra politicians figured it would be too difficult to wrest power from the states but in private meetings last year messrs howard turnbull and others concluded the drought situation was dire enough that australians would support tough changes it helped that the federal government was flush with money allowing it to spend on investments that would appeal to state leaders in january the government proposed replacing the basin commission with a new body that would answer to the federal government giving canberra power to settle disputes over water allocations the plan also includes a top to bottom assessment of the river systems status to find where it is overtaxed and where steps could be taken to ease the burden that could be achieved by buying out farmers or improving the infrastructure for instance lining irrigation canals with concrete to prevent seepage columnists and academics praised the plans audacity but it drew harsh criticism from farmers and state leaders who said they werent consulted some feared buying out farmers would effectively dismantle parts of australias agricultural economy one editorial cartoonist portrayed mr turnbull in a safari outfit similar to the one worn by deceased wildlife personality steve irwin and expensive lace up dress shoes mr turnbull went on the offensive in one interview he compared a state premier who opposed the plan to a "drowning man" who rejects a life jacket because "it doesnt match the color of his tie " but he also began to soften his stance making clear he would accept revisions including strengthening an independent panel of experts that would oversee the federal governments water management victoria officials are expected to demand more such as retaining local rights to build dams or take other steps to secure more water in wee waa some farmers are preparing for change cotton grower will kirkby uses high tech probes to measure soil moisture increasingly common to help farmers be more selective about irrigating but hes also exploring other crops that might offer a better return on the water hes using just in case like olives "we might not be cotton farmers forever " he says
