the irs has a new weapon your tax pro law deputizes preparers to police their clients higher fees a likely result a new law that puts the onus on tax preparers to head off tax dodging is expected to lead to more paperwork and higher fees for some taxpayers the law is intended to make preparers more cautious about signing tax returns that include questionable or aggressive tax items without disclosing the details to the internal revenue service on a special form stiff penalties may be imposed not only on income tax preparers but also on those who prepare estate and gift tax returns employment and excise tax returns and returns of tax exempt organizations as a result some taxpayers who try to get their preparer to sign a return may need to provide more documentation than in the past to support aggressive tax positions in some cases fees could go up as preparers need to do more research on complex or blurry tax rules and some accountants expect a few clients will shop around for a more amenable tax pro willing to agree to what the client wants paid preparers from certified public accountants and lawyers to storefront operations handle more than half of all individual income tax returns and an even greater percentage of those filed by high income taxpayers fees can range from a couple of hundred dollars for a simple return to thousands of dollars for complex cases the new law enacted in may as part of wide ranging legislation that included funding for the iraq war reflects efforts by congress to narrow the nations tax gap or the amount of taxes believed to go unpaid each year irs researchers have estimated the tax gap at about &# billion the basic idea for the new law came from congress and senior irs officials were surprised by its enactment an irs spokesman in washington declined to comment on the new law "its politically unacceptable to put more agents on the street or increase the irss budget " says cono namorato a former irs official and now a washington lawyer at caplin &amp drysdale thus the new law represents "an attempt to deputize" more tax practitioners by "holding them to a higher standard " tax preparers have long faced possible penalties for signing questionable returns without specifically disclosing the tax positions in question but the new law raises the standards considerably and sharply boosts penalties to &# or half the preparers total fee whichever is larger fines for preparers showing "willful or reckless conduct" are much higher still tax preparers can sign returns with questionable tax positions if those positions are disclosed typically using irs form but some clients may object to filing the form fearing it could raise red flags at the irs "we will be using far more form disclosures with returns and im not sure how clients will react " says claudia hill the owner of tax mam a tax services firm in cupertino calif many accountants claim the new law is unfair since it applies higher standards to return preparers than to taxpayers this could put the two parties at odds ms hill says she recently spent three hours with a new client who had asked her to review two years of returns he had prepared for himself "there were three obvious issues he had taken" that could raise questions ms hill says when she explained the new law "he quickly figured out that i could not prepare his returns taking those aggressive positions without full disclosure " but that he could do so on his own ms hill says she is now considering the clients request to engage her merely to "consult" on his returns not to prepare them "i have to figure out at what point advice i give about a return becomes return preparation " she says congress made the law effective in may but the irs recently said the new standards typically will apply to returns filed starting next year thus effectively exempting returns that have received filing extensions still the new law generally is in effect for advice that preparers give today to clients for returns filed next year tax advisers are particularly concerned about conversations with clients over gray areas such as issues where courts have issued contradictory rulings for example are investment management and advisory fees paid by a trustee or an estate fully deductible for income tax purposes one federal appeals court has said yes several others have said no under the old law a preparer in a court circuit that hasnt yet issued a ruling on the subject could have argued there was a "realistic possibility" of success the previous standard for a preparer to sign off on a tax return since one federal appeals court had ruled that way but can that same preparer do so under the new law which requires a preparer to have a "reasonable belief" that an undisclosed tax position was "more likely than not" to be the correct treatment no several tax advisers say mr namorato says that if a client came to him seeking advice on that issue "i would advise him not to take the position without disclosure " the u s supreme court recently agreed to hear a case on this subject a very important issue in the high stakes world of estate and gift taxation researching whether arcane tax strategies meet the higher standard will likely push up some tax return preparation fees next year especially for thorny questions on which the irs hasnt published any guidance accountants say "fees in many cases will increase particularly where you have the more complex situations and complex transactions " says stephen r buschel a certified public accountant and tax partner at bdo seidman llp in new york city he says the law is too new to estimate how much fees might go up preparers will have to "exercise more care in evaluating issues to ensure they are accurate in amount and technical merit before they report it on a tax return " says an aide to senate finance committee chairman max baucus d mont "preparers are tax professionals and it is reasonable to expect that they believe an item they place on a taxpayers tax return has at least odds of being correct " he says another highly complex issue that taxpayers might find themselves questioned about is whether a family limited partnership has been set up correctly based on irs rules and a long series of court decisions these partnerships are a popular technique used to slash estate and gift taxes typically they involve transferring assets into a partnership that includes someones heirs the irs has attacked what it considers misuses of the strategy the upper crust is expanding an irs report says more than three million federal income tax returns reported adjusted gross income of &# or more for according to the irss statistics of income bulletin thats the highest on record and up from the figure the latest data available represented about of all returns filed for that year up from for the irs is required by a law to publish these data each year separately a report by merrill lynch and capgemini estimates the u s had about million "millionaires" in defined as those with investable assets of at least &# million excluding primary residence that number was up from the prior year says ileana van der linde principal of the wealth management practice at consulting firm capgemini the irs redesigns a form to request "innocent spouse" relief when you sign a joint federal income tax return you typically are liable for all taxes due on that return in some cases though you may be able to qualify for "innocent spouse" relief see the irss new form which a spokesman says is designed to "help reduce follow up questions " the new form "will ask more questions initially but collecting critical information early in the process will mean faster processing " the irs estimates the new design will eliminate an estimated follow up letters each year briefs congresss joint committee on taxation www house gov jct issues a pamphlet with background on taxation of "carried interest " a key issue for private equity and hedge fund managers and others the senate finance committee plans a hearing on the subject today email taxreport wsj com returns policy recent federal legislation imposes higher standards on tax preparers some taxpayers with complex returns will see more paperwork and increased fees more questionable tax items are likely to be disclosed to the irs on a separate form tax advisers say the new rules mostly affect gray areas of the law concerning income taxes and estate and gift taxes
