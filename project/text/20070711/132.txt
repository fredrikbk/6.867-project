truck makers and emissions stockholm governments around the world are tightening emissions standards for heavy duty trucks forcing the worlds largest manufacturers to increase spending on research and raising concerns that sales and profits could suffer the european union u s and japan all are pushing for cuts in diesel engine emissions of nitrogen oxide or nox and sooty particulates the main contributors to smog and acid rain truck manufacturers in europe are positioning themselves for the technical leap needed to meet tough new eu standards expected to be outlined this summer eu standards have already forced truck manufacturers to spend more money on research and development but there are concerns that the lower fuel efficiency some new emission control systems bring about could raise costs for drivers slowing future sales all truck makers could be financially affected if customers begin to postpone the purchase of new trucks said paul greening director of emissions and fuels at the brussels based european automobile manufacturers association "with fuel making up about a third of a trucks costs efficiency is very important when a customer is choosing a vehicle " mr greening said anders johannesson vice president of environment and public affairs at volvo ab says demand for cutting edge trucks should remain strong in europe partially because some countries like germany are giving significant financial incentives to truckers using green vehicles "we are spending a lot of money on r&amp d and a lot of that goes to meeting the emission legislation with engine developments which is very costly for the industry " mr johannesson said "you have to have a large economies of scale to handle the increased costs " volvo ab the truck maker is separate from ford motor co s volvo car making unit in heavy duty diesel vehicles contributed of land based nox emissions and of particulate emissions in the european union member states at that time despite expected growth of in road traffic between and the european commission forecasts nox emissions will fall to of the eu total and particulates will drop to of the total by as the new standards kick in and older vehicles leave the road the u s and japan are also putting tight caps on emissions the u s introduced standards jan that will phase in through japan will reduce emission levels further in both countries limits will be tighter than the euro levels which go into effect in mr greening estimates that euro standards slated to take effect by will cost european truck makers about billion euros &# billion a year by mostly due to the extra spending on hardware and r&amp d currently sales in the european truck industry amount to about billion euros a year in the eu trucks carried of the blocs inland freight in the last full year of statistics from the european automobile manufacturers association germanys daimlerchrysler ag the worlds leading truck maker with more than half a million mercedes benz and freightliner trucks sold in spent billion euros on research and development in its truck division last year up from a company spokeswoman said a big chunk of that spending is to meet the tightening emissions standards the company recently agreed to sell its chrysler unit to private equity group cerberus capital management volvo the worlds second largest truck maker spent billion swedish kronor &# billion on research and development last year up from in the first three months of this year it spent billion kronor more than in the same period last year in addition to the volvo brand the company makes renault and mack branded trucks "in many cities the air coming out of euro and euro engines is cleaner than the air coming into them " volvo chief executive leif johansson said last month to meet the new standards daimlerchrysler and volvo are developing engine systems that use urea based chemicals in a separate storage tank to reduce harmful exhaust gases proponents of this system known as selective catalytic reduction say it is widely available in europe but adds weight to the truck and adds to the cost of filling the tank midsize european manufacturers such as swedens scania ab and man ag of germany back an alternative called exhaust gas recirculation although they also make trucks using scr their egr system reduces emissions by lowering the combustion temperature using recycled exhaust gas daimlerchrysler and volvo make gas recirculation engines for north america because theres no distribution network there for the fuel additives used in the scr system "more than of spending on engine development has been to try to meet emission standards " scania spokesman hans ake danielsson said "the technical challenge is significant "
