politics &amp economics bush seeks to stave off more defections over iraq washington president bush dug in his heels over his iraq policy but amid a veto threat and advisers coming to the capitol to meet with senate republicans the white house signaled continued nervousness about shaky support in its party defending the increased troop levels he began ordering in late winter mr bush told a cleveland audience that his "surge" strategy had only just started and "in washington you got people saying stop " congress should withhold judgment until iraq commander gen david petreaus has delivered his promised progress report in september the president said his advisers vowed he would veto any legislation before then demanding a drawdown of u s forces the tough rhetoric came as the senate faces its first test today of republican demands that all war related amendments command a vote supermajority before being added to a pending defense bill the high threshold is part of a strategy to prevent defections and buy time to prepare for what will be a major fight in september but this mornings vote on the first amendment is a difficult one for republicans since it addresses readiness concerns and the time troops must get at home between deployments to iraq for the white house the iraq debate now is complicated by the fact that the administration itself is torn over the substance and politics of any future iraq withdrawal officials are divided over the timing and size of the drawdown and over how far mr bush should go in explicitly promising one to maintain republican support defense secretary robert gates has sought to build bipartisan political support for a long term u s presence in iraq by moving toward withdrawing significant numbers of troops by the end of mr bushs term the emerging plan championed by mr gates and his allies would shift the u s mission in iraq from ending iraqs civil war to a more modest attempt to contain it the administration is also slated to release a politically damaging report acknowledging that the fractured iraqi government of prime minister nouri al maliki has failed to meet the key benchmarks like passing a new oil law congressional leaders are expected to be briefed by the iraq command via a video conference tomorrow and there appears to be a shift in the white house political rationale for the surge the administration had argued that the added troops would help quell sectarian violence and expedite political reconciliation now the focus echoed by republicans is more on crushing al qaeda elements and containing iranian backed efforts to disrupt iraq "from the political side they are going backwards not forward " said sen lindsey graham r s c "my goal is to focus on the surge as the best vehicle to destroy al qaeda and contain iran " even those senate democrats demanding a withdrawal of u s combat forces by may concede that some residual force will be needed including antiterrorism missions against al qaeda but sen jack reed d r i a west point graduate said any troop number "we pick out is somewhat arbitrary" and it is better to first agree on what the u s mission will be house democrats announced they will also force a vote on withdrawal from iraq this week apparently timed to the progress report but the greater test is the senate where democrats have little chance of getting to votes needed to break a filibuster and their best hope is to get at least within striking distance perhaps or votes then the margin would be small enough that concessions can be negotiated to win additional support in september when senate foreign relations committee chairman joseph biden d del predicted there was a better chance of reaching "critical mass " meanwhile the safe harbor for war weary republicans is a less stringent amendment endorsing the recommendations of the iraq study group last winter and holding out the promise that a drawdown could begin in the spring introduced last night the measure has more than a dozen democratic and republican co sponsors and even senate republican leader mitch mcconnell r ky facing re election next year hasnt ruled out backing it "hes reviewing it " said a spokesman
