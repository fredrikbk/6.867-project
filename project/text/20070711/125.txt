the mossberg solution saving a favorite web video updated realplayer copies organizes clips using a pc thanks to faster computers and higher bandwidths many web sites now contain video of one kind or another slow stuttering footage is a thing of the past and video sharing web sites are hot commodities demonstrated last year when google bought youtube for &# billion you can browse the web watching videos until your eyes glaze over but you cant easily save any of that video footage to your computer in an organized library so while your photos music and email can be neatly categorized and revisited on your computers hard drive videos that you see online may never come your way again this week i tested the newest version of realnetworks inc s realplayer which offers a distinctly useful feature the ability to copy any video from the internet onto your pc as long as it isnt protected by a copyright this player which was just released in its beta or testing version last month is available as a free download from www realplayer com once downloaded realplayer smartly runs on microsofts windows xp or vista machines in the background only making its video copying capability known when a video appears on a web page in your browser a tiny message labeled "download this video" pops up from the video viewing screen and when selected this initiates a download of the entire video you dont need to be at the start of the video to copy the whole clip in fact you can copy an entire video without watching it i used realplayer to copy videos for watching later when i didnt have a column to write saved videos can be shared with friends organized into playlists or burned onto cds i tried realplayer on my windows xp desktop and on my vista laptop using both internet explorer and mozillas firefox without problems being able to copy videos made me realize how many clips i watch online footage that might otherwise have been forgotten had i not saved it on my computer granted not all the videos that one watches online are worth capturing but its nice to have the ability to save them with just a mouse click i missed being able to use realplayer s video downloading on my apple computers but realnetworks says it will make its player usable on macs before the end of the year the company also says it is working on plans to make these saved videos transferable to portable players including apples ipod so that after downloading numerous videos you need not be tied to your computer to watch them in the case of longer videos downloading took more time and i wished this realplayer made it possible to watch videos shortly after they started downloading like apple does with movies downloaded from its itunes store downloading this new realplayer was surprisingly painless a welcome change compared with my experiences downloading the companys previous players in three quick steps i downloaded realplayer accepted a license agreement and adjusted a few settings such as whether or not i wanted to use realplayer by default for playing all videos on my pc i was never prompted to enter my date of birth or email like realnetworks downloads in the past i visited various sites to retrieve video footage including youtube aol videos google videos sports web sites television network sites and news sites like wsj com and allthingsd com every popular video file format is supported to save time realplayer lets you download multiple videos at the same time a small window shows the status of each download including how much time remains for each download and an option to cancel the download there are no limits to the number of videos you can download simultaneously as long as your internet bandwidth can manage i copied numerous videos including the first episode of my new favorite tv show abcs "traveler " a music video from country singer keith urban and a national geographic video on bowhead whales after gathering a bunch of clips i organized some of them into playlists and sent others to friends by selecting "share video link" from the top of the screen entering emails and a personal message about each clip these emails are sent with embedded links to other sites like youtube and the recipient doesnt need realplayer to see the videos though a link for this free download appears at the bottom of the emails if a video is copyright protected the "download this video" message that enables copying is replaced by a message that says "video cannot be downloaded" with a one line explainer on digital rights to the chagrin of content owners this isnt as much of an impediment as they hoped because a large amount of video content is illegally posted online even if a video was originally posted in a protected format someone may have copied it and re posted it illegally with the protection stripped off realplayer will copy these clips as it cant tell whether they were originally meant to be protected in a couple instances videos didnt display messages about downloading or not downloading in which case i wasnt able to copy the video realnetworks says this is a rare occurrence realplayer can also be used to record live streaming video in real time like the constantly recording panda camera that was set up to document every move made by tai shan the giant panda born in washingtons national zoo two years ago i tested live recording by capturing a live stream of video from cnn com for minutes but realplayer cant be set to record certain programs or at certain times like tivo does with television though i focused on its video copying capability realplayer is still a media player in its own right it is divided into six categories at the top of the screen now playing my library real guide games superpass and burn transfer if you pay an extra &# for realplayer youll be able to burn your videos onto dvds rather than just cds real guide serves as a link to realnetworks suggestions of videos and also lets you search for more videos if you visit the my library section while a video is playing a miniature view of that video appears in the lower right corner of the screen many sites offer to help you email videos or obtain a videos url for embedding into your own web site but these options often appear only after youve watched an entire video and they dont help you save videos onto your pc realplayer strikes a healthy balance its useful without intruding on your browser if you stopped downloading videos from the web to your pc you wouldnt be bothered by its subtle downloading prompts realnetworks will release a second version of this beta before the end of the year including options for transferring videos to portable players and mac compatibility for now the free download of this first version is smart simple and fun to use edited by walter s mossberg email mossbergsolution wsj com corrections &amp amplifications any video can be copied as long as it isnt protected by digital rights
