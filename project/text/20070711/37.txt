china trade surplus reached record at &# billion in june hong kong chinas export juggernaut reached new milestones in june government figures issued yesterday showed with the nation exporting more than &# billion of goods in a single month and marking another record monthly trade surplus merchandise exports for the month at &# billion were higher than a year earlier while imports of goods increased to &# billion chinas customs agency said that left a trade surplus for june of &# billion beating the previous monthly record of &# billion set in october the figures showed no reduction in foreign demand for chinas products despite its manufacturers facing higher costs and greater consumer concerns about quality after a spate of recalls of tainted products from pet food to toys and toothpaste chinas accumulated trade surplus for the first half of the year at &# billion is now running above last years level although export growth rates could ease in the second half total order volumes are typically larger then because of the christmas shopping season as a result many economists are penciling in an annual trade surplus of some &# billion to &# billion for compared with the record &# billion recorded in the surplus has brought immense political and economic pressure to bear on china much of it focused on the nations exchange rate controls which some critics allege are designed to keep chinas currency cheap in order to give exporters a price advantage there is little reason to expect that the latest figures will result in china yielding to u s lawmakers demands for the yuan to rise sharply against the dollar "the pressure has been building for a long time but that hasnt changed chinese policy makers basic stance of allowing a gradual to annualized pace of appreciation " said daniel hui a foreign exchange strategist with hsbc the yuan has risen about against the dollar so far in with most of that gain coming in the past few months the stronger currency which tends to make chinese goods more expensive abroad could start to slow export gains later in the year chinas government also recently changed tax policies to impose higher burdens on producers of goods not favored by policy makers that led many exporters to rush orders into the early part of the year before the changes took effect a practice that could mean slower growth ahead still even slower export growth may not lead to much of a decline in the surplus if chinas demand for imports doesnt pick up import growth has slowed so far this year from the pace set in because china imports mainly raw materials and capital equipment as well as parts for exported goods the slowdown may reflect weaker spending on big projects such as factories and highways
