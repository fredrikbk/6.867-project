common sense gauging buffetts success by how much dinner costs smartmoney there are many measures of warren buffetts success not the least of which is his status as the worlds second richest man after bill gates according to forbes theres also the legendary performance of his berkshire hathaway stock the class a shares trade near a heady &# but recent news that an irvine calif money manager mohnish pabrai bid &# for the opportunity to have dinner with mr buffett struck me as a good one an auction is after all the free market in its purest form i wonder who else might fetch such a fee at auction queen elizabeth ii actress helen mirren turned down dinner at buckingham palace and it was free brad pitt and angelina jolie why bother when every detail about them is chronicled breathlessly the reason i believe mr buffett might even top mr gates in the dinner sweepstakes isnt his legendary down home charm but his proven ability to make people rich mr pabrai the winning bidder is a self proclaimed disciple of the buffett method and surely he sees his meal as more than a celebrity sit down its an investment whether it would meet mr buffetts own value criteria is another matter in any event mr buffett has given away more free advice than just about any billionaire i can think of he reports his stockholdings and discusses their merits and the reasons for his choices in his popular annual letter to shareholders more fundamentally he has laid out his investment philosophy repeatedly for all to see anyone can piggyback his actual stock selections or apply his criteria to come up with other investments as ive done periodically in this column earlier this year mr buffett was tantalizingly cryptic he revealed he had more than &# million invested in each of two stocks but wouldnt reveal their names since he was still buying them he has now done so in sec filings and it turns out he was buying more than two stocks the others constituting smaller positions the big two were apparently burlington northern santa fe which i discussed in an earlier column and union pacific another large railroad concern he also acquired a smaller position in norfolk southern all told its a significant sector bet on railroads his other theme was health care another sector ive recommended he added to his already substantial position in johnson &amp johnson and bought additional shares in sanofi aventis the large french pharmaceutical company he added managed care provider wellpoint to his portfolio all fit the buffett value profile of strong brands and steady revenue growth the health care sector has been out of favor with the nascent presidential campaign fueling investor worries about increased government regulation but the sheer demographics of the aging baby boom make the sector compelling in my view mr buffett didnt say anything about what he was selling but his sec disclosures indicate he dumped shares of ameriprise financial and h&amp r block neither was mentioned in his list of holdings that accompanied his annual letter so i assume they fell into the "others" category amounting to more than &# billion obviously mr buffett doesnt tell us everything both companies have undergone significant restructurings with h&amp r block spinning off its troubled subprime loan business and ameriprise itself a spinoff from american express which has long figured in berkshire hathaways portfolio still ameriprise has been doing quite well recently trading near a week high despite mr buffetts phased withdrawal meanwhile my own effort to apply the buffett philosophy has paid off handsomely so far the two stocks i recommended as mr buffetts targets in mid march deere and caterpillar have since jumped by and respectively mr buffetts burlington northern is up over the same period not bad in little more than three months despite this impressive performance i havent been summoned to omaha for an interview to be berkshire hathaways next chief investment officer a job opening that mr buffett hasnt yet filled so far as i know nor have i been invited to dinner like mr pabrai thats a privilege ill evidently have to pay for james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
