the afternoon report the privilege drama online edition the separation of powers bout between congress and the president moved to its next round today as the white houses former political director refused to answer many questions about the federal prosecutors firings controversy sara taylor said in a prepared statement released ahead of a senate judiciary committee hearing that short of a court order compelling her testimony shed abide by president bushs decision to assert executive privilege and prevent her from discussing the firings of federal prosecutors with congress she said that in light of the presidents move "i will answer faithfully those questions that are appropriate for a private citizen to answer while also doing my best to respect the presidents directive that his staffs communications be privileged " she also said that while she might not be able to answer all of the lawmakers questions today she would answer them "if the courts rule that this committees need for the information outweighs the presidents assertion of executive privilege " fred fielding the white house counsel informed congress this week that mr bush would fight the subpoenas which sought the testimony of ms taylor as well as former white house counsel harriet miers ms miers is scheduled to speak to a house panel investigating the firings tomorrow she said through her lawyer that she cant provide "the documents and testimony that the committee seeks " both ms taylor and ms miers could face contempt of congress charges democrats were quick to lament the claim of privilege criticizing it as an effort by the administration to skirt a legitimate call for accountability "it is apparent that this white house is contemptuous of the congress and feels that it does not have to explain itself to anybody " sen patrick leahy the vermont democrat and chairman of the panel said as the hearing started "i urge ms taylor not to follow that contemptuous position and not to follow the white house down this path " lawmakers said that they believed there were questions that didnt come under the domain of mr bushs claim of privilege and ms taylor did provide a few details testifying that she didnt recall ordering that the names of certain attorneys be added to or eliminated from a list of prosecutors to be terminated she also disputed testimony from kyle sampson the former chief of staff to attorney general alberto gonzales that she wanted to avoid submitting one new prosecutor in particular tim griffin for senate consideration "i expected him to go through senate confirmation " ms taylor said but there were many other questions on which ms taylor kept silent including a query about whether the president had been involved in deciding which of the federal prosecutors should be fired democratic lawmakers angered by her refusal to supply answers argued that the presidents executive privilege claim didnt cover ms taylor who recently left the white house and is now a private citizen sen chuck schumer said at the hearing that "this broad claim of privilege doesnt stand up " but sorting out the issue could drag on for years the white house claims that complying with the subpoenas would harm the presidents capacity to receive unvarnished counsel congress counters that the move is a violation of the separation of powers the hard stances on both sides of the argument make it more likely that the scrum will eventually wind up in the federal court and leading to a potentially glacial process that may stretch out to long after mr bush had left office stocks bounce

department official told a congressional panel that he doesnt support proposed changes to the tax treatment of private equity firms and hedge funds treasury assistant secretary for tax policy eric solomon said that the current system of allowing such institutions to pay relatively slight tax rates on carried interest is good for business and good for the economy congress began to make noises about raising the tax burden on private equity ahead of last months initial public offering by private equity giant blackstone group mr solomon posited that "while it is important to review our tax laws and policies we must be cautious about making significant changes to partnership tax rules that we worked successfully to promote and support entrepreneurship for many decades " some lawmakers and critics of the industry argue that private equity should pay a tax rate closer to the regular income tax rate which can be as high as and not at the capital gains tax rate of meanwhile the securities and exchange commission voted unanimously to adopt a new anti fraud rule aimed at money managers including hedge funds who mislead or defraud investors the move was prompted by an appellate court ruling last year that tossed out an earlier rule tightening oversight of hedge fund managers the court ruled that a fund managers client is the fund itself not its investors regulators had feared that the ruling might hamper their ability to protect those defrauded by hedge fund managers chairman christopher cox called the new rule an "important tool to help police this market "

two mammoth diversified mining companies bhp billiton and rio tinto could surface with a competing buyout offer alcan cautioned that there remains no assurance another offer will materialize however

fiscal year ends sept the downward revision wasnt much of a surprise monthly data have showed a robust inflow of tax receipts for months further official deficit outlooks are frequently revised
