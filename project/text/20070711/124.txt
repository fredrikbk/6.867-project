business day sign up for the e mail here anticipated federal communications commission guidelines for a coming auction of airwaves appear to be a setback for the nations big telecom companies a potential boon for internet firms such as google and a step forward for consumer choice the guidelines are at the center of a lobbying battle in washington because they could help determine the fate of a multibillion dollar chunk of spectrum being abandoned by tv stations in their conversion to digital signals as the los angeles times reports federal officials hope the airwaves to be auctioned by january will carry another nationwide high speed internet service to compete with those offered by phone and cable companies the times says noting that google teamed with companies like yahoo intel directv and echostar communications to push for access to the new wireless airwaves the draft rules proposed by fcc chairman kevin martin would earmark about a third of the tv spectrum on the block for bidders willing to let consumers hook up any wireless device to the network the times reports "such a rule threatens to challenge the hegemony of incumbent providers" of broadband such as at&amp t and verizon and cable companies like comcast and time warner the associated press writes noting that verizon in particular has "fiercely resisted the notion that having invested in the construction of a broadband network it would have to cede control over the types of devices or applications that are used on it " the draft rules which must now be debated ahead of an agency vote in coming weeks "could hand google and other technology companies their first significant victory in a battle to loosen the grip held by telecom operators on the wireless and broadband markets " the wall street journal writes while telecom providers like verizon wouldnt be barred from bidding for the spectrum at issue "the strings attached to it will likely make it much less palatable to them " the journal says google or a satellite tv provider might now enter the market the paper says and notes that ebays skype has also backed the new rules as google may not want to spend the billions needed to build and operate a new wireless network the company has considered buying spectrum and outsourcing the network to a third party though even a direct bid for spectrum may be ruled out as too far removed from the internet companys core activities people familiar with the situation tell the journal the fccs mr martin told usa today that he hoped the proposed guidelines would lead to more innovative consumer services such as those already seen in europe and elsewhere outside the u s the paper writes that some domestic wireless carriers pressure handset manufacturers to strip out features that could let users sidestep their fee based services and applications and because the devices are tethered to a single carrier customers who switch to a new wireless provider have to throw their old phones away paying the piper in gold "the dollar is a basket case " says peter schiff president of euro pacific capital the associated press reports as the euro continued to stalk fresh record highs
