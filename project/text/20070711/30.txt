claiborne seeks to shed apparel brands liz claiborne inc is cleaning out its closet the long acquisitive american sportswear maker suffering from a downturn in department store sales is expected to announce today that its seeking to divest itself of of its apparel brands representing &# million of its &# billion in annual revenue according to people close to the company the move seven months after chief executive william mccomb joined the company from johnson &amp johnson marks a bold reversal of the strategy that claiborne and most of its competitors in the u s apparel industry vigorously pursued for more than a decade build big brand portfolios to hedge against unpredictable fashion cycles although that strategy successfully boosted claibornes revenue it had some unforeseen consequences with each brand overseen by executives in up to five different divisions "we had turned from a brand centric merchandising culture to a culture of complexity management " says mr mccomb who was known at j&amp j for winning back market share for tylenol pain reliever according to people familiar with the companys plan the brands that claiborne will try to sell or license out or possibly discontinue are sigrid olsen prana ellen tracy dana buchman mac &amp jac kensie intuitions c&amp c california enyce laundry tint stamp first issue emma james tapemeasure and j h collectibles the company has hired centerview partners a boutique investment bank to sell or license the brands to strategic or financial buyers depending on the outcome of that process the results of which should be revealed by next years second quarter claiborne could decide to keep some of the brands liz claibornes downsizing underscores the pressure the u s apparel industry faces to reinvent itself in the wake of retail consolidation and changing consumer tastes for years claiborne and competitors such as jones apparel group inc and kellwood co could rely on huge orders from department stores to make up the bulk of their sales but traditional department stores have been closing as chains have consolidated leaving mainstream brands with far fewer customers that has led them to open branded boutiques a business that requires more capital investment than simply selling goods to department stores jones faced with a similar problem is considering what its chief executive calls "exit strategies" from some moderate apparel brands while selling its top performing barneys new york luxury store chain to focus on its core apparel and footwear business in january vf corp sold its lingerie business to berkshire hathaway inc s fruit of the loom so it could devote more resources to faster growing lifestyle brands like north face and nautica even specialty retailers are feeling the pinch limited brands inc said this week that it is selling a stake in its namesake retail chain to a private equity firm to focus on its faster growing victorias secret and bath &amp body works chains the shift is being driven partly by shoppers who no longer want to wear matching ensembles from widely distributed labels and instead are seeking a more individualized look the emergence of fast paced specialty retailers like spains zara owned by inditex sa and swedens h&amp m owned by hennes &amp mauritz ab which can turn out new styles in a matter of weeks has also made it harder for companies like claiborne to compete in slashing claibornes portfolio the year old mr mccomb is betting that he can give up some revenue in the short term to devote more resources to a smaller number of brands including the lucky brand denim label that he likes wearing to the office but the scale and scope of the potential divestitures which mr mccomb is scheduled to announce at an investor conference in manhattan today will likely come as a surprise to analysts who had been expecting a few cuts mostly of brands sold in department stores the brands on claibornes hit list arent necessarily its slowest growing "it was a matter of which ones we could bite off and grow within the time frame that the street would need us to perform " mr mccomb said claiborne plans to double its spending on advertising for its kate spade lucky brand and juicy couture labels to to of annual sales in line with competitors like coach inc to further reduce its dependence on department stores and better track customers buying patterns the company plans to open more of its own stores by and improve its e commerce operations claiborne is also developing ways to shorten the time between orders and deliveries and respond more quickly to consumer demand for particular styles at the same time claiborne plans to trim &# million in annual expenses over the next three years people close to the company say as part of the cost savings plan claiborne will cut of its nonretail work force or about to positions these people say mr mccomb says investors can expect to see improvements in the companys results in mr mccomb has already taken steps to create a new management structure last month he eliminated a layer of senior "group presidents " hired a new chief financial officer with expertise in divestitures and split the company into two divisions retail called "direct brands " and wholesale called "partnered brands " the new structure mr mccomb said is intended to bring "focus energy and clarity" to the company executives say the companys previous organization had resulted in some missed opportunities when the first juicy couture fragrance was launched at bloomingdales last christmas for example it wasnt advertised in claibornes own juicy couture boutiques and the stores didnt have enough fragrance gift sets to meet demand by consolidating management of brands like juicy under one division "we can invest more wisely and maximize returns on inventory " says jill granoff now executive vice president of claibornes direct brands unit juicy couture co founder gela taylor who is still involved in running the business says she expects to have more control over the image of the brand across product categories today mr mccomb is expected to announce another key executive appointment naming dave mctague president of nike inc s converse apparel unit executive vice president of the wholesale division trudy sullivan the companys former president was to have run that unit but she left the company yesterday to become chief executive of talbots inc the company is in final negotiations with a retail executive to fill the chief executive role at the kate spade brand a person close to the company said ms spade and her husband andy are expected to leave when their contract with claiborne expires this month but may take on a consulting role with the planned divestitures mr mccomb is staking his reputation on undoing much of the strategy put in place by his predecessor paul charron under mr charron who is credited with turning the company into a model for the u s apparel industry liz claiborne acquired more than a dozen new labels by buying emerging brands and plugging them into claibornes vast supply chain the former vf executive hoped to help them grow without interfering in the creative process during mr charrons tenure as claibornes ceo which began in and ended late last year the companys revenue ballooned to &# billion from &# billion but the growth wasnt accompanied by increased efficiency operating margins have eroded recently from in to last year when net income declined for the first time in six years in this years first quarter the company reported a decline in net income marking a rough beginning for mr mccomb founded in by designer liz claiborne who died last month her husband and two business associates with an initial investment of &# the company made sportswear that struck a chord among women who at the time were entering the work force in droves by when the company went public sales had grown to &# million from &# million five years earlier the company didnt start advertising until when sales began to slow amid fashion stumbles and competition from other brands and specialty retailers like gap and ann taylor "what happened " asked then ceo jerome chazen in a gloomy letter in the companys annual report "very simply our consumers and markets changed faster than we did " mr mccomb now faces a landscape that is shifting again department stores are cutting orders and pushing their own store brands at the expense of traditional labels like the companys namesake liz claiborne brand last year of sales at macys inc came from private label brands compared with in faced with competition from moderate chains like j c penney co and kohls corp macys is also pushing itself up market and away from traditional brands like liz claiborne although claiborne embarked on an ambitious rebranding initiative last year adding a new creative director a new ad campaign and new styling sales have been slower than expected claiborne is now bracing for the possibility that its namesake label could be phased out of department stores "it is not something we want to see happen but it is something we have to prepare for " mr mccomb says last year the company inked an exclusive deal with penney to produce clothing and accessories under a new liz &amp co label although the brand is only in its first season executives say its apparel sales are exceeding expectations mr mccomb declined to reveal sales projections but said that sales of liz &amp co s womens apparel are expected to hit second year targets in the brands first year sidewalk sale some of the brands that claiborne will try to sell license or possibly discontinue include c&amp c california dana buchman ellen tracy emma james enyce j h
