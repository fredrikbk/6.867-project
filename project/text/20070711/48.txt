feds focus on core inflation raises concerns washington as food and energy prices climb across the nation the federal reserve is facing growing criticism for focusing on "core" inflation which excludes both those items as the basis for its interest rate decisions many consumers question whether fed officials eat or drive and some economists worry that the fed is underestimating inflation risks even some fed officials share these concerns the debate has intensified in the past month after new data showed core inflation measured by the feds preferred gauge the core index of personal consumption expenditures dropped to in may below the ceiling of some fed officials comfort zone but including food and energy inflation was still in the near term fed officials are unlikely to switch from their focus on core inflation in their strategy or communications but they say they may need to explain better that they do consider themselves responsible for overall inflation in the long run and use core inflation only as an intermediate yardstick of their success indeed post meeting statements dont make the distinction when discussing future risks fed chairman ben bernanke may address the issue when he appears before congress next week and if officials ever agree to set an explicit inflation target it may be the headline not the core rate mr bernanke touched on the subject yesterday in a speech at a conference of academic economists in cambridge mass "increases in energy prices affect overall inflation in the short run because energy products such as gasoline are part of the consumers basket and because energy costs loom large in the production of some goods and services " he said "however a one off change in energy prices can translate into persistent inflation only if it leads to higher expected inflation and a consequent wage price spiral " the speech seemed to imply mr bernanke doesnt see that risk at present "notably the sharp increases in energy prices over the past few years have not led either to persistent inflation or to a recession in contrast for example to the u s experience of the s " inflation expectations he said have become much better anchored that is they are pushed around less by swings in energy prices since the s but arent "perfectly anchored " the fed believes that because it has little influence over short run energy prices shifting monetary policy when those prices push headline inflation up or down could be harmful for example raising rates when gasoline prices rise during the summer driving season then reversing course in the fall the feds interest rate decisions are designed to influence the overall economy over a horizon of one or two years "the fed is pretty powerless to do something about the price of energy or the price of food " said alan blinder a princeton university economist and former fed vice chairman "i dont want to charge the fed with responsibility for something it cant do " if the fed thought energy prices were going to rise continuously it might incorporate that into its inflation forecast and policy decisions mr blinder said but in practice it doesnt second guess the futures market which at present foresees flat energy prices over the next months critics note the futures market has been repeatedly wrong and energy prices have risen steadily since more recently food prices have also risen as a result headline inflation since has been persistently higher than core inflation at versus as measured by the feds preferred gauge the price index of personal consumption expenditures that has also led to a divide between the public and the fed on the perceived threat of inflation "our monthly maintenance on our co op apartment has risen faster than the rate of inflation due to the rise in fuel costs and our monthly grocery bills have risen even faster " said frederic wile a retiree in new york city "i cannot figure out how or why the fed excludes these two most basic items from their inflation calculations " when oil price spikes were temporary overall inflation rapidly returned to the underlying core trend but unlike previous spikes in oil and food prices the latest ones are driven by rising global demand not interruptions of supply as a result unlike in the past said paul ashworth senior u s economist at capital economics "it could be more likely that the gap would be closed by core inflation moving toward headline inflation "
