the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources rock climbing confronting limitations after pioneers death the death last year of todd skinner one of rock climbings greatest showmen has forced the climbing world to face up to limits that mr skinner made a career of denying in october mr skinners harness broke while he was climbing in yosemite national park shocking a sport that presupposes that harnesses never break some climbers routinely mock the opening scene of the sylvester stallone movie "cliffhanger " in which that happens mr skinner one of the first climbers to grow rich off the sport became an even more controversial figure in the climbing world after his death reports john colapinto in mens journal in the s mr skinner and his longtime climbing partner paul piana created a stir by combining the styles of the fragmented climbing world they claimed to be the first to achieve many of their ascents by "free climbing" using equipment like ropes and bolts to protect against a fall but not to help advance up the slope while mr skinners athleticism and the scale of his achievements were never in dispute he and mr piana broke some of free climbings unspoken rules if they fell from the cliff face they would recover while dangling from the end of the rope and repeat the section instead of returning to the bottom and attempting the entire cliff again as he became the charismatic face of rock climbing in ads television shows and corporate speaking tours mr skinner drew criticism for a willingness to "airbrush the realities of rock climbing " says mr colapinto he once told a documentary crew not to film his team placing bolts in the rock for protection mr colapinto says friends and colleagues have a hard time accepting that at age mr skinner was getting too old to continue at his incredible pace and erred in using what fellow climbers said was a seriously worn harness because of the unusual nature of the accident yosemite is having the harness tested in switzerland to see if some corrosive chemical had made it especially weak whatever the results mr skinners accident serves as a reminder that "all climbing gear has a finite life no matter how strong it originally was " writes mr colapinto mens journal august judiciary why oconnor pragmatism may have retired with her does the rapid dismantling of sandra day oconnors imprint on the supreme court represent the inevitable fate of any swing voter on the court or was there something in particular about ms oconnors jurisprudence that made her legacy so ephemeral as a swing voter ms oconnor held a position of enormous influence during her tenure on the court in the months since ms oconnors retirement however the court has stepped over her theoretical framework on a number of key issues including affirmative action and campaign finance says dahlia lithwick a senior editor at slate and notably in an april decision on late term abortion the court redefined ms oconnors "undue burden" standard to make it much easier for states to impose limits on the procedure in her critics view the erosion of ms oconnors influence stems from an approach that sometimes lacked constitutional rigor but what has played a bigger role is that there are no true swing voters left on the court to sustain her legacy ms oconnor took over the role played by justice lewis powell in the s and s as "the quintessential common law judge " unlike justices powell or oconnor justice anthony kennedy the new deciding vote in the court often seems to relish his pivotal role for its own sake ms lithwick says whats more mr kennedys influence enormous as it is today might be just as fleeting over time as that of ms oconnor "in this new era of sweeping political agendas and dramatic wrenching shifts in the law there may just be no time or space anymore for small humble acts of pragmatism " ms lithwick says slate july language think spelling is confusing fixing it

system advocated by her group she writes "if u hav a por memmory yor chances of becumming a good speller ar lo but wors stil yor chances of lerning to read ar not good either because of phonnic nonsens like cow crow dream dreamt " she attributes the high literacy scores among swedish children to swedens modern spelling reforms prof vivian cook who teaches at newcastle university says the
