reed hundts spectrum play the federal communications commission has been ordered by congress to auction off a large swath of valuable telecom spectrum licenses by the end of january the only question is whether the auction will be open and fair or tainted by rules that favor some potential bidders over others it looks as if fcc chairman kevin martin has opted for the latter the agency hasnt formally released the rules but yesterday usa today quoted mr martin as saying that "whoever wins this spectrum has to provide a truly open broadband network one that will open the door to a lot of innovative services for customers " in other words mr martin wants to saddle the winning bidder with "net neutrality" mandates mr martin didnt offer any proof that this "door" is currently closed that competition in wireless broadband is lacking or that consumers are deprived of the latest gadgets and services and no wonder the fccs most recent report on wireless competition concludes that "with respect to carrier conduct the record indicates that competitive pressure continues to drive carriers to introduce innovative pricing plans and service offerings and to match the pricing and service innovations introduced by rival carriers " this should be an easy call especially for an fcc headed by a man who claims to understand economic competition auctions are the most efficient way to get spectrum to market and rigging them to play favorites defeats their purpose but chairman martin is under political pressure to jerry rig the process an upstart telecom firm called frontline wireless which is headed by former fcc chairman reed hundt and backed by google wants the agency to place conditions on the sale mr hundt wants the spectrum winner to be obligated to operate as a wholesale only carrier and make its network available to rivals at regulated rates the frontline proposal also attaches net neutrality strings to the licenses that would ban a network operator like verizon from charging a content provider like google extra fees for premium service such requirements are poison pills intended to scare away bidders and lower the price of the spectrum if at&amp t t mobile and other carriers cant earn a competitive return on their investment theyre less likely to bid but a rigged auction that steers spectrum away from those best prepared to use it immediately also bodes ill for consumers it means higher prices and slower deployment of next generation services that make workers more productive and the u s more competitive frontline says it will use the spectrum to build a nationwide wireless broadband network to compete with the likes of at&amp t and verizon thats fine if it is able to compete for spectrum on the same terms as everybody else however jeffrey eisenach of criterion economics estimates conservatively that this undertaking will cost more than &# billion over years and he doubts mr hundts business plan can deliver on its promises mr eisenach also notes that the "fccs history of recovering spectrum from private licensees who fail to meet build out requirement is discouraging " thats a reference to nextwave the telecom firm that won spectrum licenses in a fcc auction that extended financial credits to "small business participants " nextwave promptly defaulted on billions of dollars in loan payments but managed to keep the spectrum out of use for nearly a decade before eventually selling the licenses to verizon that debacle was the handiwork of a certain reed hundt who headed the fcc under bill clinton and set the rules of the nextwave auction we hope history doesnt repeat itself as political farce if mr hundts proposal prevails and frontline wireless is the top bidder dont be surprised if it moves to free itself of the license restrictions and then sell the spectrum to a major carrier for a huge profit in an attempt to win over mr martin however mr hundt is disguising this spectrum grab as a public safety play he says frontlines network will be a public private partnership that provides wireless broadband service to police and fire departments but congress has already allocated spectrum for emergency services along with &# billion in grants for public safety officials to build a system thats interoperable first responders dont need mr hundts plan mr hundt knows how to work the beltway and he has powerful political friends who apparently now include mr martin but we hope someone in the bush administration tells mr martin that the fccs obligation isnt to carve out spectrum for special interests but to serve the larger public by selling spectrum to the highest bidder
