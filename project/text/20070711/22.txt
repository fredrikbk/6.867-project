business world bloomberg vs the car give mike bloomberg points for political generalship in selling new yorkers on his plan for traffic "congestion pricing " for one thing he called it "congestion pricing " the very words are guaranteed to elicit applause from economists albeit as a way to reduce congestion listen with half an ear to the mayor and his acolytes however and their goal isnt easing congestion at all its raising money the citys plan foresees only negligible improvement in traffic density and speeds less than but millions for the city to spend on other priorities with more shrewdness mr bloomberg presented his proposal just weeks before a deadline was supposed to expire on &# million in federal grants lets be serious with hillary and chuck schumer and new yorks sprawling congressional delegation not to mention a federal highway agency thats a hotbed of congestion pricing fans new york will have no trouble getting its money the artificial deadline serves only to discourage the asking of too many questions the same goes for the mayors constant invocation of a dubious scientific link between traffic pollution and childhood asthma his supporters are now circulating flyers in new york on this theme most of all mr bloomberg has made the running with those two words "congestion pricing " he doesnt call his scheme a "comprehensive vehicle surveillance" plan or "motorist vilification and taxation" plan apt but less saleable descriptions if the goal were really to reduce traffic the city would find it easier and cheaper to introduce tolls on the east river bridges whose absence now subsidizes much inefficient traffic flow but something much bigger is afoot and voters not just in new york should be paying attention mr bloomberg is inspired by londons use of camera ruled congestion pricing in its downtown area the brits now have cameras on their roadways making theirs the most monitored society on earth these systems proved very handy indeed in tracking last weeks attempted airport bombers thats the good news the bad news arises from the relentless fiscal imperative to expand the systems revenues accompanied by rhetoric to soften up motorists as political targets in britains traffic cameras sent out million speeding tickets in the mail nearly half for violations of less than mph above the posted speed limit tens of thousands more tickets were sent to drivers who had been photographed talking on cell phones or committing other minor offenses more than one million of britains million drivers are now one ticket away from losing their licenses advocates tout safety and teaching respect for the law but the evidence suggests government is simply behaving like government going for the easy money one third of those ticketed by mail fail to respond and yet police dont track them down why bother when easy pickings are available from the majority of motorists who nervously write a check the instant a ticket arrives meanwhile their quotas met local authorities have been cutting the number of police patrolling the roads and able to intervene in truly dangerous situations where cameras are no help such as with drunk and reckless drivers the bbc accurately identified the political dynamic at work here when it recently polled its audience "is motoring the new smoking " london mayor ken livingstone when hes not penning op eds in support of mr bloomberg is now busy working on plans to hit suvs with higher "congestion fees" as punishment for global warming under the bloomberg plan car owners would be billed or fined based on hundreds of cameras to photograph license plates and feed the data to a central computer to decipher the plate number the software will have to be complex and capable assuming it works in order to meet mr bloombergs promise to charge higher fees for trucks &# than personal vehicles &# and to waive fees for residents simply moving their cars from one parking space to another the system will also likely have face recognition capability if not right way eventually and will record each vehicle from many angles and not just zoom in on the plates to discourage drivers from challenging their fines in court mr bloomberg nonetheless promises to "protect" drivers privacy whatever that means and scoffs at civil liberties worrywarts saying new yorkers long ago surrendered their anonymity in public but these are decoy statements the issue isnt cameras but networks of cameras combined with software to extract information from the pictures and match it with information held in databases on top of it all the issue is an overpowering political incentive to use the system to extract more and more money from motorists many of them out of state voters few would question as a matter of economics the usefulness of road pricing to ration scarce capacity patrick decorla souza and his team at the federal highway administration have done yeomans work promoting such thinking they prefer the term "value pricing" but far above the pay grade of these professional enthusiasts is whether americans should accept the electronic surveillance these schemes always seem to necessitate americans may decide they want or must accept a future in which everything they do in their cars including emitting pollutants is subject to continuous monitoring and regulation with little or no recourse against the digital witnesses to their alleged offenses but they should not go slumming into this future with their eyes closed or with only the advice of economists singing the praises of congestion pricing ringing in their ears
