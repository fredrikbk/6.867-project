politics &amp economics france gets its grip on imf eu backs sarkozys pick for agency giving him boost at home abroad paris frances conservative president is poised to win domestic and international political battles after european finance ministers agreed to back his candidate to lead the international monetary fund following a meeting in brussels the european unions finance ministers said they would support nicolas sarkozys nominee dominique strauss kahn a former french finance minister after current imf chief rodrigo de rato a spaniard announced unexpectedly in late june that he would step down in october mr sarkozy quickly maneuvered to put his candidate forward and canvassed other european colleagues for support the speed with which he moved gave france an advantage over other european nations such as italy that had designs on the post but didnt nominate a candidate since its inception in european nations have chosen one of their own to lead the fund but the imf and its sister institution the world bank whose leader has traditionally been designated by the u s have come under increasing pressure to open their leadership to candidates from the developing world the institutions policies most directly affect developing nations although britain resisted mr strauss kahns nomination on the grounds that the job should be open to candidates from asia and latin america mr sarkozy is likely to get his way that means it could be several years before the imfs members and others renew the debate on how the funds top management is chosen the u s treasury which in blocked a german choice for the top imf job hasnt raised any red flags about the year old mr strauss kahn at least so far its primary interest is a managing director committed to its imf "reform agenda " according to treasury officials if the nomination goes through it will help consolidate the newly elected french presidents stature as the emerging political power broker in europe since he came to office mr sarkozy has used his strong electoral victory at home to revive eu integration which has been stalled since when france and the netherlands voted down a proposed constitution just two weeks ago the nation eu endorsed his idea of replacing the defunct constitution with a simplified treaty the nomination of mr strauss kahn would also allow mr sarkozy to bolster his grip on french politics since he took office two months ago the president has been distributing plum jobs to leading members of the opposition socialist party which includes mr strauss kahn thwarting socialist efforts to regroup after their presidential election defeat the imf was created after world war ii to help maintain a stable global financial order when governments get into financial trouble the imf lends them money often with strict conditions for changing their economic policies in the s when financial crises erupted from mexico to thailand to russia the imf was criticized for insisting on excessively burdensome conditions or for promoting wrongheaded economic policies in this decade though with few financial crises and private money flooding into emerging markets the imf has been like a firefighter without fires that has provoked calls for re examining its mission the u s among others has pressed the imf to take a more active role in policing the global economy for countries china in particular that control their exchange rates to the disadvantage of other nations some u s economists say the fund needs at the helm a technocrat rather than a politician as it continues to redefine its role for the st century kenneth rogoff a former imf chief economist who now teaches at harvard university said the fund should follow the example of the worlds central banks most of which are now run by technocrats and produce good research and analysis "its not that a financial minister couldnt fill that role but hes not such an obvious fit " mr rogoff said in a brief statement mr strauss kahn said yesterday that should he become chief of the imf he would focus on "redefining the funds missions " and give emerging countries "the role they deserve" within the institution although mr sarkozy succeeded in rallying europeans behind the name of mr strauss kahn the french president ruffled some feathers along the way for having rushed through his candidate without considering opening up the nomination process to make it more transparent "its ridiculous " said charles grant director of the london based centre for european reform "mr sarkozy needs to realize that the world is no longer ruled by the u s and europe " most european finance ministers agreed that it was time to re examine the way the imf and world bank leaders are chosen but after the u s rushed to nominate former u s trade negotiator robert zoellick to head the world bank following the resignation of paul wolfowitz earlier this year europeans were loath to relinquish their claim on the imf any changes to the selection process will have to wait until the next time these jobs are open the european ministers said "after the americans suggested a successor to wolfowitz the europeans should have a chance to suggest a successor for the imf " said german finance minister peer steinbrueck mr strauss kahn is one of the few socialists leaders in france who isnt afraid to say that he adheres to free market principles a finance minister between and in the socialist government of prime minister lionel jospin he is credited with tightening frances budget ahead of the introduction of the euro the currency now shared by european countries during his mandate he presided over the sale of many state assets such as france telecom sa and played a key role in the creation of european aeronautic defence &amp space co the franco german umbrella company that owns airbus mr strauss kahn a former economics professor who often appears in gossip magazines with his third wife anne sinclair once a prominent television interviewer resigned abruptly in after he was placed under investigation as part of a corruption scandal a court later cleared him but his attempt to restart his political career fell apart last year when he came in a distant third in a bid to win the socialist partys presidential nomination john mccary in washington and adam cohen in brussels contributed to this article
