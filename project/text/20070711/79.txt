mccains misfortunes yesterdays shakeup of john mccains top campaign staff is giving the media who once loved him a chance to bury his presidential campaign but its also possible the shakeup will give his candidacy another chance to connect with the priorities of gop primary voters in the mainstream media telling the decline of mr mccains campaign is a modern greek tragedy he rose as a brave reformer who defied gop orthodoxy then fell as he gave up the iconoclasts mantle to court conservatives and defend the iraq war this is the history of a republican campaign as told by journalists who never vote republican its more accurate to say mr mccain began his current campaign having battled core gop principles too many times for some republicans to tolerate one or two heresies are acceptable even admirable for most voters but mr mccain has picked a policy fight over the years with nearly every part of the reagan bush coalition his obsession with campaign money struck social conservatives as an attempt to limit political speech he angered economic conservatives by opposing tax cuts in his campaign and then voting against them in and while mr mccain now says he wants to extend the bush tax cuts past his campaign is offering no new tax proposals to reverse doubts about his economic convictions even on national security which is his strength mr mccain has let other gop candidates get to his right on interrogations and enemy combatants rudy giuliani in particular has jumped into this space on economics and the war on terror sounding more stalwart than mr mccain we support mr mccains consistent and far sighted stand on immigration reform but it also didnt help him with many in the gop base this year there are six months before anyone goes to the polls and a comeback isnt impossible given the gop field mr giuliani is the new front runner but he has to hurdle doubts about his personal judgment bernard kerik and his stands on cultural issues mitt romney is spending millions on tv ads in iowa and new hampshire but there are doubts about his sincerity on everything from abortion rights to health care fred thompson has yet to present a compelling argument for his candidacy whatever his non candidate allure so far in the polls the main issue in will be national security and no one doubts mr mccains credentials to be commander in chief as one of those who urged more troops in iraq hell also benefit if the counterinsurgency "surge" strategy that kimberly kagan describes on the opposite page begins to show results however he fares the senator can help educate the american public by explaining whats at risk in the larger middle east from a u s failure in iraq down in the polls mr mccain can also afford to take a few policy risks that might cause voters to give him another look tax reform would be one issue on which he could break from the gop pack and free market health care is one on which he could contrast with mr romneys massachusetts mandates we hear that the staffers who departed yesterday include some who opposed bolder policy proposals when youre the former front runner you have nothing to gain by playing it safe
