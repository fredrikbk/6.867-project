politics &amp economics pakistan raid on mosque may fuel threat yesterdays military assault to evict islamist militants occupying a sprawling mosque in pakistans capital showed that embattled gen pervez musharraf pakistans president can still flex his armys muscle when necessary but it could also stir up al qaeda backed groups in pakistan and undermine confidence in the countrys robust economy after talks to resolve the weeklong standoff failed in the early hours yesterday gen musharraf ordered a final assault on the lal masjid or red mosque hundreds of soldiers stormed the mosque in the worst fighting ever in the heart of islamabad pakistans capital by evening about militants and soldiers had died according to a military spokesman maj gen waheed arshad one of the dead was abdul rashid ghazi one of two brothers who led the mosque the interior ministry said several militants were still holding out and it was unclear how many people if any were being held against their will inside the mosque which at one time had government backing is in a middle class residential neighborhood with markets and government housing the raid marks one of the largest crackdowns on islamist militants since gen musharraf took power in a coup following the sept attacks in the u s gen musharraf led his country into an antiterrorism alliance with the bush administration and has subsequently received billions in military and economic aid while pakistans military has fought rebels in pockets of the country gen musharraf has been criticized for sidestepping a broader confrontation with extremist beliefs emanating from mosques in rural areas and moving into its biggest cities that confrontation may no longer be avoided "it is a defining moment for both the country and the nation in the battle against militancy and religious extremism " said shireen mazari chairwoman of the islamabad based institute for strategic studies "there is no going back " the latest fight adds to a long list of challenges facing gen musharraf lawyers and citizen groups who have objected to the ouster of the countrys supreme court chief justice have continued to wage weekly street protests there have been sporadic and violent reminders in the southwestern baluchistan region of a simmering independence movement and afghanistans militant taliban movement has taken root in pakistans largely lawless tribal regions those holed up in the mosque have elicited little sympathy from pakistans broader and more moderate population who were alienated by the aggressive tactics the mosques leaders had been employing to try to establish a taliban style islamic rule in the capital many pakistanis also had been critical of the government for being slow in resolving the militant standoff through it all gen musharraf has been able to count on an economy now growing at about annually foreign investment is expected to reach &# billion this year up from &# billion in fiscal much of the investment is flowing into privatized state enterprises and a stock market in karachi that is trading at record levels but some analysts are starting to worry how long investors will remain immune to the political shocks yesterday standard &amp poors said it was revising downward the outlook it had for pakistans foreign currency credit rating the move makes it less likely the credit rating concern will raise its grade for pakistans debt "pakistans political and security situation has deteriorated markedly in recent months " said standard &amp poors analyst agost benard the ratings firm said unrest could affect investor confidence which in turn could lead to bigger deficits after the government rolled out a budget last month heavy on development spending and light on new taxes to generate revenue some analysts also caution that yesterdays bloodshed could boost efforts by militant groups to recruit for battles against government troops and could lead to more support for attacks against nato troops in afghanistan and indian soldiers in kashmir "the tribal areas will become more difficult " said bahukutumbi raman director of the institute for topical studies a think tank in chennai india that focuses on security issues and foreign affairs "there will be more violence and attacks " the u s has tried to strengthen the governments hand against militant movements in tribal areas partly by sharing intelligence with pakistans military and providing generous dollops of financial assistance during a visit to pakistan last month deputy secretary of state john negroponte said the u s would contribute &# million a year over the next five years to a pakistani government program to improve infrastructure health and education in some tribal areas but it is unclear how successful gen musharrafs government has been battling the spread of extremism the lal masjid movement was seen as a sign of religious militancy creeping into cities from the frontier region last wednesday gen musharraf deployed hundreds of troops near the mosque a day after the followers of radical clerics fought a gun battle with security forces mr ghazis brother maulana abdul aziz who had been one of the militant leaders at the mosque was captured that day mr ghazi had boasted that he was a follower of osama bin laden pakistani security officials said the mosque had become a center for outlawed militant groups that were involved in terrorist attacks against foreigners
