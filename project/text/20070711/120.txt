the daily fix ichiro takes spotlight as al wins again online edition for straight years the american league has not lost to the national league in the "midsummer classic " last night it extended that streak to years after falling behind early the al powered by three home runs built a lead and then held on in the ninth for a victory in san francisco on a night when mccovey cove was filled with kayaks hoping for a souvenir from hometown hero barry bonds seattles ichiro suzuki stole the spotlight with word leaking that the seattle centerfielder was close to inking a year about &# million contract extension with the mariners ichiro collected three hits including the all star games first ever inside the park home run and the games most valuable player award writes the seattle timess larry stone "never mind rising to the moment ichiro soared to the occasion heck ichiro almost upstaged willie mays but on a night when the giants living legend was given a moving pregame tribute that would have required ichiro to catch a fly ball with his teeth and then spontaneously combust in the on deck circle " ironically ichiros fireworks came in giants at&amp t park san francisco was considered by many a logical suitor for ichiros services this coming offseason after last nights performance the san francisco chronicles ron kroichick has this to say "dream on giants fans " alas the night did not belong to mr bonds which must have come as a great relief to major league baseball writes the washington posts thomas boswell twice mr bonds came to the plate and twice he lofted fly balls into the outfield on pitches he has so often has sent for baths in mccovey cove major league baseball must have fretted that the night would have belonged to mr bonds "in the end this all star game on a night that baseball has dreaded all season because the sports most notorious star would be on center stage display ended as well as it could bonds got his cheers and for an indisputably great career he deserved them but he didnt get the home run he wanted so much with its shallow appearance of vindication " writes mr boswell for the boston globes bob ryan the all star game once one of the countrys top sporting events has been ruined mr ryan writes that the games fall began in the s "when suddenly it turned into grammar school and everyone needed a ribbon to say you had been in attendance " and continued its fall in this era of interleague play espn tbs and major league tv packages which strip the all star game of its once great intrigue seeing the other leagues stars luckily for bud selig mr ryan offers six rule changes that will save the game for much of the tour de frances third stage the riders seemed to be on a training ride with their top speed rarely topping miles per hour then came the last miles and a dramatic finish that broke from one of the tours seemingly unwritten laws those that wear the yellow jersey are not supposed to win long flat stages such stages are supposed to go to the sprinters while the man wearing yellow sits back comfortably to finish with peloton "unless the man in the yellow jersey is a sprinter the maillot jaune does not usually contest mass finishes but the london prologue winner fabian cancellara is in such form at present that he can attempt anything " writes the guardians william fotheringham but with a under a mile to go "cancellara took his chance and showing enormous strength he raced away from the field to catch and pass the four hapless leaders in sight of the line " writes the telegraphs phil liggett though he is currently the proud owner of the yellow jersey and a second lead jeremy whittle of the times of london wonders if mr cancellara will be there in paris writes mr whittle "undoubtedly with two stage wins and the maillot jaune on his back he has been the man of the tour so far but when the mountain gradients bite on next saturdays first alpine stage he will be among the first to slip to the back of the peloton " oscar pistorius dreams of competing in the olympics and against the best athletes in the world now he will get his chance to compete against the worlds best this week on friday and sunday in meets in italy and england where he will run against meter olympic champion jeremy wariner what makes the south africans entry in the two meets remarkable is the fact that it will be the first time a disabled athlete has competed against the worlds elite the south african was born without fibulas had his legs amputated below his knees at months and uses with carbon fiber curved blades attached below his knees when he runs see this new york times graphic about his prosthetics mr pistorius has set paralympic records in the meters meters and meters to qualify for the meters in next years beijing olympics he "must run to meet the a standard or to reach the b by next july " writes the new york timess frank litsky his paralympic record in the meters is "but whether pistorius will be allowed to fulfill his dream of competing against the same runners at this summers world championships in osaka and next years olympics in beijing will depend on the international association of athletics federation " write the telegraphs tom knight some argue that the blades give mr pistorius an unfair advantage "oscar pistorius is beginning to get a little peeved at those who describe him as a marvel of engineering rather than an athlete with an extraordinary talent " writes the independents kevin mccallum "he is beginning to tire of the insinuations he is a cheat because he had his lower legs amputated at the age of months and runs on steel and carbon fibre rather than flesh and bone " with the all star break about to come to close and baltimore orioles games back the baltimore suns kevin cowherd is doing a little daydreaming his column today is a mock broadcast that has the orioles in first place and it doesnt stop there the orioles rotation features mike mussina curt schilling and johan santana and his revision of the jeffrey maier incident is best of all while we are on the orioles yahoo sportss jeff passan has a nice feature on baltimore rookie jeremy guthrie uber agent scott boras likes his statistics and more importantly what they can do for the players he represents during negotiations with that in mind he is planning to meet with mr selig to push for among other ideas a new defensive stat the los angelos timess bill shaikin reports the stat which mr boras calls "ep " for exceptional play would have the official scorer "distinguish between an exceptional play and a routine one in the same way he is asked to distinguish between a hit and error " tip of the fix cap to reader ronald alper and to the print journals greg corcoran write to
