sec proxy access proposal draws fire from investors washington the securities and exchange commission is circulating a much anticipated draft proposal of a plan to give shareholders an easier route to nominating candidates to corporate boards offering an approach that already has drawn criticism from investor groups a major sticking point according to critics is that the sec is mulling requiring a high ownership threshold equal to at least of shares for those looking to propose bylaw changes that would give shareholders a greater hand in nominating director candidates "wed vigorously oppose that " said richard ferlauto director of pension investment policy at the american federation of state county and municipal employees the question of shareholder access to corporate proxy ballots is a key issue being tackled by the sec the matter has long been controversial pitting shareholder advocacy groups who want to bolster the clout of individual shareholders against corporate executives who worry that open ballots will lead to chaos critics of the secs proposal say a ownership stake is so high that it would make the plan usable only by hedge funds mr ferlauto called that "totally irresponsible " and predicted that if the sec sticks with such an approach it would "create a field day for hedge funds " some think the level is meant to be a starting point for discussion and could be lowered to a level that would still be seen as too high by some pension fund groups and might be viewed as too low by business groups sec chairman christopher cox has promised the agency will propose rules this year on shareholders ability to nominate their own candidates to corporate boards and place their names on the companys proxy ballots avoiding the time and expense of a full blown proxy battle mr cox is aiming to have the five member commission consider floating a proxy access proposal at a public meeting on july according to individuals familiar with the matter final adoption of any changes would require a second vote by the sec even many large institutional investors would have to band together in order to meet a threshold the sec proposal calls for such groups to comply with the current disclosure requirements for individual owners holding or more of a companys shares such an approach would require groups seeking to propose proxy access plans to file reports on their finances an annual process for passive investors requiring shareholders who individually hold less than of a companys shares to file such reports may be a deterrent to some activists including hedge funds say those familiar with the proposal sec spokesman john nester declined to comment on the draft plan or criticism of it
