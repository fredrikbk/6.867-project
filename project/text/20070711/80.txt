new co limits cloud mirants hopes for sale buyers beware mirant corp may have a big global warming problem the power supplier announced in april it would consider selling itself hoping that private equity firms and power companies across the world will continue to pay hefty sums to capture the upside of rising electricity prices in the u s but potential buyers must weigh mirants access to profitable u s power markets against the fact that of the atlanta companys power plants will soon face limits on emissions of carbon dioxide the main global warming gas wall street has already grown skeptical that buyers will be willing to pay a significant premium for mirants stock which at almost &# is up close to in but down from a high of &# after the company announced it would consider a sale the companys market capitalization now stands at about &# billion the prospect of carbon regulations could make potential acquirers even less willing to pay the premium sought by mirants chief executive edward muller who has said the company will buy back shares if he isnt offered a good price the companys biggest global warming liability is its coal burning power plants in maryland one of the northeastern states participating in the regional greenhouse gas initiative under the rggi the states have agreed to limit carbon dioxide emissions from their power plants through a regional "cap and trade" pollution market mirants coal plants which can generate electricity cheaply relative to prevailing market prices are the source of the companys soaring profits since it emerged from bankruptcy protection in january last year mirant posted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude tax benefits and "mark to market" gains of &# million compared with &# million for the companys three coal plants in maryland and one in virginia generate the bulk of those earnings the plants produced gross margins in of &# billion and operating income of &# million on revenue of &# billion that was of the companys total gross margin and of its operating income but the blessing of these plants could prove to be a curse when the company is forced to comply with rggi coal is the most carbon intensive power plant fuel a gauge of its output of carbon dioxide when burned followed by oil and natural gas a gas fired plant produces one third to one half the carbon dioxide of a coal plant it is difficult to estimate rggis precise cost to mirant because important details of the agreement are still being ironed out but a study commissioned by the maryland department of the environment estimates that under the most generous possible regulatory scenario for power companies rggi would lower profits at the states coal burning plants by in and just over in coal fired power plant profits will decline in under rggi according to karen palmer an analyst at the think tank resources for the future which helped write the maryland study the impact of the new rules "will be significant because right now the only viable way of complying is by purchasing emission credits " said debra bolton vice president and assistant general counsel at mirant under the rggi cap and trade model total carbon emissions from the power sector are subject to a cap that declines over time historical polluters will be given or sold a certain amount of allowances if they pollute less than their allotment they can sell the unused amount to a polluter that cant physically cut its emissions by the required amount polluters must surrender one allowance to the government for every ton of carbon dioxide they produce annually the rggi states will cap carbon dioxide emissions at levels through and then cut emissions by mirant and other polluters are closely watching whether state governments give the allowances away free or auction them rggi requires states to auction at least of their allowances but most have already decided to auction the majority if not all of their allowances to the power industry to raise money for energy efficiency programs and investment in low polluting energy technologies while maryland has yet to decide its decision will significantly affect mirants costs the companys three coal plants provide of the states power according to mirant together mirants maryland plants emitted about million tons of carbon dioxide in according to data from the u s environmental protection agency of the states total carbon dioxide emissions in the deregulated electricity markets in maryland and other northeast states gas fired power plants usually set the price of electricity that price includes the cost of buying emission allowances for a gas burning plant if mirant must buy a large chunk of its allowances its margins will shrink because maryland power prices likely wont rise enough to cover the total cost of buying emission allowances for its coal burning plants "its so unknown " ms bolton said referring to pending state emission restrictions and associated costs "and frankly at this point its unknowable thats part of the problem its very unknown and yet its being legislated " the study by the maryland environment department assumed that the state would auction only the minimum of its allowances if maryland goes along with other rggi states and auctions or more of its allowances mirants profits would take a much bigger hit than the estimated starting in another unknown is the price of carbon allowances the rggi program doesnt include price caps on allowances making it difficult for companies to estimate how much they will have to spend in the emissions market "there is no price cap " ms bolton said "thats the issue thats why its hard for us to make a financial impact determination " the maryland departments study estimates allowance prices at &# per ton starting in andy kruger vice president of greenhouse gas markets at energy brokerage evolution markets said the price of allowances for could start out between &# and &# per ton but continuing uncertainty around the rules of the rggi market has made it difficult to estimate allowance prices in future years "power companies cant figure out what to do to nail down an allowance price for planning purposes " mr kruger said officials at the maryland department of the environment have said they want to make a decision on greenhouse gas emission auctioning by the fall they have hinted that they want to auction less than of allowances but more than the minimum "we are looking at whether theres an option in the middle thats best for maryland " said brian hug manager of air quality programs at the maryland environment department maryland officials said they dont want to overburden mirant given that the company is already spending &# billion or most of its free cash through to install equipment to control sulfur dioxide pollution from its coal burning plants adding to the companys burdens in is the possibility that the company will be forced to shut power plants in new york and virginia merrill lynch analyst elizabeth parrella estimates mirants adjusted ebitda her figures include the benefit of mirants operating leases will decline from &# billion in to &# million in at &# per share she estimates the company trades at premium to rival power companies on the basis of enterprise value to adjusted ebitda making it unlikely a buyer would be willing to pay a significant premium for the company
