the evening wrap carried away online edition blackstone groups ipo struck many investors as a good way to get in on the long running buyout boom but if some lawmakers also spied an opportunity to line the federal coffers by raising taxes on the buyout kings there was hesitation on the part of other legislators today senate finance committee chairman max baucus explained at a hearing today that hes trying to determine whether those new kings of wall street are carting off enormous riches while "avoiding their full and proper share of the burden of taxation " at issue in the hearing was whether "carried interest" the slice of profits beyond targeted returns that fund managers reap should continue to be taxed at the relatively modest capital gains rate as the industry thinks it should or at regular income tax rates which could run as steep as sen baucus and sen charles grassley the committees top republican are backing a bill that would lift the tax burden on publicly traded partnerships that are engaged in investment management opponents of the legislation decry it as class warfare they argue that it could hamper investment by discouraging investors from taking risks thus damping prosperity and broader improvements in living standards but sen grassley said that the measure is "not an attack on the investor class" and is only a means of "closing loopholes not raising taxes " house democrats are meanwhile pushing a measure that would treat all income from a partnership as ordinary income for tax purposes a more drastic step the sudden outcry over their tax bills has put generally secretive private equity and hedge fund operators in an uncomfortable limelight but it has also pitted lawmakers against a business that has become an important rainmaker when it comes to shaking out some cash for campaigning stopping off in greenwich conn the hedge fund hub has become de rigueur for politicians aiming to pass the hat and until today legislators from states where many of the private equity and hedge fund kingpins keep their offices have kept mum on the taxes issue sen chuck schumer the democrat from new york and a member of the finance committee seemed concerned that congress was singling out financial partnerships for a roasting and argued that energy real estate and other kinds of partnerships should also be getting the same treatment "i will not stand for treating financial services partnerships one way while all the other partnerships are treated another way " mr schumer stated adding that his "phone has been ringing a lot " a reference to an aggressive lobbying campaign by the industry all the same lawmakers appeared eager to tap into the private equity gusher to help bankroll priorities such as engineering repairs for the alternative minimum tax which is forecast to slap millions of middle class taxpayers with higher tax bills in coming years mr schumer said that he supported the idea of increasing taxes on the wealthiest to fund education or energy priorities but private equity is clearly cringing at that prospect meanwhile on the other side of the hill the house financial services committee was looking into tightening up oversight of hedge funds the investment vehicles that were once solely the domain of the wealthy but that have grown in popularity over the last few years rep barney frank the panels chairman stated he isnt "rushing to regulate but regulation shouldnt be a bad word " also today the securities and exchange commission adopted a new antifraud rule aimed at hedge funds and other money managers who mislead or defraud investors chairman christopher cox said that it was an "important tool to help police this market " slm buyers flinch at legislative proposals slm the student loan giant better

white house political director sara taylor refused to answer many questions from lawmakers about the federal prosecutors firings controversy citing president bushs claim of executive privilege democrats criticized the privilege claims as an effort by the administration to skirt a legitimate call for some accountability "it is apparent that this white house is contemptuous of the congress and feels that it does not have to explain itself to anybody " sen patrick leahy the vermont democrat and chairman of the committee said as the hearing started "i urge ms taylor not to follow that contemptuous position and not to follow the white house down this path " lawmakers said that they believed there were questions that didnt come under the domain of mr bushs claim and ms taylor did provide a few details testifying that she didnt recall ordering that certain attorneys be added to or deleted from a list of prosecutors to be terminated she also disputed testimony from kyle sampson the former chief of staff to attorney general alberto gonzales that she wanted to avoid submitting one new prosecutor tim griffin to the senate "i expected him to go through senate confirmation " ms
