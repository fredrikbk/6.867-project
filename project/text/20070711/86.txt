new treatment electronics giant seeks a cure in health care fleeing chips and tvs philips makes big bet on aging consumers eindhoven netherlands when gerard kleisterlee took over as chief executive of royal philips electronics nv europes storied consumer electronics giant was facing one of the most difficult moments in its year history it was and the televisions and compact disc players that made philips a household name were under assault from cheaper asian clones the computer chip unit strained as the internet bubble burst was hemorrhaging cash in a single year philips racked up losses of billion euros or roughly &# billion at the time six years later mr kleisterlee thinks he has found a small part of the solution people like mary prendergast an year old silver haired former nurse who lives alone in a one bedroom apartment in beverly mass ms prendergast whose eyesight is waning is a new customer of philipss lifeline service the medical alert system allows her to press a button on a bracelet and connect to a call center where operators armed with her health profile are on hand the service which costs about &# a month assists her and other clients with home safety issues such as falls and questions about their medications it was designed to help elderly customers live on their own for as long as possible philips paid &# million last year to buy massachusetts based lifeline an acquisition that represented a turning point for the company for decades its medical systems division made and sold large professional equipment like x ray and cat scan machines to hospitals now philips is attempting to meld its health care experience with its knowledge of consumer marketing the goal carve out a new high growth business selling health related products and services "patients are behaving more and more like consumers they go on the internet and get second opinions " says mr kleisterlee "care is being pushed out of hospitals which are expensive and into homes and clinics " philips is joining a parade of industrial giants making big bets on a growing elderly population and rising incidence of chronic diseases general electric co and siemens ag which both manufacture large scale medical equipment are restructuring to make big pushes into health care for philips health care is a way to escape a broader upheaval that has shaken some of the worlds most prominent technology firms as nimbler asian competitors churn out much cheaper cd players laptops and other electronic gear ibm corp exited the personal computer business it pioneered by selling out to chinas lenovo corp in french consumer electronics firm thomson sa once one of the worlds largest makers of tvs has shed of its old business lines today it is trying to reinvent itself as a provider of digital video services to hollywood studios for philips selling health care products and services directly to consumers represents uncharted territory "weve always been quite good at engineering products thats our legacy and history " says the year old mr kleisterlee himself an electrical engineer by training moreover since consumers often dont pay for health care out of pocket the company must contend with insurers and government payers lifeline is covered by some state medicaid plans and private insurers but not all another philips consumer product a device which allows a doctor to monitor patients vital signs from their homes via the internet has been in development for more than five years as the company tries to convince insurers of its value philips projects its nascent consumer health division which so far also sells baby care equipment such as home infant monitors will bring in sales of million euros to billion euros or &# billion to &# billion by the end of next year while a significant new revenue stream thats still just a fraction of philipss total sales of billion euros or &# billion when mr kleisterlee took over as ceo he had worked at philips his entire career as had his father before him the companys strategy in the s was to focus on cranking out high volume electronics it was a fully integrated manufacturer making everything from the computer chips to screens to the finished tv in addition to producing big medical equipment philips was known for its light bulbs and home appliances such as irons and electric shavers but wall street viewed philips as a high growth technology stock semiconductor analysts covered it the companys stock price reached its peak of euros a share in spring and growth was the strongest in its history "it was all about technology " mr kleisterlee recalls after the internet bubble burst technology spending dried up and a global economic slump followed philips went into a tailspin reporting losses of billion euros in and billion euros in mr kleisterlee began cutting costs and selling off assets to stabilize the company he shuttered nearly all of philipss electronics factories cutting tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs he even dissolved the components division hed run himself and shed the volatile capital intensive semiconductor business once the symbol of high tech innovation at philips mr kleisterlee knew he needed a bigger plan he thought to himself "what is the hand of cards that i have and how do i play them " he formed a special team staffed in part by executives recruited from outside the company to help chart a new course "we wanted to move away from commodity markets and into more profitable markets where we could differentiate ourselves from our competitors " explains gottfried dutine a former executive at motorola who joined the transition team with the rest of the company under pressure the professional medical division which sells large equipment to hospitals suddenly began to emerge as a bright spot with earnings growing at about in and one product it had been working on caught the imagination of executives a defibrillator like those used in emergency rooms to shock a person out of cardiac arrest philips figured that was an example of a product that could be re engineered for use by nonexperts "we took an existing very complex product and redesigned it completely for lay people " says paul smit senior vice president of the medical systems division called heartstart home defibrillator it began to be sold for about &# without a prescription in drugstores and on amazon com in hotels and shopping malls and banks were among the early customers the example of heartstart delivered a jolt to philips the product became a "trigger point " says mr dutine which caused executives to see a gap in consumer health care that wasnt being addressed by competitors in september the ceo unveiled a new consumer health care division he tapped ivo lurvink a year old former investment banker to lead the new business and gave him a simple order look for opportunities outside of hospitals mr lurvink felt a special affinity for the market in part because he had seen his mother suffer a mild stroke and had helped care for her he also wanted to learn more about his own health "i am a hypochondriac " he admits "my family jokes about it " one of the hot areas philips identified was "independent living " or elderly people who wanted to live on their own for as long as possible mr lurvink and his staff spent months traveling the world to attend medical conferences and meet with pharmaceutical and health insurance executives they wanted to absorb everything they could about the aging population philips organized focus groups of elderly people and their adult children in madrid frankfurt san francisco and boston they made some key findings for instance a stigma exists among many seniors who are reluctant to acknowledge their frailty or ill health another problem elderly patients often arent comfortable with high tech products and prefer a measure of human interaction sometimes arthritic fingers prevent them from navigating tiny buttons philips developed a profile of the elderly customer it wanted to target internally they dubbed it the "senior solutions sweet spot " people in this group they determined valued self reliance felt that staying connected to friends and family was important and yet wanted to address "functional decline" like weakening vision or trouble walking while mr lurvinks team was working on health care mr kleisterlee and the board of philips finalized the sale of the semiconductor division to a group of private equity firms for billion euros it was a seismic cultural shift on the day of the announcement in august mr kleisterlee spoke to a packed room on the companys research campus in eindhoven the scientists from the computer chip division who were accustomed to being celebrated as innovators were stunned the sale says mr kleisterlee was "fundamentally changing the identity of what a lot of people at philips stand for and believe in " at about the same time mr lurvink was looking at lifeline as a way to enter the market of products and services for seniors lifeline was founded in the u s in and currently has subscribers in the u s and canada it had strong relationships with about hospitals community organizations and home health care agencies that were the major source for referrals of patients to the service mr lurvink says some board members asked him pointedly if he was really recommending that philips buy a call center for &# million the fact that lifeline was essentially a service with operators being its most important asset made it a tough sell to the high tech minded directors "i had a lot of convincing to do " recalls mr lurvink so far investors have responded positively to the changes under way at philips the companys shares have gained roughly in the past three years although its too early to determine the success of the consumer health care push other divisions are on track electronics have stabilized lighting and medical systems are also reporting healthy margins and sales growth philips wants to take lifeline global and broaden its service offerings one idea in the works an intelligent pill box equipped with sensors to detect when a senior hasnt taken his or her medication an excess of pills would automatically alert the system and an operator could call to remind the customer to take the dosage merging lifeline into philips high tech culture hasnt always been easy mr lurvink for example recalls sitting in meetings to talk about broken bones each year according to geriatric specialists about americans fall and break a hip and of them will end up in a nursing home as a result for philips engineers the natural response was to dream up sophisticated innovations such as machines to detect motion and balance on the other side of the table the lifeline people wanted a simple solution their message "give us a dumb machine and well back it up with our call center operators " said mr lurvink
