campuses companies cozy up universities enlist firms as development partners questions about mission st louis county in recent years u s universities have been aggressively expanding developing research campuses town centers and more the university of missouri at st louiss expansion is notable for whom it attracted express scripts inc a pharmacy benefits manager with almost &# billion in annual sales express scripts is among the first u s companies to put its headquarters on a college campus "it was an opportunity we couldnt pass up " says university chancellor tom george the school has acquired more than acres since the universitys decision to bring private industry to campus highlights a growing push by urban universities to spur economic development both in reclaiming declining neighborhoods around their campuses and assuming a larger role in the creation of jobs "were expected to take the lead " dr george says but it also raises questions about whether universities should be playing the role of developer and to what degree they should be mixing campus and corporate space in recent years critics have warned of a danger in blurring the line between higher education and industry "were losing the ethos of what an independent university is supposed to be " says sheldon krimsky professor of urban and environmental policy and planning at tufts university and author of "science in the private interest has the lure of profits corrupted biomedical research " u s universities have been criticized for some time about their role in research especially in the pharmaceutical industry but often these partnerships are carried out at research parks clusters of start up companies and established firms that are off the beaten track of most students and faculty more recently however universities have sought to bring companies closer to campus last year clemson university and german auto maker bmw ag opened a joint automotive research and education center on the outskirts of greenville s c that will house the universitys square foot graduate engineering center northwest of st louis university officials have been buying land around the school in part to stem the economic decline of the citys near suburbs the area adjacent to the university along interstate included a languishing strip center neglected houses and a shuttered apartment building stripped of its doors and windows at the same time administrators say the schools role as a public land grant university obligates it to help create jobs for its graduates and to lift the sluggish regional economy "the public expects more than just a degree factory " dr george says so when express scripts announced in that it was seeking to relocate its headquarters administrators saw a good fit the company relies heavily on information technology processing million prescriptions a day and such technology is one of the universitys strengths it wasnt a hard sell express scripts chief executive george paz saw in the campus of students a potential work force and the unusual arrangement would give express scripts a hand in developing courses and joint programs with the university likely defraying the companys training costs and reducing turnover "this will allow us to get good people and keep them " mr paz says the plan raised concerns among some faculty members who worried that the partnership would undermine academics and research "it may serve the needs of the company " says joseph martinich professor of operations management and a member of a joint task force between the university of missouri at st louis and express scripts "but thats not necessarily our mission " still most of the campus cheered last month when express scripts lured in part by &# million in state tax credits traded its home in a suburban st louis office park for a &# million brick and aluminum building near the universitys athletics complex the company is the first tenant in what university administrators hope to be a business and research park creating what they say could become a technology hub students at the university of missouri at st louis many of them from modest backgrounds are particularly supportive senior kelcy siddall an intern at express scripts this summer in information technology finance says the partnership between the university and the company has allowed him crucial on the job experience "i get to see what the corporate world is all about " he says already the university and express scripts are developing academic programs they say will be mutually beneficial in one undergraduate course students will be assigned to create software to test how much activity the express scripts computer system can handle and the university will offer several courses for express scripts employees including one that targets potential leaders identified by the company as for express scripts employees some complain about a longer commute but most have embraced the new site near lambert st louis international airport express scripts employees can use the university gymnasium and there is talk of joint wellness and daycare centers
