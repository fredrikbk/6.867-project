politics &amp economics fear of taxation by association hedge funds private equity cant set coalition against new levies after getting caught flat footed on capitol hill private equity and hedge fund firms are going on the offensive to lobby against steep new taxes but their nascent campaign to enlist other industries to join them is off to a bumpy start as some players worry about being associated with such high profile targets the fledging effort comes as the senates tax committee holds its first hearing today on the tax treatment of "carried interest " a term for the cut of the profits received by private equity and hedge fund managers these sums are often taxed at the long term capital gains rate because the law treats the money more like investment income rather than regular wages a proposed house bill would deem these profits as ordinary income and tax them at rates as high as and top senators are considering whether to propose similar legislation trying to fight back private equity and hedge fund firms want to paint the proposed bill as a new "investment tax" with far reaching implications for other industries from real estate and timber companies to oil and gas interests that pitch has triggered a flurry of new and sometimes overlapping alliances to lobby against the legislation the u s chamber of commerce has formed a coalition of private equity firms hedge funds real estate groups and others for now the group is meeting to share information the real estate roundtable another trade group ran an ad yesterday in a capitol hill newspaper saying the proposed tax changes would reduce the value of investments by pension funds and threaten the availability of low income housing "the unintended consequences of raising this investment tax on carried interest are consequences america cant afford " said the roundtables ad in roll call not everyone who might be affected wants to pool their efforts however in some cases because of uncertainty about whether it is smart to align with two industries that have become a focus of congressional attention the tremendous wealth being generated by the huge buyout deals and investment gains in the private equity arena have dovetailed with a broader debate about income and tax equity making for a potent political issue the venture capital industry opposes the bill but plans to work independently in a bid to defeat the legislation "everybody is trying to figure out the best strategy " said jennifer dowling the vice president for federal policy at the national venture capital association public employee pension funds a politically powerful group are also steering clear of the fight a big blow to the lobbying effort the national association of state retirement administrators which represents most u s public pension plans doesnt plan to issue an opinion on the legislation says jeannine raymond its director of federal relations even though pension funds have made impressive gains from their investments in hedge funds and private equity firms two large pension funds the california public employees retirement system and the california state teachers retirement system are likewise mute "we dont have anything to say " said sherry reser media relations manager for the california state teachers retirement system "we are not directly affected by this proposed legislation " mutual funds investment firms large banks and most real estate investment trusts as well as oil and gas partnerships also are remaining on the sidelines even a prominent target of the proposed bill hasnt been able to muster a united front this week a small group of hedge funds decided to fund their own lobbying alliance within the industrys broader washington trade association that is because the industrys main trade group the managed funds association hasnt taken a formal position on the legislation given splits within its membership the new lobbying effort will be run by two former members of the senate finance committee john breaux of louisiana and don nickles of oklahoma at todays senate hearing the treasury department congressional budget office and a tax expert in favor of raising taxes on carried interest are set to testify cbo director peter orszag is expected to say that some if not all of the carried interest is clearly compensation for services provided rather than return on capital and that some if not all of it should be subject to ordinary taxation the event will provide the first glimpse of how senators view the legislation a variety of business partnerships use carried interest taxed at the capital gains rate not just private equity firms and hedge funds the proposed house bill explicitly hits managers in private equity hedge fund venture capital and real estate partnerships but steers clear of oil and gas ventures it is unclear what approach the senate might take the sweep of the house bill introduced last month led a number of businesses outside the world of finance to ramp up lobbying efforts that came as a relief to private equity firms and hedge funds the most prominent targets of lawmakers ire which were slow to move to ward off the tax changes when they were first floated each industry that compensates partners with carried interest has been making a case for maintaining the status quo in meetings with congressional aides arguing that the investment risks they take and the contributions they make to the overall economy warrant the preferential rate "everyone is speaking to the same issue but everyone has their own perspectives based on how their industry is structured " said steve renna senior vice president and counsel at the real estate roundtable and unlike the more prominent industries whose wealthy managers have drawn media coverage "we dont have to worry about doing damage control on our image " mr renna said another possible ally might be real estate investment trusts the proposed legislation includes language to explicitly prevent tax treatment for reits from being upended however some of the profits on which reit investors currently enjoy capital gains rates would likely be taxed as ordinary income under the bill at rates as high as according to reit tax experts deborah solomon rebecca buckman and jesse drucker contributed to this article
