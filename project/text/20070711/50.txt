basics point value in parentheses asterisk means partial credit will be awarded  which six teams will be division winners points each readers picks correct answers or current leaders in bold where

texas seattle nl east new york mets philadelphia atlanta florida nl central st louis chicago cubs milwaukee houston cincinnati nl west los angeles san diego arizona san francisco colorado only the nl east and west have more than two teams within five games of the leader the nl also has a number of teams in wild card contention in the more uneven al each team except the twins is either games over or better or at or below alex belth the al central is the story in the american league this year the yanks have finally crumbled under their own weight too old and top heavy with a weak underbelly and the indians and tigers are for real not only do the yankees have to play close to ball in the second half to have a chance they also have to hope that either detroit or cleveland falls apart which doesnt seem likely to happen verlanders no no was tremendous this isnt really a surprise but gary sheffield can really hit huh you know mags loves having him around alex rodriguez and the yankees miss sheffield plenty but that hasnt prevented a rod from having one of the best years of his career dingers and rbi and a basketful of "clutch" moments hideki matsui is the only yankee with more than homers and he just has i still say the yanks miss the playoffs and theyll really have to pony up if they want to keep rodriguez his off the field stuff has been bizarre and oddly appealing especially because it hasnt messed with his performance jon bois until recently the nl west was the most boring division in baseball i remember sitting in my parents living room a decade ago and taking in the long dark espn sunday night half asleep occasionally jostled to brief attention as jon miller squawked ad infinitum about jeff kent hitting a "linnnne shot " nick dallamora the detroit tigers are a game ahead of the indians at the break and i dont think theyre looking back justin verlander and jeremy bonderman wash with c c sabathia and fausto carmona but kenny rogers has kicked the door in on his way back from the disabled list going in three starts while posting an era of that combined with an mvp candidate in magglio ordonez and gary sheffields best season in years looks like a sure thing if the indians were to take the wild card though theyd be a lot more likely to make the alcs assuming they play the angels the angels have a terrific record but their starting pitching is anything but intimidating jason fry the mets are taking a page from the yankees right now theyre in a dogfight have endured some bad play and distractions and the fans are restless yet they should get through it get reinforcements and could easily put the hammer down and cruise in the second half as a rabid met fan i find this a little disquieting paul steiger the biggest surprises to me at the break are the padres yankees and brewers everybody expected the san diego pitching to be intimidating and it is from the starters peavy young maddux wells germano to the set up people to closer trevor hoffman who still scintillates at age saves in opportunities but how about the offense the padres are scoring as many runs per game as teams with way better offensive reputations like the cardinals and the diamondbacks though injuries have held him back a bit the last month or so adrian gonzalez is a bona fide slugger meantime mike cameron and khalil greene are delivering in the clutch big time greene is a weird hitter for a shortstop well over half his hits are for extra bases he is slugging on top of a puny on base rate and has rbis the additions of the talented yet elsewhere disruptive milton bradley and michael barrett could be positive for the second half bottom line the padres are scoring nearly a run a game better than they allow by far the best in the nl versus for the brewers for the dodgers for the cubs and for the mets they are a serious threat to win more games than anyone else in this league the brewers remain a mystery to me in part because i dont get to see them much the hitting is awesome with the tandem of prince fielder and j j hardy doing huge damage and with lots of others chipping in a kid named ryan braun is hitting and slugging since being installed as the regular third baseman last month they score nearly five runs a game and have hit homers which is more than their suspect pitching has allowed the pitching alas is the weak link after ben sheets there are no starters who should scare anyone though jeff suppan seems to get up for big games and closer francisco cordero untouchable early had a dreadful june blowing three saves my seemingly unambitious pre season pick for this division st louis has played horribly but the cubs are jelling one of these two will beat out the brewers the obvious reason for the yankees stumbling is the number of injuries their pitchers have suffered less obviously key people are failing to deliver on the offense jeter is jeter and a rod has had a spectacular first half giving me rare hope for one of my pre season predictions his mvp merits beyond them and jorge posada the record is painful robinson cano has been acting like a typically jinxed sophomore though in his third year the american league pitchers could have been expected to figure out bobby abreu better than when he first came over from philadelphia last summer and they have hideki matsui despite respectable numbers has just not been the game breaker he was before his injury last year in recent days all three have shown some life the yankees are better than a team they scored more runs than they surrendered in the first half they have only saves by far the lowest number in the league in part because they squander runs winning big then lose other games by narrow margins the yankees average margin of victory in their wins is runs the margin is less than in the games they have lost put another way the yankees have lost games by one or two runs each while winning only eight games by such narrow margins if the yankees can keep a healthy rotation and do better in close games they will get into the playoffs if dave studeman the interleague waste of time proved once again that the american is the better league but the national is the more entertaining league this year it wouldnt be a major surprise if the al playoff teams were the four currently far ahead of the pack the red sox angels indians and tigers im not giving up on the yankees twins or mariners just yet but i wouldnt bet against the current top four but everything is up in the air in the national league yes the brewers have a big lead but the cubs will turn that division into a pennant race before the season is over thank goodness lou lost his temper the mets dont seem to have the depth to maintain a big lead over the braves and phillies and the al west is a dogfight  which two teams will win the wild cards each al boston new york yankees cleveland detroit minnesota chicago white sox toronto anaheim oakland baltimore tampa bay nl philadelphia new york mets atlanta los angeles san diego st louis chicago cubs milwaukee arizona houston florida colorado pittsburgh san francisco in each of the last five years at least one wild card team made it to the world series this year readers think their pick for the al wild card will win the league championship while think the same about the nl wild card kansas city and washington are the only teams chosen by no one to make the playoffs  which two teams will go to the world series each al new york yankees boston anaheim detroit minnesota cleveland chicago white sox oakland toronto baltimore nl los angeles new york mets philadelphia st louis atlanta chicago cubs milwaukee san diego arizona san francisco cincinnati houston florida the yankees are games out of first place and games out of the wild card last years champ the cardinals are two games worse than the yanks but in a better position for the playoffs sound like last year it should the cards made the playoffs and won the title despite finishing with just wins will leitch id like to note that as a cardinals fan its so much easier to watch a team thats games out of first place when it just won the world series poor yankees fans they have no such absolution its almost like theyre cursed bois a rod is doing all he can its quite possible that no other yankee will hit home runs but the team is hitting a solid and ranks third in the al in runs scored theyre fielding reasonably well and their pitching while not as great on rubber as it is on paper should be good enough at this point mariano rivera deserves some blame but hes starting to turn around ill chalk most of this up to a lack of timely hitting any team thats around + on their runs scored runs allowed figures and still cant pull together a record is choking larry borowsky the cubs have gone since carlos zambrano beat up michael barrett not coincidentally zambrano is with a era since that game in starts pitching to barrett the big z got raked for runs and a slugging average in starts throwing to other catchers he has yielded just runs and a slugging average of the white sox and red sox sloughed off their curses could this be the year for the cubs fry larry has his starting point i have mine zambrano has been lights out since i gave up on him in fantasy baseball and traded him for ian snell struggling teams should pay me to trade their players  which team will win the world series new york yankees boston new york mets detroit los angeles anaheim minnesota chicago cubs cleveland philadelphia atlanta milwaukee oakland san francisco st louis san diego arizona baltimore chicago white sox houston kudos to readers who didnt choose the yankees none of the teams with more than three votes has a losing record and the only team with a winning record not to get a vote is the seattle mariners who wouldnt make the playoffs if the season ended today  which team will have the best regular season record new york yankees boston new york mets anaheim detroit philadelphia st louis cleveland los angeles oakland atlanta chicago white sox minnesota san diego houston just games separate the four best teams all in the al the red sox tigers angels and indians the tigers riding a five game winning streak have the majors best run differential at + the red sox are next followed by the padres  which team will have the worst regular season record washington kansas city tampa bay pittsburgh baltimore colorado seattle cincinnati florida this race is as tight as the one at the other end of the spectrum tampa bay is worst at but five other teams have at least losses no team is on pace for more than losses  who will win the al and nl cy young awards each al johan santana roy halladay daisuke matsuzaka rich harden c c sabathia jeremy bonderman john lackey mariano rivera josh beckett andy pettitte erik bedard bartolo colon kei igawa kevin millwood jonathan papelbon francisco rodriguez curt schilling justin verlander chien ming wang

martinez bronson arroyo matt cain zach duke cole hamels chuck james anthony reyes the nl west has cornered the market on ace starting pitching with brad penny jake peavy and chris young leading the pack al all star starter dan haren leads the race in the junior circuit josh beckett c c sabathia and john lackey lead the league in wins but haren has been better than all of them last years winner johan santana is also in the mix bois jake peavy era and chris young are the reasons i pay attention now coincidentally peavys statistical career arc is starting to remind me of teammate greg madduxs young is proving me right if the season ended today i think hed deserve the cy young because ultimately era is all that matters at the start of the season i picked him to win the award not only because i witnessed sparks of brilliance over the past couple of years but also because i thought a guy named young winning the cy young would be really neat dallamora jake peavy is looking great for the nl cy young but how the hell does alex belth pick c c sabathia for the al johan is a second half pitcher so im sticking with the king i bet beckett finishes the season with more wins than sabathia anyway so enjoy your pedestal while it lasts belth  who will win the al and nl mvp awards each al alex rodriguez david ortiz grady sizemore vladimir guerrero derek jeter travis hafner joe mauer manny ramirez mark teixeira robinson cano justin morneau ivan rodriguez gary sheffield vernon wells michael young bobby abreu johnny damon carlos guillen nick markakis hideki matsui johan santana jim thome kevin youkilis nl albert pujols ryan howard alfonso soriano david wright chase utley carlos beltran lance berkman nomar garciaparra jose reyes miguel cabrera andruw jones derrek lee aramis ramirez jason bay barry bonds carlos delgado adam dunn bill hall chipper jones carlos lee jimmy rollins alex rodriguez has the als best conventional stats but there are plenty of other candidates on contenders detroits magglio ordonez is the pick of espn com baseball writer jayson stark while hardball timess win shares stat a collective measure of all of a players contributions to victory favors home run derby champ vladimir guerrero other candidates mvp ichiro suzuki and a duo of cleveland indians catcher victor martinez and centerfielder grady sizemore in the nl barry bonds has sterling credentials including reaching base on of his plate appearances but isnt helped by his contentious relationship with voters nor with the giants putrid record that throws the race open prince fielder has been the best player on the surprise brewers while jose reyes has paced the shaky yet division leading mets russell martin deserves a look for his offensive contribution from the backstop for the dodgers belth the emergence of prince fielder as a top flight slugger is great to see oh and after a slow start ryan howard is still on pace to hit homers im amazed at the amount of good hitting shortstops its not just a couple of guys heck the nl east alone is an embarrassment of riches hanley ramirez and jose reyes are two of the best young players in the game and edgar renteria has put together a very nice career now orlando cabrera can hit and j j hardy rakes derek jeter is having another steady season adding to his hall of fame resume and the best hitting shortstop in the game plays for the tigers bois why arent people talking about alex rodriguezs june avg hr rbi as much as they did his april hes still on pace to hit + home runs which when considered with a average a projected rbi and steals compels me to place it among the all time great offensive seasons until i realize that it might have a shot at placing fifth in this unfinished decade  who will win the al and nl rookie of the year awards each al daisuke matsuzaka alex gordon delmon young b j upton alexi casilla john danks jacoby ellsbury philip hughes philip humber akinori iwamura adam lind dustin pedroia brandon wood nl chris young kevin kouzmanoff troy tulowitzki mike pelfrey homer bailey stephen drew josh hamilton james loney hunter pence carlos quentin lastings milledge jeff baker michael bourn tim lincecum delmon young chris burke buck coats chris coste angel guzman tony gwynn jr cole hamels corey hart chris iannetta conor jackson andy laroche andrew mccutcheon tony pena jr felix pie luke scott ryan theriot justin upton dice k and dustin pedroia have been good but boston teammate hideki okajima has been better yielding just four earned runs in innings other notable al rookies travis buck jeremy guthrie akinori iwamura reggie willits and delmon young in the nl centerfielder hunter pence has been best hitting with a slugging percentage for the astros also notable ryan braun josh hamilton corey hart and troy tulowitzki borowsky nobody picked troy tulowitzki for nl rookie of the year but hes making a viable case he leads the field in runs scored and is second in rbi while playing a premium defensive position shortstop hunter pence or ryan braun will probably walk away with the award but it wouldnt shock me if tulowitzki ends up having the most productive career of this class dallamora daisuke matsuzaka is rolling on wins an era well under and his strikeouts are good for th in the majors when you consider how big the difference is between japanese ball and american ball and how hard a time many pitchers have just going from the nl to the al i find these numbers to be fantastic look at what one year in the al did for josh beckett daisukes excelling while hes still making changes to his game at the beginning of the year when he was pitching from the stretch he broke very quickly and my amateur estimate pegged him at twice as many balls when there were men on base it looked like the japanese league players stole a lot more bases and he was just trying to pitch as quickly as possible now hes taking more time and his control has to be at least twice as good better anyone who expected more out of daisuke this year is not thinking rationally there is nothing but good to come from this guy the nitty gritty points each all questions include regular season games only asterisk denotes partial credit will be given  which manager will be first to no longer be managing team whether fired retired resigned or otherwise not managing in mike hargrove seattle sam perlozzo baltimore clint hurdle colorado buddy bell kansas city john gibbons toronto charlie manuel philadelphia joe torre new york yankees jerry narron cincinnati eric wedge cleveland ozzie guillen chicago white sox bob melvin arizona grady little los angeles dodgers joe maddon tampa bay jim tracy pittsburgh bruce bochy san francisco phil garner houston terry francona boston lou piniella chicago cubs ned yost milwaukee fredi gonzalez florida tony la russa st louis none sam perlozzo was the first to go fired by the orioles last month a couple of weeks later mike hargrove and jerry narron had a photo finish for second dallamora so perlozzo was the first stooge to get the axe which isnt really shocking hargrove quit like a week later so i dont think i would have gotten points anyway whats really interesting here is that joe girardi was offered the position and he refused it could this guy put any more stock into becoming the yankees new skipper granted the yankees arent looking too good to get to the playoffs this year and brian cashman and joe torre would most likely get a cold kick to the curb a week or two after the regular season ends but this is borderline scary i bet steinbrenner contacted girardi after his orioles interview and put a bug in his ear  who will be the highest salaried player based on salary released or traded todd helton alex rodriguez

anaheim atlanta san diego in the rosters for last nights game the mariners rockies and brewers were the big surprises for our readers dallamora ok so i got cute picking the indians for one all star the indians had three ed i was just getting sick of dumping on the royals and nationals for every one of these "worst of" categories we all know theres no such thing as a washington all star which made dmitri youngs appearance all the more fun  on what date will barry bonds hit career hr no just readers dont think hell pass hank aaron on the all time list this year of the who expect it this year the median and mean is august the most popular answer is july bonds has hit this season for a career mark of in clay davenports last check in on bondss run at hank aaron on baseball prospectus more on that here he set the most likely record breaking day at july and the median day at july the commenters weighed in on bonds and also offered their takes on other personal milestones bois its happening last year anti barry bonds sentiment was fomented by his eclipse of babe ruths th home run as he creeps to the doorstep of henry aarons th though that sentiment is waning certainly within the media but also among baseball fans i talk to its not that were finally resigning ourselves to the idea of a first degree steroid abuser achieving baseball immortality weve known it was going to happen for some time now its that weve been hating him for a while and were running out of steam were losing resolve hatred is hard work since he hit his th weve had chances to take in a few vacations a holiday season a phenomenal prince halftime show and dozens maybe hundreds of bottles of our favorite beer we know that hate is destructive for everyone involved and maybe weve begun to wonder why we allow a sport that exists to make us happy to make us bitter ive thought about it a lot and you know what ill take from baseball what i like and leave what i dont borowsky my prediction regarding the date of bonds record breaking homer is looking pretty good the prediction july isnt really mine it comes from a member of my community zubin sumariwalla july is now the median prediction in chris davenports running series over at baseball prospectus bonds needs five homers and the giants have games from now through july thats one homer per three games in this decade bonds has averaged a homer per games but heres the kicker july is also the premiere date for "the simpsons movie" whose lead character is named homer sweet im in like flynn i pretty much need that one because the rest of my predictions look terrible three of my eight playoff predictions are nearly lost twins cardinals and yankees and that includes both of my predicted pennant winners twins and cards scoring is way down i had it increasing by charlie manuel still has his job the yankees whom i picked along with almost everybody else to have the best record in baseball are under my predicted mvps grady sizemore and albert pujols are both having lukewarm years id be thrilled to break points belth one of the most enjoyable storylines this year has been the number of milestones reached and passed by the older generation of great players barry bonds chase of the all time home run record is the biggest story one that is unfortunately filled with controversy and unpleasantness i picked him to break the record on july so im probably going to miss that one when sammy sosa hit his th home run not long ago people talked about steroids not how great sammy has been thats too bad but not all of the accomplishments are ruined frank thomas just hit his th career dinger and junior griffey is close to he just passed frank robinson for everything that griffeys career has not been man hes close to dingers thats sick i used to think that rooting for junior was a lost cause because hes always getting hurt but ive changed my mind the swing is still as sweet as ever and if he can keep himself healthy in his declining years hey he might have a chance to catch willie mays i think it will be great when tom glavine gets to his th win i love all these old pitchers clemens regardless of the contact and everything that goes with it has been a joy to watch he knows hes pitching on borrowed time and hes really pitching his last two outings of the first half were excellent three hundred and fifty wins and counting thats just cool and so is maddux at dallamora what the hell was barry bonds doing skipping the home run derby there has got to be this voice of reason perched atop his shoulder that tells him everything he needs to do to look like an unconcerned pompous jerk its a fun little game that a lot of people love to watch the players are always loose and playful razzing friends and taking pictures from the grass in foul territory hes about to cement his name next to the home run record the all star game is at his home park and therefore his name was pushed into the starting rotation yet he wouldnt spend minutes hitting home runs for a nation of home run lovers something isnt adding up i really hope he had something going on monday night because hes not going to get too many more opportunities to smash a bunch of home runs and receive a round of applause fry ive muted my bonds ranting because a its inevitable and b hes having a good year instead of crawling his way to the record also the lazarus like reappearance of ken griffey jr has provided a happier foil to bondss deeds and because hey its baseball i mean in january id do most anything to watch barry bonds ground out against the brewers studeman seemingly will go down in history as the year of the milestone theres barry chasing hank of course but youve also got trevor hoffmans th save craig biggios th hit thomass th home run and sosas th before the season is over you may also see griffey reach homers and biggio will break the all time record for being hit by a pitch very soon by the end of the year a rod will hit his th home run glavine will win his th game etc sadly the phillies will lose their th game really appears to be a year in which an entire great generation of ballplayers reach many career milestones i hope the steroids coverage which often sounds like ranting hysteria doesnt cloud the achievements of a remarkable group of players leitch i think its awesome in every possible way that frank thomas was ejected from the game he hit his th homer and craig biggio was thrown out going for second on his th hit every time we do an update here that bonds hasnt broken hank aarons record its a good day write to carl bialik at carl bialik wsj com
