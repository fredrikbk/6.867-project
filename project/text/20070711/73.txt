min wage max politics the federal minimum wage went up on july and hardly anyone noticed and why should they have the federal minimum had been stuck at &# since while average hourly wages had risen nearly even entry wages at mcdonalds had crept above &# in the decade of legislative inaction so the bump from &# to &# was largely a nonevent the insignificance of the latest wage hike is surprising in view of the intensity of the political debates that preceded it liberal democrats had proclaimed that two million workers would benefit directly from a federal wage hike and millions more would benefit from bumping up the entire wage scale republicans warned that a legislated wage hike would cause a labor market apocalypse destroying the very entry level jobs that low income workers so desperately need to get a toehold on economic security the debate was always more about political posturing than economic reality an "effective" wage hike must actually raise someones wages with labor market wages already significantly above &# this "hike" was largely ineffective but what about those two million workers the democrats said would get a pay boost from the legislated wage increase it turns out that the u s labor department found only workers earning &# an hour in those minimum wage workers represented only of the million worker labor force and that was two years ago today the labor force is larger and the number of minimum wage workers smaller the other million workers cited by the democrats were actually earning less than &# in neither they nor their employers were breaking the law however thats because contrary to a popular impression the federal minimum doesnt apply to everyone the fair labor standards act contains a long list of exemptions including tipped employees seasonal recreation workers charitable organizations mom and pop businesses farm workers and samoan laborers and as the u s supreme court recently affirmed homecare workers are also exempt none of these workers got a pay raise thanks to the new minimum wage law this huge "uncovered" exempt segment of the labor force not only restrains the wage impacts that democrats promise but also obscures the disemployment effects that republicans project a worker displaced by a legislated wage hike at mcdonalds can take a waiter or busboy job in a sit down restaurant in the process uncovered employment becomes a substitute for increased unemployment the "beneficiary" of the legislated wage hike may actually experience a wage decline in the process as a result the true displacement effects of an effective minimum wage hike are not easily observed much less measured this phenomenon will become increasingly important as the second july and third july steps of legislated wage hikes creep into the "effective" range even then july however a federal minimum of &# will still not be very effective its no wonder then that few workers noticed much less celebrated this weeks hike in the minimum wage the only people celebrating are the politicians who are already proclaiming how they helped the poor low income worker mr schiller is professor of economics at american university and the author of "the economics of poverty and discrimination" prentice hall th edition see related letter "letters to the editor a tip on minimum wage and restaurant employees" wsj july
