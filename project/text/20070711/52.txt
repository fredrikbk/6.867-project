fresh approach familiar brands get a makeover questions for joe jacober company innovative brands llc title ceo if procter &amp gamble co the largest advertiser in the u s cant revive a brand what makes an entrepreneur think he can just ask joe jacober chief executive of innovative brands llc who is trying to revitalize two sluggish brands cast off last year by p&amp g sure deodorant and pert plus shampoo mr jacober joins a burgeoning group of consumer product veterans looking to overhaul well known but underperforming brands jettisoned by big companies including p&amp g unilever and colgate palmolive co after a stint at dial corp where mr jacober worked with the team that launched liquid dial he cut his marketing teeth on a number of entrepreneurial ventures including developing contact lens sportswear plastics and beauty businesses last year the year old mr jacober took the ceo post at innovative brands which is owned by private investment firm najafi cos innovative brands last month launched its first ad campaigns for sure and pert plus mr jacober discusses the challenges and considerations involved in making an old brand new again the wall street journal when you are shopping for brands to acquire what characteristics do you look for mr jacober no is consumer awareness were not buying new to the world products or turnaround businesses were buying brands that consumers have some understanding of but the message may not be clearly articulated anymore secondly we look for brands that already have distribution in retailers and third it has to have some sort of upside potential with the opportunity to be a niche in its category were not going to buy a brand from procter &amp gamble thats going to compete head on with them they wouldnt sell it and we dont want to take on procter &amp gamble wsj what are the advantages in buying an already established brand rather than starting a new one mr jacober the risk of launching a new brand is so high but when i invest in brands like pert plus or sure which consumers do know about there can be more leverage in taking those brands to another level through marketing for example obviously the large companies when they hit it out of the park get great returns on developing new names but having worked with new products at large companies i also know how much they spend on new products that never see the light of day wsj what can you do for pert plus and sure that p&amp g couldnt mr jacober we look at it as a niche approach procter looks at how they will get a large market share across a large group of people we look at how we can target a particular niche think of it as a dartboard the concentric rings of a dartboard in procter &amp gambles world their target is the whole dartboard our world is the two inner circles we start with existing users and then go after all the lapsed users we dont go outside those circles until we think weve owned the inner ones thats an advantage of companies like ours we can focus on those two inner circles with a message thats meaningful wsj is reviving a brand just about marketing or must product changes also come into play mr jacober i think its a combination making sure people fully understand your brand message is important but we also have to make sure that were aligned from a product standpoint with pert plus we have to evaluate whether we have the right versions and whether there are people who want pert plus with something else like a deep conditioning for example wsj shampoo is a fiercely competitive category dominated by giant players what opportunity do you see in owning pert plus mr jacober pert plus is a two in one shampoo and conditioner and we see it more as a convenience product than a salon treatment it doesnt mean that people who use pert plus dont care about how they look they do but theyre not going to put the time into it that someone coming from a salon treatment perspective does our story to retailers is that this niche is very important to their business if you look at the category anywhere from to of all users out there fall into what we call "limited effort " they arent about buying the cheapest brand they want to look good but theyre not willing to put a lot of time into it its a niche the big guys arent going to worry about because its too small for them but its important enough that as a smaller company we can be very successful with it wsj what common marketing missteps do people make when theyre trying to bring back a brand mr jacober the biggest misstep is when they try to interject their own opinions into what consumers want if you dont truly understand how consumers receive your brand or if you try to make it be something its not thats a huge misstep you have to find out where the strength of that particular brand is wsj sure deodorant had a powerful slogan "raise your hand if youre sure " in developing your new ad campaign was that memorable slogan constraining why did you tweak it mr jacober i dont think we were confined at all it was a clear way the consumer could connect with the brand but with the new slogan "raise your hand ur sure " we are trying to update it the old slogan was a relatively innocuous statement at this point and it became a claim made by several different antiperspirants the new one is a confident message this consumer doesnt get caught up in their antiperspirant they just know that it is going to work wsj some say one of the problems with sure is that it targeted both men and women at a time when other leading deodorants were gender specific like so many other personal care products are these days why keep sure gender neutral mr jacober people who use sure dont want to be defined by the way their deodorant smells a lot of brands in the category have a heavy fragrance like fruity or sporty the sure user just wants one that will work and then they can add their own perfume on top of it or stay unscented rather than smelling like your deodorant you get to smell like yourself if you ask male and female sure users they dont look at it as a mens or womens product my personal belief is that the men versus women thing was generated by the marketers and not by the consumer secret does a great job with their idea of being "made for a woman " but having an antiperspirant thats effective regardless of your gender is a pretty compelling statement as well
