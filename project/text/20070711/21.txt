business bookshelf caught in a web of comment the new influencers by paul gillin quill driver pages &# in late october mark russinovich an expert on computer operating systems was surprised to find evidence of hidden software on his computer after much sleuthing he discovered that sony bmg music entertainment had put software on its music cds that silently installed itself without asking the customers permission to cloak itself and avoid detection the software modified the windows operating system in doing so it made the computer vulnerable to certain kinds of viruses moreover the software couldnt be un installed when he deleted the files mr russinovich found that he had crippled his cd drive he was irked there the matter might have ended except that mr russinovich was a blogger he posted an account of his discovery within hours someone had submitted his entry to the internet roundup sites boingboing net and digg com which in turn spread the word that evening the story hit the popular information technology site slashdot org hundreds of upset readers went to mr russinovichs site and left comments many pledging never to buy sony products again matters became worse for sony bmg one of those commenters said that she had run tests and found that the software was communicating with the company over the internet it seemed that the software was transmitting the identity of the cds that the users were listening to mr russinovich corroborated the report with his own tests shortly after and blogged about them major media organizations quickly picked up the story facing a full blown scandal sony bmg announced a recall of the cds in mid november and also was hit with several class action lawsuits other goliaths have also taken a hard knock on the head from this new democratic medium among them microsoft which announced last week that it will spend more than &# billion on free extended warranties following complaints about the unreliability of its xbox game console but blogs of course arent only a vehicle for complaints they recount events propel debate and lavish praise too some two in five internet users in the u s read blogs according to a pew survey giving citizen commentators the potential for more influence than ever how then should companies deal with the world of blogs as well as podcasts social network sites such as facebook and other "social media" that question is at the center of "the new influencers " written by former computerworld editor paul gillin mr gillins primary focus is blogs for him this community is as much a lockean as a hobbesian one true blogs have no standards organizations or governing bodies but there are norms nonetheless enforced socially rather than bureaucratically bloggers for instance are expected to credit their sources with a link if possible and to highlight revisions to their posts instead of making them furtively from a corporate pr point of view mr gillin says amateur bloggers differ greatly from journalists in both substance and style for one thing they are free of the newsroom rule to seek both sides of a story though often the old media seem to follow it more in form than in substance looking at a study comparing coverage of wal mart by bloggers and by traditional media mr gillin observes that bloggers were far more likely to write on the basis of personal experiences with the stores when they did weigh in on broader matters e g wal marts economic or environmental effects they were vastly more negative than their old media counterparts even so mr gillin makes a persuasive case for companies reaching out to bloggers a strategy that political campaigns and film studios have pioneered consumers are increasingly turning away from print media skipping tv commercials and ignoring s style cost per thousand banner ads but they are still seeking information and many are embracing social media as in the sony bmg case moreover blogs can help a message make the inter species jump from ordinary citizens to journalists mr gillin notes a few key rules for a marketer trying to win coverage from bloggers assume they are knowledgeable as avid enthusiasts tend to be be frank about negative information they will react badly if they feel theyve been deceived by half truths and be available to respond to questions nearly around the clock when should firms wade into the blogosphere themselves not every company or ceo needs a blog apple synonymous with hipness doesnt have one but often enough a company blog makes sense as a way of telling a companys side of a debate google and verizon for example both maintain blogs to present their views on public policy matters such as broadband regulation blogs also allow firms to keep up a connection with a fervent customer base as southwest airlines does with "nuts about southwest " an outlet to which many employees contribute and then of course company blogs can serve a more fundamental purpose selling my own favorite is that of thomas mahon a savile row tailor whose blog englishcut com gives a broad view of the custom suit trade even as it drums up business for one small corner of it the salesmanship is deft and understated one of mr mahons highlighted entries even gives a supportive rundown of other savile row houses for me buying new suits is a chore and normally i would never even consider a custom made one but a few minutes on mr mahons blog makes me feel as if i really should get myself fitted for one of his &# and up products right away no make that two i feel lucky that this blog induced impulse has passed quickly so far mr price is a writer in washington
