beyond pokemon nintendo ds goes to school in japan game machine gets a lift from programs that turn it into a reference book kyoto japan every morning at eighth grade teachers at otokoyama higashi junior high school bring out plastic baskets stacked with electronic devices for minutes students use styluses to scrawl english words like "woman" and "tree" on touch screens electronic voices beep responses like "cool " if the children spell the word correctly and a mocking "come on " if they get it wrong the students are tapping away on nintendo co s ds videogame machine a portable device customarily reserved for games like pokemon and super mario bros "work sheets were such a pain " says minori yamanaka a year old student during a short break between classes "these exercises feel like a game " behind the fastest selling portable videogame player in japan is an unusual shift in the culture of gadgets people are clamoring for it not just for games but also to keep a household budget play the guitar and study the buddhist scripture heart sutra since its introduction in the ds which responds to writing and speech has spurred software makers to fill the japanese market with an eclectic array of reference guides digital books and study tools of the odd ds software titles released or in the works so far only about are traditional videogames nintendo is quick to license uses of its ds device which is also sold in the u s so long as they arent violent or otherwise objectionable most of the software isnt available overseas though nintendo has released a few products like a "brain training" quiz game called brain age and says it is considering releasing more game publishers believe the trend will eventually move outside japan based in kyoto nintendo has sold nearly million ds units in japan more than triple the sales of rival sony corp s playstation portable according to market research firm enterbrain co more than of the ds units were bought by people who dont think of themselves as videogame users enterbrain said electronic arts inc a u s publisher best known for graphically rich fast action games like "madden nfl" and the "need for speed" racing series is now tiptoeing into the world of references launching this month in japan the first of a three part series on wine sake and cocktails electronic arts says it is considering a version on wines for the french market nintendo officials also riding the success of the wii videogame console introduced last november say they are still committed to games "the popularity of the ds shows that the line between entertainment and education is getting blurry but consumers are still buying games like brain age because theyre fun so its still the entertainment factor that is important " says spokesman yasuhiro minagawa nintendos big rival sony isnt following the ds into books and references sony is trying to attract new game users to its playstation portable machines with easy to play games such as virtual tennis it says it will continue to focus on games that show off its high quality screen and advanced technology ds which stands for dual screen marked nintendos first attempt before the wii to lure customers who werent big game players unlike the companys gameboy games which asked players children mainly to dexterously use a plus shaped control pad and buttons while peering into a small screen the ds was easier to use with voice recognition technology and two big screens one of which recognizes handwriting adults began to take interest when nintendo released the quiz game brain age which was designed to stimulate rusty minds with a daily quiz that tests reflexes memorization and speed arithmetic a subsequent english dictation game that helps improve listening and spelling cemented the demand for a new genre of ds software "who would have thought an english game would be a million seller " says nintendos mr minagawa soon a slew of other software companies caught on to the idea and came out with their own versions of nongame software one early ds fan was yukimitsu hayashi an assistant manager in kyotos yawata school district which now uses the ds in its four junior high schools he thought the device had qualities that might make it an appealing educational tool such as a built in microphone and handwriting recognition whats more it cost less than &# a relative bargain compared with computers so it seemed affordable to classrooms there was another big advantage it was teacher friendly despite japans reputation as a gadget loving nation many schools including those in yawata were surprisingly dependent on paper many teachers found computers to be a nuisance because they required preparing extra lessons and moving children to a computer room some were even intimidated by the computers but the ds could be used briefly and in the classroom and it cut down on paperwork "its not like were letting the students play games without supervision " mr hayashi says "i dont even consider them to be a game device its a tool " to avoid potential controversy mr hayashi introduced the device cautiously he secretly approached ie institute co a tokyo educational software concern about making an english vocabulary program a year and a half later mr hayashi showed the finished product to his colleagues and proposed a test educators including the principal of otokoyama higashi junior high where the trial was held last fall were impressed with the dss ability to pronounce words and quickly recognize letters that were written on the screen japans ministry of education is taking a reserved view of yawatas efforts it says it is up to each district to decide which teaching tools to use but hastens to add that the government isnt endorsing them still the results of the five month test have been impressive the school found that nearly of students who used the ds each day mastered junior high level competence in english vocabulary compared with just before about half of those students had developed th grade level abilities the school district is now testing other software for subjects like arithmetic and japanese
