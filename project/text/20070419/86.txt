politics &amp economics sarkozy taps french desire for security new focus fuels lead in presidential contest later backlash is a risk paris last month as french voters watched tv images of police firing tear gas and slamming youths to the ground to quell a riot presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy was fine tuning his campaign strategy "we need to be tougher " the candidate told aides according to one who was present mr sarkozy who holds a narrow lead heading into the first round of frances elections on sunday is frances mr security a rudy giuliani figure in a country that has seen a spate of violent rioting among its ranks of largely unemployed arab and black youths in recent years in four years as interior minister the year old mr sarkozy hired extra police and jailed hundreds of prostitutes just last year he deported some illegal immigrants he has matched that record with tough talk referring to the largely muslim youths who staged days of violent riots across france months ago as "scum " on the campaign trail mr sarkozy has been equally forceful he proposed lowering the age youths can be tried in regular courts to from suggested pedophilia is a birth defect and called for a ministry of immigration and national identity an idea that critics said recalled frances wartime vichy regime which was allied with the nazis as france like the rest of europe struggles to integrate its increasing mostly muslim immigrant community estimated to make up of the nations population mr sarkozy is seeking to capitalize on growing concerns about deteriorating security and social order indeed his campaigns focus on law and order has overshadowed the broader economic issues that many feel the next president must tackle such as a unemployment rate billowing public debt and declining competitiveness mr sarkozys aides say the shift toward security issues has played to their candidates strength he appears set to be one of the top two finishers in sundays balloting which would advance him to the second round of voting where he likely would face either socialist segolene royal or centrist francois bayrou some analysts suggest far right national front party leader jean marie le pen who reached the second round in the elections by campaigning on a stridently anti immigrant platform could sneak through again at the same time as french voters choose a new president for a five year term mr sarkozys tough guy persona is alienating some voters unaccustomed to hearing such brash rhetoric from a mainstream politician and helping keep the race competitive about a third of voters still claim to be undecided just days before the vote "sarkozy scares me " says caroline osta a college student from nice who works part time at a beauty parlor in paris indeed mr sarkozy is expected to tone down his language to appear more conciliatory in the lead up to the second round of voting set for may mr sarkozys polarizing nature speaks to a deeper paradox within french society the french love a coddling state that doles out generous welfare or efficient public transportation yet they often rebel against its authority in mr sarkozy voters see a man who is determined to use the powers of the state to get things done but they also wonder how he will use those levers jean francois cope frances budget minister and one of mr sarkozys closest aides concedes that some voters may be wary of the conservative candidate but he says "its because french people are aware that hes actually going to do the job and maybe take away some of their privileges " in france as throughout the continent the "flower power" uprisings are remembered with nostalgia and it is a rite of passage for students to take to the streets in protest of national or international injustices french politicians have generally recoiled at the first sign of conflict in then prime minister jacques chirac withdrew a bill on college funding when a young man called malik oussekine was beaten up by police during a protest and died the incident has since haunted mr chirac who last year as president revoked a labor overhaul bill when students took to the streets mr sarkozy however is promising to govern with a firmer hand than his predecessor that has been the secret of his success thus far but is also at the root of the anxieties about him during the campaign mr sarkozy has threatened to cut frances bloated state bureaucracy saying civil servants would no longer be selected on their knowledge of "the princess of cleves " a th century novel the promises have alarmed civil servants in cradle to grave jobs with generous pension plans "sarkozy makes civil servants anxious in a way that is very similar to former british prime minister margaret thatcher in the s " says jean francois sirinelli director of the historical research department at pariss institut detudes politiques some see that as an aspect of an irascible personality that doesnt take criticism well when french left leaning newspaper liberation published an article questioning mr sarkozys tax returns the candidate phoned liberations leading shareholder and described the daily with a vulgarity according to edouard de rothschild the shareholder asked earlier this week whether he was excited mr sarkozy answered "excitement is not for the powerful " critics say mr sarkozys tough policies as interior minister have created even deeper rifts in society and not only between frances mostly white majority and the mostly muslim residents of the impoverished suburbs left wing politicians in particular point to a sense of distrust and disconnect between police and large swaths of the population mr sarkozy started the campaign last year by addressing business issues positioning himself between free market and state intervention he promised to introduce flexibility in the short time workweek regime and lower taxes for companies but insisted the government should support key strategic industries "sarkozy is not entirely liberal hes trying to achieve a fair balance " says jean michel fourgous a lawmaker for mr sarkozys center right ump party and founder of a small software business but as the campaign gathered speed earlier this year mr sarkozy began to make security and immigration the theme of his speeches critics say that his audacious proposal to create a ministry of immigration and national identity however stretched his credibility as a mainstream candidate mr sarkozys move was carefully orchestrated to draw in voters of the national front the far right party of mr le pen electorally mr sarkozys move made sense the anti immigration sentiments behind mr le pens strong showing in still thrive and were exacerbated by the violent rioting of the countrys suburbs in "in france when you use the word immigration people hear blacks and arabs not finns and swedes " said former equal opportunity minister azouz begag who describes himself as french of arab origin "his proposal for a ministry of immigration and national identity means i will protect france from african immigration " mr sarkozy has responded that he isnt "a racist" and that his objective is to fetch national front voters "one by one" to bring them back into the republican arena nonetheless there already are indications mr sarkozy will soften his tone if he makes it to the second round his just released book is entitled "ensemble " or "together " and in an interview last week with le figaro newspaper he promised "if i get through to the second round i will lead a different campaign "
