the speaker and her speaking to dictators mideast tour in response to robert turner "illegal diplomacy " editorial page april who suggests that speaker nancy pelosi may have committed a felony under the logan act when she went to syria in the more than years since the enactment of the logan act there has never been a prosecution against anyone much less a member of congress article i section of the constitution the speech and debate clause clearly trumps any attempt under the act to criminalize a members speech in pursuit of her duties and even the state department when sen george mcgovern went to cuba in opined that nothing in the law restricts members of congress "from engaging in discussions with foreign officials in pursuance of their legislative duties under the constitution " christopher wolf washington ms pelosis trip implemented the harmful baker hamilton commission recommendation for talks without preconditions diplomacy toward a terrorist state cannot involve conflict resolution or "just talk to them" methods because an independent syria must no longer submit to western logic and definitions of meaningful interactions this adversary and those african asian cultures we seek as allies exist in worlds where assassination terrorism and genocide dominate political agendas the state department has designated syria a terrorist state a u n war crimes tribunal is currently investigating assads link to the assassination of lebanon prime minister rafik hariri syria provides safe haven and conduits for foreign fighters who kill civilians and our soldiers in iraq sponsorship of hamas and hezbollah provides syria with tools to disrupt lebanons struggle toward democracy and seek israels extinction for these and other behaviors syria elicits from the u s a policy containment through isolation also applied against libya which returned to the international community as it renounced terrorism and wmds broadly representative government provides the antidote to infection by terrorist heresies and brings final victory in the global war on terror however choosing representative government over alliances with malevolent factions requires extraordinary personal risks deliberations favoring such risks demand allies who consistently reject and isolate expressions of totalitarian force the pelosi assad photo ops and sound bites damage our reliability by seeming to accommodate terrorism and criminality within the spectrum of international propriety governments must then reluctantly accommodate those elements within their cultures nolan nelson eugene ore whenever a presidents defenders become defensive or embarrassed about a foreign policy that has become either incoherent or unpopular the logan act is dragged out from behind john adamss tombstone to be wielded like a clove of garlic against those who might have the temerity to speak to foreign leaders without parroting what the president is saying maybe as robert f turner implies a "legal" congressional "fact finding trip" involves members of congress wandering mute and sheeplike through a country without venturing an independent opinion to anyone in charge on anything more substantive than the quality of the lamb kebab somehow given the garrulousness and egotism of almost everyone who runs for public office i doubt it according to mr turner speaker pelosi said the following to the syrian dictator "we came in friendship hope and determined that the road to damascus is a road to peace " lets assume for the sake of argument that the logan act could constitutionally be applied to ms pelosis statement and that syrias bashar assad is such an ignorant boob that he is unaware that a house speaker whose party has only a slim majority has very little to say about a presidents foreign policy how then was ms pelosis statement supposed to "influence the measures or conduct of government in relation to any disputes or controversies with the united states" it seems to me that the only response that ms pelosis statement would elicit would be the suggestion that she hire a better speechwriter although to be fair her allusion to st pauls conversion while possibly missed by her hosts certainly reflects her having received a quality catholic education i am not sure what if anything ms pelosi accomplished in her well meaning but somewhat naive middle east tour other than damage the u s headscarf industry but i would save the logan act for those who for example might try to influence another nations relations with the u s in order to sell weapons chasing after members of congress who tick off the president serves more to illuminate and emphasize the domestic political weakness of that president than it does to further the goals of american foreign policy barton l jacka san diego see related letter "letters to the editor was speakers mission to embarrass president " wsj april
