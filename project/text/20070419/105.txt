the duke of hazard the supreme courts newfound expertise in global warming burned through all the headlines earlier this month but another environmental decision handed down the same day may prove equally important the consequences will turn on the bush administrations response the case environmental defense v duke energy dealt with an arcane provision of the clean air act called new source review nsr requires new power utilities to install the most advanced pollution control technologies available existing plants are not obliged to upgrade without major physical changes at least that was how it worked for two decades until the clinton era environmental protection agency decreed that routine maintenance like replacing a steam duct or turbine blade triggered nsr improvements the move was redundant because the u s was already phasing out expensive mandates after revisions to the clean air act in favor of cap and trade where the market works out how to most efficiently meet pollution reduction goals the move was also a retroactive reinvention of the rules which is why the bush epa restored the original interpretation of nsr in while toughening emissions baselines in but fearing criticism of air quality "rollbacks " the administration allowed previous epa and justice department litigation against utilities to move forward such policy chaos was bound to end up at the high court in duke energy the court sought to determine how to measure an emissions increase when a "modification" is made to a facility as plants operate they deteriorate meaning they produce less power and also less emissions routine maintenance restores both to original capacity but no further the epa litigators argued it is proper to compare the immediate pre maintenance and post maintenance conditions and call the latter a "new source" of pollution even though it isnt the justices agreed this broad reading could create a situation where nearly any physical or operational activity at a power plant could set off the new source review process which can run to hundreds of millions of dollars keep in mind the industry is already operating under strict emissions caps and other air quality standards nsr is a back door for those who desire tougher environmental laws but find it too taxing to go to congress and ask for them the perversity is that nsr yields few actual advantages if power plants must always put into operation the most state of the art technology even if it is only slightly more advanced upgrades become ever more expensive with ever more diminishing returns in practice that means utilities have incentive to keep chugging along with deteriorating equipment which benefits the environment least of all the good news is that duke energy is by no means the final word disposing only of a single issue in this controversy meanwhile the court also affirmed that the epa retains its "customary agency discretion to resolve questions about the statutory definition" of nsr the bush administration then can continue to advance its market based policies first though it will need to resolve its nsr enforcement contradictions which it is expected to do shortly the decision has been delayed pending a decision in duke energy and the danger is that a weakened white house will capitulate to the career epa bureaucrats but given that the administration finds itself criticized for any environmental decision it makes in whatever shade of "green " the right thing to do is reject the old command and control environmental agenda and get on with more modern approaches
