a cautious rx for china drug shares government overhauls corruption probe weigh on listings for investors the chinese pharmaceutical sector is as fraught with risk as it is full of promise for now the best investment prescription may be caution a spate of chinese drug companies have listed shares in hong kong and new york this year and more plan to follow the activity underscores the companies hunger for fresh capital and demand from overseas investors for more ways to play the chinese market but a corruption investigation by the state food and drug administration chinas drug regulator has cast a cloud over the industry the probe together with continuing government efforts to overhaul the countrys health care system has hit some of the stocks and is likely to weigh on coming listings "a lot of investors think that the health care sector will boom " said vicky chen a ubs health care analyst in shanghai "i think in the long term its true but in the short term the sfda shake up and price controls by the government will all have an effect on the industry " analysts say investors betting on the fragmented sector cant really be sure they have sided with the winners which might be shaken out in an industry consolidation there are no official statistics on how many of chinas odd drug makers seriously invest in upstream research that could eventually produce blockbuster medicines said cai renhua dean and professor at shanghai jiaotong university medical school it is in short a buyer beware market in recent months the sfda has been slower to approve new drugs after the government found evidence that officials had taken bribes from some companies to approve their drug applications china also is grappling with a severely underfunded health care system in which many doctors and hospitals raise their incomes by overprescribing drugs to patients the government has pledged increased scrutiny of which drugs hospitals are subscribing and in what quantities the measures are affecting sales growth in chinas pharmaceutical market which ims a drug market research firm in fairfield conn put at &# billion in it said growth slowed last year to from more than the

universitys medical school said margins for generics makers are so slim that the companies often compromise on quality if the government follows through on its pledge to impose stricter quality standards many of these companies could be forced out of business he said "the upside is that any generic drug maker in china is bound to make money " mr cai says "the downside is that there is plenty
