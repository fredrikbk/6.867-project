long hard journey from the pen of frank lloyd wright to hawaii one day in frank lloyd wright heard the doorbell ring at his suite in new yorks plaza hotel and found marilyn monroe standing in the doorway she and her new bridegroom the playwright arthur miller wanted the architect to build them a bucolic haven as shelter from the cyclone of celebrity as it happened wright already had just the ticket a luxury manor hed designed eight years earlier for a wealthy texas couple but that never was built three years later he proposed it to a mexican government official whod asked for a house on the cliffs above acapulco and again it fizzled finally for the glamorous couple wright hauled out his twice stymied plans and added a movie theater swimming pool and nursery to produce a design for a square foot house near roxbury conn but the monroe miller marriage collapsed a few months later wright died shortly after that and the blueprints wound up in an archive at taliesin west wrights arizona winter retreat and school eventually however wrights creation did get built on the hawaiian island of maui and it has just been reincarnated as a home for hawaiian art as well as golf in tonia baney a portrait artist whod co founded a maui advertising agency was having lunch with a honolulu ad agency owner sandy sims and the conversation turned to a shared passion the architecture of frank lloyd wright mr sims had obtained a license from the frank lloyd wright foundation to construct a collection of unbuilt wright designs on the big island of hawaii "why not build them on maui " ms baney said a distant relative of wrights whod grown up near his wisconsin hometown she had been involved in the islands arts scene for years including the creation of the maui arts and cultural center its major patron was masaru "pundy" yokouchi a baker turned realtor whose investing in commercial property brought him an immense fortune and political clout yokouchi who died last november at age chaired the state arts and culture foundation for a dozen years and headed other arts and business groups ms baney asked him if he knew anyone who might be interested in bringing an unbuilt wright creation to maui of course he did the japanese had a special fondness for wrights work which was heavily influenced by asian art and architecture his celebrated imperial hotel was the only major building to survive the big tokyo quake of alas it was demolished in yokouchi was a partner with some japanese investors who were scouting maui for a golf property they flew to taliesin west to see what drawings might be suitable taliesins john rattenbury suggested the miller monroe manse and a deal was soon struck but obstacles loomed the golf club would need five times more space than the original plan provided and how could a building first designed for the texas prairie then the mexican coast and finally rural connecticut fit a hawaiian mountainside mr rattenbury the architect of record solved the first problem by placing two thirds of the square foot structure underground while preserving wrights original proportions above and the desert rose painted concrete buildings graceful curves somehow nestle comfortably amid the rolling fairways and against the scalloped mountainous backdrop granted a bottomless budget and a mandate for authenticity mr rattenbury brought in craftsmen with experience in wright projects he also designed the interior adornments including art glass features incorporating wrights abstract geometric patterns the square foot main dining room offers a degree view and is capped by a foot dome with a foot skylight the curving interior walls wide porthole windows and other details contribute to the soft organic feeling throughout and the clubhouse evokes the simultaneous sensation of spaciousness and intimacy that characterizes wrights best work after the original investors spent more than &# million to develop the clubhouse and two golf courses the club opened in may its &# million clubhouse boasted an expansive pro shop banquet meeting rooms and in the mens locker room a japanese furo bath with soaking pool and seated showers offering spectacular views of hookipa bay on the left and maaleaea bay to the right and facing the haleakela volcano that dominates the horizon the club seemed to have at last fulfilled wrights vision but japans economic slide quickly took its toll the original owners sold the country club six months after it opened and the course closed in enter another tokyo tycoon golf lover and part time maui resident makoto kaneko every time hed fly over the defunct acre course and country club the engineering magnate fumed what a shame to let such a beautiful place lie fallow in mr kanekos mmk maui company bought the property for &# million and embarked on a &# million overhaul of the clubhouse and courses he also renamed the club after king kamehameha who united the islands in the mid s mr kaneko insisted that he wanted to honor traditional hawaiian culture but attaching the name of one of hawaiis most venerated monarchs to an enclave mostly used by wealthy white and japanese golfers infuriated many native hawaiians "i applaud his desire to honor kamehameha but in traditional culture we do not put our names on buildings thats another cultures concept imposed upon the native hawaiian culture " says hokulani holt padilla cultural programs director at the macc moreover kamehameha wasnt from maui which he conquered in his campaign to rule all of hawaii to ensure cultural authenticity mr kanekos company hired clifford naeole as a cultural liaison one of mr naeoles ancestors had saved the infant kamehameha from assassination and mr naeole assured concerned native hawaiians that he would likewise protect the kings legacy mr naeole says that mr kaneko displayed deep respect for hawaiian traditions first he created an ahu an altar at the crossroads between the two courses visible to everyone who drives up to the courthouse native hawaiians can use it as a place to honor their ancestors and practice their religion the clubs managers participated in its blessing ceremony drinking kava made from coconuts grown in a sacred part of maui and pledging to respect and honor all things hawaiian mr naeole also devised a course in hawaiian culture and history for all employees "he was able to bring a level of hawaiian culture to the golf course and thats good " ms holt padilla says "but that doesnt absolve them of the presumptuousness of taking the chiefs name " shes happier that the new owners commissioned work from some of hawaiis finest artists except for ms baneys striking portrait of wright which now sits above the main staircase the clubs previous incarnation was distinguished by lots of photos of monroe now the entry gallery is dominated by painter herb kawainnui kanes colorful by foot mural depicting a gathering of mauis legendary chiefs resplendent in red and gold feather capes a multicolored feathered cape by jo anne kahanamoku sterling hangs nearby dale zerrella sculpted three koa wood and two bronze statues including a figure of a traditional healer surrounded by hawaiian medicinal plants fiber artist puani van dorpe created a series of exquisite mulberry paper baby blankets her interpretations were based on patterns specific to each of the kings predecessors much like a scottish tartan framed in native koa wood the kapa moe are accompanied by a genealogy chart and explanation of each chiefs historical significance outside a yellow traffic sign depicting a mama bird and goslings cautions drivers to yield to nene geese hawaiis state bird a rock garden features boulders arranged to resemble the hawaiian islands seen from the air a spiral outdoor staircase surmounts a water feature with four descending streams merging into a fountain representing the four valleys the area is named after and their unification by the clubs namesake mr kaneko dropped the price of memberships to a little over a tenth of the &# the previous owners charged hoping to attract as many locals as second homers alice cooper and dennis hopper visited during my tour mr naeole says that he intends to conduct cultural programs for the public the clubhouses main level is available to the public for weddings meetings and banquets and the clubs director of golf operations and memberships rick castillo says the club may host scheduled tours when demand warrants hes already explained wrights legacy and hawaiian art and culture to a group of schoolchildren and their parents "they have a national treasure there and its in a dream setting " taliesens mr rattenbury says "it would be wonderful if they can make it available to anyone who wants to see it " mr campbell is a writer and critic in portland ore
