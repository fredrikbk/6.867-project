local contractor new rebuilding plan in tikrit iraq a few weeks ago lt col james foster strode through a newly renovated courthouse here and cursed loudly the iraqi police who worked on the building had torn holes into several walls haphazardly leaving piles of broken bricks and debris on the floor in a room meant to become a judges office water spilled from a broken sink the buildings entrance hall was crammed with iraqi police recruits who had turned it into a makeshift barracks col foster a reservist temporarily assigned to a state department team called over the iraqi engineer running the project and told him to redo the shoddy repairs "we cant build this for you " he snapped that point is at the core of the latest american vision for rebuilding iraq and of tension within the bush administration over how to do it the state department is trying to push more responsibility for reconstruction onto the iraqi government the pentagon believes in keeping projects under american control and completing them quickly to win the loyalty of the iraqis both approaches have run into difficulties and its not clear if either will be more effective than the administrations initial reconstruction push which relied heavily on halliburton co bechtel group inc and other large american contractors that &# billion effort was a flop amid poor oversight widespread mismanagement and corruption in hopes of finding a new way the state department in late began setting up small teams assigned to work in individual iraqi provinces and coordinate small projects that are funded by the iraqi government and carried out by iraqi companies "what we want to do is change the mind set that the u s will solve every problem for them " said stephanie miley who was head of the team working on the courthouse and col fosters boss until march "we dont want the iraqis to wake up and see that their sewage doesnt work and have their first thought be the coalition will fix this for us we want them to do it themselves " the provincial reconstruction teams or prts have been hampered by security problems and difficult relations with iraqi officials some of whom are corrupt or incompetent as a result the joint u s iraqi projects proceed fitfully if at all ms miley and other senior state department officials argue that the provincial teams can lead reconstruction projects in areas of iraq that are too dangerous for private sector western contractors to operate in they also say the provincial teams can get more bang out of the remaining reconstruction funds by hiring iraqi firms to carry out the work rather than relying on more expensive u s and european companies many u s military commanders however think that the state departments approach is wrong for a country as violent as iraq the militarys own reconstruction effort takes a different approach funding the projects it takes on and overseeing the work itself the pentagon believes this is the best way to show iraqis there are clear benefits to backing the u s and not insurgents or terrorists "you need to knock out the small quick projects or else the iraqis just give up on the process " says maj christina nagy a civil affairs officer from the nd airborne division here staffing problems also have caused bad blood between the state department and the pentagon it is hard to recruit civilians to serve on prt teams and the state department often fills out its teams with military officers in february the state department officials asked the pentagon to send additional military personnel to iraq for as long as six months to serve on the new provincial teams the request infuriated defense secretary robert gates although he approved it "it is illustrative of the difficulty of getting other agencies to provide people on a timely basis " mr gates complained to lawmakers at the time the state departments approach got a high profile endorsement on march when president bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice hosted a meeting at the white house with several leaders of reconstruction teams the following day the u s said veteran state department officials would be leaving for iraq to create new reconstruction teams doubling the number of prts there to the first prts were established in afghanistan in november and were credited with some success there three years later ms rice traveled to the northern iraqi city of mosul to inaugurate the first iraqi provincial reconstruction team at the time the u s was backing away from the idea of leaving reconstruction to halliburton and other big u s companies billions of dollars spent on private contractors had gone missing leaving iraqs electricity and water systems far below their prewar conditions "the era of big construction indeed of reconstruction with a capital r is over " david satterfield the top state department official on iraq told reporters in february ms mileys team began operating here in the salahaddin province in april and is currently working with the iraqi government on the new terrorism courthouse and approximately other projects including farmers markets and food warehouses a former peace corps volunteer ms miley spent years in the foreign service mostly working in economics related posts she met her husband a u s military officer when they were both deployed to the united nations peacekeeping mission in egypts sinai desert in the s she spent five months in iraq in working at the coalition provincial authority and then at the mammoth u s embassy in baghdad last spring she returned to iraq to take the helm of the provincial advisory team here "my mother always pushes me to do the london paris rome circuit but i like getting my hands dirty " she said with a laugh "i dont do well in cubicles " in tikrit ms miley works out of a small office on the second floor of a former iraqi air force building located on what is now contingency operating base speicher a sprawling u s facility that has hour coffee shops burger king and subway fast food restaurants after arriving in salahaddin last april ms miley and her colleagues ran into an immediate problem most of the iraqi officials they were supposed to work with wanted nothing to do with them the local u s military commander army col michael steele a special forces veteran had tense relations with local iraqis because of his aggressive use of military power which is a central focus in the ongoing criminal trial of four of his men for allegedly murdering three iraqi detainees the iraqis greeted ms miley and her colleagues with skepticism and outright hostility "all the doors were shut to us we couldnt get any meetings and iraqis went out of their way to ignore us " says lt col john bayer a member of the prt over time the provincial governor hamad hamoud al shakti took a strong personal liking to ms miley who he says reminded him of his wife amira al rabei a prominent doctor here the two women quickly became friends but last july insurgents detonated a bomb in dr rabeis medical office last july killing her instantly "her death was devastating to me " ms miley says ms mileys connection to mr shakti has helped open doors but security concerns still frustrated efforts to get projects going impromptu meetings with iraqis have proved all but impossible visits to project sites are complicated by the need for military protection ms mileys personnel can only venture into tikrit and other nearby cities a few times a week and they always travel in convoys of at least three armored humvees protected by heavily armed u s military personnel trips are regularly scrapped at the last minute because of gunfire or roadside bombs and several military members of the team have been wounded in insurgent ambushes due to safety concerns many of the teams iraqi counterparts spend extended periods of time out of the country mr shakti for instance speaks defiantly of never bowing to the insurgents who killed his wife he says insurgents have tried to assassinate him times but u s officials say he spends at least as much time in dubai and jordan as he does in iraq the security restrictions have hampered provincial teams across iraq an october audit by the special inspector general for iraq reconstruction stuart bowen found that just four of the state departments main and auxiliary prt offices then in operation were "generally able" to function effectively and recommended closing the offices in the bloody basra and anbar provinces entirely ms mileys prt has also faced criticism from u s military commanders while mr miley has been trying to build a courthouse the military has been building a string of new greenhouses across the province the greenhouses are to include adjacent plots of land where iraqi farmers can experiment with different types of crops the idea for the greenhouses originated with iraqi agricultural officials but the army isnt relying on the iraqi government to fund or manage the project instead the greenhouses are being purchased with american money and the nd airborne division is in charge of hiring the iraqi contractor and overseeing the actual construction work "you need to grab the low hanging fruit " says capt dan cederman a civil affairs officer for the nd airborne division "you need to knock down some short quick goals to show the iraqis they have something to gain " during a recent meeting in a heavily fortified building here with an iraqi agricultural official capt cederman said he was thinking of hiring a new local contractor for the project because the current contractor was moving too slowly "i really want to get the ball rolling on this " capt cederman tells the iraqi official "the prt folks with the best of intentions see the long term goal but dont really know the steps to get there " capt cederman says after the iraqi leaves the room "iraqis are out of patience and who can blame them " members of the state departments provincial teams acknowledge the risks of focusing on long term solutions to iraqs manifold problems but they argue that the militarys approach runs the risk of deepening the iraqi governments dependence on the u s ms miley says that the military may end up building schools or health clinics that the iraqi government has no intention of supporting with money of its own for staff salaries supplies and other operating expenses in a nearby town a u s civil affairs team built a water treatment plant in september but the provincial water ministry because the plant had been built without its approval refused to provide certain chemicals and spare parts for the facility u s officials said when the military went back to the town in december it found that the plant had fallen into disrepair military officials say repairing it will now cost at least &# in new u s money "id love to just snap my fingers and get things as fast as possible " said ms miley who remains in iraq "but the projects wont work unless the iraqis have bought into keeping them alive " prt personnel acknowledge however that even firm commitments from the iraqi government are not always enough to ensure that projects are completed the new courthouse for terrorism related cases for instance has been in the works for half a year the idea originated last october with col foster and andrew norman a federal prosecutor from baltimore who is part of ms mileys team the salahaddin province desperately needs the new courthouse suspects believed to have ties to insurgent groups are regularly released because there is no place to put them on trial still it took col foster and mr norman months to persuade local iraqi politicians to go along with the project and agree on a workable location in the end the u s and iraqi officials settled on an unused portion of an iraqi military facility housed here which was already fortified by several walls and guarded by iraqi security personnel in december the iraqis promised to cover the costs of renovating the decrepit buildings into workable courtrooms pretrial detention cells and judges chambers in exchange the u s agreed to buy new furniture and computers in late february however the iraqis reversed course and asked the u s to also pay for the electric work at the site when the u s personnel visited the site a few days later col foster discovered much of the repair work was poorly done hunched over the hand drawn blueprints for the site col foster pointed to a long series of mistakes from doorways that were bricked in for no apparent reason to a wall that was left up even through it was supposed to have been torn down the iraqi engineer overseeing the work nodded his head and said he will ensure the work is done correctly "it will take maybe two days to start again with no more problems " he told the americans after the iraqis left col foster pulled a colleague aside and told him that he has little confidence in the iraqis "they tell you what you want to hear and then they drag their feet " he said "its one of the little games they play " prt personnel are now considering abandoning the building and finding a new site for the courthouse
