the evening wrap gonzales on the hill online edition attorney general alberto gonzales returned to capitol hill for another round of testimony on the u s attorneys uproar in an attempt to clear up conflicting statements made by himself and former aides about the attorneys firings and to save his job at the hearings start mr gonzales declared that nothing improper had taken place in the firing of the eight federal prosecutors that their terminations had been justified and that while the process had been bungled the "resignations" of the prosecutors "should stand " he also played down his own involvement in the affair to the incredulity of some lawmakers "we have to evaluate whether you are really being forthright " said sen arlen specter ranking republican on the senate judiciary committee democrats sharply questioned mr gonzales over what they say are his many inconsistent and contradictory statements sen edward kennedy questioned mr gonzaless assertion that though he had little to do with the process he stood by the dismissals "since you apparently knew very little about the performance about the replaced attorneys how can you testify that the judgment ought to stand " mr kennedy inquired mr gonzales told california democratic sen dianne feinstein that he had not reviewed the records of the fired attorneys the justice department has said that all eight had been dismissed for performance reasons "most of this is a stretch " sighed sen lindsey graham the south carolina republican "its clear to me that some of these people just had personality conflicts with people in your office or the white house and the administration made up reasons to fire them " it was clear from the outset of the hearing that mr gonzales was facing a rough ride and the questioning got bumpier as the long and still unfolding proceedings progressed sen patrick leahy the committee chairman pressed mr gonzales over the move to dismiss david iglesias in new mexico he also asked the attorney general as to when he decided to go through with dismissing the prosecutors mr gonzales said he didnt remember sen chuck schumer tore into mr gonzales over the firing of u s attorney for san diego carol lam whom the administration says was let go because of her shortcomings with regards to immigration enforcement mr schumer asked the attorney general whether ms lam had ever been informed that there were problems with her immigration enforcement performance both ms lam and former gonzales aide kyle sampson had earlier testified that she wasnt so informed mr gonzales said that ms lam "was aware that there was concern" and that members of congress had complained but said that perhaps she hadnt been told that if she didnt beef up her immigration cases "there will be a change " mr gonzales said that he didnt remember the reasons for firing daniel bogden of las vegas and margaret chiara of michigan the attorneys are political appointees serving at the pleasure of the president as has been so often repeated recently and the administration has the right to remove them as it sees fit but by offering imprecise and conflicting statements about the circumstances surrounding the dismissals the justice department has allowed the attorneys matter to mushroom into a four alarm political fire now mr gonzaless future is hanging in the balance despite the blunt questioning from the committee mr gonzales seated alone at a table as cameras whirred didnt seem to be any closer to seeking the eject button mr gonzales said "the moment i believe i can no longer be effective i will resign as attorney general " during the opening statements by lawmakers mr gonzales frequently knitted his brow or shook his head in disagreement president bush has stood by mr gonzales and spokeswoman dana perino said today that "the president has full confidence in the attorney general " but even stalwart republicans seem ready to see mr gonzales climb aboard the next bus out of town
