stock watch is burlington on the right track buffett bet lifts railroad bears worry about costs online edition buying railroads sounds like an investment strategy borrowed from monopoly but a play on burlington northern santa fe could just be the right move a boom in commodities in the past few years has boosted demand for rail services and some analysts think that demand is here to stay billionaire investor warren buffetts berkshire hathaway recently disclosed a stake in burlington northern the nations largest railway operator by market capitalization as well as stakes in two other unnamed north american railroads the move sent rail shares up sharply but other analysts say railroads are a slow growth industry and that after the buffett euphoria subsides burlington will look less attractive the stock closed up &# or at &# on thursday the bull case buffetted up when an investment is good enough for mr buffett investors often take heed confidence in railroads received "a significant boost" when berkshire disclosed its stake writes john kartsonas of citigroup burlington shares rose on april "buffett certainly got the rails moving again " writes john barnes of bb&amp t capital markets soon after argus research raised its price target on burlington stock to &# from &# "shares have been rising and we believe they still have meaningful long term upside potential "

writes j p morgans thomas wadewitz movable feast analysts say the ethanol boom and a high demand for coal for electricity generation are benefiting burlington in coal accounted for of burlingtons freight revenue and agricultural products &lt ndash&gt including grains and ethanol &lt ndash&gt accounted for "everyones giddy on ethanol and were looking at a bumper corn crop " says rick paterson of ubs investment research mr wadewitz sees less competition from the trucking industry which has been constrained in part because of a driver shortage and rising fuel prices which hurt trucks more than trains arguss mr tynan says coal demand would hold steady even if consumer spending were to slow adding "burlington has become less sensitive to economic cycles " running on time burlington has improved its infrastructure and is increasing the efficiency of its rail network analysts say randy cousins of bmo capital management says train speeds rose from last year despite some difficult conditions last winter "dwell" times roughly defined as time spent in the rail yard fell by last year burlington boosted capital spending by about to &# billion making strategic investments including some double and triple tracks two or three tracks on the same line increasing the amount of traffic that can run yards terminals and new locomotives says bank of americas scott flower edward wolfe of bear stearns also expects an advantageous regulatory environment for railroads in the future "as rail capacity is viewed increasingly favorably by the government for decongesting highways " the bear case too hot some analysts think burlingtons valuation is too high despite buffetts investment "sentiment will likely ebb and in our view most of the good news is now discounted in the stock " says ubss mr paterson who downgraded bni to "neutral" from "buy " the recent spike in rail share prices doesnt reflect industry fundamentals says credit suisses jason seidl who thinks there is less than a upside from the companys current valuation revenue growth looks likely to slow says analyst kevin kirkeby of standard &amp poors who calls railroads a "mature" industry mr kirkeby notes that revenue gains have exceeded in each of the past three years a level difficult to sustain he expects weak shipments of lumber and housing related materials in the first half of rising costs burlington has hired more engineers to operate its expanding fleet during a tight labor market a challenge for a railway trying to keep down costs standard &amp poors mr kirkeby expects operating margins to be "relatively flat as expected rises in labor expenses offset productivity gains " and fuel costs do hurt railroads to some extent mr cousins of bmo capital markets notes a "sharp increase in fuel costs" since the company issued first quarter earnings guidance arguss mr tynan expects first quarter operating expenses to rise by over the same period last year because of the effect of high fuel costs lbo derailed though lbo buzz has lifted railroad stocks several analysts say a buyout is unlikely barclays fixed income analyst melody vogelmann cites recent strong stock performance an annualized over the past three years stock buybacks and high valuation as reasons a buyout of burlington northern is improbable "loss of enthusiasm" for an lbo creates risk to stocks in the railroad
