a cultural conversation with michael white a professor musician passes new orleans jazz tradition on new orleans the fresh faced young man on a stool at the back of the sound cafe one thursday night in march just had to be a musician something in the way he nodded to the beat and studied the band gave him up sure enough year old sean roberts explained as he applauded a rousing blues that he was a trumpeter with the tbc brass band whose initials stand for "to be continued " the evening was a study in extending tradition for those onstage and in the audience the last in a series of weekly gigs this performance united clarinetist michael white with the hot a popular local brass band whose members range in age from to "were just trying to carry the torch of this music forward " hot trumpeter raymond williams said "to keep it burning in new orleans " with that he introduced dr white whose playing on this nights version of the classic "st james infirmary" was by turns sweet toned bluesy curled and dark hued a standard bearing musician bandleader and xavier university of louisiana professor dr white is at perhaps the foremost ambassador of new orleans traditional jazz an important link to second line parades and jazz funerals and to the heritage of the citys storied preservation hall these days dr white shuttles between houston to which he relocated after hurricane katrina and new orleans where he was born and raised and where he now keeps a trailer near his office at xavier in the floods he lost a personal archive of more than books and recordings many obscure transcriptions of music from jelly roll morton king oliver sidney bechet and other jazz pioneers vintage clarinets dating from the s to the s photographs concert programs and other memorabilia including used banjo strings and reeds tossed off by early th century musical heroes yet even before katrina dr white sensed a gradual fading away of the musical tradition of brass band players clad in white shirts ties and black banded caps playing everything from hymns and marches to blues and jazz always with swinging rhythms complex group improvisation and specific three trumpet harmonies "there was something about that sound " dr white said at his xavier office recalling the moment high school band director edwin hampton first played him a s recording of the olympia brass band there were more epiphanies to come the first funeral he played with trumpeter doc paulins brass band the recording he picked up on a whim by clarinetist george lewis that turned out to be his most profound discovery in the face of widespread loss and dislocation the cultural traditions of new orleans have assumed heightened significance the hot brass band has its own story of continuation in the face of tragedy one band member lost his legs in a horrific roadside accident not long after katrina hit and in january during a wave of violent crimes the groups year old snare drum player dinerral shavers was fatally shot by a teenager last year lee arnold the hot s manager approached dr white about the need for younger brass band musicians to connect with tradition bearers tuba player bennie pete the bands leader invited dr white to begin working with the group the result was a mixture of rehearsals performances and discussions of musical elements repertoire harmony dynamics as well as history and shared values in between sets at the sound cafe mr pete spoke of gaining from those sessions "answers to questions id never asked before " dr white whose conversations with wynton marsalis in the s led to jazz at lincoln center concerts focused on the music of morton bechet and louis armstrong is uniquely qualified to provide such answers through his work as a recording musician as leader of the original liberty jazz band and especially since in an endowed chair at xavier dedicated to "new orleans culture " dr white seeks to stimulate inquiry "initially new orleans jazz was a reflection of a way of life " he said as he peered over the jagged pile of books and cds atop his desk including the red notebook in which during the weeks following the hurricane he jotted down the names and whereabouts of colleagues "it spoke of the way people walk talk eat sleep dance drive think make jokes and dress but i dont think america ever truly understood new orleans culture because the mindset is so different here so that whole tradition was hidden from most of america " hidden even from dr white for much of his childhood though he was born in the ninth ward he moved with his family to a mostly white uptown neighborhood and attended school in a nearby black one "i later found out " he said "that on the weekends when i wasnt around the blocks around my school were alive with social aid &amp pleasure club parades and jazz funerals " most of the so called new orleans jazz dr white heard on the radio and in school was the more commercialized dixieland "its as if you were from italy " he said "and someone was telling you that pizza hut is your authentic cuisine " he sensed there was "something more something special " to be found he learned valuable lessons about musicianship and a repertoire of marches as a member of st augustine high schools famed "marching " but he didnt discover the connection he craved until he began playing in guitarist banjoist danny barkers fairview baptist church brass band and in paulins brass band two ensembles that flourished during a period of waning interest he gives thought to these beginnings whenever he flies in or out of his hometown above one terminal exit of louis armstrong international airport hangs a large mural of a parade led by paulins band in full swing dr white clarinet poised dominates its foreground "thirty years later i remember the faces of some of the members of the club " he said "their specific movements and gestures " dr white took the cash earned from that parade to buy a recording by a clarinetist hed never heard george lewis "that music sounded like it told the story of my life " he dove headfirst into the traditional jazz idiom exemplified by lewis replete with personalized timbres and variations within tight collective improvisations and dr white soon learned of familial connections to such jazz clarinetist willie joseph clarinetist saxophonist earl fouche and bassist "papa john" joseph formative players all were cousins on his mothers side he found quick acceptance into the community of older traditional jazz players meeting and eventually playing with men who had played alongside armstrong morton and bechet "i was able to do away with a lot of the stereotypes that existed about traditional music to hear it as a living breathing thing " despite its early jazz trappings dr whites own music steers away from revivalism of the tracks on his most recent recording "dancing in the sky" basin street records are new compositions responses to his liner notes say "the internal questions and issues that confront any artist wishing to develop new fresh and honest material within the context of tradition " theres nothing especially tradition bound for instance about the leaping intervals and interpolated melody dr white plays three minutes into the jump blues "new orleans bounce out of the woods " and when he speaks of tradition these days its often as a key to recovery in the here and now earlier this month dr white convened a panel discussion at xavier about the importance of mardi gras indian tradition last year he led one dedicated to the jazz funeral "i think life as i knew it ended with katrina and im onto another life " dr white said "we all are in new orleans and ive started to realize that the most important thing that i have i didnt lose the memory and the spiritual and musical contributions the older generation of musicians gave me from the very beginning jazz in new orleans was a form of political activism a show of strength and unity whats happening now is that some people are catching on hey we might lose this hey what is this all about "and in a way katrina washed away some of the barriers between generations and classes one of the things that gave me hope after katrina was my interaction with the hot band and with dinerral shavers who was a shining example of this tradition the guys in the hot seem to understand the need not only to learn about tradition but to pass it on " in discussing the resilience of new orleans brass band and mardi gras indian traditions dr white drew on another of his passions film he cited the end sequence to "black orpheus " which transplanted the greek myth of orpheus and eurydice to rios carnival orpheus carries eurydices body away but a stone thrown by the jealous mira knocks him over a cliff to his death back up on the cliff the young child benedetto takes orpheuss guitar and begins to play while his two young companions dance it is an affecting reaffirmation that despite tragedy the dance of life goes on "the idea is " dr white told me "this is all going to continue " mr blumenfeld is a katrina media fellow with the open society institute documenting the experiences of musicians in new orleans he writes about jazz for the journal
