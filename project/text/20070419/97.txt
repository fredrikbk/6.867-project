ruling to shift abortion fight focus moves to states as supreme court backs a partial birth ban washington the battle over abortion rights likely will move to the states after the supreme court its conservative wing buttressed by two bush appointees opened the door to a raft of new regulations intended to curb the procedure in one of the courts most significant rulings on abortion since its landmark roe v wade decision a majority upheld a contentious federal ban on so called partial birth abortions which was signed by president bush in the ruling marks a rare victory for the administration after years of reverses at the supreme court and represents a signal victory for opponents of abortion rights it also underscores the importance of one of the presidents most lasting powers to appoint supreme court justices justice samuel alito who voted with the majority yesterday was appointed last year to succeed sandra day oconnor who in was part of the five member majority that struck down a similar restriction passed by nebraska with democrats running capitol hill congress is unlikely to pass additional abortion restrictions instead the action likely will shift to the states where dozens of legislatures have passed antiabortion laws only to see them struck down or ruled unenforceable already more than half the states have enacted bans on partial birth abortions according to the guttmacher institute a reproductive health research organization litigation is sure to follow to see if as written they pass muster under yesterdays high court decision abortion foes likely will test the waters to see if they can push other restrictions too particularly in more conservative southern and rural states where abortion rights have been unpopular last week the full eighth u s circuit court of appeals in st louis heard arguments over the validity of south dakotas "informed consent" law which requires doctors to tell women several things that might discourage them from seeking an abortion such as that the procedure can induce suicidal thoughts in cincinnati the sixth circuit is to decide on an ohio law limiting use of ru the "morning after" abortion pill to the exact protocols specified by the food and drug administration a restriction not imposed on physicians employing other drugs the justice department had no comment on how it planned to enforce the ban which allows prison sentences of up to two years for doctors who perform the operation but doesnt penalize women who undergo it more than simply banning the procedure which is used in only a small fraction of abortions the courts majority embraced much of the vocabulary of the antiabortion movement it stopped short of overruling roe v wade but a new majority indicated greater deference to legislative efforts to "promote respect for life including life of the unborn " in yesterdays decision the justices hewed to their previously expressed views justice anthony kennedy who had dissented in the case wrote the opinion for the new majority which included chief justice john roberts and justices antonin scalia clarence thomas and alito the courts only woman justice ruth bader ginsburg wrote an impassioned dissent which in a rare move she read from the bench justice ginsburg was joined by justices john paul stevens david souter and stephen breyer in a statement president bush said the court he helped shape affirmed "the progress we have made over the past six years in protecting human dignity and upholding the sanctity of life " republicans issued statements endorsing the ruling while democrats bemoaned it senate majority leader harry reid a nevada democrat who personally opposes abortion rights said the decision shows why "a lot of us wish that alito werent there and oconnor were there " the antiabortion movement has been split over the best way to attack the procedure a frontal assault on roe v wade or an incremental strategy seeking piecemeal limitations yesterdays decision underscored the success of the latter approach only justice scalia joined justice thomas in a concurrence asserting that roe itself was wrongly decided and should be reversed that would free legislators to ban abortion outright chief justice roberts and justice alito who in their confirmation hearings asserted their respect for judicial precedent didnt go so far justice kennedy who has expressed revulsion at the partial birth procedure has never challenged the core holding of roe he fashioned his ruling yesterday as seeking to strike "a balance" between a womans privacy right and a state interest in protecting potential life he also said the ruling was consistent with the decision in which he dissented unlike the nebraska law struck down then the federal ban was more specific in describing the procedure essentially defining it as one in which a fetus is killed after being partially extracted from the uterus rather than before federal appeals courts in st louis san francisco and new york had reached the opposite conclusion primarily because the federal ban lacked an exception to protect the womans health prior supreme court decisions had held that such an exception was necessary yesterdays decision said that outlawing the procedure didnt enable states to outlaw abortions outright nor did it place "an undue burden" on women seeking to obtain them instead justice kennedy wrote government was entitled to regulate the medical profession barring a procedure congress found "brutal and inhumane " he wrote was a legitimate way to show "profound respect for the life within the woman " his role in the decision reflects his emerging importance as the courts new swing vote the court did concede that enforcement could potentially go too far in banning medically necessary procedures and left the door open to lawsuits arguing that specific applications of the law might be illegal but that didnt mollify the dissenters who said the court was interposing its view of morality in a decision that should be left to doctors and patients justice ginsburg wrote for the courts dwindling liberal wing where justice kennedy justified banning the procedure partly because "respect for human life finds an ultimate expression in the bond of love the mother has for her child " justice ginsburg observed "not all pregnancies are wanted or even the product of consensual activity " while the majority didnt overturn roe its decision "cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to chip away at a right declared again and again by this court " she wrote
