day sign up for the e mail here a move to let medicare negotiate the prices it pays for drugs has stalled in the senate a legislative win for the pharmaceutical industry and a big setback for democrats who made it one of their signature issues back in november the law that created the medicare drug benefit program also barred the program from negotiating or setting prices in the face of vociferous opposition from what were then the minority democrats on jan of this year the house passed a bill that ordered the secretary of health and human services to negotiate purchase prices notching it up as early proof that washington was operating under a new agenda but senate democrats aware of their smaller majority and the limits that places on fighting a filibuster or presidential veto instead sought simply to end the restrictions on such negotiations arguing they wanted to untie the hands of hhs to seek better prices for the million older americans who get medicare benefits but in a procedural move to bring the measure to the floor the democrats couldnt line up the needed votes as the new york times reports the vote wasnt entirely along partisan lines six republicans joined democrats for what became a tally but the republican leadership put up staunch resistance framing the issue as a fight between government run health care and private sector benefit management as the times says republican sen john cornyn went so far as to denounce the bill as "a step down the road to a single payer government run health care system " the democratic leadership hadnt displayed high hopes for victory knowing it faced what the washington post calls "formidable opposition from the pharmaceutical and health insurance industries two of the most powerful lobbying forces on capitol hill " but their effort was also undermined by a recent analysis from the nonpartisan congressional budget office which found the change would only result in cheaper drug prices if congress changed the wider program which has grown in popularity since it began and also ended up costing less than originally predicted still the democrats plan to try again the pharmaceutical industry meanwhile is engaged in a fight on another legislative front this time over patent law congress is working on a bill that would introduce what the wall street journal calls "the biggest changes to the u s patent system in more than years " it includes proposals to limit patent royalties to the "economic value" of the new products novelty that would please the financial services and business software industries which have long pushed for such change but it could hurt drug companies a supreme court reversal on abortion dealing with another law the supreme court yesterday changed its mind about the late term procedure banned by congress in the partial birth abortion act ruling in a case called "gonzales attorney general v carhart et al " that such a ban doesnt impose an undue burden on a womens right to abortion since justice samuel alito voted to uphold the law reversing the stance of predecessor sandra day oconnor on a similar nebraska law bloomberg notes the ruling "erased any doubts" that president bush has managed to shift the courts balance it also offered vindication for what the new york times calls a strategic choice by the anti abortion movement years ago when a total reversal on abortion by the court seemed extremely unlikely by identifying the particular procedure "and giving it the provocative label partial birth abortion the movement turned the public focus of the abortion debate from the rights of women to the fate of fetuses in short order states banned the procedure " the times says indeed justice anthony kennedy writing for the majority indicated that focus contributed to his reasoning saying the law conformed to the courts validation of "drawing boundaries" to save lives "the act also recognizes that respect for human life finds an ultimate expression in a mothers love for her child " he said adding that women may come to regret the "difficult and painful moral decision" required by an abortion and suggesting that doctors "may prefer not to disclose precise details of the abortion procedure to be used " in contrast justice ruth bader ginsburg called it an "alarming" break with past rulings in what legal times notes was an unusual reading of her minority opinion from the bench "despite our unambiguous ruling congress passed the partial birth abortion ban act without an exception for womens health a ban that would operate nationwide after lengthy trials and thorough review of volumes of medical evidence each of the district courts to consider the statute found that it was unconstitutional for the same reason significant medical authority identified the procedure as the safest procedure for some women " she said "the courts opinion tolerates indeed applauds federal intervention to ban nationwide a procedure found necessary and proper in certain cases by the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists " anti abortion activists in many states now plan to push for more stringent limits on late term abortions the los angeles times reports and the n y times notes both sides of the debate now predict abortion will play a bigger role in the presidential elections chinas juggernaut economy
