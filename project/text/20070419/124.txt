wii and ds turn also ran nintendo into winner in videogames business a year ago nintendo co looked like the videogame industrys biggest also ran the japanese companys new game console due out in time for the holidays was a technological laggard compared with more powerful systems from microsoft corp and sony corp and the machines goofy name wii pronounced "we" earned it ridicule from some game fans and critics nintendos dominance of the portable game market meanwhile was under assault by a new product from sony but against the odds nintendo has become the company to beat in the games business as the wii flies off store shelves nearly as quickly as the company can make them the buzz about the wii has overshadowed the even greater success nintendo has had with the nintendo ds a portable game player that is still selling briskly more than two years after its introduction the kyoto based companys unexpected strength is prompting broader changes throughout the industry as game makers that were caught off guard by nintendos strength including powerhouses like electronic arts inc the worlds largest publisher of games hurry to beef up development of games that take better advantage of nintendo hardware "this has been a honeymoon with consumers like nintendo hasnt had in a decade or more " says john taylor a veteran games analyst at arcadia investment corp in portland ore nintendos strength underscores how transitions to new generations of game consoles an event that occurs every five years or so in the industry can shake up the existing balance of power among hardware makers nintendo dominated the industry during the s and early s with hardware like the nintendo entertainment system and iconic game characters like donkey kong and mario brothers the company founded over years ago as a maker of traditional japanese playing cards eventually lost its leadership in consoles to rivals finishing in third place with its gamecube system behind sony and microsoft in the last wave of game hardware "i would say that this time last year people were underestimating or discounting us pretty universally throughout the industry " says george harrison senior vice president of marketing for nintendos u s division but since going on sale in november the wii has become the hottest selling product among the latest generation of game consoles designed to be hooked up to tv sets a group that also includes sonys playstation and microsofts xbox the product lacks the ability to produce sophisticated graphics on par with the sony and microsoft machines but it has an innovative motion sensing game controller that lets players swing tennis rackets golf clubs and swords within games the nintendo consoles &# price too has made it more appealing to some consumers than the xbox and the ps which start at &# and &# respectively in february u s retailers sold wiis compared with xbox s and playstation s according to npd group inc a sales tracking firm in port washington n y microsoft of redmond wash still leads the overall market with more than million xbox s shipped to retailers world wide since it went on sale in november a year earlier than the wii and ps it isnt clear how durable nintendos current momentum will be with the wii an array of coming titles this year based on blockbuster game franchises could give big boosts to the sony and microsoft machines including take two interactive software inc s grand theft auto iv and microsofts halo at ea based in redwood city calif executives concede that nintendo sold more consoles than they expected over the holidays "luckily for us because of our scale and scope weve got the ability to adjust pretty quickly and deploy some additional development teams " executive chairman lawrence probst said in an interview in february to take better advantage of the wiis growth ea moved quickly to ramp up game production for the system acquiring headgate studios a developer in utah focused entirely on making titles for nintendo hardware and shifting resources in other ea development groups to nintendo projects the company released four titles for the wii in march including a version of its tiger woods golf game in which players swing the wii controller like a club ea is also working on a line of consumer guides for the nintendo ds that will be aimed at older players in japan majesco entertainment inc a small publisher in edison n j is betting the farm on nintendos success majesco found itself increasingly unable to compete with deep pocketed rivals to create the splashiest games for ps and xbox for which budgets can run in the &# million to &# million range simpler games for the nintendo ds and wii in contrast can cost under &# million and &# million respectively to make and can be completed far more quickly than titles for ps and xbox late last year majesco said it would focus nearly all of its development efforts in the future on nintendo ds and wii games one of the first titles it published was a version of a japanese game called cooking mama that lets players practice virtual culinary skills jesse sutton interim president and chief executive officer of majesco says nintendo is targeting its hardware at the fastest growing audience in the games business "casual" gamers who are more interested in fun simple games rather than the deeply immersive titles that most hard core gamers prefer nintendos performance in the portable games business is causing similar ripples the company long dominated portable games hardware with the gameboy its strength seemed in jeopardy though when sony introduced the playstation portable or psp in late a more powerful portable machine with a dazzling screen on which users could also watch movies to compete with nintendo ds which lets users play games through a touch sensitive screen analysts believe nintendo has largely vanquished the psp threat nintendo has shipped more than million dss world wide to sonys million psps recently sony cut the price of the psp in the u s to &# from &# to help boost sales the nintendo ds sells for &# the popularity of ds has affected strategy for hard core game publishers like square enix co the creator of the popular final fantasy role playing game series while square enix is planning to launch several titles for the psp this year it currently has more than twice as many existing and planned titles for ds than for psp including travel guidebooks and a gardening tutorial square enix ceo yoichi wada says he realized the need for nontraditional games about a year ago when he saw how well a nintendo brain training game was selling "we anticipated that portable games would take off before next generation consoles " says mr wada "what we didnt expect was that the ds would attract new users who use the device in a brand new way "
