politics &amp economics bush democrats tackle funding meeting strikes conciliatory tone over iraq war bill washington president bush and democrats used a white house meeting to begin to look past an imminent veto fight and set a more conciliatory tone as they try to resolve their differences over an iraq war funding bill the hour long meeting described by participants as polite and respectful opens what promises to be an intense month of maneuvering by both sides the army confirmed that gen david petraeus one of the administrations more effective voices on the war will come to washington from his baghdad command and likely meet with lawmakers next week but his task was made more difficult by a spate of car bombings that killed nearly in iraq yesterday democrats know they will have to soften their demands for a fixed date to withdraw u s forces but mr bush could be forced to accept language requiring the iraqi government to do more to meet political and military benchmarks house speaker nancy pelosi d calif reminded the president that most of the congressional benchmarks are the same ones he has set for the iraqi government democrats read back quotes from defense secretary robert gates saying the war debate in congress "has been helpful in demonstrating to the iraqis that american patience is limited " one of the sharpest exchanges came when senate majority leader harry reid d nev suggested that like president lyndon johnson in the vietnam war mr bush was plunging ahead not wanting to admit that the war couldnt be won the president denied this forcefully after which mr reid touched his arm in a gesture of friendliness and at another point mr bush allowed that he shared many of ms pelosis goals in changing the mission of u s troops in iraq but believed congress was going about it in the wrong way house and senate negotiators are expected to meet monday with the goal of sending a first version of the estimated &# billion bill to mr bush by the end of next week democrats are leaning toward a compromise under which the house would accept less binding senate language which would set a goal of withdrawing most u s combat forces by spring of next year the senate is poised to embrace house provisions emphasizing military readiness and seeking to protect marine and army combat units from excessive rotations overseas albeit with waivers available to the president asked about such a deal ms pelosi would only say "lets put it this way its not excluded " mr bush has said the senate withdrawal language while milder than the house bill still would force a veto but house majority whip james clyburn d s c said the talks could yet be an opportunity to avoid a veto fight "lets cut to the chase lets do it now " that seems unlikely at this stage but neither side can wait long before tackling the second bill and the white house has a vested interest in getting the matter resolved many democrats want a final compromise quickly but given the recent violence in iraq others argue that congress should maximize its leverage by passing only a two month funding bill after the presidents anticipated veto "money bills are what count " said rep john murtha d pa one of the bill managers "the surge is not working its not getting better i think lets take another look at this two months from now " john d mckinnon contributed to this article
