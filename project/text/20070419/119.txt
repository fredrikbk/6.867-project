weathering the storm in student loans as furor mounts over schools preferred lender lists families can often find better deals shopping on their own the widening college loan scandal is highlighting the need to look beyond schools recommended lenders but for students and their parents the process might be harder than they expect most students who take out loans use one of the companies on their schools so called preferred lender list because its the path of least resistance however as allegations mount that some lenders have been offering incentives to secure placement on those lists students and their parents are concerned that schools may not be presenting choices that are necessarily in their best interests it makes the most sense to shop around for a federally guaranteed loan because new lenders knowing the government stands behind the loans may be more willing to cut prices to quickly build market share whats more nonprofit groups and some state run programs may offer better deals on these loans and new online tools are emerging that can help borrowers compare loan offerings with private loans however students are likely to find better rates on loans offered through their schools than shopping with lenders directly though some nonprofit groups offer even better deals private loans which carry higher interest rates than federal loans made up about of the &# billion in new student loans last year and are increasingly being used by students as a way to help bridge the gap between the rising cost of education and the limited amount the government allows students to borrow in its programs when schools send financial aid packages they often contain loan documents with a lenders name already filled in and many students arent aware they have the right to choose any lender they wish students who do go with a lender that isnt on a schools list may encounter loan processing delays extra paperwork and red tape from their financial aid office norm reddick of westlake village calif ran into delays when he took out a loan for his daughter from a lender that wasnt on whittier colleges preferred list last july mr reddick applied for the loan with myrichuncle a student lender owned by mru holdings inc but he says the university didnt process the loan until october "when i called the financial aid department to find out why the loan was delayed they just said this isnt a lender that we work with " says the year old dentist who decided to use myrichuncle because it was offering a lower rate on plus loans than lenders his daughters school was recommending vernon bridges director of financial aid for whittier college says any delays are usually caused when the school is unfamiliar with a particular lender schools typically need information such as how funds will be disbursed before they can certify a loan he says whittier college plans to be more proactive including contacting students before summer vacation to find out what lender they plan to use the following term schools generally defend their lists of preferred lenders saying they have already done the homework to find the best deals for students and have considered other factors such as the quality of customer service in their decisions still preferred lender lists are "a starting place " says dallas martin president of the national association of student financial aid administrators "but you also have the right to go someplace else if you find something better some schools werent making it as clear as they should have " he says as schools mail out financial aid packages to prospective students among the loans that may be offered to them are federally guaranteed loans these come in two main flavors stafford and perkins loans which go directly to the students and plus loans which are taken out by the parents of undergraduates or by graduate students themselves aid packages may also suggest loans from private lenders federal loans borrowers should exhaust federal education loans which have low fixed interest rates and more favorable repayment terms before turning to private loans the government has set the maximum interest rates on federal loans to for stafford loans and for plus loans and this is what most lenders charge but there are breaks myrichuncle is offering loans carrying rates that are one to nearly two percentage points lower than the maximum fixed rates on stafford and plus loans though the firm charges a and origination fee for stafford and plus loans respectively national city corp is offering a rate on its graduate plus loan but charges a origination fee many lenders such as j p morgan chase &amp co wachovia corp bank of america corp and wells fargo &amp co promise to reduce the interest rate on or the principal amount of a loan after the borrower makes a certain number of payments on time but in reality only a fraction of borrowers qualify for the discounts and borrowers instead should focus on immediate discounts

automatically debited from their bank accounts up from the current discount citigroup inc s student lending unit says it will automatically drop its rate by one percentage point once students start repaying their loans typically after graduation borrowers should also check with their state to see if there are any benefits available michigan residents or non residents who attend schools in the state can take out federal loans through the michigan higher education student loan authority a nonprofit agency and see their interest rate fall to zero after they make months of on time payments the missouri higher education loan authority or mohela a nonprofit lender in st louis reduces the rate by two percentage points for borrowers making automatic payments on plus and stafford loans the missouri deal is open to any student nationally and borrowers also can get a better rate on plus loans if they skip the intermediary lender and borrow directly from the federal government theres also an additional discount if they sign up for automatic payments one hitch only about of the nations schools participate in the federal loan program for direct loans graduate and professional students also now have a cheaper alternative to private loans as of last july graduate students could take out a plus loan up to the cost of education minus any aid received tony gruia of new york estimates he saved about &# by expanding his search beyond his schools preferred lenders the year old decided to use an advisory service graduate leverage which matched him with a lender that was willing to offer on his stafford loans and on his graduate plus loans "i honestly dont care who gives me the money as long as i get the best rate " says mr gruia a first year student at columbia business school private loans some students may opt for private loans if they need to borrow more than the total cost of tuition such as to pay for computer or travel expenses or if their parents cant or wont assume responsibility for a plus loan borrowers also often turn to private loans if they want low monthly payments in repayment since private loans have longer terms than federal loans but these loans are
