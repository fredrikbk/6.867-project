when illness isn t metaphor sick by jonathan cohn harpercollins pages &# in his account of the state of health care in america jonathan cohn begins with the story of a woman with a heart attack whose ambulance must bypass the hospital best able to treat her and take her instead to one with less up to date staff and equipment the first hospital was "on diversion" too busy to accept new patients the woman died the implication of the anecdote and of many others in "sick" is that with government funded universal health care patients would get the services they need at the best facilities with no such terrible delays or limitations in short the woman likely would have lived both outcomes fast effective treatment and a health catastrophe survived would be welcome of course but there is no basis for assuming that either one would flow from universal health care which will have its own painful inefficiencies and shortfalls that doesnt prevent mr cohn from seeming to promise all things to all people as he relates vignette after wrenching vignette of real folks experiences to illustrate in human terms what can happen when insurance and health care fails those who fall between the cracks of our present system we meet for instance marijon binder an impoverished and uninsured former nun still doing good works as the caregiver to a disabled elderly woman ms binder develops chest pain and is brought to a charitable hospital by ambulance fortunately its a false alarm but the &# bill for two days of observation is real the paperwork that might have canceled her bill gets fouled up unwilling to relent the hospital institutes legal proceedings but the judge annoyed by the arrogance of the hospitals attorneys according to mr cohn rules in ms binders favor and voids the bill whether he is describing emergency rooms overburdened by becoming clinics for the uninsured or the dysfunction of charitable institutions attempting to operate as businesses mr cohn chooses his cases to highlight specific flaws in current health care delivery still one wonders whether some of the patients in his more dire tales would have succumbed no matter how perfectly their care was organized and financed there are cancers for example that kill even with early diagnosis a sad truth that the author tends to gloss over when hes not tugging on heartstrings mr cohn is a good historian he traces the politics and economics leading up to our current hodge podge system of health care payment from early in the th century through the enactment of medicare and medicaid in the s the hmo act of the changes in the tax code that shifted the burden of health insurance to employers and the spread of managed care many people of course are pleased with such arrangements the great question marks are the uninsured and those who lack adequate insurance for particular circumstances if they cannot pay for care themselves then they either miss out on proper treatment or receive it thanks to cost shifting at the expense of others as mr cohn describes the debate over the clinton health plan a quasi universal care approach that was ultimately rejected we meet a confused public afraid of losing existing health insurance benefits while being promised something even better to this day the public remains paralyzed by this conflict why according to mr cohn it is because conservatives the bad guys have succeeded in fanning baseless fears of government control and because businesses venal and market solutions inadequate have deflected the momentum of history add the basic selfishness of doctors and hospitals and one can reasonably conclude that only a bold populist leader stands a chance of championing the broad public interest against the forces of darkness mr cohns bogeymen free market conservatives have definitely been wary of promoting more government power in health care fearful of ballooning budget commitments the rationing of care a rigid micro managing bureaucracy and the loss of competitive alternatives among other things are these sound reasons for caution if so mr cohn doesnt say nor are the policy comments of doctors who actually see patients to be found among the books many quotes an approach reminiscent of hillary clintons when she excluded practicing physicians from the hundreds she enlisted to design her health plan because of "a conflict of interest " "sick" does however say a lot that ought to interest conservatives and liberals alike it is indeed difficult to find the right balance between insurer profitability and service a free market conservative might say that a less regulated insurance market with a greater variety of offerings is one way to find it mr cohn shows the burden of high costs and the distress of not knowing what will or wont be covered by insurance and he vividly portrays workers fear of job loss and a resulting loss of health insurance hardly a paranoid fantasy in a climate of globalization the steadily employed face ever less generous benefits too what to do mr cohn feels that republicans have failed to do enough to reassure the average person brushing aside specifics and relying on absolute faith in the market to handle all eventualities perhaps so but mr cohns faith in government is surely as unrealistic as free market triumphalism alas the challenges of health care in the modern age will persist no matter how it is financed to quote the noted health care expert roy rogers "people are a lot sicker than they used to be when they got sick before they died now they live sick " living sick in other words trying to live a semi normal life while keeping a chronic disease such as diabetes under control is costly so is early detection which is often achieved by expensive new technology the medical mission obviously requires that we do all that we can for everyone but still stay solvent this means setting limits which is more feasible with people who can afford to pay for part of their care than it is for the poor who would have to forgo entirely what isnt provided free solve this by granting the poor "equal access" with no financial barriers as medicaid does in theory and a new dilemma is created unrestrained demand a privilege that paying people do not have these are the hard questions that "sick" does not address dr alper a practicing internist is a visiting scholar at the hoover
