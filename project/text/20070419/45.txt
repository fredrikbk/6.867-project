home &amp family breast cancer data pose puzzle a new report shows breast cancer incidence remains at its lowest rate in years but it raises more questions than it answers about why an estimated fewer women in the u s have been diagnosed with the disease the data published in a special report in the new england journal of medicine offer an extended analysis of breast cancer statistics for and the data are important because they affirm that a steep decline in breast cancer that occurred in first reported in december wasnt an anomaly researchers from the university of texas m d anderson cancer center and the university of california los angeles have speculated that the big drop may be explained at least in part because millions of women abruptly stopped using menopause hormones in mid at the time a major government hormone study was halted because of fears that older women in the study who used hormones had higher rates of heart attacks and breast cancer the study results frightened women causing a decline of about million prescriptions or about in the months after the announcement although changes in hormone use may explain some of the drop in breast cancer incidence experts speculate other factors are probably involved one big worry is that a portion of the decline may be due to fewer women getting mammograms that would mean women arent really being spared from cancer but that doctors just havent found it yet because women arent showing up to be screened "some women become less vigilant about having regular mammograms after stopping hormone therapy " says joann e manson harvard university epidemiologist and investigator for the womens health initiative study of menopause hormones "if so some of the decline in rates could reflect underdiagnosis " in addition increased use of medications such as the bone drug raloxifene aspirin and anti inflammatory drugs and of calcium supplements and vitamin d all of which are linked with lower breast cancer risk may also help explain the decline "its probably the combination of a lot of things that may be contributing to this change " says oncologist dawn hershman assistant professor of medicine and epidemiology at columbia university medical center "we probably need another couple years of data to fully understand it " peter ravdin the texas researcher who led the new study says the good news is that after the big drop in breast cancer in the number of cases leveled off in rather than increased as many feared would happen that shows the drop "was not a one year wonder " he says although the reasons for the decline are probably complex dr ravdin says much of the evidence points to changes in hormone use he notes that the drop was seen in women over the same age group that uses menopause hormones in addition the biggest declines were seen in the type of tumor most affected by hormones although the number of breast cancer cases dropped by from to the number of estrogen receptor positive breast cancers fell by about during that period but even if the drop is linked to hormones what isnt clear is whether it is a temporary dip or a permanent decline it may be that stopping hormones which are known to fuel tumorgrowth may have simply slowed or delayed tumors but that they will show up eventually "thats the real question" says dr hershman "did you actually change anything or did you just slow it down " experts say the breast cancer data dont change the fact that menopausal women should use hormones to treat distressing hot flashes and other symptoms in the lowest dose for the shortest time possible "i wouldnt want this to be something that caused all women to stop hormone replacement therapy "" dr ravdin says researchers noted that stopping hormone therapy doesnt dramatically change an individual womans overall risk for breast cancer based on the latest analysis a woman who stops hormones would at best reduce her individual risk of developing breast cancer by just in or about percent say researchers researchers at the university of california san francisco are reviewing data on hundreds of thousands of women who take part in a national breast screening program that analysis should help clarify whether less screening is affecting breast cancer incidence "it looks like incidence has gone down and thats good "" says karla kerlikowske the ucsf epidemiology professor who is conducting the new analysis "but its unclear how much of that decrease is potentially from hormones and how much is from changes in screening you just cant tell "" in an unrelated study the lancet medical journal reported that a major british study of hormone use called the million women study found that hormone users were at higher risk of ovarian cancer than nonusers the womens health initiative showed no statistically significant increase in risk of ovarian cancer among hormone users
