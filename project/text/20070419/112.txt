tips for getting past some of the hassles of buying a new pc whew the new windows vista operating system five years in the making is finally out and preloaded on new pcs from every major windows computer maker after months of uncertainty and delay you can go forth with confidence and buy a new computer right well its not that simple so heres my annual spring buyers guide to desktop pcs most of what i say below also applies to laptops although with laptops there are additional factors such as size weight screen size and battery life as always these tips apply to mainstream users doing typical tasks not hard core gamers or techies last fall i advised average consumers with aging pcs to hang on until new vista pcs emerged rather than trying to upgrade existing models i still believe that was the right course because windows upgrades are so tricky but it turns out that even new vista pcs have two big downsides first vista isnt all that exciting a replacement for windows xp its much prettier and has much better searching and microsoft claims it has much stronger security although you still need add on security software second to an extent that amazes me makers of windows software and hardware have failed to update their products to work smoothly or to work at all with vista in my house for example the only built in vista printer driver i can find for my printer doesnt allow the two sided printing i can do with windows xp and apple macintosh computers so if you desperately need a new windows pc be prepared to be underwhelmed and to be frustrated by incompatible software and hardware and if youre not desperate you might wait another six months or so for the software and hardware to catch up and for microsoft to issue some bug fixes or you could buy a mac instead i still believe the best desktop computer on the market for mainstream nontechnical consumers is the apple imac it has gorgeous hardware and superior built in software its operating system mac os x includes most of the key new features of vista and the imac can even run vista along with its own operating system if you need the occasional windows program apple has delayed until october the release of its new operating system version leopard but its almost certain that any mac you buy now will upgrade to it smoothly see my mossbergs mailbox for more details and the mac is still largely free of the security problems that add such hassles to using a windows pc but if youre going for a windows pc here are my buying tips vista versions the cheapest pcs will have only a stripped down edition of vista called home basic which lacks vistas flashy new user interface to get the full vista experience youll need more expensive machines that come with home premium which also has more media features and is probably best for most average consumers if your company recommends it you may need a different version of vista called vista business which lacks some of the media features but can connect to some types of company networks that the home versions cant or you can buy a machine with the costliest version of vista called ultimate that includes all the features of the other versions if you want to shun vista altogether you may still be able to find new pcs with windows xp though these machines may not be as secure as vista models memory no matter what microsoft or the pc makers say i strongly suggest one gigabyte of memory or ram for home basic and two gigabytes for all other vista versions video vista home premium business and ultimate will work best on machines with a separate or "discrete " graphics card with dedicated video memory some integrated graphics systems built into the computers main circuitry will also work though they will drain some of your main memory through a scheme called shared memory processor for home basic any current intel or amd processor in a new brand name pc will work for other versions i suggest a "dual core" processor like intels core duo or amds athlon x which pack the equivalent of two chips into one even if your processor can handle so called bit software average users wont find that capability useful today hard drive if youre not much interested in video music or photos or gigabytes should be sufficient if you are gigabytes or more is best disks dont buy one of the competing new high definition disk drives blu ray or hd dvd until the war between these competing formats is settled stick with plain old dvd junky software nearly all windows pcs are packed with "craplets" the useless annoying trial versions of programs in a retail store they may remove these for you for a small fee price you can get a bargain brand name desktop with home basic and a slow processor for under &# but for a versatile desktop with two gigabytes of memory discrete video a large hard disk and a dual core processor you can easily spend &# or more without a monitor just dont buy more or less machine than you need email me at mossberg wsj com
