fashion journal green jeans why designers are late to eco game though hemp seaweed now make fine fabrics retailers balk at hippie image for an industry that prides itself on being up with trends fashion inc has been slow to recognize that eco friendly and luxury are no longer at odds with one another far from producing scratchy hemp to be paired with earth shoes textile technology has advanced so far that factories are weaving fine supple cloth from bamboo hemp seaweed and other sturdy plants that dont require coddling with fertilizer and pesticides theyre dyeing fabrics with colorful nontoxic pigments you can have your clothes fully organic recycled or in a variety of other permutations that attempt to minimize harm to the environment animals or factory workers variations collectively referred to as "green" or "eco " but if you want to buy an ecologically sensitive wardrobe for earth day this sunday unless you wear nothing but yoga clothes youll need the bloodhounding capabilities of sherlock holmes and watson high end store buyers are risk averse when it comes to veering from the tried and true luxury pitch thats espoused by the guccis and louis vuittons many of those makers have been leery of new "green" textiles because they are often still associated with birkenstocks and burlap sacks much is made of the attention and money lvmh group gives to environmental causes including pursuing ecologically sound farming methods for its liquors but louis vuitton isnt producing eco handbags at least not yet one of the early designers of luxury high fashion linda loudermilk has struggled to sell store buyers on her green designs since launching her label four years ago her sense of humor remains intact as she riffs on her pleas to retailers "i promise its not ugly i really do want to talk to your couture buyer " there is a lot of dabbling going on barneys new york has pledged to carry more eco lines and eileen fisher has introduced organic cottons nordstrom is carrying some organic pieces including an attractive tracy reese jacket while h&amp m has a few organic cottons giorgio armani has been producing clothes in hemp and corn fiber but its generally scattershot the big guys are "slow off the mark" to see the opportunities says david wolfe one of the industrys more frank trend gurus and creative director at consultants doneger group in new york "theyre not the quickest thinkers on the planet " concetta lanciaux a longtime adviser to lvmh group chairman bernard arnault says the luxury industry is only beginning to think about eco production because the manufacturers thought such concerns as sustainable farming didnt apply to them "its coming " she says "luxury has always thought of itself as more environmentally sensitive its not heavy industry its not massive production because of the craftsmanship of the industry " but they are clearly missing a rapidly emerging market in a survey of people by npd group tracking consumer interest in ecologically sensitive products from food to cars interest in buying organic fashion products increased to of consumers in from in "that is a huge jump " says marshal cohen an npd analyst who has been studying eco business the paris based trend company promostyl predicted last fall that the eco luxe market will be big in "we call it from hippie to hip " says nathalie fausty one of the companys trend consultants one of the reasons that retailers and manufacturers give for their green reticence is the higher cost of eco luxe textiles which may cost anywhere from a little more to off the charts depending on the material but cost is a red herring luxury buyers are by definition willing to pay more for elan the price of a cotton and polyester louis vuitton bag doesnt reflect the manufacturing cost so much as a womans desire to own it npd estimates that consumers are willing to pay as much as more for eco demand for eco luxe goods has been successfully plumbed in other industries whole foods sells organic and nonorganic foods for prices that have earned it the nickname "whole paycheck " toyota took a small gas electric hybrid car with good gas mileage added leather seats and a keyless ignition and wound up with leonardo dicaprio buzzing around in his prius acting as the companys unpaid celebrity spokesman far from balking at priuss premium prices people got in line even household cleaning fluids can be luxury with a green message and great packaging hence the success of the method guys who have been gracing magazine covers while their products fly off the shelves everywhere from target to gift boutiques eco these days carries its own panache "the consumer is buying into it for the same reason they buy a status label " says mr wolfe "it gives them a rush of pleasure " with a few exceptions the eco luxe niche is still being filled by smaller fleet footed designers who are learning that the market for eco clothing is far deeper than the vegan crowd this isnt organic scratchy colorless territory eco luxe designers must make good as well as green stuff stella mccartney has been selling organic cotton pullovers and other clothing based on style and her own celebrity not just the appeal of organic edun a line of green clothing got a lot of early publicity for being launched by bonos wife ali hewson a couple of years ago but many stores didnt reorder and its clear why the line didnt sell so well the clothes werent especially stylish susan white and barbara warren known for their white + warren cashmere sweaters introduced a plush green line last october with a stereotypical view of the eco market they chose muted colors but they say that one of their big customers neiman marcus balked "they said its too crunchy " says ms white "we assumed that urban people dont want eco friendly clothes we were wrong " in recent months they have added red fuchsia and orange and increased production having found new factories in china that make eco fabrics they expect to sell about &# worth of eco clothing this year the lines debut out of more than &# million in total revenue ms loudermilk achieved the holy grail of fashion this year a gown on stage at the oscars worn by producer lesley chilcott of "an inconvenient truth" and is opening her own store on trendy melrose avenue in los angeles near marc jacobs she has also launched a sort of good housekeeping seal called the luxury eco stamp of approval whereby her staff will also certify a variety of luxury products by other designers thats a concept that might help us consumers figure out whats really green and what just claims to be but thats a whole nother story viridis luxe a new eco luxe label shipping its first soft hemp blend sweaters and silky bamboo t shirts in july is taking advantage of the void in the market the brands creators hala bahmet and amadea west have the sort of connections to play the fashion game ms bahmet is a former hollywood costume designer and ms west is married to simon west producer of "black hawk down" and director of "lara croft tomb raider " trend setting fred segal in los angeles has placed its order over lunch at los angeless chateau marmont ms west excused herself to kiss orlando bloom bringing the actor to the table to see a finely photographed viridis luxe brochure next up they say are viridis
