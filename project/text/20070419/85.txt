readback making sense of senseless acts in underground murakami chronicles poison gas attacks on tokyo subway online edition i had just finished reading "underground " a book about the terrorist attacks in the tokyo subway when i heard the first dispatches from virginia tech i might have fallen back on the age old lamentation "what is this world coming to " except that i had just read the oral histories of people trying to make sense of a random assault that occurred more than a decade ago so what i thought was "again " on a sunny march morning in members of a religious cult called aum shinrikyo dropped plastic bags of poison gas sarin swaddled in newspapers on the floor of five tokyo subway cars the men punctured the pouches with sharpened umbrella tips and fled through the doors to getaway cars sarin is so lethal that breathing a pinheads worth can be fatal almost all the victims dead and thousands injured were ordinary workingmen and women hurrying to their jobs a few years later haruki murakami who has written several acclaimed novels including "the wind up bird chronicle" and "kafka on the shore " was reading a magazine and happened upon a letter to the editor from a woman whose husband had been gassed he survived but could no longer work "the letter shocked me " mr murakami wrote he didnt know that so many survivors were permanently scarred mr murakami worried that their suffering would disappear into the ether he decided to track down as many survivors witnesses doctors cult members and families of the dead as he could then he tried to persuade them to recall minute by minute a day they badly wanted to forget many people "slammed down the phone at the mere mention of publication " mr murakami wrote of the who eventually agreed to speak for the record he said "each had a face a life a family hopes and fears contradictions and dilemmas and all these factors had a place in the drama " for the survivors of such shocking indiscriminate violence the phrase "today is the first day of the rest of your life" takes on an ominous new meaning some would lose their health indefinitely "i know i dont appear to be in constant pain but imagine wearing a heavy stone helmet day in day out " said a tokyo auto technician "if id lost an arm or was reduced to a vegetable people could probably sympathize more " yoko iizuka a year old bank employee recovered enough to resume working but she knew she was forever changed "that kind of fright is something you never forget no matter how hard you try " she said "sometimes i find myself in a confined space in the subway or an underground entrance and my feet wont move " mr murakami methodically walks each of his characters through that day on the surface the accounts are similar breakfast subway funny smell coughing panic chaos hospital but each person reacted to the unimaginable differently some people quickly suspected a catastrophe others were oblivious some ran away from danger others ran toward it some emergency services were quick and effective others were almost criminally inept some victims hoped the perpetrators all of whom were eventually caught and convicted would be put to death others didnt want to think about them in tokyo in lower manhattan and in blacksburg va "why " is the question that can never be satisfactorily answered why did the tokyo terrorists most of them well educated young people from affluent families think they should kill and maim strangers mr murakami didnt speak to any of the terrorists so their motives remain unclear but according to a member of aum who did agree to an interview the cult attracted people who "dont fit into the system because theyre not comfortable with it or because theyve been excluded from it " once someone became a so called renunciate giving up all ties to the outside world "your sense of self steadily deteriorates things are forced on you from above and youre continually attacked for not accepting the status quo and inevitably your spirit is broken " behind the chronicle of that day in tokyo is a touching portrait of the japanese working class although the attack occurred on a monday morning many of the subway riders were still exhausted from the previous weeks overtime these clerks and accountants salesmen and software developers couldnt afford to be terrified "after experiencing something like that " one man said "the fear of going underground in a metal box and something bad happening is overpowering but what choice does a salaryman have there isnt any other way to get to work " write to cynthia crossen at cynthia crossen wsj com
