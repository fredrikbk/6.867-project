economic showdown the misery index was first employed by jimmy carter in to unseat president gerald ford that year the index which is calculated by adding the unemployment rate to the inflation rate averaged four years later it had climbed to and ronald reagan used it to unseat mr carter today the misery index isnt revealing much misery as of february it was only unemployment plus a month increase in the pce deflator a level bettered in only four years since and all those years were in the so called "bubble economy" of the late s one would think that complaints about the economy would be few and far between but complaining has become the national pastime not directly about the misery index but about the economy in general and how much worse we have it today than we did during the clinton economy in the s in particular while i find it hard to believe that every complaint is politically motivated it is difficult to imagine another justification for those who assert that the clinton economy was better than the bush economy for most americans who arent familiar with economic analysis its impossible to determine whats actually happening but the debate over bush versus clinton would be silly if it werent potentially influencing policy president clinton took office in january almost two years after the recession had ended on the other hand president bush took office just two months before the recession began as a result any economic comparison that uses four year presidential terms is highly misleading the clinton years will always look better than the bush years with that approach a better analysis which compares the two business cycles from their previous trough shows the opposite the bush economy is equal to or better than the clinton economy in almost every area president clinton benefited from gale force tailwinds the price of oil fell from &# a barrel in the first quarter of to &# a barrel in the fourth quarter of inflation remained very low president clinton also benefited from being in office immediately after the cold war had ended allowing him to enjoy the "peace dividend" a rapid decline in defense spending which helped bring federal spending down more importantly the fall of the iron curtain accelerated the global movement of capital and goods president bush on the other hand has been faced with gale force headwinds in the midst of deflation and an epic stock market meltdown the attacks occurred just eight months into his term while the recession he had inherited was still underway president bushs massive increase in security spending has effectively offset the benefits of the peace dividend the burden of government spending and the cost of shifting resources toward security are drags on the private sector in addition hurricane katrina flooded new orleans the th largest city in the u s while oil prices climbed above &# a barrel trying to compare presidential terms is a useless and biased venture cutting through all the rhetoric the boom of the s was spectacular and so has been the boom of the s but they are both part of a longer term wave of technological innovation that dates to the early s during the high tax highly regulated years between and the economy was in recession of the time since then following ronald reagans tax cuts and deregulation and paul volckers victory over inflation the u s economy has only been in recession of the time there have been periods of sub par performance and one of those periods was the first half of the s partly thanks to the first president bushs and president clintons tax hikes many argue that president clintons tax hikes did not hurt the economy and that this proves taxes dont matter as much as supply siders think but nothing could be further from the truth during the first months of the s recovery real average hourly earnings fell while the unemployment rate fell to for the current recovery during its first months real average hourly earnings are up while the unemployment rate is down to at the grass roots level the current recovery is significantly stronger than the s recovery despite rhetoric to the contrary tax cuts are not a giveaway to the rich but a huge lift to labor demand and therefore wages and dont forget oil prices tripled over this period the proof is in the pudding the early s recovery had better performance for financial markets the s&amp p increased annually during the first months of the s recovery but only annually in the first months of the current recovery but this is somewhat misleading the stock market of the early s was lifted by the end of communism but in it was hit hard by a new age of terrorism which lifted the risks of investing in the u s and around the world the s&amp p fell in the months following the attacks nonetheless since tax rates were cut in may the s&amp p is up an annual rate of a comparable performance to the early s the most interesting comparison is in the job market according to the payroll survey the current recovery has been weak with just million new jobs versus million in the first months of the s recovery but the payroll survey has major problems mostly because it cannot capture the dynamic nature of our new economy because it captures self employment and does not undercount small business the civilian jobs survey is much better it shows million new jobs in the s just slightly less than the million new jobs the survey shows for the first months of the s recovery this is amazing if you stop and think about it the s saw a massive amount of capital thrown at internet start up companies that were designed to compete against the status quo these new companies staffed up quickly and drove the demand for labor well above its normal trend the nasdaq crash changed much of this but the real shakeout from all of this disruptive technology did not hit until the s that is when the inventions of the past two decades really began to pay off the early years of new technology create a great deal of economic activity and excitement for investors who can fantasize about the future but it is the implementation phase when productivity and profits boom in the first five years of the current recovery pretax corporate profits are up a significant improvement from the growth during the first five years of the s recovery while some argue that the growth in profits is a sign that greedy rich people are benefiting at the expense of workers this is not shown in the data civilian job growth in the past five years is not statistically different than it was in the early s while wages for every income level have experienced better performance the big difference between the two periods was that tax rates were hiked in the early s while tax rates were cut in the early s and contrary to popular belief tax cuts because they lift incentives to invest always lead to a better environment for the overall population this does not mean that the massive transformation of our economy as new technology up ends all the old ways of doing things does not create anxiety or actual pain but that pain is much less prevalent than most people seem to believe while misery may love company its hard to paint a miserable picture of todays economy mr wesbury is chief economist at first trust advisors l p in lisle ill
