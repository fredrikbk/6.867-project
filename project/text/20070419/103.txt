the afternoon report grilling gonzales online edition attorney general alberto gonzales returned to capitol hill for another round of testimony on the u s attorneys uproar in an attempt to clear up conflicting statements made by himself and former aides about the attorneys firings and to save his job president bush has stood by mr gonzales a longtime friend and advisor reaching back to the presidents days as the governor of texas but calls for the attorney general to step down have come from democrats and a number of republicans democrats on the senate judiciary committee made their anger clear from the first moments of the hearing "today the department of justice is experiencing a crisis of leadership perhaps unrivaled during its year history " said sen patrick leahy of vermont the panels chairman comments from republicans were similarly bruising "as i see it you come to this hearing with a very heavy burden of proof " said ranking republican sen arlen specter of pennsylvania mr gonzales has argued that the eight federal prosecutors werent terminated for improper political reasons and also apologized for what he characterized as "management missteps" in how the firings were handled by the department in prepared testimony that was released in advance of the hearing sunday the attorney general said he "did not and would not ask for a resignation of any individual in order to interfere with or influence a particular prosecution for partisan political gain " he said today that the attorneys firings were "justified" and that he had never intended to mislead the american people the attorneys are political appointees serving at the pleasure of the president as has been so often repeated recently and the administration has the right to remove them as it sees fit but by offering imprecise and conflicting statements about the circumstances surrounding the dismissals the justice department has allowed the attorneys matter to mushroom into a four alarm political fire in his earlier statements on the matter mr gonzales said he delegated the process of selecting attorneys for dismissal to his former chief of staff kyle sampson and that he wasnt briefed on the process by his aide since then he has said that he indeed does recall a number of briefings from mr sampson but he continued to maintain at the hearing today that he had played a limited role in the process to let the attorneys go that insistence didnt sit well with the panel "we have to evaluate whether you are really being forthright " sen specter said adding that mr gonzaless description was "significantly if not totally at variance with the facts " the attorney general said that he didnt "want to quarrel" with the panel despite the blunt questioning from the committee mr gonzales seated alone at a table as cameras whirred didnt seem to be any closer to seeking the eject button mr gonzales said "the moment i believe i can no longer be effective i will resign as attorney general " during the opening statements by lawmakers mr gonzales frequently knitted his brow or shook his head in disagreement this weeks shooting rampage at virginia tech caused the hearing originally scheduled for tuesday to be postponed by the committee until today chinas economy strains at the leash economic growth in china picked up even more steam during the first

chinas growth engine could blow a gasket "if this kind of fast growth continues there is the possibility of shifting from fast growth to overheating there is that risk " said li xiaochao a spokesman for the national bureau of statistics china has been trying to slow the economy down by making some incremental adjustments to reserve requirements but to this point they amount to lobbing a pillow
