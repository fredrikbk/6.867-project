mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q i had been waiting to buy my first macintosh until this spring when apples new leopard operating system was supposed to be released now that leopard has been delayed until october i am wondering if a mac i buy now will be compatible with the new system a leopard isnt an entirely new operating system but a major new version or edition of apples mac os x operating system which made its debut in it will replace the current version which is called tiger as you noted it was supposed to become available this spring but now has been delayed until october apple will say only that "were designing leopard to deliver full functionality and performance on the widest number of macs possible and upgrading a system to run on leopard should be simple and smooth " i believe that it is highly likely that leopard will run with all its functions and with decent speed on any mac purchased today and in fact on any mac purchased in the past months or so at the least compatibility could go back much further than that though some old mac models will certainly be incompatible or will slow down unacceptably upgrading to new apple operating system versions has generally been a very good experience in recent years much better than similar windows upgrades if you intend to upgrade to leopard then the biggest downside to buying a mac now may be financial not technical if apples past practice prevails leopard is likely to cost &# for any mac purchased today if you wait until you can buy a mac with leopard preloaded you will save that extra cost also memory could be another cost issue some macs sold today have only megabytes of memory even today with the current tiger version of the operating system i recommend doubling that to gigabyte i suspect that advice will hold for leopard but nobody knows for sure so if you buy a mac now there is a risk youll have to shell out later for more memory q im trying to free up some space on my hard drive by removing programs that i dont need going through the "add remove programs" list on windows xp ive run across three separate ipod updates that date from well over a year ago is it safe to remove these earlier versions is it typical that the newest version incorporates the features of the older ones a yes the latest version of ipod software contains all the features and bug fixes from the older updates so it is safe to remove the older ones q in internet explorer is there a method to alphabetize my favorites list a i get this question at least twice a month and have answered it many times over the years but am happy to answer it again obviously microsoft hasnt made the process of alphabetizing favorites obvious enough heres what to do display your list of favorites then select one and right click on it somewhere in the menu that appears you should see a choice called "sort by name " click on that choice and your favorites should be rearranged in alphabetical order this works in both ie and ie
