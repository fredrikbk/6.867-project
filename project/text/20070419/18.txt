capital lack of well educated workers has lots of roots no quick fix its a mystery with all the energy devoted to expanding prekindergarten programs leaving no k child behind improving community colleges and sweetening aid for college students how can the u s be short of educated workers the shortage is evident from this fact employers are paying the typical four year college graduate without graduate school more than they pay high school grads twenty five years ago they were paying more employers insist on ever better educated skilled workers so this is partly a story about demand but it is also about supply the stock of educated workers isnt increasing fast enough to keep up with rising demand "this is the first generation of american born men who dont have substantially more education than their fathers generation " says lawrence katz a harvard university labor economist american women do have more schooling than their mothers but thats not sufficient to offset whats going on with men at the start of the th century most americans received only eight years of education over the next years as electricity and other technologies increased demand for skills the american high school was transformed from an institution for the few to a school for the masses by the end of the s more than half of all teenagers in the u s were going to high school "if wed seen a college movement like the high school movement wed expect half of young americans to graduate from college instead its more like or " says mr katz who is finishing a book with colleague claudia goldin on the history of education technology and wages by age americans born in had years of schooling on average at the same age americans born in the baby boomers had years among todays somethings those born in have years of schooling on average thats up a bit but the quality and quantity of educated workers isnt growing nearly as fast as it did in the past nor as fast as it needs to if the fruits of todays prosperity are to be widely shared other countries arent standing still in observes harvard economist susan dynarski only canada and finland had a higher share of young people with college degrees the latest organization for economic cooperation and development data show more than a dozen countries have equaled or surpassed the benchmark achieved by the u s in and six have a higher share of to year olds with college degrees belgium canada ireland japan korea and sweden the shortage of educated workers doesnt fully explain the widening of the gap between the u s s economic winners and losers something else is going on too this dynamic doesnt reveal much about why the incomes of the top are climbing so much nor does it explain why some college grads do so much better in the job market than others and its worth remembering that wages of the average worker with a four year degree and no graduate work havent kept up with inflation in recent years on average only those with graduate degrees have beat inflation but how come the stock of educated americans is growing so slowly the birth dearth that followed the baby boom is one cause smaller cohorts mean fewer workers even if a higher percentage of high school grads start college the overall number is restrained by the demographics another cause is the appalling fact that roughly one in five american year olds hasnt graduated from high school with some ups and downs thats been stubbornly true for the past four decades ms goldin who leavens number crunching with volunteer tutoring at a local high school speculates that one virtue of the american education system theres always a second chance may be a vice "the second chance means teenagers arent going to push themselves theyll do it later " she says but they dont and theres this about two thirds of new high school graduates are in college the following fall but many drop out before completing even a two year degree or a certificate the u s census shows that of those between ages and who report any college attendance didnt get any degree didnt even finish a single year of college ms dynarski calculates despite frequent assertions by advocates for one solution or another there is no one sure cure for this if only we got more kids into high quality pre k it wouldnt be enough if only we improved k education it wouldnt be enough if only we got more teenagers to finish high school it wouldnt be enough if only we guided more community college students to get marketable skills or to transfer to four year schools it wouldnt be enough if only we made student aid better and easier to navigate so more americans could finish four year college degrees it wouldnt be enough we have to do them all see related letter "letters to the editor better community colleges for a smarter workforce" wsj may
