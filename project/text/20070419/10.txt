boycott journalism when bbc reporter alan johnston was kidnapped in gaza and according to an unconfirmed statement by his apparent captors murdered in cold blood one naturally expected britains national union of journalists to take a strong stand indeed it has on behalf of its members the nuj has declared a boycott of tomatoes oranges cucumbers and other products from israel believe it or not while calling on her majestys government to do the same if this sounds orwellian remember that "" was inspired by george orwells stint at the bbc for years british journalists have as a group been notoriously unsympathetic to israel so much so that bbc correspondent barbara plett actually admitted publicly to weeping at yasser arafats funeral but now that the nuj has put an institutional stamp on her kind of journalism it will be more difficult for some of the leading organs of british journalism to deny as they frequently do charges of bias the nujs general secretary jeremy dear even went so far as to explain the boycott vote as "a gesture of support for the palestinian people" apparently forgetting just who mr johnstons captors are for british journalists working in the field the nujs political grandstanding cannot be entirely welcome besides the further damage this does to their reputation among israelis they also have little choice but to eat those dreadful zionist tomatoes we suspect too that mr johnstons kidnapping has probably made them feel secretly grateful for the safety and freedom that living in stable democratic israel affords meanwhile mr johnstons condition and whereabouts remain unknown a grim reminder of what goes on in the palestinian territory that israel abandoned in maybe if mr dear and his fellow travelers had paid more attention they would have thought twice about stationing their colleague in harms way see related letter "letters to the editor scorpion and frog at tale of illogic" wsj april
