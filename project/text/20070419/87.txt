politics &amp economics warming taxes u s agencies flood crop programs havent limited risks panel is tougher on co washington government auditors are warning that two federal insurance programs face "many billions" of dollars in possible damage claims because they havent acted to limit risks from storms and floods resulting from climate change the way many private insurers have at the same time a bipartisan commission that has been influential in shaping legislation on global warming proposed tougher steps than it has advocated in the past the national commission on energy policy citing a rising urgency for action proposed that lawmakers order a reduction in greenhouse gases by and require auto makers to increase the fuel efficiency of cars by as much as a year it also suggested requiring utilities to get of their electricity from renewable fuels such as wind william k reilly co chairman of the bipartisan commission said its economywide proposal to regulate greenhouse gases continues to emphasize "market based cost effective approaches " but added that events of the past two years including clearer scientific projections of future risks require a stronger bill together the two developments indicate how the debate in washington is shifting slowly but steadily toward more government action on climate change the effort to translate that sentiment into action is likely to pick up next month when the senate energy committee will try to complete a bill laying out steps for the federal government the bipartisan energy commissions work is being used as a model by senators and aides drafting that legislation in their new report on insurance programs auditors at the government accountability office the audit arm of congress noted that private insurers use computer models and other strategies to shift away from risk prone areas but federal insurers havent responded the same way to climate change concerns federal insurers "have little reason to develop information on their long term exposure " because they arent required to do so and focus on discounted premiums to sell more policies the gao said sen joseph lieberman ind conn who requested the report said it "presents another strong argument this one fiscal for adopting an economywide cap and trade anti global warming law " a "cap and trade" system would require companies that produce emissions of carbon dioxide a gas believed to contribute to climate change by trapping heat within the earths atmosphere to have permits for each ton of co they emit under the revised energy commission proposal the government would issue about half of the permits to major emitters and auction off the rest which would build up a fund that would be used to help finance power plants that can inject co into the ground and other projects that sharply lower emissions since the flood insurance program has quadrupled its coverage to almost &# trillion meanwhile crop insurers have increased their portfolio by nearly times reaching &# billion more policyholders mean that a repeat of midwest flooding that damaged crops in would cost the government five times more according to the gao
