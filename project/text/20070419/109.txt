the case for a hershey cadbury romance play for u k firm may pinch stock now but set stage for growth shares of hershey co might turn bitter before becoming sweet again with a potential tug of war for the confectionery brands of cadbury schweppes plc in the offing hershey might not be able to resist the temptation to make a bid any attempt by hershey to purchase cadburys chocolate and chewing gum brands with an estimated value of about &# billion would put a squeeze on hersheys earnings but it may be an opportunity hershey cant afford to miss analysts have bandied about various scenarios for a cadbury deal including one in which hershey could buy cadburys gum business consisting of trident and dentyne brands while kraft foods inc or wm wrigley jr co could bid for its cream eggs and milk chocolate bars if hershey were to consume a sizable chunk of cadburys brands it would position the company as a global confectionery powerhouse hershey with a market value of &# billion is near a week high of &# its valuation of about times projected per share earnings higher than most food companies is lofty "in our view a large part of the run up in hershey shares is due to the markets belief that hershey could be involved in some form of transaction with cadbury schweppes confectionery " j p morgan chase &amp co analyst pablo zuanic wrote in a note to investors mr zuanic who doesnt own hershey shares but whose firm seeks to provide investment banking services for hershey downgraded hersheys stock monday to the equivalent of a "sell" from a "hold " he said the decision was in part because the most realistic option for hershey would be to acquire all of cadburys confectionery brands a move he sees as being initially dilutive to hersheys shares in p m composite trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange hersheys shares fell one cent to &# a cadbury deal is enticing for hershey because the company is going to have a hard time expanding on its own the year old maker of hersheys kisses reeses and kit kat bars suffered a setback last year after the company failed to do enough advertising for its core products after it stopped selling limited edition items such as marshmallow filled reeses that misstep "opened up a window of opportunity for our competitors and they took advantage of it " hersheys chairman and chief executive richard lenny told shareholders gathered for the companys annual meeting tuesday in its hometown of hershey pa the company also didnt come out quickly enough with new products such as a premium line of chocolates called cacao reserve hershey lost market share to rival mars inc which boosted innovation last year and increased its advertising spending those factors combined to take a bite out of hersheys profit which fell in the fourth quarter of the first decline in more than three years plans to increase marketing this year for new products such as fiber rich hersheys chocolate hersheys antioxidant milk chocolate and special dark kissables led mr lenny in january to predict that earnings growth will be in the to range in below the companys long term target of to earlier this month the company said it had increased prices on its products to offset rising ingredient packaging and fuel costs those moves are expected to help but sanford bernstein &amp co analyst alexia howard said that with such a heavy reliance on the chocolate category and with the majority of its sales coming from the u s hershey is "boxed in " although the company recently announced two joint ventures with large confectionery companies in china and india "its going to be a long haul for them to create earnings growth" out of those deals said ms howard who has the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock she doesnt own shares of hershey and sanford bernstein doesnt have an investment banking relationship with the company a major acquisition that would give hershey a bigger international presence could eventually deliver the kind of growth and higher stock price that investors crave but other participants are expected to bid up the price for cadburys confections possibly to a premium over cadburys share price ms howard said cadbury shareholders for a long time had been pushing for the company to separate its drinks business which consists of up and dr pepper from its gum and candy business because they believed the two parts would be worth more separately last month cadbury ceo todd stitzer announced his intention to do just that mr lenny said in an interview that hershey is "constantly looking for growth opportunities in high growth emerging markets " but he was mum on cadbury given the rash of recent buyouts hershey would seem like a logical takeover target but the charitable trust that controls of the voting rights for the company could block any sale as it did in when cadbury and nestle sa jointly bid for hershey followed by an offer from wrigley jeff krumpelman senior portfolio manager at fifth third asset management which has &# billion in assets under management last year dumped more than &# million of hershey shares in the growth portfolios he manages because he worried about the companys prospects and felt the stock was overvalued "this is a transition year for hershey " he said "its a show me stock right now " twelve of the analysts surveyed by thomson financial have the equivalent of hold ratings on the stock mr krumpelman is keeping an eye on hershey which is scheduled to report first quarter results today he said if it looks like hershey eventually will be able to achieve to earnings growth he would like to get into the stock again but for now he said "theres not a lot to be excited about in their growth strategy "
