airbus faces wide gap in a orders with the paris air show less than a week away airbus has so far been unable to lure crucial customers to its proposed a jetliner despite making sweeping changes to the plane a year ago giving rival boeing co a major opportunity to cement its market dominance for the next decade airbus had hoped to shore up its credibility with customers before the industrys most closely watched trade show of the year five years behind boeing in developing a new midsize long haul jetliner airbus has booked only firm orders for the a compared with nearly for boeings proposed entrant the dreamliner the european plane maker must move quickly customers are racing to secure delivery spots in the dreamliner order book making it difficult for airbus to catch up in recent weeks airbus has offered steep discounts and other incentives for a said one airline and others familiar with the matter officials at airbus a unit of european aeronautic defence &amp space co say they are on the right track though they acknowledge they are facing an uphill battle in closing deals "its moving more slowly than some might have expected " said john leahy airbuss chief operating officer for customers in an interview "but nobodys informed me they want to cancel " the marketing offensive comes nearly a year after airbus agreed to redesign the a amid customer complaints that the jetliner wouldnt be as fuel efficient as easy to maintain or as comfortable as the while airbus is likely to announce some a orders at the show it isnt likely to make the big splash it had hoped "we sent the first a to the cemetery and many months later airbus still hasnt provided the kind of details that would make us rush to place an order " said steven udvar hazy chairman of aircraft leasing titan international lease finance corp a unit of american international group inc mr udvar hazy is expected to announce a deal with boeing for at least of the s according to people familiar with the matter the deal is valued at about &# billion at list prices although such orders usually carry big discounts mr udvar hazy confirmed that ilfc is in "advanced negotiations with boeing " the expected ilfc deal would push boeings order book for the past it is scheduled to enter service in may so far in addition to its firm orders airbus has less firm commitments for the a it hasnt managed to persuade customers to convert an additional orders and commitments for a previous version of the a into orders for the revamped model airbus has battled to convince airlines that it has turned a page on the management misjudgments and turmoil that have thwarted development of the a and led to major delays on production of the larger a superjumbo its efforts show how difficult it can be for companies to regain lost customer faith saving face is crucial for airbus if it wants to keep up with boeing in the high volume high margin long haul segment of the market which is expected to dominate airline sales in coming years amid an expected surge in international travel airbus unveiled the a three years ago but sent plans back to the drawing board three times last year airlines said they wanted it to be faster and more fuel efficient to allow them to be more responsive to shocks like fuel price increases or the threat of terrorist attacks mr udvar hazy said in an interview that he is concerned that airbus doesnt yet have a deal in place with general electric co to provide a second engine choice for the plane rolls royce plc is offering engines but airlines prefer having choices because that creates price competition and some carriers already have agreements with one engine maker or the other a ge spokesman said officials plan to meet with airbus executives during the air show but a deal is unlikely before later this summer mr leahy said engine selection is important but rarely critical airbus also has yet to adequately explain how it will deal with engineering challenges posed by plans to mount the airplanes carbon fiber composite skin panels on an aluminum skeleton futuristic composites can be lighter and more durable than traditional materials like aluminum but aluminum expands and contracts at a different rate than composites making them difficult to combine airbus remains hopeful that the a will catch on officials at dubais emirates airline which typically relishes big air show announcements say that they are still deciding between the a and the dreamliner among the incentives airbus is offering are steep discounts to the airplanes sticker price of around &# million as well as promises that airbus will cut prices on existing orders that some airlines have for other airbus models according to people familiar with the matter "of course we took full advantage of that " said dermot manion chief executive of irelands aer lingus group plc which recently ordered six as mr manion said that while "theres some work to be done" on the as design "well keep airbuss feet to the fire to meet performance guarantees " mr leahy has been scrambling to persuade us airways group inc to announce a deal at the show for between and as but airline officials are still balking according to people familiar with the situation airbus has offered to pay us airways steep penalties if it fails to deliver the a on time the airlines board is scheduled to meet today but a person familiar with the airlines deliberations say there is no guarantee it will agree to a deal "they still have to convince people they can build an aircraft that competes with the boeing aircraft " said air france president pierre henri gourgeon in an interview air france klm sa the airlines parent plans next year to select between the a and the dreamliner
