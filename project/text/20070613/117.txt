the afternoon report spenders not spent online edition betting against the american consumer has become the ultimate mugs game just when it looked like shoppers were down for the count in april they leapt off the mat in may to rush the nations checkout lines consumers helped dig the economy out of a deep hole in the first quarter of the year amid a slump in business spending and a lopsided balance of trade shoppers kept shopping and as a result growth managed to avoid stalling out completely but if economists believe consumers will ease up in the months ahead while previous hurdles to growth fade a bit data out today suggest such assumptions need revising retail sales soared during may more than double the rate that forecasters expected and not a single category turned up negative americans ate out more bought more clothes cars and electronics and did more shopping online to be certain rising gasoline prices helped pad the headline reading but even stripping away the surge at the pump sales rose a strong showing thats all the more encouraging for hinting that consumers arent being beaten down by filling up "the absolute resilience of the consumer cannot be overstated "

believed the weak housing market would choke off spending bankrolled with home equity lines of credit and refinancing or simply cause shoppers to feel less wealthy and thus less inclined to spend but obviously that hasnt happened or at least not to the extent that many feared so after a first quarter in which the economy grew at a mere clip many economists now think that with consumption holding up the second quarter will be stronger by far macroeconomic advisers said after the numbers were released that they see the quarters growth tracking at around while ethan harris of lehman brothers said he expects a second quarter expansion of about encouragingly after a quarter in which inventories were an impediment to growth they now looked poised to give the economy a kick forward business inventories grew during april news that economists at bear stearns said augurs a "further inventory build in the coming months " they too said that the chance "of a second quarter for real gdp growth continues to grow " such strong numbers would seem to vanquish any idea that the federal reserve will slash interest rates this year and a jump in may import prices would only seem to seal the case bond yields of course have been climbing lately on the perception that rising inflation will force the worlds central banks to begin increasing borrowing costs a few such as the european central bank and the peoples bank of china already have but futures markets dont think the fed is quite ready to join the rest of the gang as of this morning markets saw only about an chance of a rate increase by the end of the year while placing about odds on an increase from the current to by the close of though the news would seem to be rather bearish for bonds yields were actually easing off a little after

minarets of the key askariya shiite shrine in samarra iraq were leveled in an attack by suspected al qaeda insurgents in a jarring replay of the incident in which the mosques golden dome was destroyed last year the obliteration of the dome has been widely cited as a catalyst for iraqs current wave of sectarian bloodshed trying to prevent todays attack from leading to a flurry of reprisals iraqi

order "we call upon our iraqi people to exercise self restraint and not be dragged into reactions like those planned by the killers " mr malikis dawa party said in a statement but the attack seemed to be taking a toll upon iraqs governing coalition a member group loyal to shiite cleric muqtada al sadr said they were suspending their participation in parliament until the government takes "realistic" steps to rebuild the shrine the walkout will likely delay passage of reconciliation and oil revenue laws that the u s has urged iraqi leaders to complete gaza battles continue hamas and fatah fighters

not meet the technical requirements for designation " since china abandoned its peg in july the yuan has appreciated about against the u s dollar the currency is now allowed to float in a narrow daily
