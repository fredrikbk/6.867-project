computer power waste targeted google intel drive effort to lift energy efficiency reduce greenhouse gases mountain view calif google inc and intel corp announced an effort to get computer makers and customers to adopt technologies that reduce energy consumption the initiative sets annual targets for reducing power usage on personal computers and server systems other supporters include microsoft corp dell inc hewlett packard co international business machines corp advanced micro devices inc sun microsystems inc pg&amp e corp electronic data systems corp the world wildlife fund and the environmental protection agency pcs waste about half the power they consume while computers overall account for about of world wide energy usage backers of the effort estimated if computer users meet the targets the amount of carbon dioxide emitted to supply power for computing uses could drop by million tons a year and save more than &# billion in annual energy costs participants in the program dubbed the climate savers computing initiative must commit to produce systems and components that meet the power efficiency targets corporate customers commit to purchase power efficient computing products and use software that allows computers to waste less energy the epa already runs a program called energy star whose initial power efficiency standards for pcs the new group is using as its base line that program mainly focuses on pc power supplies which also are a focus of the new initiative urs holzle a google senior vice president estimated that most pc power supplies operate at about efficiency the energy star guidelines seek to raise that to but the new initiative sets targets to reach efficiency by he said the new program also focuses on another source of wasted energy in pcs components called voltage regulators that are installed on the main circuit board though it hasnt spelled out its guidelines mr holzle estimated the group hopes to drive efficiency of voltage regulators to about from about another focus is getting companies to turn on power management software on their pcs which puts desktop computers into a sleep mode to save energy after periods of inactivity "this is not a technology problem " said pat gelsinger a senior vice president and general manager of intels digital enterprise group "it is really an industry choice " the improved hardware comes with an upfront cost about &# more on a pc and &# more for a server mr gelsinger estimated but by getting big u s computer users to adopt the technology and then pushing the concept to other countries greater manufacturing volumes should reduce that price premium he said along the way the annual electricity bill for running an average pc could drop to less than &# from about &# if customers adopt all of the improvements recommended by the group he said some technology vendors already try to one up each with eco friendly products one of dells most potent energy conserving options is simply selling pcs with power management features switched on said jon weisblatt a senior manager for energy initiatives at the computer maker if all working pcs used that feature of the time it would save billion kilowatt hours of electricity a year he said
