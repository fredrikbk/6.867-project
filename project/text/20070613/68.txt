immigration plan b last week the senate immigration bill was smothered in its crib by the same folks who said the status quo was unacceptable now the status quo is what they have congratulations hope they like it our own view is that the current policy warts and all is preferable to some vast new enforcement regime that harasses employers for hiring willing workers this makes no more sense today than when it was first proposed years ago we dont see the logic or fairness in punishing business owners for failing to detect and oust illegal aliens in their midst especially when citizenship and immigration services has proven so inept at performing the same task employers encounter enough red tape without also being required to double as deputy immigration cops or risk facing federal raids and steep fines we also had problems with some of the measures proposed changes to our current legal immigration policies such as replacing family based migration with a government run "point system" for newcomers that smacks of industrial policy silicon valley can do a more efficient job than uncle sam when it comes to choosing and maintaining the high skilled workers it needs to keep u s companies competitive supporters are saying the senate bill can be revived but the legislation was moving in the wrong direction before last weeks senate vote one amendment cut in half the size of a guest worker program that probably wasnt big enough to begin with given the hostility on the right and left and the democratic congresss desire to deny president bush any political victory the measure is probably too ambitious to survive the better approach might be to go with a more modest stripped down version that avoids the "amnesty" canard and improves things at the margin current laws are too restrictive for some industries especially high tech and agriculture the visa quota for foreign professionals is filled faster every year the markets way of saying make more visas available regarding agriculture workers the problem isnt the number of visas available its the cumbersome and litigation prone process that employers and workers must navigate to use them as john hancock a former labor department official once put it "the current program with its multiple regulations and related requirements is too complex for the average grower to comprehend and use without the aid of a good lawyer or experienced agent " the result is more illegal immigration a more streamlined bill could address both these concerns and in the process test the bona fides of restrictionists who keep saying they like immigrants so long as theyre here legally the cap on visas for high skilled workers could be lifted or removed congress might also consider exempting from the cap foreign nationals who receive a masters degree and above from a u s school for agribusinesses the procedure for a farmworker visa could be simplified by reducing paperwork and expediting the labor certification process but the most important thing congress could do before giving up altogether is put in place a guest worker program for future immigrants if we want to reduce illegal entries lets provide more legal ways for foreigners to enter the country its worked before and it could again back in in response to a shortage of agriculture workers caused by world war ii congress authorized the bracero guest worker program for the next two decades mexican workers were permitted to enter the u s on a temporary basis to fill gaps in the labor market as the nearby chart illustrates illegal border crossings subsequently plummeted between and they fell by some in mainly in response to complaints from labor unions the program was scaled back and eventually phased out but theres no reason congress cant put in place a bracero like program with proper worker protections and receive a similar result a guest worker program for newcomers wouldnt solve the problem of the million illegal aliens already here but it would help ensure that our illegal population doesnt continue to grow the lesson of the bracero program is that if we provide immigrants with a regulated legal way to enter the country theyll use it some restrictionists will oppose this too because their real goal is a "time out" on all immigration as the tom tancredo republicans put it that may sell in some precincts on the right notably among those who worry that the country is becoming less anglo saxon but that isnt the majority view among conservatives much less the country see related letters "letters to the editor bracero immigration plan worked can similar plan work today " wsj june
