the situation in iraq prime minister nouri al maliki was quick to impose an indefinite curfew on vehicle traffic and large gatherings in baghdad miles south of samarra and asked the u s commander in iraq to send american reinforcements to the area around the shrine iraq was sending additional police forces there as well to head off what officials fear could be the latest explosion of sunni shiite violence but while the attacks may indeed provoke a new spasm of bloodshed sectarian tension and the countrys ferocious hostilities havent dimmed much since the assault in samarra that first attack may have been just the most flagrant assault in a chaos campaign that began in the summer of but it came shortly after elections that were trumpeted by the white house and generated hope among iraqis

iraq must expand its army by at least more soldiers than the bush administration had anticipated in order to free u s forces from manning checkpoints and carrying out daily patrols but even then he said iraq wont be able to secure itself for many years and even those scenarios assume iraqs leadership can make the political advances deemed mandatory for any cooling of the hatred behind the
