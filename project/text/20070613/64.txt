guy klucevsek is squeezing out a living charleston s c hiring virtuoso guy klucevsek to play the relatively small accordion part in the "rise and fall of the city of mahagonny " kurt weills operatic allegory of greed and betrayal is like paying tiger woods to compete in a miniature golf tournament but there he was in the orchestra pit at spoleto festival usa until the "gluttony" scene in act two then he and mandolin player jack morer performed a mocking little two step onstage while the character of jakob gorged himself to death mr klucevsek accepted the invitation to play in spoletos six performances of "mahagonny" because it was coupled with a booking during the festival for a solo recital of his music a rare opportunity for him in the u s these days "during my s i was starting to make a living " said mr klucevsek in an interview at his staten island n y home prior to the spoleto engagements "during my s i was able to make one now im and its borderline " he wound up participating in a chamber program as well and was peripherally involved in soprano tammy hensruds recital of weill songs the quadruple gig was intended to provide what artistic associate john kennedy calls "thematic resonance" between the festivals highly regarded presentations of music but it also served as a fitting emblem of mr klucevseks multifaceted career earnest and unpretentious he has eked out a living by performing composing and persevering in the face of public indifference to his instrument in america which is not to say he has been without recognition his dance score for david dorfmans "hey" won a bessie in he played the accordion parts in john williamss scores for two spielberg movies "the terminal" and "munich" and provided accompaniment for the audio book of novelist e annie proulxs "accordion crimes " he has also appeared in concert with the kronos quartet and other new music groups and he regularly tours europe with the "accordion tribe " a five member ensemble of composer performers he co founded in so far mr klucevsek has been unable to obtain bookings in the u s for the tribe contrast that to europe where the group has filled seat venues thanks to the showing of the stefan schwietert documentary "accordion tribe music travels" in art theaters and on art television an integral part of folk culture in europe the accordion has never fully recovered in the u s from its association with the saccharine "lawrence welk show " yet rock stars like bruce springsteen and tom waits have used accordion players on some of their albums and hip "downtown" composers like john zorn have written for the instrument lending it "outsider" cachet in recent years and thanks to mr klucevsek and others the repertoire for the instrument has expanded mr klucevsek has premiered more than works his greatest legacy among them is "manhattan cascade" by lois v vierk the title track of a klucevsek recording for cri that also includes "road runner" by mr zorn it is available through www newworldrecords org also noteworthy is "breath and bone" by jerome kitzke which has been performed about times and is from the disc "free range accordion" on starkland available on www amazon com of slovenian american descent mr klucevsek grew up in a hotbed of polka activity in western pennsylvania and began accordion studies around the age of seven later he earned a masters degree in composition from the university of pittsburgh over the years his music has evolved into a genre skirting fusion of world music jazz and contemporary composition and all of it displays a classical sensibility and expressivity one standout at his spoleto recital was the lively "dancing on the volcano " written in part of a suite of three pieces inspired by the accordion driven music of eastern europe its descending chromatic lines using both black and white keys on the keyboard sudden tempo fluctuations and rapid trills really do convey a sense of cavorting on a precipice along the way there are hints of swing polka and jazz improvisation another highlight was the world premiere of "my walk with ligeti " written in remembrance of the hungarian composer who died last fall there were traces of the repetitive minimalist rhythms once more common in mr klucevseks works and quivering trills that mimicked electronic echo effects alas while mr klucevsek has an impressive command of the accordion the instrument wears thin quickly shortly after he began the short solo etudes dances and wordless songs of "the well tampered accordion" his take on bachs "well tempered clavier" this listener began longing for some variety a duo with a singer or instrumentalist perhaps or the appealing massed sonorities possible with an ensemble like "accordion tribe " barring that a shorter program still "epilogue fantasy " the th piece proved the most substantial of the recital it opened with a series of slow solemn chords of hymn like richness the brisk "fantasy" included a range of varied textural effects then the slow tempo and brooding chords returned the piece ended with two repeated drawn out notes like the gradual cessation of breath in a peaceful death although mr klucevsek appears at barbes a brooklyn club this sunday he is not scheduled for any more concerts in the u s until november when he plays on two contemporary music series in new mexico "im loath to complain " he says "because i chose the path myself and i knew what it was like when i chose it im lucky ive been able to do it for this long " ms jepson writes about classical music for the journal
