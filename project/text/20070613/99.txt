politics &amp economics reviving the immigration bill bipartisan group weighs revisions to ensure votes washington senate backers of an immigration overhaul said the stalled legislation could be revived as soon as this month if they are able to agree on a limited set of amendments and win over more republicans concerned about border security and enforcement the bipartisan group of senators who crafted the immigration bill met last night to start developing a short list of amendments to be brought up if the debate is reopened there is some hope among backers of the bill and the bush administration that bolstering its immigration enforcement provisions would secure enough republican votes to carry the package forward many republicans are skeptical that the government would follow through on promises to secure the borders and enforce immigration laws a point raised in a closed door meeting between republican senators and president bush yesterday to reassure them immigration bill supporters are considering several changes such as guaranteeing funding for security measures and increasing penalties for immigrants who stay in the u s illegally after their visas expire sen lindsey graham r s c one of the immigration negotiators said such proposals may be included in a "confidence builder" amendment he is drafting with other republicans the amendment would set up a &# billion fund that would be available immediately after passage of the immigration bill to pay for security measures such as hiring more border patrol officers and expanding detention facilities he said if immigration legislation is to move ahead he said "the house and everyone else will need to know the money is there " some lawmakers have become increasingly vocal about the need for such assurance sens johnny isakson and saxby chambliss both georgia republicans who helped craft the immigration bill wrote president bush that he should push for an emergency spending bill that would immediately fund border and enforcement provisions in the legislation but a separate spending bill could complicate an already delicate negotiation in the senate where much support for an immigration bill centers on an approach that also would deal with the million illegal immigrants already in the u s and create a temporary worker program backed by businesses the senate bill stalled last week after it fell votes short of the needed to pass a procedural hurdle mr bush speaking to reporters after meeting with senate republicans said the legislation would improve enforcement and urged quick action "i believe without the bill its going to be harder to enforce the border the status quo is unacceptable " mr bush said homeland security secretary michael chertoff echoed that view saying that an employee verification system mandated in the bill would greatly improve the governments capabilities but is a "hostage to getting this bill out " mr chertoff indicated support for the effort being undertaken by mr graham which also may require jail time or other penalties for people who overstay their visas "its an enhanced enforcement measure that i think would be quite helpful " mr chertoff said it was unclear whether the proposal would be acceptable to democrats senate majority leader harry reid d nev said he is willing to bring up the bill again but only if republicans agree to a manageable number of amendments and prove they have more support than was evident last week "i have agreed to go forward on this if they give me a way to go forward "
