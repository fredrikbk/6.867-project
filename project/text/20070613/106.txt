politics &amp economics senate energy bill debate begins with lobbyists poised to enter fray washington kicking off whats expected to be a long winded summer on energy issues the senate started debating an energy bill intended to curb gasoline consumption and push cleaner fuels for electric power plants but its not likely to reduce near record high gasoline prices anytime soon sen jeff bingaman d n m who is shepherding the bill called for bipartisan support saying it will tap americas "limitless capacity for innovation" to produce new energy sources such as cellulosic ethanol made from other plants rather than corn currently the source of of the fuel but the bill faces pressure from muscular lobby groups including car makers that oppose tightening efficiency standards for cars and trucks coal mining companies that want to promote liquid fuels made from coal as an alternative to ethanol based fuels and oil companies which claim proposals to curb gasoline "price gouging" might actually increase prices during future oil shortages in the senates first vote on the energy bill a democrat led majority voted to to approve an amendment requiring the bush administration to implement regulations within months that would reduce u s imported oil consumption by from to some republicans opposed the measure arguing that other portions of the pending bill such as increases in automobile efficiency standards and renewable fuels requirements would achieve the same objective what could emerge by mid to late summer after the house acts on a somewhat similar measure is a "christmas tree" bill laden with trimmings for everybody even that wont be easy predicts bennett johnston a former senator from louisiana who managed a similar energy bill in "there will be some bipartisan votes but there is not a bipartisan spirit " mr johnston will be in the thick of many of the battles because hes now a lobbyist for the american petroleum institute which represents the oil industry and the edison electric institute the trade association for the nations private utilities the oil industrys top concern is one of the bills prominent features a mandate to increase the use of ethanol and other so called renewable automotive fuels to billion gallons by from the currently required billion gallons in it would require the use of more than million gallons of cellulosic ethanol which wont be commercially available without a technological breakthrough mr johnston argues that such a mandate will discourage oil refiners from increasing the nations limited oil refining capacity one of the causes of soaring gasoline prices bob dinneen president of the renewable fuels association which represents farm groups and ethanol producers counters that the mandate will send a "positive signal" to potential investors in cellulosic plants the coal industry is pushing to broaden the mandate to include automotive fuels made from coal the nations most abundant fuel environmental groups will undoubtedly weigh in arguing that coal based fuels will waste energy and water and increase pollution "theres no question we need to reduce our dependence on oil but this is the worst possible way to go about it " said deron lovaas an energy analyst for the natural resources defense council auto makers already are working on ways to weaken a proposal to raise fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks from the current average of miles per gallon to mpg between and and the nations electric utilities are split over a proposal to require power plants to produce of their electricity from wind or other renewable sources by less controversial is the bills energy efficiency standards for appliances sen bingaman figures they will save enough electricity to power million u s homes annually and enough natural gas to supply homes the targets include the first federal standards for washing machines and dishwashers cutting back water usage by congressional leaders say regulations on carbon dioxide and other emissions linked to climate change wont be included but sen amy klobuchar d minn might offer an amendment to require midsize to big businesses to report annual emissions of greenhouse gases
