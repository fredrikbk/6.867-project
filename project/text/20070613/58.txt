first active etfs might look familiar funds to have index feel with subtle differences a change every monday mutual fund companies are eager for the day when they can sell the exchange traded fund equivalent of the fidelity magellan fund in the days of peter lynch it would be actively managed knock the socks off the returns of index funds suck in buckets of investor cash and charge a hefty management fee but two regulatory filings from aer advisors inc and xshares advisors llc suggest the first active exchange traded funds will look a lot more like existing index etfs etfs resemble index mutual funds but trade on an exchange like a stock they have been one of the fund industrys biggest success stories assets rose to &# billion in the past year says the investment company institute trade group despite years of trying no company has been able to create an actively managed version that is acceptable to the securities and exchange commission instead dozens of recently launched etfs have sought to capture some of the pizazz of active funds without being actively managed these funds known as "semiactive" or "enhanced" index funds do follow indexes but their benchmarks tend to be little known or even proprietary and aim to create market beating portfolios now aer and xshares have found similar ways to run active etfs and their ideas may portend the first type of active etf that the sec will approve both companies made filings on their proposals in may and emphasize that they differ only slightly from existing funds which may make them palatable to the sec "when we developed this we spent a lot of time with our ear to the ground listening to what was being said out of the sec " says xshares chief executive anthony dudzinski the biggest sticking point in designing an active etf is whether to reveal what stocks the fund holds managers of conventional funds are wary of telegraphing their strategies to rivals and disclose their stocks only when required to periodically by the sec the holdings of etfs by contrast always more or less reflect the stocks that constitute their indexes information that is publicly available even enhanced indexes that dont reveal all the criteria they use to pick stocks publish up to date lists of their components and rarely perhaps once a quarter make changes to the roster aer an affiliate of north hampton n h stock research company alpha equity research proposes four stock funds that would differ from existing etfs in subtle ways the company would use a rules based methodology to pick stocks just like many enhanced index etfs but the aer funds would be slightly different because they would make no pretense about enshrining the rules in an "index " like etfs the aer funds would sacrifice their ability to alter the funds portfolios whenever portfolio managers wanted without notifying investors instead it would announce changes to its portfolio once a week on friday and implement them the following monday morning the xshares proposal would also require the funds to reveal more information about their portfolios than conventional mutual funds its funds would publish their holdings once a day and the value of the fund based on the previous days holdings would be updated continuously but unlike existing etfs fund managers would still be able to trade the funds holdings without revealing their moves until after the market closed xshares argues that the information would be enough to entice market makers to do arbitrage trades with the funds keeping the funds market price true to the value of its portfolio of holdings or net asset value
