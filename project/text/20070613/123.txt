the mossberg solution invite sites help start a party mypunchbowl features fewer ads than evite photo sharing possible for a while evite com was the only game in town when it came time to send out electronic invitations now almost a decade after its introduction competitors are finally giving the popular web site a reason to look over its shoulder like a beloved old car with faults that its owner no longer notices evites familiarity often masks its rough user interface its web pages are littered with advertisements many that are obnoxiously intrusive social networking users are irked that evite doesnt do enough to incorporate their favorite web sites leaving fans of myspace com and facebook feeling like the evite creation process is a bothersome step out of their online community of friends still others complain that since it was launched in evite hasnt done enough to improve its user interface and hasnt added many significant features that take advantage of so called web technologies which allow publishers to integrate more functions onto one web page rather than forcing users to refresh or change pages to accomplish tasks this week i tested mypunchbowl com www mypunchbowl com by punchbowl software a competitor to iac interactivecorp s evite www evite com both programs are free though mypunchbowl was introduced only in january it has a clean interface with fewer ads than evite in fact mypunchbowl invitees never see ads it doesnt integrate with social networking sites such as myspace com friendster or facebook but it does use message boards as well as photo and video sharing through flickr com and youtube com respectively mypunchbowl isnt perfect its invitation preview button is buried leaving the host wondering what exactly will be sent out to the guest its templates are limited to around according to the company while evites templates total roughly but all in all mypunchbowl offers a good mix of just enough and not too many features it is approachable for the tech savvy and nontechies alike sensing competition from mypunchbowl socializr an evite meets social networking application founded by the maker of friendster and others evite com has stepped up its game hotel suggestions can now be made in a hotels com section on invitations and photos can be uploaded for post party sharing in august evite plans to introduce an online party supply store and in october it will offer a mobile component the company is even testing new animated versions of its invitations i first played around with evite to refresh my memory i focused on its real purpose creating an invitation this process is started by choosing a theme like "bbq " then picking a design to go with your theme a host must then add details about the event for guests and then enter guests emails i found a bbq invitation design in the new animated style but couldnt figure out how to see what its animation looked like before i sent it which was frustrating when i brought this to evites attention it acknowledged the bug hosts can easily see previews of regular invitations as well as the exact email that the guest will receive evite allows for personalization in its reply style section this section lets the host create party related categories for responses rather than just yes no and maybe an invitation for a night of card playing might for example categorize the yes responses as "im all in " evite responses are a big reason people like using it as it lets all guests see who is coming and what they said in their response the party planning section in evite was introduced in the past year it includes some useful tools such as a drink calculator to estimate how much alcohol youll need for an event a party checklist and event planning ideas i used one tool called the party budget estimator to see if it guessed the right amount spent on a bridal shower i co hosted and it was pretty accurate mypunchbowl com tries to distinguish itself by offering start to finish steps for the events host this procedure begins with pick a date so that you can offer guests a few potential suggestions to see which one theyd prefer guests can be distinguished as vips helping you give their vote more merit and you can tell guests the date you prefer once a date is chosen a save the date email is sent out with a message board on which guests can start chatting about the event the full invitation follows this followed by the after party message board on which photos and videos can be shared via flickr com and youtube evite also offers to send out save the date cards before an event and it incorporates pick a date options in the actual invitation itself i got started on mypunchbowl without signing up for an account which was a treat i got halfway through the invitation creation process before deciding i liked it enough to sign up i started an account by opening a small window in my current screen entering my name email and password and continued making the invitation right where i left off one glaring problem with mypunchbowl was that i couldnt figure out how to preview my invitation before i sent it to guests i ended up crossing my fingers and sending the invitation out anyway later someone from the company showed me an obscure preview link on the bottom left side of a page but this didnt cut it mypunchbowl says it knows this is a big problem and that it intends to fix this and other problems in the next few months i also noted that the text box where i typed a message to guests didnt offer various fonts or colors nor did it offer to spell check my message evite offers all of these things and responses on mypunchbowls invitations are limited to yes no or remind me later if guests want to respond in more detail they are directed to a message board evite users may not adapt to the message board method i was able to instantly add a google map to the mypunchbowl invitation at the press of a button which is helpful mypunchbowl also gives users a chance to more tightly control guest responses such as requesting that guests respond a certain number of days prior to the party change and variety are welcome for electronic invitations after all it makes sense that a hip host would want to be on the cutting edge starting with the invitation mypunchbowl requires a bit of a learning curve and doesnt have as many extra features as evite for people who might not understand the idea of mypunchbowls message boards evite will remain the favorite but the younger competitors cleaner interface coupled with its plans for improvements this summer might make it an appealing option for planning your next get together edited by walter s mossberg email mossbergsolution wsj com
