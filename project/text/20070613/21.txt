business bookshelf gambling on the big win what really matters by john pepper yale university press pages &# when procter &amp gamble co was nearing the launch of dawn dishwashing liquid in the company debated whether to frame its marketing around the soaps superior cleaning ability or to focus more narrowly on its distinctive grease cutting action some executives fretted that emphasizing just one aspect of cleaning could limit sales but ultimately the dawn team placed the riskier wager launching the tagline "dawn gets grease out of your way " thereafter grease fighting became the benchmark against which all dish soaps were judged writes former p&amp g chairman and ceo john pepper in "what really matters " or at least it was the benchmark for nearly years in the late s colgates palmolive dish soap began challenging dawns dominance by introducing new fragrances and packaging dawn "had become too singularly focused on the benefit of superior grease removal " mr pepper concedes "we had committed the cardinal sin of giving consumers a reason to switch from dawn " p&amp g fought back with new dawn fragrances spruced up bottles and even an improved grease fighting formula exhaustively chronicling the lessons in branding and management that he acquired during his four decade career at p&amp g mr pepper offers a rare glimpse into a notoriously insular corporate culture he also provides through detailed anecdotes and frank admissions of business missteps a well rounded portrait of the challenges of managing mega brands for a consumer products titan and one of the worlds biggest advertisers the books folksy title and narrative tone belie mr peppers underlying competitive grit which serves him well in elevating company insider tales about seemingly mundane products such as laundry detergent and toothpaste into suspenseful and substantial case studies in mr pepper joined p&amp g following his graduation from yale and a three year stint in the navy he steadily climbed through the ranks of the company until he was named its chief executive and chairman over the course of his career mr pepper witnessed and eventually helped engineer p&amp gs transformation from a u s centric company of employees into a global empire employing more than people describing his climb up the corporate ladder mr pepper recounts his own successes and mistakes along the way not just as simple bits of biography but also as guideposts to building leading brands each chapter ends with a list of questions for readers to consider as they reflect on their own experiences among the lessons that mr pepper wants to impart is the importance of going for "big wins" instead of small ones its a bit of advice that any business book might offer but in this case mr peppers championing of the "big win" strategy gives us an insight into how p&amp g has secured market leadership positions with so many household goods world wide in the year old mr pepper was in charge of p&amp gs italian business which then faced high inflation government imposed price controls and a price war instigated by a competitor to boost p&amp gs dismal profits in the italian market mr pepper decided to introduce a new brand either p&amp gs monsavon a leading soap in france or the companys pampers diapers a u s success monsavon could rely on existing distribution channels but pampers would require a sizable and chancy investment because the disposable diaper market barely existed in italy at the time mr pepper decided pampers could wait and introduced monsavon as it turned out monsavons french pedigree held little appeal for italians meanwhile a local competitor introduced its own line of disposable diapers and won market dominance before p&amp g finally brought pampers to italy p&amp g eventually had to form a joint venture with the local company today mr pepper writes pampers is the leading diaper in italy "but we could have achieved that position a decade earlier at a far lower cost if i had taken a long term view in we could have gone for the big win rather than what i thought would be the safe win which turned out to be no win at all " that lesson was still with mr pepper when years later he led p&amp gs international business and contemplated how best to enter eastern and central europe after the berlin wall came down p&amp g decided to invest in regional plants allowing the company to introduce quickly several different products local sourcing also meant that p&amp g could offer lower prices today the author says these plants are among the companys most cost efficient and have become sources for exports beyond the region aside from presenting the well told case studies that mr pepper either witnessed or was directly involved in "what really matters" in many ways reads as a manifesto on the advantages of a promote from within corporate structure by hiring most employees directly out of school p&amp g has developed its own culture even character which mr pepper asserts is the companys most important competitive strength "there is no way i can imagine p&amp g being able to navigate so well through the major changes and challenges that it faced in recent years if it hadnt developed a community of colleagues who had grown up together in pursuit of common goals " amid the all too familiar contemporary business tales of accounting scandals ethics lapses and getting ahead by job hopping from one company to another mr peppers coming of age story as a marketer and ultimately as chief executive offers an unusually compelling argument for the benefits of promoting ones own the motivation it develops the loyalty it breeds and the critical passion for dish soap it fosters ms byron writes about the consumer
