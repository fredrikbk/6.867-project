michael breckers coda a sax virtuosos final cd among the jokes musicians share while filling time on the road theres one that asks "how many saxophonists does it take to screw in a light bulb " the wry answer elicits knowing smiles and speaks a truth that almost every modern day reed player must face eventually "twenty one one to screw it in and the rest to discuss how michael brecker would have done it " mr brecker who died this past january at age while putting the final touches on "pilgrimage " his last studio album was arguably the best known and easily the most influential saxophonist to come of age in the rock era from his point of arrival in he grabbed the ears of his generation with a fluid virtuosity on the tenor saxophone he had an uncanny ability to construct passionate solos that slid seamlessly into pop ballads rock tunes and funk workouts he was just as dexterous adding shade and intensity to radio hits by aerosmith james brown and paul simon his second solo on simons "still crazy after all these years" is considered a miniature masterpiece as he was playing with jazz giants like chick corea mccoy tyner and elvin jones perhaps mr breckers most singular achievement was garnering star like status among general music fans while maintaining the respect of jazz purists not to mention the highest regard of his fellow musicians many of mr breckers recordings as a leader or as a member of jazz rock fusion ensembles like the brecker brothers and steps ahead are now considered primers for serious instrumentalists to those who chose to pick up the saxophone after mr brecker his astounding technique and emotional depth remain required listening "i began studying in the s and there were only a few modern day saxophone players that most of us focused on " says saxophonist ravi coltrane "michael was just another caliber of musician what he was playing nobody else could play technically and conceptually he was very methodical " pianist brad mehldau who performs on mr breckers final album stands as proof of the saxophonists sway beyond reed players "in high school there was a group of us we had what we called breckeritus the tenor players were playing brecker licks verbatim or trying to and it was all rubbing off on my very fledgling vocabulary we were all trying to figure out what he was doing " mr breckers approach was widely imitated to a fault according to some "we used to call them brecker heads guys who would play in a brecker style just being brash and doing whatever they could do to play all those licks " mr coltrane recalls "but michael always maintained an elegance and a dignity about what he was doing it wasnt just a hyper development of technique out of proportion with the emotional connection every note he played made sense " so what made mr breckers style so distinctive and dangerously seductive the answer as is often the case with musicians lies in his history born in mr brecker grew up at a time when walls between musical as well as political and cultural categories were crumbling at a rapid rate from the late s into the s rock bands were jamming over extended modal passages while jazz groups like those led by trumpeter miles davis were breaking ground by adding rock and funk rhythms to their acoustic mix along with electric guitars and keyboards in the best sense mr breckers musical priorities reflected the prejudice free ideals of the day to him music played in any style or in any key offered an equal opportunity to improvise to his contemporaries like former davis saxophonist dave liebman mr brecker was among the first of his generation to successfully translate the jazz innovations of the s especially those of john coltrane "he was able to take the incredible detail the language of coltrane and find a place for it in rock and popular music without betraying either side " recalls mr liebman who later co founded the group saxophone summit with mr brecker "in the early s his sound became the thing every musician every producer wanted it on their record and michael was the one to give it to them " guitarist pat metheny who also performs on "pilgrimage" was when he heard one of the saxophonists most celebrated contributions to rock radio in "i was driving by a major intersection in my town lees summit mo i heard james taylors single dont let me be lonely tonight with this tenor player on it i just had to pull over i was like thats the best tenor sound and best tenor conception who is that playing that post coltrane style of saxophone " coltrane was indeed a guiding influence at the start "i remember going out and buying a love supreme " mr brecker said in of coltranes popular album "i listened to that record every day in my bedroom its still etched in my psyche " though he developed a lifelong enthusiasm for other sax based improvisers like wayne shorter joe henderson and sonny rollins mr brecker remained primarily focused on coltrane in a number of ways his own history paralleled that of his inspiration both reached maturity in the philadelphia area and relocated to new york city all the while studying and practicing on the sax with the intention of knowing the instrument completely "im constantly discovering more things that the acoustic saxophone can do " mr brecker once said "i dont feel its been pushed to the limits yet " both became hooked on hard drugs during their s then kicked their habits after reaching rededicating themselves to their musical path like coltrane mr brecker initially established himself as a sideman sessionman and band member hesitating to strike out on his own until he was in his s "i quite honestly was scared to do it i preferred sharing the pains and successes " he admitted around the time his first solo album finally appeared in and as coltrane added soprano sax to his creative arsenal in midcareer mr brecker also expanded to a more demanding one and pioneered the use of the ewi or electronic wind instrument essentially a reed driven synthesizer "theres a part of me that feels like im playing this museum piece " mr brecker said of the saxophone "now the tables are turning partly because of the new technology im very happy to be in the time im in " mr brecker was happiest when creating music and averse to most career oriented activity he accepted accolades and accomplishments like grammy awards with extreme humility and agreed to interviews only reluctantly preferring to spotlight those who inspired him he spoke of his deepest passions through his horn in trumpeter roy hargrove and keyboardist herbie hancock toured with mr brecker as directions in music a tribute to the music of davis and coltrane mr breckers solo rendition of the latters "naima" was the show stopper eliciting standing ovations as he hopped from the saxophones lower to upper register and back with fervent agility during a directions tour in mr brecker discovered he had developed myelodysplastic syndrome a rare cancer of the blood marrow a well publicized two year search for a stem cell donor ensued a partial matching transplant from his daughter allowed him to gather his strength and last july he made a surprise appearance at the jvc jazz festival in new york it was his last public performance a month later mr brecker was strong enough to revisit some compositions he had been working on with the arranger gil goldstein and return to the studio "pilgrimage" is the happy result of those sessions a nine track album that bristles with the band mr brecker assembled not only messrs hancock mehldau and metheny but drummer jack dejohnette and bassist john patitucci "pilgrimage" is an inspiring tour de force that measures up to the promise of its all star cast vibrant and edgy solos abound and varying moods and memorable themes color much of the album in its energy and upbeat visceral flavors it transcends any tendency to hear it as an epitaph theres but one slow ballad "when can i kiss you again " that is more soaring than doleful listening for the variance between mr hancocks and mr mehldaus keyboard styles is a delight in itself theres a playful piece of abstraction that slyly suggests a funky groove "loose threads" and a fast lane romp that relies on a dizzying series of rhythmic shifts "anagram" that messrs dejohnette and patitucci deliver mr breckers muscular tenor "the mean time" and urgent ewi triggered vocal cries "tumbleweed" testify to the restorative power of music the lyrical heart of the album reveals itself on the title track opening with a coltrane like benediction passing through a series of uplifting improvisations and closing with a bold and confident thrust "pilgrimage" also captures mr breckers startling growth as a composer already suggested in on his album "wide angles " significantly "pilgrimage" features all new material written by mr brecker alone flush with a feeling of risk taking and a strong sense of moving forward had he not departed who knows what steps lay ahead mr kahn is the author of "the house that trane built the story of impulse records" w w norton
