most states is dominated by small local operators financed by construction loans from larger regional banks as well as small local lenders stock market listed home builders such as hovnanian enterprises inc and kb home represent only about a third of the u s home building industry according to the public home builders council of america so the trend of private local operators running into trouble could affect more lenders making a recovery in regional banking further off than some expect "meyer sutton is a small bankruptcy but it isnt the only one out there " says keith long head of
