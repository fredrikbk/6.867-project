late june through which individuals and organizations can make donations of at least &# to microfinance institutions these financial institutions offer loans and other services to hardscrabble entrepreneurs in developing countries who dont have access to banks microfinance is gaining traction as both a charitable cause and an investment citigroup is hoping its new fund the citi microfinance donor fund will give private bankers and financial advisers at the firms smith barney brokerage division another reason to discuss clients philanthropic interests and ways to focus their charitable giving to make a difference in the process it hopes advisers can deepen their relationships with clients scott hayes a citigroup private banker in palo alto calif says microfinance strikes a personal note with many of the entrepreneurs venture capitalists and private equity participants he advises citigroups new fund mr hayes said is an "another opportunity for our clients to engage in their passions and look at making an impact in a philanthropic way " donors interested in microfinance should be aware that it doesnt offer the same recognition such as dinners or buildings in ones name as other charitable pursuits do said melanie schnoll begun director of philanthropic services which advises clients on making charitable contributions it can be difficult to see ones gift at work because of the physical distance between donors and recipients as well as the slow pace of change citigroup plans to give donors regular updates on the projects theyre funding and has hired an outside firm to provide independent analytical reports ms schnoll begun said "so our clients can really see whats going on behind the scenes and how were using the capital " the fund will open june for irrevocable contributions of at least &# it will remain open for months and citigroup will begin making grants to microfinance institutions shortly after that citigroup plans to distribute the money it has collected within two years of the fund closing ms schnoll begun said citigroup had considered a minimum contribution twice the &# amount and a limit on the number of donors it decided however to open the fund to more people while keeping the minimums high enough to attract sizable donations and serious microfinance donors the minimum contribution is still at least double that of a donor advised fund a popular vehicle that allows investors to establish a fund account receive an income tax deduction the year they contribute and decide where to direct their funds at a later date donors in the u s will be able to take a tax deduction for their contribution to citigroups microfinance fund but an advisory committee rather than the donor will direct the contribution the advisory committee which citigroup says is made up of representatives from the bank and microfinance experts from outside organizations will request proposals from microfinance institutions and decide which ones should receive grants the advisory committee will seek proposals as the fund is accepting donations in an effort to expedite the eventual distribution of grants and match the number of grant recipients with donation levels the board of directors of citi gift inc a nonprofit organization that oversees citigroups donor advised funds will approve the grant recommendations from the microfinance funds advisory committee citigroup will make grants of up to &# for projects in five areas technology energy and the environment banking services in rural areas life cycle needs such as financial literacy and the promotion of long term savings and the expansion of microfinance institution capabilities such as back office systems and human resource training ms schnoll begun said the grants are meant to spur the maturation of microfinance institutions that arent yet able to cover all their costs through their operations and dont have the track record to attract investments or secure loans from big banks such as citigroup citigroup formed a london based microfinance group three years ago which worked with the firms business units to develop commercial relationships with microfinance institutions that includes making loans and helping them access capital markets meanwhile citigroup foundation the banks charitable arm is an active microfinance donor citigroup plans to roll out other special interest funds the environment is one area of interest but first wants to see how things go with the microfinance fund depending on the results it could also launch a second microfinance fund ms schnoll begun said citigroups focus on microfinance institutions that are approaching self sufficiency and the size of its grants make good sense says chuck waterfield a consultant to microfinance institutions and an adjunct professor at columbia universitys school of international and public affairs mr waterfield isnt involved with citigroups charitable fund grants of up to &# can give institutions a significant boost without overwhelming their staff and systems he said "theres definitely a substantial role still needed for grants specifically working for organizations that arent yet sustainable " mr waterfield said the challenge for the funds advisory committee he said will be determining which emerging microfinance institutions have the capacity desire and management skills to make their way into the top tier of self sustaining microfinance institutions
