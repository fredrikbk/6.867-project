business world this years man behind the tree being a shrewd bunch the private equity industry presumably has gotten the message when vast new fountains of wealth open up in the economy congress must receive its ransom in campaign donations delivering the wagged finger were none other than max baucus and charles grassley chairman and ranking member of the senate finance committee whove taken to musing aloud about how the tax codes treatment of private equitys lately fabulous profits might be revised the bipartisan nature of the initiative should reassure readers that theres no philosophical issue here its purely bidness you private equity have been remiss in your patriotic duty cough up anyone who recalls the junk bond wars of the s will notice a pattern then too congress was awash in proposals for taxing the takeover industry by eliminating the interest deduction for junk bond interest by imposing an excise tax on assets acquired in a hostile takeover etc these ideas came to naught not least because of the fright the proposals put into the stock market but the endless debate unlimbered a delicious flow of campaign dollars from all concerned which brings us to "carried interest" the form in which private equity folks extract their extravagant compensation in the mists of time i e the s it was settled by the tax authorities that when passive investors in a partnership agree to share any future profits with a managing partner the transfer of this "carried interest" will not be taxable at the time its granted furthermore any profits under the deal will be taxable as capital gains not income which today means not having picked up their papers and noticed the riches now being realized by private equity partnerships various observers labor journalist academic have begun to complain that this treatment is inappropriate and preferential they gripe that since the managing partner is being paid for managing i e work he or she should have to pay full income tax like any other worker the counter argument an ordinary worker gets his wage whether or not a venture is a success a pe managing partner receives a share of the profits only if there are any the counter counter argument the same is true of ceos in the corporate world who receive stock options but they still have to pay full income tax on their option gains the back and forth might tell you one thing in the name of "tax fairness " or the rather more manageable principle that tax policy should treat like taxpayers in like fashion theres a lot that could stand fixing in our tax code the abominable tax distortions behind our health care woes come to mind but another principle of good governance one that congress actually frequently honors is that its a bad idea to introduce sweeping tax changes to an industry after hundreds of billions have already been invested never say never but congress is especially reluctant when that industry has been a driving factor behind higher stock prices bringing happiness to broad classes of voters but the message has been received private equity has now set up a washington trade group and has opened its pockets to politicians with barack obama being a special heartthrob oh happy day for members of the house and senate tax committees who lived for years off the junk bond wars and now will live for years off the private equity plutocrats but what about the economic issue any tax is a disincentive so lets just say the tax code imposes less of a disincentive than it might to what private equity does buying overhauling and reselling companies is there a public interest reason suddenly now to use a tax policy bludgeon to reduce the attractiveness of this business the private equity boys arent bill gates thomas edison or walt disney creating new wealth through visionary talent and innovation they are managers and their success tells us how much potential wealth is still lying around unrealized even amid our hypercompetitive capital markets because of the resistance of corporate managers to making certain kinds of decisions yes private equity may sweep in and do the dirty work of shutting down an unprofitable factory and laying off workers but equally its arrival may mean spending more money on customer service or advertising even though it dings reported earnings it may mean undertaking risky but lucrative investment projects that would otherwise be unappealing because a public company has a higher cost of capital and is less trusted by its investors and yes the tax code doesnt hurt either so many corporate assets have been fleeing into the hands of private equity partly because private equity has no inhibition about dangling bigger vastly bigger rewards in front of its decision makers than public companies dare to do didnt catch it the first time the booming private equity business tells us that intelligent engaged profit seeking investors believe they have something to gain by bestowing even bigger payoffs on managements for decision making that increases value there we have debunked a generations worth of journalism which holds that large and rising ceo compensation is a market failure an aberration theres no doubt that the federal tax code by allowing "carried interest" to be treated as capital gains facilitates the outbidding of public companies for managerial talent but congress should note that the urge itself comes from the drive by investors to reap the gains from making businesses more efficient and the pursuit of efficiency however dislocating in the short run makes society wealthier in the long run see related letter "letters to the editor carried interest change in tax rules is senseless" wsj june
