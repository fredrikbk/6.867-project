bluesocket sizes up competitors bluesocket inc has spent the past eight years proving its technology in a highly competitive market the company which sells equipment to manage and secure wireless local area networks boasts that it has increased revenue each quarter by introducing competitive network components and by bolstering its international presence but time may be running out after six equity rounds adding up to more than &# million industry analysts say the unprofitable company is one of dozens of tech bubble survivors that have limited growth potential because they are being overmatched by bigger competitors the burlington mass company says it isnt looking to go public or get acquired anytime soon but simply to ride out the strong growth in the wireless lan market when bluesocket entered the wireless networking market in the company found itself with a group of products in a technology space crippled because of a flawed encryption standard that exposed networks without specially designed access point gateways or products that help secure and manage lans as universities public institutions and hospitals began to slowly go wireless they turned to companies like bluesocket and its early competitors reefedge networks inc and vernier networks inc all of which offered network gateways to keep information secure a large syndicate of venture capitalists ascent venture partners boulder ventures intel capital ironside ventures menlo ventures ridgewood capital st paul venture capital and osborne capital all invested early in bluesocket by just as the market for wireless lan began to heat up the wireless industry fixed its encryption problems this development allowed for the creation of thin access points which simply route information through a central processor and dont demand the use of expensive security gateways to keep intruders out thin access points were in most cases easier to scale for large numbers of users and cheaper to install than their predecessors and companies such as airespace inc aruba networks inc symbol technologies inc and trapeze networks inc rushed in with the new products cisco systems inc entered the market in by acquiring airespace inc for &# million shifting the momentum in its favor while reefedge went out of business and vernier changed focus bluesocket persevered even after the reengineering of the wireless encryption standard drove down demand for its components in bluesocket introduced its own line of thin access points that president and chief executive mads lillelund says have sold tremendously well especially within the markets the company focuses on health care government and large scale general enterprise bluesockets reputation as a creator of secure networks kept the company popular among those portions of the market but analysts say the company didnt have the sales force to catch up to those businesses that had introduced thin access points two years earlier "when you look at bluesocket among the other wireless lan vendors out there you have to wonder what do they really offer thats not already being offered by someone with better deployment " chris silva an analyst with forrester said "i wouldnt say they are as technologically strong as other vendors and as the basic wireless networking business begins to commoditize in a few years its those value added products that are going to matter most " for its part bluesocket says it can match its competitors offerings but at a lower cost "before we lacked a fully wrapped hardware platform but that has changed and you will begin to see our market share increase " mr lillelund said "were cheaper than cisco cheaper than aruba and if we are able to get to the table to compete on a bid well win of the time " the company which has employees plans on reaching profitability for the first time during in the fourth quarter of mr lillelund said bluesocket recorded revenue growth though he declined to provide specific numbers with all the competition though bluesocket may have a tough time attracting a buyer or making it out onto the public markets today cisco controls about to of the wireless lan equipment market motorola inc which recently acquired wlan provider symbol networks inc is competing with aruba networks and trapeze networks for the no spot according to analysts aruba went public in march and now has a market capitalization of around &# billion abi research vice president stan schatt says another challenge bluesocket faces is that most of its patents are tied to wireless security technology and not other functions such as network scalability and data management now in high demand mr lillelund said he disagrees with that assessment and says the problem has less to do with issues of technology and more to do with issues of sales force size and the companys inability to penetrate the market to the same degree as companies like aruba to get around those problems bluesocket is looking to grow internationally instead of going against the competition head on domestically the company now does business in china europe and russia former bluesocket chief executive eric janszen who ran bluesocket from to and is an investor in the company through seed stage firm osborne capital said the real challenge for the company wont be gaining market share in the short term but coming up with a product that lets it leap ahead in the same way its competitors jumped forward in "there is plenty of opportunity for a really smart organization to leap forward " mr janszen said "the question is do they have a better vision to meet the requirements of enterprise customers in the next cycle " the size of the wireless lan market should double over the next several years hitting more than &# billion by according to inder singh formerly of prudential equity group while there is little chance any company will overtake cisco mr singh said the next few slots in the rankings are still up for grabs "im not ready to write these guys off yet " mr singh said "there is a lot of room in this market for second tier vendors that focus on the verticals for specific enterprises for bluesocket that growth could be found in the finance or insurance industry because of their reputation for security " bluesockets investors dont seem ready to write the company off either "i think the reality is that we saw the initial years of investment to be relatively disappointing but that has changed " brian j girvan a partner at ascent said "we think its a fast growing company in a huge market that is only going to be better positioned as time goes on we think there is a pretty clear path ahead "
