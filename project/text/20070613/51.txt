dont ask who cares last weeks forum of republican presidential hopefuls offered the country some troubling insight into the thinking of leading gop candidates in particular the five who responded to questions about the clinton era "dont ask dont tell" policy governing military service by gays and lesbians showed a disturbing move away from conservative principles in favor of what smells strongly of political expediency or timidity as a conservative republican member of congress from to i was hardly a card carrying member of the gay rights lobby i opposed then and continue to oppose same sex marriage or the designation of gays as a constitutionally protected minority class service in the armed forces is another matter the bottom line here is that with nearly a decade and a half of the hybrid "dont ask dont tell" policy to guide us i have become deeply impressed with the growing weight of credible military opinion which concludes that allowing gays to serve openly in the military does not pose insurmountable problems for the good order and discipline of the services asked about reconsideration of the dont ask dont tell policy in favor of a more open and honest approach the simplistic responses by several republican presidential candidates left me and i suspect many others questioning whether those candidates really even understood the issue or were simply pandering to the perceived "conservative base " the fact is equal treatment of gay and lesbian service members is about as conservative a position as one cares to articulate why first true conservative political philosophy respects the principles of individual freedom and personal privacy particularly when it comes to what people do in private the invasive investigations required to discharge a service member are an unconscionable intrusion into the private lives of american citizens worse while supporters of dont ask dont tell claim the policy only regulates behavior and not identity the distinction is disingenuous a service member could be discharged for being overheard remarking that "i can stay later today since my partner will be taking the dog for a walk " second and on a more practical level the ban on gays openly serving in our armed forces is hurting a military that is stretched thin putting further strain on an institution conservatives claim to love the u s has fired over people under the current policy and in the process has lost over service members with "mission critical skills " including arabic linguists researchers at the ucla school of law have found that lifting the ban could increase the number of active duty personnel by over because the military cant fill its slots it has lowered its standards extended tours of duty and increased rotations further hurting morale and readiness conservatives are supposed to favor meritocracy rewarding ability especially in the armed forces instead the military is firing badly needed capable troops simply because theyre gay and replacing them with a hodge podge that includes ex cons drug abusers and high school dropouts third the gay ban wastes money according to a blue ribbon commission made up of academics and prominent defense leaders including former defense secretary william perry the gay ban has cost taxpayers over &# million and even this figure did not include many of the actual costs of rounding up gays and lesbians firing them and training their replacements the training of an arabic linguist alone costs some &# that of medical or aviation specialists can cost up to a quarter million dollars for all these reasons many conservatives and other former supporters of the policy have concluded its time to change in march former republican senator and army veteran alan simpson announced he no longer supported policy of dont ask dont tell and believed it was crucial to lift the ban which in his view has become "a serious detriment to the readiness of americas forces " a handful of other republicans have signed onto the military readiness enhancement act which would repeal the current ban on openly gay troops in january gen john shalikashvili former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff became the highest ranking military official to call for repeal joining a growing chorus of mostly retired military brass to oppose the policy attitudes both within and outside the military have shifted greatly since when the current policy was formulated three quarters of returning iraq and afghanistan vets said in a december zogby poll that they are "personally comfortable" interacting with gay people a majority of those who knew someone gay in their unit said the persons presence had no negative impact on unit morale among the public at large polls show consistently that roughly two thirds of americans favor letting gays serve including majorities of republicans regular churchgoers and even people with negative attitudes toward gays these reasons and the credibility of many experts making the arguments have convinced me that there is little reason left to believe gays openly serving would break the armed forces americans want strong moral leadership and they are quick to sniff out pandering and expediency it sure would be nice if the presidential wannabes were as quick to realize this mr barr is a former republican congressman from georgia see related letters "letters
