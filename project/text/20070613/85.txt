neiman marcuss cusp tries for younger crowd dallas burton tansky chief executive of neiman marcus group inc has long cultivated the cachet of the century old retailer by focusing on pricey designer goods and limiting expansion to two stores a year but with neiman marcuss private equity owners expected to eventually take the company public mr tansky is likely to face pressure to find new ways to sustain the companys impressive sales growth his challenge is how to attract shoppers in their s and s without alienating neimans core clients in their s one experiment neiman marcus has in the works is a chain of boutiques called cusp offering womens apparel with a young casual vibe and lower prices than that sold in neiman marcus stores in a bid to develop a new identity the boutiques stocked with short dresses designer jeans t shirts and other casual duds dont carry any reference to neiman marcus in packaging or displays since last summer neiman marcus has opened cusp stores in los angeles washington d c and mclean va a fourth is scheduled to open in a chicago suburb in august plans to sell online are under discussion though no firm date has been set neiman marcus executives have said they hope to eventually have cusp stores in to locations that would be nearly double the neiman marcus stores whose typical shopper tends to favor classic tailored big name designer clothing sales of the "contemporary" fashions that cusp focuses on last year rose a pace nearly double that of womens wear overall according to npd group a market research firm based in port washington n y "if cusp takes off it would really be exciting " says the year old mr tansky a year veteran of neiman marcus group who became its ceo in after running its bergdorf goodman and neiman marcus stores units but he adds the cusp concept is in the "early r&amp d stages " the new boutiques however face a number of challenges one of which is that they are arriving late to the world of fashion shops selling contemporary looks so called portfolio retailing is spreading with a growing number of companies rolling out new chains to create excitement to attract young shoppers who tend to be eager for something new for instance pacific sunwear of california inc last year launched the shoe store chain one thousand steps and j crew group inc created madewell a separate line of casualwear stores other luxury retailers are also experimenting with new stores often aimed at younger less affluent consumers the nine rugby boutiques operated by polo ralph lauren corp for instance carry shirts and pants aimed at a college age crowd precious jewelry specialist tiffany &amp co for the past three years has been developing the iridesse chain of shops carrying less expensive pearl necklaces and earrings barneys co op stores an offshoot of barneys new york have gained a following among young shoppers who mix and match designer goods however the strategy can be costly and risky warns randal konik an analyst who follows the retail industry for bear stearns "in general when retailers come up with new concepts they add execution risk they are putting more items on their plate " he says in the case of neiman marcus he adds "you have a company going after a younger demographic where they didnt have an expertise before " neiman marcus has had trouble with retail offshoots in the past in the late s it opened the galleries of neiman marcus a chain of three smaller stores selling jewelry and home decor items in seattle cleveland and phoenix they have closed the retailer also has tried branching into other businesses acquiring majority stakes in brand name luxury goods companies such as kate spade accessories and the purveyor of laura mercier makeup since neiman marcus was acquired by private equity firms texas pacific group and warburg pincus in it has divested both stakes retail industry executives have increasingly speculated that neiman marcus might go public mr tansky declined to comment on that prospect as did both private equity firms the idea behind cusp is to reach shoppers who want to buy designer goods but are uncomfortable with the chandeliers marble floors and grand artwork neiman marcus stores are known for the los angeles cusp boutique which opened in september has a natural theme garments are displayed on faux trees or on twig fences jewelry is shown in wooden bowls with necklaces placed atop dried lentils mr tansky notes cusp stores are to square feet compared with a typical square feet or more for a neiman marcus cusp is "focused on a customer with a contemporary point of view who likes to mix and match her wardrobe from various designers " mr tansky says in contrast to many traditional neiman marcus shoppers who tend to dress nearly head to toe in a particular designers goods unlike neiman marcus whose signature is a hefty catalog known as the book the boutiques are marketed almost entirely online at a web site www blogonthecusp com one cusp boutique in washingtons georgetown neighborhood for instance has live rock music events promoted by email to shoppers who have signed on to the cusp "it girl" list similarly the boutiques carry styles that arent found in neiman marcus stores including tattoo inspired ed hardy sneakers and jeans and pants from smaller label level but roughly of the goods now at cusp such as high end manolo blahnik shoes marc by marc jacobs bags and diane von furstenberg dresses for instance can also be found at neiman marcus says karen katz president and chief executive officer of the neiman marcus stores unit she says the overlap eventually will fall to about and that cusp will have its own separate buying team pricing is different though cusp stores offer an assortment of tops for under &# such as ed hardy t shirts for up to &# or tokidoki tops for &# among its highest priced items are a &# tory burch sequin tank dress for summer and an &# see by chloe dress for fall in contrast much of the finer merchandise at neiman marcus stores is priced in the thousands of dollars such as a &# akris zip jacket for fall so far mr tansky says cusp shoppers appear to be buying a variety of merchandise at various prices including the "very highest " the pitch appeals to some young shoppers kelly chen a photo editor for the atlantic monthly magazine in washington d c has made several visits to the cusp store near her office in march buying a pair of &# sam edelman "caroline" satin ballet flats "in this d c market especially neiman is geared to older more conservative women " she says "cusp has done a really amazing job making itself the center for d c fashion " ms katz says neiman marcus is learning about the habits and preferences of something shoppers through cusp one of the discoveries many cusp shoppers drop in on a thursday friday or saturday to pick up outfits to wear that night unlike neimans average year old shopper who tends to buy in advance for each season cusp could find it difficult to stand out in the sea of contemporary fashion boutiques as many of its rivals seem to be following the same pattern of showing contemporary fashions in informal settings another risk is that cusp could cannibalize neiman marcuss own sales to younger shoppers the new cusp boutique set to open in august outside chicago will be just yards away from a neiman marcus at northbrook court mall "cannibalization is not of concern to us " ms katz says "cusp is a free standing store with a different target market a unique merchandise mix and distinctive architectural and visual elements "
