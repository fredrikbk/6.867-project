an overdue memorial considering the enormity of what it commemorates the memorial to the victims of communism dedicated by president bush yesterday is striking for its modest proportions a foot female figure raising a torch at a busy intersection in washington d c thats a fitting rebuke to an ideology that made a fetish of statuary and murder on a monumental scale the numbers are almost beyond reckoning mao zedong was responsible for million peacetime murders according to his biographer jung chang the middle estimate of stalins victims is million pol pot slaughtered nearly three million fellow cambodians in only four years ethiopias mengistu killed some million opponents in the late s and contributed to the death by starvation of a million others in the s throughout these and other horrors communists always managed to find high profile apologists among the bourgeois intellectuals jean paul sartre for stalin noam chomsky for pol pot and so on some like sidney hook arthur koestler and whittaker chambers repented but most did not they may not have been witting accomplices to the butchery quite but they are the reason why the west was almost fatally late in recognizing the depth of evil it faced in its communist enemy not by coincidence yesterdays dedication took place on the th anniversary of ronald reagans speech at berlins brandenburg gate calling on the soviets to "tear down this wall " back then the smart set and some of his own advisers said he was a fool for seeking to bring the communist nightmare to an end inasmuch as he led the free world in doing so the memorial is also inescapably a tribute to him
