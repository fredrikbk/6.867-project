common sense stock investors overreact to bond gurus forecast smartmoney i cant help but wonder if interest rate guru bill gross wasnt a little taken aback that so many commentators credited blamed him for last weeks two day stock market slump and steep rise in bond yields on the one hand it must be flattering to be deemed so wise and powerful that your words can send markets reeling on the other you might wonder if anyone was really listening or reading carefully mr grosss imputed power to move markets is all the more impressive considering that he holds no elected or appointed position of any governmental power he isnt a central banker like fed chairman ben bernanke or his predecessor alan greenspan though mr grosss statements have taken on added gravitas now that mr greenspan has signed on as a consultant to pacific investment management co the asset management firm where mr gross is chief investment officer and which claims nearly &# billion under management mr gross is a self made market mover largely on the strength of his uncannily accurate predictions in recent years of low long term u s interest rates and pimcos exemplary track record in fixed income securities what set off last weeks interest rate panic were widely circulated reports that mr gross had experienced a change of heart and had abandoned his year bullish stand on u s treasurys the dow jones industrial average dropped more than points in two days of trading rivaling februarys one day rout and year bond yields hit i went to pimcos web site to read the text of his investment outlook and the accompanying q&amp a i came away baffled by the market reaction wondering how many traders had sold stocks on the headlines while not bothering with the broader context i dont read mr grosss comments as a bearish call he did raise the range forecast for the year note to a to range from a to range for the time frame he confirmed that this is a "major shift" from his previous longstanding bullish stance on bonds but heres what wasnt in the headlines "cyclical countertrends as evidenced currently in the u s japan and elsewhere suggest caution in overreaching just yet into bearish secular territory " mr gross continues "readers and clients again are alerted to the probability of yields closer to the lower end of our ranges during the weak cyclical environment of and " in the q&amp a mr gross elaborates "we do see the fed reducing rates in the latter part of based upon that weakness in the economy over the shorter term and that being the first year i suppose of the next three to five years in terms of the secular outlook we see a mild bull market as opposed to a bear market in this case we do like the bond markets from this point forward for the next six months but we do suggest in and that interest rates will be moving mildly higher " and thats just bonds hes talking about a fed rate cut later this year followed by a recovery from housing induced economic weakness is exactly what stock investors are praying for as a bond investor mr gross looks enviably at world economic growth and says hes looking at opportunities outside bonds especially in emerging markets and commodities "odds favor a continuation of recent years global growth rates and the favorable dynamics for most financial markets " he concludes in his investment outlook you call that bearish in my view the big news from mr gross is that as he puts it hes gone from being pessimistic about the global economy seeing the glass as "half empty " to cautiously optimistic seeing the glass as "half full as well " i cant say whether mr gross will be proven right or wrong but his arguments seem to make sense they strike me as a reason to buy stocks not bail out james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
