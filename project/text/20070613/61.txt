fix picks u s open online edition quirky i was at usga headquarters over the winter and bumped into a senior usga official who is involved in setting up the championship layout and asked how things were going to be at oakmont the site of this weeks u s open he said he thought the boys teeing it up will find oakmont "quirky " the more i thought about it the more i thought thats probably a good word for all of the years four majors in april zach johnson going for absolutely zero of the par fives in two shots at the stretched out take no prisoners masters drove out magnolia lane on sunday evening with a green jacket for his efforts i dont mean to imply the native of that golfing mecca of iowa isnt a deserving champion just quirky after this weeks u s national championship the british open will be played next month at carnoustie where in jean van de velde made himself into a verb with a triple bogey seven on the final hole in "van de velding" himself he played off the grandstands the top of a stone wall into a burn into a bunker and finally holed a rather lengthy putt just to get into a playoff that four man playoff was won by paul lawrie the last time a european has won one of golfs four majors quirky and s fourth major the pga will be at southern hills where in retief goosen won the first of his two u s open titles in an hole monday playoff after he missed a final hole putt of less than two feet a virtual gimme quirky but back to this week and oakmont just north of pittsburgh where the open has been played more than at any course this is oakmonts eighth u s open including the one in won by the quirkiest of champions local boy sam parks jr this time around at oakmont cc there are three holes that are almost drivable two par fours and the par three yard eighth that is not a typo in addition the yard par five th hole the longest hole in major championship history awaits the pennsylvania turnpike runs through the golf course phil mickelson who is quirky all by himself had to pull out of the past two tournaments on the pga tour after injuring himself last month during a chipping practice session in the oakmont rough i dont know perhaps the word im looking for is "quirky " and so the winner will undoubtedly be quirky not tiger although by hitting only about five drivers a round hell certainly be a factor no the trophy will be hoisted by someone like geoff ogilvy last years winner at winged foot who wasnt really on anyones radar before the nd hole hospitality tent interfered with mr mickelsons bid to win three majors in a row unlike the tree lined doglegged winged foot where golfers could have complained of golfing claustrophobia there are virtually no trees at oakmont fewer than tigers majors according to the latest count no one really knows how many thousands of trees were removed restoring the course to the scottish type links that the fownes family designed the course to be here the holes are mostly straight aways with gently banked fairways with the usga setting up the fairways at their normal width a taller man can just about stand in the middle of the fairway and touch both sides of the rough its a different kind of shotmaking this year instead of fitting balls into the correct slots length is a bit more important this year like some sort of psychic auction players have been bidding up what they expect the winning score to be with some suggesting that a four day total as high as over par or will take the championship the fix picker strongly considered mr johnson to double up on his majors as well as huge pittsburgh steelers fan and world number jim furyk but the fix pick is sean ohair who is first in overall driving which combines length and accuracy th in greens in regulation and actually under par in his scoring on the years par fours given his history in standing up to his father as a teenager mr ohair is clearly mentally tough enough which is one thing that cant really be measured by stats but is all important in winning the u s open and anyone still reading this wsj com preview has got to be wondering how they got this far without hearing about the feature of oakmont that will have the players waking up in cold sweats this week the greens what can i say other than this its quirky mr carroll has been fortunate enough to play oakmont twice both times before the trees were removed and the course was not in u s open conditions still he left the course in near tears it was so tough write to him at tim carroll wsj com
