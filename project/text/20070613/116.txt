terrorism muslims should look within and not blame others irshad manji states in her piece "muslim melting pot " editorial page june that "political islam has not caught on in america as it has in europe because most muslims in the u s are dare it be said treated with dignity " she implies by listing examples of muslim terrorists born and raised in europe that europes attitudes toward muslim immigrants drive muslims toward terrorism and she even hints at a possible civil war although europe can undoubtedly learn from the u s given its long and successful history of immigration the message that this discrimination is the cause of terrorism is flawed since sept various "solutions" have been proposed that supposedly would remove the root cause for islamic terrorism they range from reducing the wealth gap between rich and poor to finding a solution for the israeli palestinian problem to a u s withdrawal from the middle east to better treatment of muslims within western countries over the past five years terrorist plots have been foiled in among other countries canada australia germany the netherlands the u k and the u s these countries have widely different economic immigration and foreign policies for example germany and canada vehemently opposed the war in iraq none of these policies protected these countries from muslim terrorists who were willing to sacrifice the lives of many innocent others for their goals muslims are not the only minorities with different beliefs living in western countries the west has absorbed many immigrants from a wide variety of countries and with many different beliefs more needs to be done to better integrate these immigrants in especially european societies and to give them better opportunities to move ahead however no surinam south african columbian or chinese non muslim immigrant has been accused of terrorism while dozens of muslims have been ms manji and many "moderate muslims" continually point to others when explaining the root causes of islamic terrorism the overall muslim community would be better served if their energy would be directed toward constructive self criticism moderate muslims need to take more ownership for preventing muslim terrorist attacks and they need to be more vocal and active in denouncing and preventing acts of mass terror pointing to others and their perceived wrongdoings as cause and justification for terrorism is not credible anymore pascal ter horst san francisco the comparison between europe and the u s in their relative abilities to absorb and integrate non european immigrants must be put to rest once and for all the u s was founded as an immigrant based nation a failure of the u s to afford the same opportunities to muslims as are extended to all immigrants would be an abandonment of its fundamental principle the nations of europe form traditional societies the base populations of which came together well before islam emerged not only are respective european cultures and their common civilization deeply embedded and ultimately as enduring as islam but europeans are as equally entitled to self determination as are all peoples of the world thus europeans are obliged to insist on full compliance by foreigners with the internal customs values and laws of the host countries until recently europeans have been profoundly intimidated by accusations of official "racism" and bigotry their liberality goodwill and generosity have been abused by many of the largely uninvited populations the need for "guest workers" ended in the early s led by the example of the recent french elections there appears to be a belated resistance within europe to this form of social and political extortion frank k vita bethesda md
