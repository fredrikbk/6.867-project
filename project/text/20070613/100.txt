politics &amp economics terror war legal edifice weakens courts chip away at bush administration detainee policies washington the bush administrations effort to create a separate legal system for the war on terrorism may be foundering consistent resistance from the u s legal establishment has led to court rulings against the government in a series of cases over the past three years involving enemy combatants held both on the american mainland and the naval base at guantanamo bay cuba as a result the approach promoted by president bush may not outlast his presidency what to do with some detainees now in guantanamo may be one of the first questions along with how to handle the iraq war that a new president will have to tackle in january skeptical civilian and military courts using language both sweeping and technical have blocked the governments contention that to fight terrorism the president can invoke military powers that supersede traditional legal protections none of these setbacks has resulted in the immediate release of prisoners but they raise questions about the long term viability of the legal regime the latest blow came monday when the federal appeals court in richmond va ruled illegal the indefinite military detention of a u s resident arrested in peoria ill in its opinion the court warned that embracing the presidents argument "would have disastrous consequences for the constitution and the country " the bush administration gave no sign however that it was ready to abandon its approach and plans to appeal to the full fourth u s circuit court of appeals "the president has made clear that he intends to use all available tools at his disposal to protect americans from further al qaeda attack including the capture and detention of al qaeda agents who enter our borders " the justice department said after mondays ruling it cited evidence that the prisoner ali al marri trained at an al qaeda camp in afghanistan during the s and said he "entered the united states just before sept to serve as an al qaeda sleeper agent and to explore methods of disrupting the u s financial system " still the administrations last chance to salvage its detention strategy may be in the same courts that have so far rejected it thats because of a tactical decision made soon after in which the administration chose not to ask congress for permission to try alleged terrorists before military tribunals or indefinitely detain americans arrested at home instead the administration asserted that such powers were inherently assigned to the president by the constitution the bush administration has "been hit on the back of the head repeatedly by the courts for this enemy combatant" theory says michael greenberger a law professor at the university of maryland who served as a senior aide in the clinton justice department "clearly this is going to evaporate when bush leaves office " mr greenberger says the "steamroller effect" started with the high profile supreme court cases of and culminated with this weeks fourth circuit decision but lee casey who worked in the reagan and first bush justice departments says the book is far from closed on the administrations counterterrorism efforts "were midstream here " he said moreover he added the next president whether a republican or a democrat will be hard pressed to relinquish the executive powers mr bush has fought so hard to assert "i dont think the next president will have much of a choice whatever his or her instincts may be " mr casey says "you are either engaged in an armed conflict " where a country can use military force against its enemies "or the laws of war dont apply " since the president has argued that fighting terrorism is like fighting a war as commander in chief of the armed forces the president has irreducible authority to direct troops on the battlefield which the administration argued includes related powers such as the detention interrogation and military trial of enemy prisoners yet unlike conventional war the terrorist threat means the battlefield is everywhere in the cities and suburbs of the u s as much as in afghanistan thus the administration believed the president could treat a u s citizen arrested in chicago as if he were an armed guerrilla attacking american forces overseas several courts and commentators embraced that theory but the weight of legal opinion has come down on the other side the administration has found relatively few supporters in the legal community for its argument that the war on terrorism is the legal equivalent of world war ii the last time a u s administration asserted such sweeping military powers over enemy prisoners resistance to the presidents claims has come even from the uniformed legal branches where senior officers have voiced discomfort with deviations from established procedures for courts martial some concerns filtered out of guantanamo itself where earlier this month military judges in two separate cases dismissed charges against the only two prisoners being tried before a military commission finding they had not been properly classified as "unlawful enemy combatants " the government is appealing that decision and in any event could convene tribunals to examine the prisoners status the administration has won some of its legal battles to date courts have also deferred to administration actions under the military commissions act dismissing pending guantanamo prisoner lawsuits contesting their detention as enemy combatants one reason for the governments difficulties lack of early congressional approval in the weeks after congress might have armed the president with any power he deemed necessary but the administrations legal team worried that seeking congressional authorization would implicitly cede lawmakers a power they believed the president already embodied and could invite future congresses to regulate matters the white house claimed were exclusively its province courts have always looked more favorably on presidential claims of authority when lawmakers have endorsed them now with democrats controlling a restive congress the administration is unlikely to get new authority from capitol hill
