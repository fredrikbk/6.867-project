russia is becoming hybrid of tyranny and capitalism in response to your june editorial "russian diplomacy" vladimir putins goals should now be clear to all a return to "soviet greatness" without all of the baggage of a failed communist system call it commie lite in any case the goal appears to be to merge the power of participation in the global economy using russias vast resources with the control of a command driven society the chinese have made great progress in this very same effort but with far less bellicose posturing in this light the russian opposition to the proposed missile shield in eastern europe is clearly not about opposing a shield to protect europe from a nuclear ballistic armed iran have we simply accepted this as a foregone conclusion the real purpose is to extend influence and power using the old soviet tactics of intimidation and bullying "dont side with the americans or well make you targets with our superior missiles that can penetrate the puny yankee technology " substitute "ground launched cruise missiles" and "pershing ii missiles" for a "missile defense system" and you have strikingly similar scenarios taking control of yukos and other growing industries effectively nationalizing the oil and gas industry eliminating any effective internal political opposition murdering vocal critics in foreign lands soviet style foreign policy with the attendant double speak can anyone really be surprised by the actions of a government led by a former senior kgb officer tom van kleef executive vice president warren goodwin inc fort worth texas
