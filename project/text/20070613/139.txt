what happens in vegas goes to china &# billion casino resort is part of new push in cotai to lure gamblers travelers macau even in an industry addicted to excess the &# billion venetian casino resort being built here by las vegas sands corp will set a new standard for grandiosity the venetian will boast hotel rooms gambling tables and four swimming pools there are underground conveyor belts for guests baggage and a covered driveway with a ceiling adorned in gold leaf the high end retail shops by themselves will employ people and occupy one million square feet of space an area big enough to host simultaneous football games by all teams in the nfl a few miles from the downtown cluster of neon drenched casinos that dominate this chinese territory the venetian will replicate its nevada namesake itself an exaggerated vision of venice but the asian version will be bigger and its vast casino floor almost three times as large at square feet upstairs on the third floor gondoliers will ply three indoor canals while the cirque de soleil acrobatic troupe will perform in its own separate building for now some construction workers swarm over the venetians hotel floors seat arena and hangar like convention space all pushing to finish in time for a planned grand opening in august at night when the building frenzy slows would be michelangelos mount extra tall cherry pickers to paint clouds and sunsets on foot high vaulted ceilings the venetians management expects to receive at least visitors daily many of them from mainland china as many as tour buses will drive guests right to its doors each day and a fleet of luxurious catamarans will ferry visitors in from nearby hong kong and the chinese mainland but it is no sure bet that all those shuttles will be filled or that the
