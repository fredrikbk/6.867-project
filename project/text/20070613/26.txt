bush to defy lawmakers over yuan washington despite growing congressional anger at china the bush administration today plans to reject lawmakers calls that it formally accuse beijing of manipulating its currency to give its exports an unfair advantage treasury secretary henry paulson is expected instead to use a semiannual currency report to be released today to reinforce his calls for beijing to move on its own to allow the yuan to rise faster mr paulson wont brand china a currency manipulator turning aside congressional demands to do so according to a person familiar with the matter the decision comes at a time of high tensions in washington over chinas economic policies with several lawmakers gearing up for a drive to punish beijing for keeping its currency artificially weak against the dollar "there might be an initial sigh of relief in the markets that the treasury has not taken a more confrontational line but protectionist pressures are only likely to build " julian jessop chief international economist at capital economics in london said in a note yesterday meanwhile beijing took steps apparently aimed at least in part at defusing u s concerns chinese authorities permitted an unusually large rise in its tightly controlled currency which markets took as a signal that authorities intend to speed the yuans climb a u s treasury spokeswoman declined to comment the yuans so called central parity rate against the dollar was set at before trading a relatively sharp rise from mondays rate of the parity rate sets the center point around which the chinese allow the yuan to move no more than per day "this guides the market to faster appreciation " said wang qing china economist for morgan stanley traders look to the central parity rate as a signal of the peoples bank of chinas intentions but it doesnt necessarily dictate where market participants make their trades the yuan closed at against the dollar up from mondays close of the yuan has risen against the dollar since authorities began allowing it to creep upward in july a stronger yuan could make chinese goods relatively more expensive for americans and u s goods relatively cheaper in china the recent pickup in chinese inflation could in theory add to the rising yuans impact in making chinese goods more costly abroad but any such effect would be limited in the u s because both nations have similar inflation rates said nicholas lardy senior fellow at the institute for international economics in washington
