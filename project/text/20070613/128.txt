the informed patient the growing clout of online patient groups when researchers at harvard university were looking for a gene mutation in a group of rare blood cancers they turned to joyce niblack who put the word out to an online patient mailing list she manages spurring more than members to send in mouth swabs and bone marrow samples later ms niblack mustered participants from countries for a mayo clinic led study of how the cancers known as myeloproliferative disorders affect quality of life the mayo researchers are now running the clinical trials page on her foundations web site mpdinfo org to keep participants up to date on developments online patient groups have become an increasingly powerful force for health care consumers over the past decade raising funds for research and offering patient information and support now as the cumulative power of their memberships grows these groups are becoming invaluable partners to researchers and physicians searching for cures patient groups are stepping up their participation in medical and public health research and entering far reaching collaborative efforts with researchers scientists and drug developers they are raising funds and taking part in studies to evaluate the impact of online patient sites they are even conducting their own studies on side effects of medications and working with researchers to recruit clinical trial participants provide dna samples and start tissue banks in the case of ms niblacks efforts the results of collaboration are already apparent the dna gathered from the groups mouth swabs and bone marrow samples helped researchers identify a genetic mutation that could be a target for new therapies the finding could lead to new drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells "groups like those led by joyce immensely serve the needs of patients " says ayalew tefferi a mayo physician and researcher who works with the group her foundations web site is "one stop shopping for clinical trials and breaking news in research " other online groups are having a similar impact an online group for patients with a rare cancer known as leiomyosarcoma sent more than tissue samples to researchers at stanford university for a tissue bank that is being used to study genetic and molecular changes that occur in the disease the international myeloma foundation conducted an online survey of patients that helped identify jaw bone deformities in some patients taking the novartis drug zometa which is used to reduce or delay bone damage that may occur with the disease novartis now advises patients to avoid invasive dental procedures while taking zometa to spur more widespread collaboration a group of experts in patients use of the web just launched a new web site and blog e patients net originally developed by tom ferguson a physician who received funding from the robert wood johnson foundation and the pew charitable trusts following dr fergusons death last year after his own year battle with multiple myeloma his cohorts completed his study "e patients how they can help us heal health care " which is available free on the site co authors of the blog include daniel hoch a neurologist at massachusetts general hospital and susannah fox a researcher at pews internet and american life project another member of the team gilles frydman founder of the association of cancer online resources recently launched a patient focused "wiki" a collaborative web site that visitors can add to and edit called lo wiki acor org the site helps consumers build and maintain online discussion groups and aid researchers who want to study such online communities or use the online groups to conduct research mr frydman who started acor more than a decade ago when his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer is also developing other sites including one that will provide links to medical research papers for patients acor which offers access to mailing lists for cancer and other disorders including the one managed by ms niblack had about cancer patients and caregivers using the online communities over the past year according to mr frydman but there are tens of thousands of such groups on sites such as yahoo last year about million adults or of internet users surveyed by pew participated in an online discussion or group forum that helps people with personal issues or health problems "we can bring information about studies clinical trials and meetings to any patient world wide who has computer access " says ms niblack a retired patent attorney who runs both an acor mailing site and the mpd foundation and has been fighting the disease for almost years "people have told me the information has saved their lives " the university of north carolina at chapel hill teamed up with acor for the first large scale scientific analysis of medical online communities publishing its findings last month in the journal of medical internet research using software that analyzes message content to examine the type of support provided by the groups the researchers found that the most common topics in messages were about treatment information and how to communicate with health care providers "one of the real values in the mailing lists is their role in getting patients to seek second opinions and ask questions about clinical trials " says barbara rimer dean of north carolinas school of public health and an author of the study the software programs enabled researchers to study messages without identifying who wrote them but deborah bell an ovarian cancer survivor who manages the ovarian cancer list for acor and participated in the north carolina study says members of the group are already aware that what they are writing is on a public forum and privacy is not a major issue with a potentially deadly cancer diagnosis she notes their main concern is finding information and coping with doctors who say snide things like "and where did you go to medical school " when confronted with questions from a patient of course the rush to link communities and researchers and the move by patient groups to conduct their own research raises some thorny new issues while the nonprofit patient run online groups have no financial interest in research or recruiting for trials some for profit health web sites see their online communities as a way to make money such sites supported by drug company advertising may seek to recruit patients for drug company clinical trials often without going through physicians who may advise patients about the pros and cons of such trials also the research organized by online patient communities makes some scientists nervous because such efforts dont use the gold standard of randomized controlled clinical trials the life raft group an organization of patients suffering from rare gastrointestinal tumors known as gist conducts its own surveys about the side effects of the novartis drug gleevec commonly used to treat gist the group recruits participants from among its members and publishes results on its liferaftgroup org web site norman scherzer a retired public health official who started the group when his wife was diagnosed with gist notes that the study turned up different reactions among men and women to the drug and was the first to report that side effects decrease over time "at minimum it is a surveillance system " says mr scherzer who says the group isnt trying to pass off its research as pure science mr scherzer recently persuaded novartis ceo dan vasella to give the group &# million for a research program that will recruit experts from major cancer institutions to work together to study patients who become resistant to gleevec george demetri head of sarcoma and bone cancer research at dana farber cancer institute in boston who treats gist patients and has worked closely with the life rraft group says that doctors need to work in partnership with patient groups doctors should take the self administered surveys seriously to understand the impact of side effects for example but in cancer research he cautions "the challenge is keeping the patient voice in but also staying as rigorous as possible and not being swayed by inaccurate premature or misleading data " email informedpatient wsj com corrections &amp amplifications
