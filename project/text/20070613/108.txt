russia beware estonia chooses a national fish baltic herring submerged under the soviets wins will people eat it now tallinn estonia since this seafaring baltic nation achieved independence in from its far larger russian neighbor estonia has tried to forge a post soviet national identity that effort became more urgent recently in the face of renewed threats from moscow including riots in the capital here led by kremlin supporters a key part of the strategy baltic herring following an emotional debate an online poll charges of voter fraud and parliamentary debate estonia which is about half the size of maine several months ago officially selected the small oily animal as its national fish "food has a political dimension " explains ruve schank an estonian agriculture ministry official who recalls how recipes including their names had to be approved by moscow in soviet times "for me the baltic herring as our national fish is meaningful " there are some problems with the selection for starters few estonians actually eat it the baltic sea is one of the most polluted in the world reducing the herring catch in recent years high amounts of dioxin are found in some baltic herring often above levels allowed by the european union which estonia joined in the countrys herring fleet is about a third its size a decade ago whats more much of the tons of herring caught last year was exported herring prices about &# a pound in local stores are now largely determined by the international market making the fish expensive for many estonians vjatseslav savtenko a year old retired locksmith fishing from the banks of a saltwater river near tallinn early one morning said he hadnt caught a baltic herring in years he prefers porgy he said like the four pounder he caught the previous evening and fried with onions for his dinner "for fishermen the bigger the better " he said with a blue frayed cap pulled down low over his weathered face baltic herring are usually no more than eight inches long that size makes them hard to prepare they can also go bad within a day or two he added even when refrigerated some believe that pike would have been a more worthy choice in fact in the online poll to select a national fish which attracted voters the pike won by about votes acknowledges valdur noormagi the head of the group behind the idea the estonian national fishery association but a panel of judges that included him overruled the vote on the grounds that as a traditional staple of the estonian diet the baltic herring has been more important for more people through the countrys history the pikes popularity lies mostly with weekend fishermen on the countrys many rivers and lakes mr noormagi says the panels action was also justified by what he termed voter fraud which occurred on the last day of voting in february when more than votes for the pike came from a single computer also other web sites that allowed estonians to vote for the national fish which boosted the voter turnout to more than showed a vast majority for the baltic herring he says "this was the correct choice " says mr noormagi "scientists said the baltic herring has been near our coast for years " the heralding of the herring is part of a larger government campaign called "fish makes good" to encourage estonians to improve their diet by eating more fish the government in recent weeks began running ads depicting a woman in a bikini emerging from the sea with a fish in her mouth illustrating how fish can improve ones complexion the government also wants to promote estonian cuisine it first had to identify it over the years the largely agrarian population of million has been partial to pork sauerkraut blood sausage and fried potatoes fare heavily influenced by nearby germany and russia during the soviet period estonian recipes were suppressed as nationalist by the soviets a moscow sanctioned estonian cookbook from has just pages of estonian recipes relegated to the back of the page publication it features instead long political tracts describing how in "capitalist countries the production of consumer goods diminishes with each passing year " as a result many estonian dishes such as a popular holiday recipe of beets potato salad and baltic herring called rosolje fell out of favor during the cold war preserved primarily by the estonian diaspora after independence in estonians were eager for foreign goods such as german yogurt and american ice cream "our food was virtually lost " says karin annus karner who heads an estonian school in new york and recently wrote an estonian cookbook in brooklyn n y toomas sorra a gastroenterologist and estonian american who has visited estonia frequently in recent years says the only baltic herring he has experienced was as a gift at a dinner at the estonian consulate in new york he offers that his relatives in estonia like to catch eel now the government is eager to develop its own cuisine led by the herring the matter recently found its way to the estonian parliament which debated whether to build some sort of statue for the chosen fish estonian personalities have weighed in dimitri demjanov a prominent estonian chef and founder of a culinary institute in tallinn has appeared numerous times on tv to talk about the distinctiveness of the fish herring eaten in other countries like finland sweden and holland is bigger and "more rubbery" than the estonian version he says "we have this fish that no one else has " he says "ours is smaller and more gentle " mr demjanov says having symbols like a national fish is particularly important for a country like estonia which has enjoyed independence only once before in its history for years before world war ii "it shows the world we are an independent country " he says the baltic herring joins the blue cornflower and the barn swallow as estonian national symbols which were chosen during the cold war as small expressions of nationhood in the face of soviet hegemony the suddenly unfriendly relations with russia make the initiative timely russia last month cut rail and road links to estonia and may have been behind an unprecedented cyber attack on the country after the estonian government relocated a soviet war memorial moving the controversial statue triggered a night of riots led by a pro kremlin youth group called nashi the word is russian for "ours" the kremlin has denied any involvement in the cyber attack others still assert there are better uses of the governments time and money the total cost of the fish promotion including advertising and brochures was more than &# some of which came from the eu "i like estonian food but its not worth spending money for this jokey thing " says leopold garder who runs a shipping business in tallinn "we have a national flag song and flower that is quite enough " an angry editor of a local newspaper quipped in an editorial that the national fish is the former agriculture minister who came up with the campaign
