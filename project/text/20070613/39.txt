chinese inflation fuels few worries so far beijing although chinas inflation rate touched a two year high of last month the big price gains remain largely in food and havent spread to a broad range of consumer goods so despite rising global concern about inflationary pressures chinas response will likely be moderate economists said chinas central bank has said it wants to keep inflation under this year and inflation has been at or above that level for three months in a row but while food prices jumped from a year earlier prices of all other goods and services inched up just "this is a very special case because the consumer price index is being driven by food prices it looks like there is inflation but its hard to say that the central bank should tighten credit policy " said zhou chunsheng a professor of finance at the cheung kong graduate school of business recent price increases for pork for instance have resulted mostly from a supply shortage which interest rates would be unlikely to affect mr zhou said nonfood prices generally fell from about until but last months increase is still low in absolute terms especially for an economy that has been growing by more than a year steady productivity gains and continued rapid increases in factory capacity have helped contain inflationary pressure in most manufactured goods and the may figures show that prices for some goods such as electronics and textiles are still falling still the headline inflation rate is higher than the interest rate that banks pay on deposits currently for one year that gives consumers a big incentive to spend or invest their money rather than let its value erode in the bank indeed household bank deposits fell by billion yuan &# billion in may probably indicating a shift into the chinese stock market which has boomed in the past year that shift is of particular concern to authorities as many analysts consider chinese stocks ripe for correction many economists expect the central bank to raise interest rates once or twice more this year likely by the customary increment of percentage point so bank deposits provide at least some return after inflation "if the consumer price index exceeds the interest rate on bank deposits i do feel there should be an appropriate increase in rates " zhou wangjun a deputy director of the national development and reform commission said in an online forum yesterday chinas central bank has raised lending costs by a total of percentage point and figures yesterday seemed to indicate that has had some effect with growth in bank lending and money supply slowing in may "tightening measures should still be moderate as there is no need for beijing to slam on the brakes " said qu hongbin an economist with hsbc
