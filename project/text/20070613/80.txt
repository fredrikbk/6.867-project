me &amp my car columnist jonathan welsh answers readers questions about automobiles q how much of a boost in gas mileage comes from reducing weight in a vehicle john l gann jr madison wis a as we accumulate more stuff cluttering trunks and cargo areas with everything from golf clubs to picnic furniture to tool boxes we hurt not only a vehicles aesthetics but also its efficiency according to the environmental protection agencys fueleconomy gov shedding pounds can improve your cars fuel economy by as much as significantly boosting a cars fuel economy requires many small improvements in overall efficiency maintaining proper tire pressure changing air filters regularly using the proper engine oil and making sure the engine is tuned properly all contribute to greater miles per gallon q my ford mustang gt recently hit the mile mark when i went for my latest oil change the mechanics suggested i use "high mileage oil" for my car at an &# premium over the normal oil is it worth it glenn squire dallas a i dont think your mustang needs high mileage oil which is designed to compensate for losses in efficiency resulting from internal wear perhaps if the car was built in the engine might be a bit worn after miles but in more recent years engine parts generally have been manufactured to tighter more consistent tolerances and dont wear as severely as they once did q i am looking at small suv hybrids and the toyota highlander costs about more than the mercury mariner including the hybrid tax credit with about the same features and goodies is it really better tim finlay scottsdale ariz a no i think one could argue the highlanders larger size gives it a more substantial feel on the road but characteristics related to its size including a few hundred pounds of additional weight and a larger engine hurt its fuel efficiency i count the mariner hybrid and its fraternal twin the ford escape hybrid among the more underrated vehicles on the market they both combine the seating position and cargo capacity of an suv with the fuel economy of a small car still the highlander is surprisingly efficient and peppy for its size and buyers who arent willing to give up strong acceleration may prefer the toyota questions can be emailed to mecar wsj com
