u s bond yields climb hitting a year high u s bond yields hit a five year high with the yield on the benchmark year treasury note rising to nearly driving up the cost of everything from &# home mortgages to &# billion leveraged buyouts and threatening to slow the nations economic growth investors continued to dump treasurys yesterday as they have for more than a week amid worries about rising inflation abroad and concerns that foreigners might curb their purchases of u s bonds which have been an important source of support for the market by increasing borrowing costs for american consumers and corporations alike the upsurge in yields could damp the economy which barely grew in the first quarter and intensify the slump in the nations housing market rising interest rates raise the monthly payments of homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages and make it more costly for them to refinance to a fixed rate they could also put the brakes on the corporate buyout boom which has been financed by cheap debt and has helped to drive the stock market higher in recent years yesterday the year note closed at just above last years peak rate and slightly below the recent high set in may of the notes price which moves in the opposite direction of the yield was down or &# for each &# invested the price of the year bond was down pushing its yield up to the highest since june in less than four weeks the yield on the year note has climbed from just a huge jump for bond yields in the past such sharp moves have led to big losses for hedge funds and other investors who rely heavily on borrowed funds when yields rise the relatively safe returns offered by bonds make stocks less attractive the stock market has struggled since bond yields began their push higher yesterday the dow jones industrial average shed points or to close at it is now points below its record set on june in some ways the bond market is returning to normal for years bond yields stayed low despite impressive economic growth around the globe that confounded economists traders and federal reserve officials alike who searched for ways to explain the phenomenon "rates have been low for a long time and theyre just moving back to more normal levels " says anthony richards a managing principal at stairway partners llc a &# million investment firm in oakbrook ill "many people have rationalized their involvement in risky assets like stocks by saying that bond yields are low and now theyre rising and catching people off guard " also returning to normal recently the yield curve or the difference between the yields on short term and long term bonds has regained its upward slope normally interest rates are higher on longer term bonds than short term bonds because investors want to get paid more to hold bonds for the longer period but for much of the past year the yield curve has been inverted meaning short term rates were higher than long term ones a signal some investors believed economic growth would be weak the recent bond market move has pushed long term rates above short term rates again the jump in yields has been driven by strong economic growth and rising inflation outside the u s which has prompted central bankers in europe japan and elsewhere to raise or consider raising rates last week the european central bank increased its target interest rate to from and signaled that there are more rate increases to come the bank of england and the bank of canada are expected to raise rates next month and the bank of japan looks poised to raise rates later this year that u s bond yields have jumped despite weak u s economic growth is further evidence of how interconnected the worlds markets have become increasingly the u s market is being influenced by global investors thats in part because the u s imports far more than it exports to countries like china and makes up the difference by borrowing from foreigners who have been flocking to u s bonds to continue attracting those investors u s bond yields need to compete with rising yields abroad initially investors shrugged off rising u s yields but as the year treasury note which dictates mortgage and other loan costs neared and then passed the psychologically important mark last week many of them started to get worried the rise in long term yields caught many in the bond market flat footed just weeks ago economists and investors were betting that a weakening u s economy and the prospect of a longer than expected housing slump would encourage the fed to cut rates but hopes for rate cuts have faded due to rising global inflation "surprisingly strong growth overseas is dashing hopes for a quick rate cut " and sparking broad selling by bond investors says wan chong kung senior fixed income portfolio manager at minneapolis based first american funds in the u s inflation remains a concern as well in april consumer prices were above their year earlier level according to the labor department later this week the government will release reports on last months wholesale and consumer prices economists expect hefty increases in food and energy prices will push both sets of prices higher any sign that inflation is heating up could raise concerns among investors that the fed might actually raise rates later this year some bullish analysts argue that bond yields wont get much higher because the u s economy remains weak and the housing market is struggling raising the possibility that the federal reserve could cut rates at some point in the future but it may be difficult for the fed to cut rates as other central banks are raising them ultimately the fed may be stuck argus research economist rich yamarone said the fed cant join central bankers around the world in raising short term interest rates to help rein in inflation because doing so would worsen the nations housing recession "the only thing the fed can do now is just talk sternly about fighting inflation " mr yamarone says "you cant tell me theyre not squirming in their seats " yesterdays bond market tumble was exacerbated by tepid demand in an auction of &# billion of year treasury notes the lackluster interest especially from foreign investors raised new concerns about whether they would continue to buy u s bonds to the extent they have in recent years foreign buying has helped keep u s bond yields low in turn helping the housing market former fed chairman alan greenspan speaking in new york also said yesterday that the historic lows seen in long term u s yields over the past several years will eventually end although the recent rise in the year treasury note may simply be a temporary development but he added that he doesnt see signs that the chinese government is selling its massive holdings of u s bonds easing a concern of some traders investors are worried that foreigners are losing their appetite for u s treasurys in part because they can get good yields elsewhere and also because the weakening dollar is reducing the value of their current holdings the chinese government last month said it would take a &# billion stake in private equity firm blackstone group and other governments are actively looking at places to invest their savings other than treasurys the recent treasury selloff has battered financial stocks and triggered declines across a broad swath of corporate bonds bonds of morgan stanley bear stearns cos hca inc and sallie mae all edged lower yesterday as their yields rose to accommodate the steep rise in treasury yields last month when treasury prices started falling most corporate bond prices held steady as many investors viewed the change as a temporary one analysts say that sentiment has changed over the past two weeks "compared to what happened in may investors are interpreting this as more of a longer term shift in rates " says jamie farnham director of credit research at metropolitan west asset management "but theres still a degree of complacency in the market " higher corporate bond yields are likely to raise borrowing costs for many companies including dozens of firms that are being taken private in leveraged buyouts that are funded mostly with debt "with the backup in rates were hearing a lot more talk about financing deals coming to market more quickly " says paul scanlon a junk bond fund manager at putnam investments in boston as buyout firms rush to the market to raise funds worried that interest rates could rise further justin lahart and peter a mckay contributed to this article
