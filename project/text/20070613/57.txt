firms tidy up clients bad online reputations as she puts it christina parascandola has the bad luck of having an unusual name the year old attorney was mentioned in news reports and blog posts about a heated dispute between residents of her washington neighborhood and a noisy local bar that hosted some gay themed events ms parascandola was worried that she came across in the articles as homophobic particularly to potential employers "when you google my name it looks like im some kind of monster " she says ms parascandola set out to minimize the bad publicity she hired a company called reputationdefender inc that promises to help individuals "search and destroy" negative information about them on the internet businesses and others have long employed so called search engine optimization techniques to try to make themselves appear higher in web search results now services like reputationdefender and defendmyname are charging fees that can run into hundreds of dollars to help clients remove or downplay unflattering online information the companies cite success stories of customers who have buried snippy blog comments embarrassing photos or critical mentions of their names but as ms parascandola found out the services cant wipe everything off the internet and their efforts can backfire reputationdefender sent a letter to political blog positive liberty asking it to remove ms parascandolas name from a critical entry on the grounds the post was "outdated and invasive " blogger jason kuznicki refused and posted a new entry mocking the request he says he "had a good laugh over it " michael fertik a year old harvard law graduate who founded reputationdefender in october said misfires represent a "tiny percentage" of the companys efforts to fight the "permanent and public" nature of negative online content for fees starting at &# a month the person louisville ky based company scours blogs photo sharing sites and social networks for information about a client then charges &# for each item the user instructs it to try to correct or remove the service wont say how many customers it has he declined to say how many times reputationdefender has succeeded in having content removed he cited recent examples including a man whose ex lover posted revealing photos to a web site an identity theft victim who had his personal information published on a blog and a medical student who had discussed his own clinical depression in an old newsgroup that he didnt know was public mr fertik declined to identify those clients janel lee a mortgage loan closer in minong wis sought reputationdefender out after her ex boyfriend began posting her work and cellphone numbers in response to several questions on yahoo answers including "what is cents phone number " she got to calls a day sometimes as late as a m one after hours voicemail presumably intended for the rapper was a lengthy rap performance "i sing blues jazz and rock this was painful " said ms lee ms lee said she contacted yahoo inc directly but was unable to get most of the information taken down so she paid reputationdefender about &# for a two year membership plus about &# for the posts that the company over three months got removed "it was quite a great relief knowing that someone was working on it for me " she said mr fertik said yahoo removed the information after being contacted by reputationdefender a yahoo spokeswoman said the company doesnt discuss individual customer care cases but that if someones contact information is posted on yahoo answers without approval the site will remove it reputationdefender begins by sending emails on behalf of its clients to web site owners the letters typically introduce the company identify the client and the offending content and ask the recipient to remove it the letters dont make threats mr fertik despite his training and others at reputationdefender arent lawyers but instead try to appeal to recipients sense of fairness "like our clients and perhaps like you we think the internet is sometimes unnecessarily hurtful to the privacy and reputations of everyday people " one such letter reads "the first thing we do is we just ask very politely " said mr fertik "thereafter we can get less polite " including contacting a sites internet service provider to complain about the site when web site owners dont respond to its letters reputationdefender sometimes suggests that clients hire a lawyer though mr fertik said that happens infrequently mr kuznicki the blogger said he refused to take down the information about ms parascandola because he merely included published information and expressed personal opinions "i was surprised to get a notice like this because i dont run an unprofessional or defamatory blog " said mr kuznicki a bowie md policy researcher for a think tank ms parascandola criticized reputationdefender for sending a letter directly to someone who had already written critical things of her an approach she considered clumsy "i certainly would not have authorized that " she said mr fertik said he apologized to ms parascandola and refunded her fees while mr fertik said such problems are rare takedown attempts that go awry can generate considerable unwanted attention stuart neilson a statistics instructor at a university in cork ireland claimed on his personal web site that he was the victim of "academic bullying" by a colleague after the other professor hired reputationdefender to try to have the accusations removed dr neilson rebuffed the firm and posted his exchanges with the company on his site those posts received wider attention when they were republished on a blog devoted to faculty discord in academia "it has merely generated additional publicity " he said reputationdefender also sent a takedown request to consumerist a gawker media blog that had written about a man who was briefly jailed for harassment after repeatedly calling online travel agent priceline com inc for a refund the letter asked the blog to remove or alter the archived post saying it was "outdated and disturbing" to its client consumerist editor ben popken blasted the request with a profanely titled entry calling it an attempt at censorship "its not like were spreading libel " he said "they were trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube " reputationdefenders mr fertik said the company is no longer sending letters to irreverent blogs like consumerist which may be more likely to mock the companys efforts "we are no longer taking those kinds of risks with those kinds of outlets " he said defendmyname a two year old unit of portland maine based marketing firm qed media group llc markets itself as a way to remove negative mentions from search engine results
