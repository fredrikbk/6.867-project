man on a mission in a bangladesh forest priest fights for tiny tribe father homrich battles logging and old age murder of an activist pirgacha bangladesh a half century ago the rev eugene homrich set up a catholic mission among a tiny pagan tribe clinging to a tropical forest he is still here as a result perhaps so are the garos a predominantly farming people whose sari clad women own the family land and pass on the family name a native of muskegon mich father homrich has founded schools and built clinics for the garos most of whom have converted to christianity once he personally delivered a baby on the back of his motorcycle during bangladeshs bloody civil war in he stockpiled explosives in his mission and narrowly avoided execution now father homrich is confronting the countrys forestry department to stem illegal logging of the modhupur forest the garos ancestral homeland to the chagrin of the local administration the blunt portly american has become the de facto leader of some tribe members "if it werent for the father wed be in a sea of trouble " says simon marak a garo community activist "by his grace were living here " but there is only so much father homrich can still do for the garos he is turning this year and recently spent several months in the u s for medical treatment he can be expelled from the country at any time and despite his efforts the modhupur forest has shrunk through logging and development to some square miles one tenth its size in the s as the countrys population keeps soaring conflict between the garos and land hungry outsiders intensifies the worlds third largest muslim nation bangladesh packs million people about half the population of the u s into an iowa sized territory in recent years more than a dozen tribe members have been killed by forestry officers and soldiers because of land disputes say garo leaders and human rights groups in bangladeshs capital dhaka in march the garos say a prominent tribal activist cholesh ritchil was tortured to death while in army custody an incident that sparked a wave of outrage in bangladesh and prompted protests from western embassies shaken by the killing father homrich says its only a matter of time before the garos unique culture disappears from modhupur "the future for them is in the city or in india there is no future here in the jungle " he said last month at the pirgacha mission a neat compound shaded by jackfruit and mango trees "anyway there is no jungle left " but a few hours later as he shuffles through photos of mr ritchils cadaver the priests fire ignites "ill keep going " he vowed "well get their ass " father homrichs path to rural bangladesh began in a classroom in muskegon during world war ii one of six siblings born to a factory worker father homrich was fascinated by tales of catholic missionaries who often visited his primary school he prepared for missionary work at the university of notre dame in indiana and at the holy cross college in washington d c the holy cross a catholic congregation had one mission abroad at the time in what is now bangladesh the young priest arrived here in equipped with knowledge of the bengali language and tropical agriculture the country was still part of pakistan its population less than one third of todays level since ethnic bengalis usually follow islam or the hindu religion christian missionaries sought new converts in outlying tribal areas populated by non bengali minorities the modhupur forest was one of the closest such areas a half days drive by car from dhaka in the late s the forest still teemed with monkeys deer and leopards some garo people made their home here in an enclave separated from south asias larger community of garos people ethnically and linguistically related to tibetans and burmese and concentrated in indias meghalaya state moving to the modhupur forest alone father homrich established a new mission deep in the jungle most of the garos whom father homrich encountered followed animist cults sacrificing chickens and goats to shrines of multiple gods living in small huts in clearings they followed slash and burn agriculture on a rotation that anthropologists say gave the forest time to recover he was immediately won over by the garos serene demeanor "these are wonderful people " he says as smiling tribal women in colorful saris sweep leaves from the missions garden "they have an inner peace that is amazing in this messy country they live in the eye of god " the jungle was a deadly place at the time malaria scabies intestinal parasites and a lethal black fever known in the west as visceral leishmaniasis claimed lives almost daily father homrich taught villagers to dig wells and set up separate outhouses and provided rudimentary medical services at a mission clinic the american priest was also accepted as a member of the tribe soon after arrival and became intimately involved in running the tribal affairs the peace was shattered in march when the country sought independence from pakistan pakistani troops assisted by islamist militias responded with a bloody crackdown and most ethnic bengali soldiers deserted on an april morning father homrich woke up to find two indian army officers sipping tea on his porch india as an enemy of pakistan supported bangladeshs independence bid the officers had come to help organize the local insurgency father homrich embraced the guerrillas stockpiling india supplied arms and explosives at the mission the pakistanis shelled his mission with mortars and father homrich and garo leaders were taken to a military encampment there the group was told they would be executed for aiding the insurgents say father homrich and garo villagers aware that the pakistani army was trained and supported by the u s father homrich asked the local pakistani commander where he had studied "camden new jersey " came the answer "would you really want this headline in tomorrows u s newspapers american priest executed by american educated pakistani officer " father homrich recalls asking the officer later ordered the detainees to be released when the war ended in december the new bangladeshi state awarded father homrich a "freedom fighter" certificate that he displays above his door the new country was hard pressed for land waves of ethnic bengalis flocked to the modhupur area the only unfarmed patch in central bangladesh the democratically elected administrations and military regimes that governed bangladesh after were consistent on one issue they sought to evict the garos from modhupur to make room for the fast growing bengali majority at one point a colonel in charge of bangladeshs tea board a government agency supervising the tea growing industry arrived at the mission with a proposal all the garos should be resettled on tea plantations elsewhere father homrich who had been aware of the idea says he invited some bearded maoist rebels who prowled the region he knew the rebels from treating their family members at the mission clinic open to all comers "look behind you these men have come to cut your head off " he recalls telling the colonel the colonel left the tea plan was never raised again having established himself as a voice for the garo people father homrich became their advocate in a larger struggle in bangladeshs government declared that most of the land inhabited by the garos was state forest the tribe members it said were illegal squatters the garos arent the only ones cutting down the forests valuable sal trees forestry officials often allow outside poachers to log and usually look the other way when bengali villagers convert forest land into farms father homrich and villagers say "wherever there is the forest department there is no forest left " quips father homrich yet the government has filed thousands of illegal logging suits against the garos and razed many of their banana and pineapple plantations rabindranath adahkary the chief local forestry official in modhupur said in a recent interview there is no corruption in his department a few days later his boss the forest departments national chief was arrested on corruption charges mr ritchil the garo leader was one of many tribe members wanted by the forestry department on march witnesses say he was picked up by the bangladeshi army at an improvised roadblock on his way back from a wedding he was taken to a military camp near modhupur for interrogation about weapons he allegedly owned according to a tribe member who was arrested with him bangladeshs army enjoys wide ranging powers of arrest and detention after intervening in january to abort an election and to put the country under emergency rule mr ritchils body was returned to the family the following day according to witnesses and photographs most of it was covered in dark bruises mr ritchils testicles were cut off and his eyes were mutilated his finger bones were snapped with pliers says the tribe member who says he witnessed the torture at the time officials said mr ritchil died of a heart attack determined to ensure the killing didnt go unnoticed father homrich used a patchy mobile phone connection there are no land lines in the forest to send emails about mr ritchils death as well as photos of his corpse to western embassies journalists and human rights groups the emails caused an uproar human rights groups sent investigators to modhupur the u s ambassador in dhaka patricia butenis raised the case directly with senior bangladeshi military commanders and bangladeshs government established a commission of inquiry into the incident the local army commander and forestry officials were transferred out of the region the outcry over mr ritchils death showed the formidable influence an american christian missionary exerts in the middle of this predominantly muslim nation an influence that some ethnic bengalis resent human rights activists and nongovernmental organizations in dhaka while appreciative of father homrichs work point out that in the long run the garos association with the christian religion might hurt the tribes interests here in the forest the most vocal critic is zakir hussein the modhupur based chairman of the local administration which governs a territory inhabited by most of the areas garos and some ethnic bengalis he says he is frustrated that the garos view the missionary and not his administration as their authority "i expect father homrich to be neutral " says mr hussein a pious muslim "but whenever there is a conflict he always takes a position defending the garos because they are christian " father homrich points out that mr husseins supporters organized a public celebration when mr ritchil was killed in march he adds that on the whole he has good relations with local muslims in part because the mission clinic and schools serve the muslim population and in part because he refuses to accept muslim converts apostasy is a cardinal sin in islam the american missionary is more concerned with the attitude of bangladeshs army installed government which displays less and less tolerance for critics like him a u s citizen father homrich must have his visa renewed every year "they will probably kick me out of the country " he says in the meantime the priest who reports to the local bishop wakes at a m to prepare for mass in the mission which has flush toilets and a satellite tv hookup that lets him keep abreast of current events unlike the rest of the day when he walks around dressed like a farmer in a nondescript t shirt and khaki shorts father homrich wears a prim white cassock as he delivers a sermon the mission supported by donations from christian organizations in the west now has primary schools throughout the forest employing teachers and producing a literacy rate of some among the garos according to father homrich thats well above bangladeshs national average of less than improved education and health what father homrich describes as his lasting legacy have allowed many garos to find relatively well paid jobs in the capital as nurses beauticians and because of their reputation for honesty as household help for wealthy families dozens of local garos have even gone to college in dhaka and the missions clinic is staffed nowadays by five native nurses recently some of them have had to take care of father homrich two and a half years ago the priest slipped off a ladder while entering a nearby pond for a swim and broke his leg with an open fracture the leg became infected after unsuccessful treatment in a dhaka hospital father homrich was flown to the u s where he says advanced antibiotics saved his leg and his life he spent seven months recovering in part in a retirement community with every day he grew desperate to return to the garos "i couldnt stand to be with old people " father homrich says "they live in the past " back at pirgacha father homrich made rounds at the mission clinic on a recent day checking on fever ridden children nurses teased him for the braces he wears on his leg suggesting he needs a new limb he complained that he still hasnt gotten used to the weather all three of father homrichs brothers passed away this year he hopes to remain among the garos for the rest of his life "here " he says "is a garden of eden "
