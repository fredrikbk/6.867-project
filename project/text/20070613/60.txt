fiscally fit competition for roadside assistance heats up terri looks at the many companies that are jockeying to fix her flat tire online edition id been a member of the auto club since i bought my first car in a beat up ford mustang that car desperately needed a roadside assistance program and the &# a year membership fee to aaa paid for itself the first time it broke down though our roadside assistance program covers my husband gerry and me im typically the main consumer gerrys handy and can fix most minor and some major car problems in the years weve been married hes never once had cause to use it but ive never changed a tire in my life a fact that annoys gerry to no end let alone fixed an engine problem so roadside assistance is a necessity for me lately ive noticed that there are a lot more companies lining up with offers to fix my flat tire three years or miles of roadside assistance came with the limited warranty on our ford f last year our auto insurer mailed out plastic cards listing all the features available from the roadside assistance program thats included in the cost of our auto insurance premium gerrys credit card also offers a roadside assistance program at no additional charge recently my blackberry carrier verizon wireless announced it would offer a roadside assistance program for &# a month "everybodys getting into the roadside assistance plans " says philip reed consumer advice editor at auto comparison web site edmunds com "and that should tell you something theres a lot of money to be made there " typical roadside assistance programs including the major national motor clubs aaa ge motor club bp motorclub and better world club cover such things as flat tire changes and towing jumpstarts lockouts and in some cases car rentals and others costs that may be incurred when your car is disabled full service roadside assistance providers offer additional perks such as travel and hotel discounts trip interruption insurance maps directions and travel brochures and car rental coverage one service onstar will make the call to roadside assistance for you that said many programs have restrictions on certain types of emergencies for example many will deny service if you dont have the membership card with you or if the breakdown was caused by some catastrophic event such as a fire or flood and some plans are banned from restricted highways as i discovered the first time i broke down on the new jersey turnpike also the quality of the various services provided can suffer during peak driving times or periods of bad weather the growing number of competitors made me wonder whether paying for roadside assistance still made sense for us our aaa roadside assistance program isnt cheap annual membership runs about &# but while competition for providing roadside assistance services is fierce there are advantages and drawbacks depending on the type of company we choose many cars marketed by dealers as "certified pre owned" offer hour roadside assistance programs as part of the vehicles limited warranty auto makers tend to work with major roadside assistance programs like aaa so the service is usually good and the service comes with the warranty so theres no annual membership fee the problem with these limited warranties is theyre just that limited most impose restrictions on the age of the car and mileage and some require a vehicle inspection to qualify for roadside assistance click here for a comparison of auto warranties weve never relied on the roadside assistance coverage offered under our ford f s limited warranty mainly because the truck is so new its unlikely to break down and the roadside coverage itself extends only to the truck we have two other vehicles to cover also some manufacturers require that the car be towed to the nearest dealership for repair thats all well and good if the reason for the break down is a part thats covered under the warranty but if its for something thats not covered under warranty a shredded tire or a dead battery we could end up paying more than we should we want the freedom to choose where our vehicle is going to be towed so well look elsewhere for roadside service the plus with choosing my cellphone carriers plan or gerrys credit card companys service is again the low cost but when it comes to cellphone carriers or credit card companies that offer roadside assistance plans or any roadside assistance program for that matter the most important consideration should be the extent of the services towing network says edmundss mr reed "murphys law will tell you youre most likely to break down in a remote place where theres no cellphone service " he says "those services that have been at it for a long time are likely to have the largest network " many companies that offer roadside assistance as a perk or for a nominal fee also place tight restrictions on how far the car can be towed and how many times a year you can use the services without incurring additional cost a few plans offered by cellphone providers will leave you stranded if you dont have your phone with you when you need help and some companies free programs are merely referrals the equivalent of someone making the phone call to a towing service for you leaving you holding the bill my husband and i drive quite a lot during the year and restrictions on towing and use concern me the service offered by my auto insurer seemed like a good deal generally roadside assistance programs add between &# and &# a year to the premium and the major insurers often contract with national roadside assistance programs to provide reliable services the problem is that some insurers treat a call for roadside assistance service the same as if id made a homeowners insurance claim a few companies even report roadside assistance claims to data collection agencies that track claims and help insurers to set premiums and decide whether to drop clients or accept new applicants with an unacceptable number of claims finally a number of insurers require that you have comprehensive coverage on all vehicles the possibility of having our premium increase the next time my battery dies was enough to deter me from using insurer provided roadside assistance that left me back with the majors aaa ge motor club bp motorclub and better world club these services can cost between &# and &# and offer the most comprehensive benefits after reviewing the various programs available my decision came down to aaa and better world club though aaa was among the most expensive programs it by far offered the greatest travel discounts and member perks among my favorite is discounted mobile windshield glass replacement which has saved us the cost of an annual membership still i was attracted to better world club as an environmentally friendly alternative the company sets aside of its revenue toward environmental cleanup and advocacy programs and &# is donated for every travel booking online it also offers members free carbon offsets with carbon offset programs consumers and companies typically make payments that go to programs that create renewable energy or absorb carbon dioxide to counteract emissions it gives discounts to hybrid car owners and in turn owners of certain gas guzzling cars may pay more our ford f while indeed being a gas guzzler doesnt fall into the companys list of guzzlers so we wouldnt pay more and the company will waive its one time &# application fee for aaa customers who switch i was sold bottom line it pays to compare roadside assistance programs to see which one makes the most sense in your particular circumstance if our cars were older with more mileage wed pay more for premium service at one of the majors if we didnt travel a lot wed probably choose a less expensive plan that covered the basics and wed pay any additional cost ourselves should any crop up which roadside assistance programs do you use and why in addition to roadside breakdowns which services offered by your roadside plan do you use most often would you feel comfortable relying on a program that isnt run by one of the major auto clubs write to me at fiscallyfit
