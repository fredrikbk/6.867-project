david obey reformer life isnt easy for an appropriations chairman in congress these days what with all the fuss about "earmarks " and other hassles from backbenchers who wont accept their pork in silence like everyone else so its possible that house spender in chief david obey was temporarily disoriented when he uttered this beauty on monday "the only real opportunity you have to prevent something stupid from happening is to have the protection of the staff who know the most about these programs and can fight something if they think it smells " mr obey told reporters while trying to explain why he wont be disclosing earmarks in spending bills despite the promises made by nancy pelosi while lambasting republicans last year instead mr obey declared that he and his staff would vet the earmarks themselves and then disclose them all in the congressional record some day the staff the who apparently mr obey is referring to the capitol hill employees hired by members of congress and beholden to them for their livelihoods these are the same appropriations employees whose job it is to tend to the needs of members keep them happy and make sure they get enough pork in the various spending bills so they vote "aye" and the bills pass on the house floor these are the cops that mr obey says will clean up the earmark beat uh huh we sympathize at least a little bit with the wisconsin democrat his colleagues have already shoved something like earmarks his way so far this spending bill season and the last thing he wants is for some troublemaker to be able to lampoon one or more of them on the house floor thats what got republicans so embarrassed when that alaskan bridge to nowhere was uncovered in democrats led by campaign chairman rahm emanuel had great fun with the issue and promised theyd be different now poor mr obey is stuck between the pork and those campaign promises so the promises are giving way at least republicans allowed earmark votes on the floor under mr obey earmarks wont be vetted in an appropriations subcommittee or at the rules committee or on the floor they will be kept secret before the house votes on spending bills to be unveiled only later when it is time to prepare a final house senate conference report only then will backbenchers be able to raise questions about individual earmarks in writing to mr obeys "staff " which will then get to decide whether the earmarks survive or not guess what "the staff" decision will be on an earmark requested by say powerhouse democrat jack murtha and a challenge raised by some first term republican from amarillo by the way the latest los angeles times bloomberg survey finds that congresss approval rating is down to with of the public saying democrats are practicing "business as usual " for the record thats lower than president bushs approval rating at this rate maybe "the staff" will have to run for re election next year
