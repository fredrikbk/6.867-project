its fees profits on deals and other income totaled &# billion according to documents filed with the sec for years buyout firms have operated beyond the scrutiny of the public markets but blackstones upcoming ipo and a public offering last year by kkr of an investment vehicle in europe signal that the industry is expanding beyond its core constituency of institutional investors and reaching for more permanent sources of capital a former associate quotes mr schwarzman on the subject of his latest coup "the little man has cracked the code in how to be a private company in the clothing of a public company "after blackstone sells about of the firm for as much as &# billion mr schwarzman intends to run it without instituting such traditional corporate governance restrictions as having a majority of independent directors according to an offering document as mr schwarzman weighed whether to take his firm public he told his family they would make a financial killing but could be under more scrutiny says his mother arline a family member asked him "do we need any more money " arline schwarzman says she interrupted "you dont understand what drives him money is the measuring stick " the seeds of mr schwarzmans approach to business were sown in philadelphia there as a year old he worked weekends in his familys store called schwarzmans he says he urged his father to open more stores and grew frustrated when his dad content with their middle class lifestyle refused his grandfather who opened the business "said i should keep folding towels and handkerchiefs and stand up straight and protect the good name of schwarzmans " he recalls "i didnt want to be a retailer i hated to wait on people " in school mr schwarzman ran track and played basketball to compensate for his size former teammates say he drew up complicated basketball plays and strategies later for intramural soccer games at harvard business school he devised "elaborate triangular formations that were not flawed in conception but that nobody was capable of executing " says jeffrey rosen mr schwarzmans roommate and now a deputy chairman of investment bank lazard freres &amp co mr schwarzman says he was president of his junior high and high school classes that he was on the podium on class day at yale and that he was president of the prestigious century club at harvard business school "im a

donaldson invited him to work at the securities firm one summer after graduate school at harvard he went to work at lehman brothers he rose quickly through the ranks to become head of mergers and acquisitions his last assignment was to sell lehman itself he says he had no desire to stay on after the sale to american express co he and peter g peterson who had left lehman a year earlier after a

was determined to launch a buyout fund mr peterson suggested trying to raise &# million mr schwarzman suggested &# billion a huge amount at that time "i thought how hard could this be " he recalls "the timing was right " blackstone raised &# million for its first fund completing fund raising days before the stock market crashed in he pitched blackstone as a corporate suitor that would not launch unsolicited bids "our comparative advantage was our relationships with the largest companies in the country " he says of himself and mr peterson "we would say at meetings we are strictly friendly unlike other firms in the business our base of large companies did not want to get hit by hostile tender offers " when mr schwarzman covets a company he sometimes will pursue it for a long stretch in he sought to buy celanese when the german chemical companys stock was trading at the equivalent of &# over the course of a year celanese kept raising its asking price rejecting blackstone offers of &# &# and &# a share finally the chairman of celanese told mr schwarzman that nothing less than &# would do mr schwarzman agonized for minutes before calling him back worried that he was overpaying "this is my definition of a nightmare " he said at the time "i felt nauseous " blackstone eventually made nearly six times its investment on the celanese deal when the firm went public again in late in february he was drawn into a bidding war for equity office properties the nations largest owner of office buildings vornado realty trust a real estate investment trust was also eager to buy the company mr schwarzman raised blackstones bid repeatedly at the same time he insisted that equity office repeatedly increase the "breakup" fee making it more expensive for the real estate company to walk away from a blackstone deal regulatory filings show had blackstone lost it would have received &# million the filings say blackstone eventually won the auction by bidding higher than its original offer it agreed to pay &# billion including debt the nations second largest leveraged buyout mr schwarzman reduced his downside by selling off about &# billion of equity office properties around the nation while hanging onto the buildings he wanted in northern california and silicon valley in an industry that often has shied away from open competition between rival firms for deals mr schwarzman is willing to play hardball when a rival guns for ones of his deals last summer with blackstone close to wrapping up a deal to buy freescale semiconductor a rival group led by kkr indicated it would make a counteroffer regulatory documents show mr schwarzman knowing he had the leverage of an offer on the table immediately raised his bid by &# million and pressed the freescale board by telling directors they had hours to make a decision or he would yank his bid the documents indicate blackstone won the auction agreeing to pay &# billion including assumed debt mr schwarzman says he would never go after a company just to thwart a rival firm and that he isnt a "marauding low class low brow inflictor of random damage " last year kkr took public a &# billion fund in europe giving public investors a stake in some kkr deals mr schwarzman who had plans for something similar told associates he was angry that kkr had beaten blackstone to the punch in listing part of its operations as a public company later after bankers suggested that mr schwarzman take blackstone itself public he was determined to be first in line when a buyout executive suggested to mr schwarzman that he invite kkr chief henry kravis to his th birthday party in february an extravagant affair at new yorks park avenue armory mr schwarzman observed icily that he had never been invited to mr kraviss home the executive recalls mr schwarzman rejected the idea mr schwarzman had no qualms about stage managing the accolades when blackstone colleagues prepared a video tribute he sought to squelch any roasting asking his peers not to poke fun at him "happy birthday steve " david rubenstein co founder of rival buyout firm carlyle group said on the video "i wish you would retire so you wouldnt compete with us on deals " blackstones planned ipo and the large expected payouts for mr schwarzman and some of his colleagues has triggered some carping from rivals who say they worry about bringing unwanted attention to the riches being made in the buyout business at a conference in january mr schwarzman insisted hes worth every penny hes made at blackstone he argued that he has created extraordinary wealth for blackstone partners and for the teachers policemen and civil servants whose pension funds are his firms biggest investors he said the problem he has with executive pay isnt his own its about chief executives who run their companies into the ground then collect huge severance packages judging by the lavishness of his birthday bash which was extensively chronicled in the press he isnt particularly concerned about being seen as ostentatious the armorys entrance hung with banners painted to replicate mr schwarzmans sprawling park avenue apartment a brass band and children clad in military uniforms ushered in guests a huge portrait of mr schwarzman which usually hangs in his living room was shipped in for the occasion the affair was emceed by comedian martin short rod stewart performed composer marvin hamlisch did a number from "a chorus line " singer patti labelle led the abyssinian baptist church choir in a tune about mr schwarzman attendees included colin powell and new york mayor michael bloomberg the menu included lobster baked alaska and a louis jadot chassagne montrachet among other fine wines "we have all wanted to be private at least until now " said david bonderman co founder of buyout firm tpg formerly known as texas pacific group at a recent conference "when steve schwarzmans biography with all the dollar signs is posted on the web site" when blackstone becomes a public company he said "none of us will like the furor that results and thats even if you like rod stewart "
