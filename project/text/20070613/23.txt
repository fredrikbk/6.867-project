business ceos find lack of political leadership on trade with the collapse of the immigration bill in the senate last week the gap between business and politics in the u s has widened into a frightening chasm business is embracing the global economy more than ever before politics is turning away from it the immigration bill was meant to be a modest nudge in the direction of a skills based immigration system which would help american business compete in the world but it faced rejection in the senate largely by republicans because of fears it would open the border gates too wide meanwhile many democrats while more willing to ease immigration rules than republicans are bearing down on trade they insist on loading up trade agreements with labor and environmental restrictions and are threatening destructive tariffs on imports from china the debates among presidential candidates show which way the wind is blowing republican sen john mccain of arizona whose virtue is that he on occasion stubbornly embraces positions against his political interests has given a spirited defense of the immigration bill but two of his opponents mitt romney and rudy giuliani have used that as an opportunity to boost their own standings by taking the opposite tack at the same time sen hillary clinton of new york has broken ranks with her husband by criticizing the north american free trade agreement which was one of his greatest accomplishments its against that backdrop that nine chief executives of large technology companies today plan to release a report titled "a great nation how americans can lead and prosper in a changing world " the report is filled with broad truths about the enduring success of the u s economy "our openness to immigrants " the report says "ensured that the best brightest and most ambitious came to our shores to create jobs companies and wealth " likewise the report says a great nation "does not fear overseas competition a great nation prepares its workers and companies to successfully compete in a global market " the nine ceos who make up the technology ceo council hope they can be an antidote to what paul otellini of intel corp calls the "myopic" nature of todays political discussions "i dont think we have internalized the extent of the global competitiveness issue its almost like we take our position in the world for granted " "theres a disappointing lack of leadership explaining the need to keep us globally engaged " agrees michael splinter of applied materials inc which manufactures equipment to make semiconductors in addition to messrs otellini and splinter the council includes the ceos of hewlett packard co international business machines corp unisys corp emc corp ncr corp dell inc and motorola inc to be sure no pronouncement from a group of ceos will calm the angst felt by americans who worry about having their jobs outsourced to india or china or who lack health care coverage yet in spite of such worries more than of americans responding to a poll conducted by john zogby agree with the statement "we have prospered for more than years by welcoming the best and the brightest to our shores and we should continue to welcome new generations to america " the conclusion of the ceos is that americans are willing to be led into a closer embrace of globalization whats missing is the leadership can ceos provide that leadership thats a trickier question for ceos to lead the public has to be willing to follow but its hard to imagine that an executive with a multimillion dollar golden parachute can "feel the pain" of workers who fear their jobs will be shipped abroad in the s many ceos had rock star status three were honored as times "person of the year" during the decade after not earning that distinction once since the s but after the scandals of enron worldcom and the like public approval ratings of ceos went into the tank and public outrage at excessive pay has kept them there even as memories of dennis kozlowskis vodka spewing ice sculpture of david have faded that outrage was on display recently when motorola shareholders voted to give investors an annual vote on the pay of ed zander the companys chief executive and chairman of the technology ceo council last year he earned about &# million "in the last few years we havent heard a lot from ceos" because of the fallout from the corporate scandals mr zander said in an interview his hope is that by focusing on issues where the companies have clear expertise the technology ceo council will help rebuild credibility so that "ceos can once again be thought of as positive and influential role models " that would be good because whatever one thinks of the messenger their message needs to be heard
