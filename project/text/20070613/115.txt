temporary workers transform german economy monchengladbach germany when marcus windges finished engineering school last year he made a decision that was inconceivable for an earlier generation of german workers he joined a temporary employment agency and accepted a short term job at a factory "im more flexible than the previous generation " said mr windges a goateed year old who had been an apprentice at a machinery company that went bankrupt "i have to be " mr windges is part of a new breed of workers who are transforming europes largest economy changes to german labor laws over the past few years have made it easier for companies to hire workers through agencies one reason the countrys unemployment rate had fallen to in april from a peak of two years earlier economists said during that period the number of temp agency workers in germany has climbed to about one million from slightly under according to staffing firms and trade unions this increase is causing tension between employers push for flexibility and workers demands for protection germanys industrial giants many centered in cities like this one near the rhine say they need to be able to hire and fire workers more easily to compete against eastern european and asian companies unions argue that temp workers are undercutting their members wages and disrupting the traditional system of apprenticeships that helped make german workers among the most skilled in the world germanys battle over temporary labor is a part of the european unions broader struggle to curb persistent unemployment the blocs economic expansion of in the first quarter outstripped growth in the u s but the eus unemployment was in march compared with in the u s economists attribute this difference to the u s labor markets greater flexibility "over the longer term more flexibility leads to higher employment levels " said stephen nickell a labor economist at the university of oxford "if you want a situation where the economy isnt strictly divided between the fully employed and the unemployed then labor regulations need to be more flexible " additional flexibility has helped create million jobs in the eu during the past seven years according to the european commission the eus executive arm some countries have been more open to this shift than others violent protests erupted in france last year over a plan to allow short term contracts for young workers the scheme was scrapped in spain about one third of the labor force is employed through short term contracts temp workers have been a contentious issue in europe for decades through the s most countries had strict rules that limited the length of time agency workers could be employed and required companies to give temporary staff the same pay and benefits regular employees received the united kingdom and the netherlands were the main exceptions to this trend creating only light regulations about of the u k labor force comes from temp agencies the highest level in europe that figure is about in the netherlands for young people in the u k college graduates included temp work is seen as a first step in finding permanent jobs according to oxfords mr nickell across the countries that are the eus older members temp work accounts for of the labor force in the mainly former soviet bloc states that joined the eu over the past three years temp work is less prevalent bringing the average rate for the eus countries down to in the u s temp workers make up about of the work force until recently germany was among the fiercest opponents to temp workers barring them until when the law was relaxed companies were allowed to hire agency workers only on three month contracts that ceiling was raised gradually starting in the late s but agency workers remained a fraction of the total labor force the countrys unions resisted employers push for more agency workers and while the industrial sector remained robust the unions got their way that changed in and when the unions power faded following an economic downturn factories were closing or leaving germany to set up shop in lower wage eastern europe the unions were desperate to strike a deal "we were in a bad condition and we had to give in to the employers " said joerg weigand a dusseldorf expert on temporary employment for ig metall the countrys main industrial union germany deregulated agency work in and following a government commissioned report suggesting ways to make labor more flexible "reforming the labor market was the most important thing we could do to fix the german economy " said wolfgang clement germanys minister of economics and labor between and he is now chairman of a research group at swiss staffing company adecco sa set up last year now that germanys economy is on stronger footing its trade unions are wondering if they gave up too much the threat of hiring more temp workers has loomed over wage negotiations according to ig metalls mr weigand in a recent bargaining round the union demanded a pay raise this year but settled for companies see the issue as a choice between a temporary job and no job at all manufacturers such as airbus a subsidiary of european aeronautic defence &amp space co auto maker bmw ag and semiconductor maker infineon technologies ag are among the employers that have expanded their use of agency workers in germany airbus has regular employees and temp workers in hamburg where it assembles and equips some of its airplanes a restructuring plan announced this year includes job cuts in france the u k spain and germany of the workers in hamburg who will lose their jobs half will be from temp agencies according to airbus spokesman tore prang temp workers offer "the kind of flexibility the system needs " mr prang said infineon said it needs temporary workers to adapt to changing conditions "since we are in a cyclical business we couldnt accept certain orders if we didnt have temporary workers " company spokesman gunter gaugler said at an infineon plant in dresden where the company makes chips for mobile phones and the auto industry of the employees have been hired through temp agencies bmw employs permanent workers and more than people from temp agencies at an assembly plant in leipzig "we are not willing to employ more fixed term workers than we need " plant spokesman michael janssen said "the only reason is flexibility " at a worker factory in moenchengladbach run by french nuclear power and engineering giant areva sa mr windges is one of employees hired through temp agencies to help build transformers for electricity grids he started months ago after finishing higher level training at an engineering school in dusseldorf in the middle of his two year course mr windgess former employer closed his factory mr windges decided a job placement with adecco would offer the most flexibility "if the placement with areva didnt work out the agency would be able to help me find another job " he said mr windges declined to disclose his salary but said he earns what most companies pay engineers with his qualifications his hour workweek and days of vacation are slightly less generous regular employees who are ig metall members have a hour workweek and days of vacation arevas human resources manager at the moenchengladbach plant petra kampfmann said the company likes the flexibility temp workers offer agency workers also are a good way to try out new employees for regular jobs said ms kampfmann at the end of may areva offered mr windges regular employment starting in august "we found a really good guy " she said andrea thomas in berlin contributed to this article
