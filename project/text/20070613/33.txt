colombia must face issue of crimes against unions i havent taken a position on the u s colombia free trade agreement "colombia goes full tilt to return to grace " politics &amp economics june my votes on free trade agreements are cast on the individual merits of each agreement changes will have to be made to the colombian free trade agreement to bring it in line with the bipartisan framework of which the democratic led congress and administration agreed i strongly support the new framework for crafting free trade agreements however before making important changes to the base trade agreement colombia must address the issue of violence against labor leaders the use of intimidation and murder of trade unionists is unacceptable and i believe our country should provide assistance to the colombian government to build up their capacity to prosecute the perpetrators of these crimes and protect those threatened i will continue to promote the ideals of my constituents of colombian descent we believe firmly that establishing colombia as a strong and democratic nation is important to the region and to the u s a u s colombia free trade agreement can advance this goal but only if this agreement increases the capacity of the people and strengthens colombian institutions rep joseph crowley d n y washington
