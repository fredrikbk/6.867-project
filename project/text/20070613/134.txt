web based services give email users a taste of the infinite how is this for progress just three years ago the state of the art for web based email programs was the one gigabyte of free storage offered by gmail when it was unveiled on april it was such an absurdly large amount that observers figured it was an april fools joke by google since then a gigabyte or two of free storage has become routine so in an effort to shake things up once more yahoo this month is going google one better rather than merely providing a few gigabytes of email storage its offering in effect infinity "free unlimited storage" is being introduced for yahoo mail users this month its one of the first cases of internet boundlessness where the resources of the web have become so vast that normal measurements dont matter any more at least thats the theory in reality there are limits to yahoos limitlessness still competitors are taking note microsoft for example which runs hotmail says it will move to "take storage off the table as an issue " email is a crucial part of the business strategies of the big web companies because it brings millions of users into contact with their brands and products for yahoo and microsoft which offer a &# a year for pay service in addition to the free variant its also its own business in fact yahoo pays a &# bounty to marketers for each paying email customer they refer google has another reason to like email it serves up targeted text ads based on the contents of a senders gmail by reading key words yahoo and microsofts hotmail each have around a penetration of the global web based email market says comscore with yahoo slightly ahead gmail while a darling of the tech set is a distant third at around though its growth rate from last year made it the service thats coming on the fastest the three companies all do email in their own image microsoft talks about how closely hotmail synchs in with its widely used outlook desktop mail program along with its popular office word processing and spreadsheet programs google takes something of an opposite approach it is using gmail to wean people away from office and get them using googles rival web based versions for example if you receive a powerpoint presentation over gmail you can look at it via a built in viewer without needing to have powerpoint on your machine yahoo stresses the social networking of its email you can for instance either email someone or chat with them directly if they are online the other services have similar features so how exactly can yahoo or anyone else provide an infinity of something because they know that most people will never use it mail providers say that the vast majority of users come nowhere near their limits one yahoo executive conceded that a main reason for the move to "no limits" was to eliminate the perception that gmail still offered more storage even though yahoo had long since caught up most users fill up email not with lots of messages but with attachments and there are limits on how big email attachments can be usually they are in the megabyte range enough for an mp or two but a tiny fraction of what youd need for say a movie more significantly email tends to be slow sending a big attachment can easily take a few minutes yahoo says it is removing the limits so normal mail users dont have to worry about running out of room it also adds that it wont allow people to abuse the privilege though its slightly vague on what would constitute "abuse " would that include using software to cut up your computers hard drive into small files and then backing it up via email probably how about mailing a cds worth of mps to a friend probably not one of the ironies of the current tech scene is that the free email services available from the big web companies are often faster and have more storage than the corporate accounts that office stiffs use in their jobs every day its thus now common for people to forward work email to an outside free account turning it into a permanent archive thats always available for quick searching after a year or two of this its easy to run into situations like mine where a yahoo email account has more than messages in it and my own experience makes me wonder whether yahoo is biting off more than it can chew with its promise of unmetered electricity one of yahoo mails bragging points is that it shows you all of your messages in a single list like outlook rather than having to deal with them in batches of or at a time like hotmail and gmail but yahoo breaks down when i try to sort my huge inbox by certain criteria such as subject or size yahoo mail also stumbles with sending big attachments in a little test of mine it choked two of the five times i tried to mail a big file both gmail and hotmail did fine with hotmail being slightly faster yahoo said most users have much smaller inboxes and thus wouldnt have my problems but it promised to get engineers working on the matter "power users today are normal users tomorrow " said mail boss john kremer email me at lee gomes wsj com
