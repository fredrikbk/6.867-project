politics &amp economics blogger event draws democrats candidates court liberal support but its no guarantee of success chicago fox news talk show host bill oreilly couldnt have given new york sen hillary rodham clinton a better opening in mid july mr oreilly devoted a portion of his weeknight show to attacking a convention of liberal bloggers that began here yesterday organized by the liberal blog daily kos the event has brought together hundreds of bloggers journalists party insiders and democratic presidential candidates for a three day wonk fest of panels speeches and what promise to be beer soaked parties calling daily kos a "vicious far left web site " mr oreilly spent a segment of his broadcast attacking the blog and asking why the conferences lone major corporate sponsor jetblue airways corp would support a site that allows readers to post hateful comments jetblue later denied that it was a sponsor of the event daily kos bloggers its staff of editors and their many readers contributors took offense at mr oreillys attack and a war of words broke out it took less than a day for the blog to acquire an unlikely champion mrs clinton who has been a favorite target of the blogs writers for her vote to authorize the iraq war and her refusal to apologize for it within days of mr oreillys attack the clinton campaign launched a pro kos petition drive issued a statement of support and sent communications director howard wolfson onto mr oreillys show to defend the bloggers the strategy worked to reduce suspicions of mrs clinton among the bloggers gathering here "hillary appears invested in the netroots which is a great thing for all of us " wrote markos moulitsas founder of daily kos on his blog last week "hillarys response against attacks by fox news partisans is a sign of growing respect" for bloggers mr moulitsas told reporters here mr moulitsas noted on his blog that the clinton campaigns aggressive defense of liberal bloggers "was to send a message that the hillary campaign was going to have our backs when attacked by the right wings smear mongers " the episode underscores how important the writer activists have become to the democratic party and how much this weekends daily kos get together illustrates the trend liberal bloggers now routinely get invited to campaign events to meet candidates they receive press credentials and sometimes are given exclusive information during briefings and blogger conference calls when this weekends convention was attacked other campaigns also leapt to the bloggers defense connecticut sen chris dodd vowed to go on mr oreillys show this week to defend the site others issued statements of support now on saturday afternoon most of the democratic field minus delaware sen joe biden who is hawking a new book and sent his regrets will answer questions from the yearlykos crowd capping off three days of discussions and panels such as "ballot initiative campaigns " "what to do about the religious right " and "how to get your blog noticed " having bloggers on your side hardly guarantees electoral victory four years ago former vermont gov howard dean was a blogger favorite but his presidential campaign flamed out in iowa connecticut sen joseph lieberman remains widely despised among many netroots the grass roots of the internet bloggers for his vote for the iraq war and they helped lead to his defeat in the states democratic primary to businessman ned lamont but mr lieberman easily won re election in running as an independent yet for less known democratic candidates including some hopefuls who are heading here this weekend liberal bloggers have proved to be an effective grass roots army for raising money and creating excitement among the liberal base progressive bloggers have raised more than &# million since through actblue a political action committee funded by online donations from bloggers and their readers it helps funnel small donations to campaigns some bloggers and journalists will be among the people attending the second annual convention organizers say for months dailykos bloggers have been trying to raise money to help put on the event which organizers say broke even when it was first held last year in the wake of the oreilly controversy daily kos reported jetblue asked that its logo be taken off the conventions web site although the airline allowed the conventions organizers to keep plane tickets it had donated a jetblue spokeswoman confirmed the airline donated tickets for the convention but said it "was a donation in kind for marketing purposes" and not a sponsorship "anything between "the oreilly factor" and the convention is between them and we have no further comment " said jenny dervin the jetblue spokeswoman until the clinton campaigns aggressive defense on mr oreillys show of the netroots a term that usually refers to liberal internet activists there was speculation that the new york senator could receive a somewhat frosty reception from the kos crowd "there are definitely people who are anti hillary in the blogosphere " says jane hamsher founder of the popular progressive blog firedoglake "to have a candidate like that send a surrogate onto bill oreilly to defend the blogosphere was really a step forward " she says the new york senator hasnt won all of them over yet even after her campaign defended the bloggers she still only scored third in the daily kos monthly presidential straw poll of readers behind former north carolina sen john edwards at and illinois sen barack obama at but mrs clintons showing was still her highest in more than a year daily kos makes efforts to ensure that there is no ballot stuffing in its online poll the oreilly incident was just the latest in a quiet campaign by the clinton camp to try to win over liberal bloggers earlier this year sen clinton participated in a live chat on ms hamshers blog to answer reader questions when she received the endorsement of former ambassador joe wilson a hero among some in the liberal netroots for standing up to the bush administration her team first announced it on a blogger conference call "the idea behind this has been similar to her senate campaign where as people get to know her they get to like her " says peter daou the head of the clinton camps internet outreach efforts before joining the campaign mr daou compiled a best of the blogs column on salon com which endeared him to many writers who received attention after he spotlighted their work "there are bloggers with three readers and bloggers with who each have an important voice we dont limit efforts to high traffic bloggers " mr daou says
