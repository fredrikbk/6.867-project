closed circuit nuclear safety reports called into question gaps in global database blamed on regulators a scare in bulgaria to inform the public about nuclear plant mishaps a united nations agency in helped create a richter like scale rating them from zero to seven chernobyl was pegged as a seven three mile island rated five how many mishaps have occurred over the years and is the rate getting better or worse its hard to know thats because every day the u n s international atomic energy agency deletes from its web site any rated incident thats more than six months old the agency says it doesnt want to penalize more forthcoming countries by making it look like they have poor safety records as countries across the globe push nuclear power to feed a growing appetite for electricity transparency or lack of it is a big issue separately from the accident scale the iaea and another agency oversee a global database of nuclear incidents but regulators often neglect to pass accident reports to it that database and a second one run by the nuclear industry are off limits to the public "there are countless events that are insufficiently documented or not documented at all " says a may report by nuclear safety specialists that was commissioned by a green party member of the european parliament in japan last month tokyo electric power co initially said an earthquake near one of its nuclear plants caused no release of radiation only to admit later that it had reactor operators in japan have admitted falsifying safety records for years including the coverup of a incident in which operators lost control of a reactor for about a quarter hour proponents of nuclear power say the disclosure lapses shouldnt detract from the bottom line results no major nuclear accidents since the chernobyl disaster in ukraine in which killed dozens of workers and spread radiation for hundreds of miles "nuclear power is safe " president bush declared during a visit in june to a nuclear plant in alabama "the operations of the worlds nuclear fleet has demonstrably improved " says jeffrey s merrifield who served as a commissioner of the u s nuclear regulatory commission from until june the result he says is "improvement in the comfort level of the public in nuclear reactors being built both here in the united states and abroad " the world has operating commercial reactors in countries of which are in the u s regulatory records show at least four serious incidents have occurred since at overseas plants in bulgaria hungary sweden and taiwan including a radiation release and a fire a fifth incident involving severe corrosion in a reactor part that could have led to a major radioactive leak took place in ohio regulators emphasize that none of the incidents endangered the general public and that either backup safety systems ultimately kicked in or the problems were discovered in time amid concerns about climate change and the high price of oil the bush administration is trying to restart new plant construction in the u s for the first time in three decades the last new american plant watts bar in eastern tennessee opened in years after construction began noting that reactors produce no greenhouse gases because they dont burn fossil fuel mr bush signed an energy bill two years ago that offers subsidies and loan guarantees to new plants eighteen companies have told the nrc they hope to build up to new nuclear plants in coming years primarily in the south with the first to open around outside the u s nuclear plant construction never stopped thirty one plants are being built and china india and russia have announced plans for dozens more egypt indonesia and vietnam are exploring building their first commercial reactors nuclear power currently accounts for about of the worlds electricity production in the u s the figure is the american nuclear industry and u s officials have touted the performance of nuclear plants including those overseas as justification for building more plants among its "top reasons" why the technology is vital the washington based nuclear energy institute includes "nuclear power is a trusted technology abroad " the industrys policy association states "more than countries rely upon nuclear power as a safe and affordable source of electricity " two confidential voluntary databases contain extensive reports of safety related incidents one is jointly run by the iaea in vienna and the paris based nuclear energy agency part of the organization for economic cooperation and development the other is kept by a london based industry group called the world association of nuclear operators the iaea which opens its database to regulators so they can learn from others mistakes has seen fewer reports in recent years last year down from in it says this doesnt reflect improved safety but regulators failure to contribute reports to the voluntary system "we know about many more events that we think should be reported " says christer viktorsson an official in the iaeas department of nuclear installation safety the european report commissioned by the green party parliamentarian found that the french nuclear operator electricite de france sa has reported since around "significant" safety related events each year at its reactors to the institute of radiological protection and nuclear safety a government funded body but the institute passes on only about incident reports each year to the iaea jacques repussard the institutes director general says the purpose of the system is "not to report every incident it is to report incidents in which others may learn " he says frances level of reporting is no different from that of the u s or japan mr repussard says even the small number of incidents that do make it to the iaea tend to get ignored "a lot of countries dont make sufficient use of the reports for future prevention purposes " the managing director of the association of nuclear operators luc mampaey expressed the same concern last year he told inside nrc an independent newsletter that plants in different countries were suffering the same kinds of incidents suggesting that some operators werent checking the associations information a report last year by the oecd and iaea cited a number of recurring events at nuclear plants over the years including corrosion and valve failures in emergency core cooling systems mr mampaey also said that while many utilities were doing a better job of reporting events "the battle remains" because some werent reporting any officials at the association didnt respond to requests for comment in the u s even nuclear critics acknowledge that the nuclear regulatory commission is more forthcoming with safety related information than most other countries "the nrc provides the public with its inspection reports and incident reports " says james riccio a nuclear policy analyst at greenpeace usa in washington "even though the amount of information has decreased since it still seems to be more than whats provided by other nuclear nations " in the japanese earthquake last month information emerged in dribs and drabs tokyo electric power apologized after admitting the quake released radiation and radioactive water into the environment and knocked over hundreds of barrels of low level nuclear waste hiro hasegawa a company spokesman attributed the information delays to the plant being short staffed on a weekend the japanese government said the radiation releases posed no danger to the public the plant has been shut down indefinitely tokyo electric and other japanese utilities have previously admitted to coverups of nuclear plant incidents including accidents and unplanned shutdowns repeatedly over the past several decades in april the japanese government said hokuriku electric power co had admitted to hiding a incident at its shika nuclear plant when several control rods which are used to slow down or speed up the nuclear reaction in the fuel core became dislodged during a test while the reactor wasnt operating the dislodged rods caused the reactor to start inadvertently an emergency safety system had been turned off by workers and the reactor grew hotter for minutes before plant operators could shut it down the company said it didnt initially report the incident because the plant manager feared that construction on a second reactor would be delayed one of the few recent public sources that aims to give an in depth review of global nuclear incidents is the european report released in may rebecca harms a german member of the parliament who opposes nuclear power commissioned the study by seven experts led by french energy and nuclear policy consultant mycle schneider after interviewing regulators and studying incident reports the authors described in detail "significant events" in the last years including a dozen outside the u s they included nuclear fuel degradation a fire a hydrogen explosion and blackouts one little publicized incident it describes is a control rod failure near the town of kozloduy in northwestern bulgaria on march an electrical failure caused one of the main coolant pumps at the russian designed unit to stop the pump circulates water to keep reactor temperatures from reaching dangerous levels the system automatically began to reduce the plants power output by dropping control rod assemblies into the reactor core to decrease the nuclear chain reaction but some of the assemblies were stuck bulgarian records show more than six hours later a backup safety system was used to shut down the reactor later tests showed that more than a third of the assemblies were inoperable and apparently had been that way since their driving mechanisms had been replaced eight months earlier bulgarias nuclear regulator didnt acknowledge the control rod incident for days and initially said it had no safety significance five months later the regulator said the plants operator state owned kozloduy npp plc had fixed the sticking problem the study done for ms harms called the prior operation of the plant with inoperable control rods "an unprecedented example in the history of nuclear power " in the event of an emergency requiring an immediate shutdown of the plant it added the kozloduy system wouldnt have been able to prevent "severe damage of the reactor core " kozloduy npp disputes that assessment in its annual report it stated "in we did not have any events with a negative impact on safety due to the high safety culture of our personnel " the report devoted one sentence to the control rod incident noting it received a rating on the iaea scale one level below a "serious incident " mr repussard of the french nuclear safety institute says many utilities fear that if they release information on incidents they consider minor "it might not be interpreted well by the public " if all incident reports were made public he says plant operators would be reluctant to share them with each other no radiation was released in the bulgarian incident but that wasnt the case with a mishap in hungary on april workers at the paks nuclear plant south of budapest were cleaning used but still radioactive fuel rod assemblies by placing them into tanks containing water and chemicals that remove mineral deposits at p m hungarian records show alarms sounded in the reactor hall when monitors detected high levels of radiation the area was evacuated an emergency team unlocked the lid of the cleaning tank to inspect the assemblies radiation levels in the area immediately soared two hours later a cable used to open the lid snapped leaving the lid stuck and the tank partially open radiation levels spiked again it turned out that the fuel rods had overheated as the nuclear reactions had speeded up because the cooling system for the tanks wasnt sufficient according to the report for the european parliament emissions of radioactive gases like xenon and krypton during the accident were nearly four times the total average annual releases of all of frances reactors the plant operator wasnt able to remove the radioactive fuel more than five tons of it until january nearly four years later a report by the hungarian atomic energy authority concluded that the radioactive exposure to the population was "negligible " it cited an inadequate "safety culture" at the plant however the hungarian utility that operates the plant mvm group publicly blamed a contractor framatome anp gmbh which designed the decontamination equipment the contractor later paid damages the most serious nuclear plant incident in the u s in recent years occurred at the davis besse plant in oak harbor ohio in there a pineapple size cavity caused by extensive corrosion was found in the lid of the reactor pressure vessel which houses the fuel core the corrosion the worst ever found at a u s plant could have led to a loss of reactor coolant water workers discovered the problem before a serious accident resulted "its probably the most significant incident weve had" since three mile island says mr merrifield the recently departed nuclear regulatory commission member in that incident near harrisburg pa a reactor core was damaged but didnt release widespread radiation davis besse subsequently shut down for two years its owner firstenergy nuclear operating co a unit of firstenergy corp of akron last year paid &# million in fines and admitted to the justice department that its employees had lied to the nrc that the plant was safe to operate
