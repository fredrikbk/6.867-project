how vote may turn japans markets opposition party has new power to reject current bank line tokyo japans financial markets took in stride the heavy defeat that prime minister shinzo abe and his ruling party suffered in sundays upper house election but the outcome may have an impact on markets in coming years by affecting another decision who will be the next central bank governor bank of japan gov toshihiko fukui will step down march at the end of a five year term the most common view among economists is that his successor wont be as keen as mr fukui has been to raise interest rates that view has been strengthened by the historic election of the main opposition the democratic party of japan the appointments of governor and the other eight members of the bank of japans monetary policy board require approval of both the lower and upper houses of parliament until the july vote mr abes ruling coalition had majorities in both chambers the dpj as the opposition party is known now has more upper house seats than the coalition parties combined total meaning it can likely block any candidate it doesnt like economists say the dpj likely would favor candidates with an academic or business background but the opposition group will oppose candidates with strong ties to the government or mr abes liberal democratic party that could tip the selection for governor toward candidates who favor keeping monetary policy loose for as long as possible "i think the boj will be a bit more dovish other things being equal " says john richards head of debt market strategy and economics for asia pacific at royal bank of scotland in july mr fukui ended a five year policy of keeping the central banks target for short term interest rates at zero in a subsequent increase the central bank raised rates to the current level of economists see mr fukui as determined to "normalize" monetary policy from its super easy state so many expect him to implement two more quarter percentage point rate increases before his departure the next increase could well come at the boards next meeting on aug however japans core consumer prices which exclude fresh food prices but include energy have posted small year to year declines since february after edging up in from that makes it hard for the central bank to raise interest rates at a faster pace as a result a big gap has opened between japans super low interest rates and rates in the u s and euro zone until sundays election mr richards was forecasting three to four interest rate increases a year of a quarter percentage point each he now expects two or three increases a year during the first few years of the new governors tenure a slower pace of raising interest rates would translate into higher prices for japanese government bonds as bond prices move inversely to yields which are the interest rates on the governments borrowing the yen meanwhile would remain weak against the dollar euro and other currencies as investors would continue to sell yen to invest in countries where returns are higher a weak yen generally boosts the stock prices of japans blue chip exporters the nikkei stock average of companies has shed since sundays election and ended yesterday at but yesterdays decline was mainly due to a downturn in the global stock market rather than the election result prior to sundays vote economists thought the front runner for next central bank governor was toshiro muto one of the two deputy governors mr muto a former top official at the ministry of finance holds policy views similar to mr fukuis and likely would continue current policy but there is a strong likelihood the dpj would reject him when he was nominated as deputy governor in the party opposed him because of his background as a bureaucrat for the same reason the dpj also might oppose kazumasa iwata the other deputy governor and also a former bureaucrat tetsufumi yamakawa a goldman sachs economist in tokyo says one strong candidate is kazuo ueda a university of tokyo professor a member of the bank of japan policy board until mr ueda like other academic candidates tends to emphasize the importance of boosting peoples expectations that prices will rise in the future mr yamakawa said in a report this week an implication of this kind of approach is that interest rates should be kept low while consumer prices remain low european stocks
