weekend journal taste houses of worship further fervor missionaries go from east to west the recent kidnapping of south korean christians in afghanistan highlights an overlooked fact asian missionaries are everywhere and today theyre often found in some of the worlds most dangerous hotspots nowhere has this hit home harder than in south korea where the afghan incident has triggered widespread soul searching on july south korean aid workers were kidnapped in the central ghazni province by taliban militants the pastor bae hyung kyu was shot dead on july five days later year old shim sung min was killed and dumped on a roadside as i write this the rest of the group is still in taliban custody although only about of south koreas million citizens are christian the country is second only to the u s in the number of missionaries it sends abroad as of last year korean missionaries were stationed in countries the people taken hostage in afghanistan were on a popular kind of tour in which church groups go on short nonevangelical aid trips mostly in their s and s all of the hostages were members of the saemmul community church a presbyterian congregation in bundang a suburb of seoul many were english teachers or medical professionals over a day period the group was scheduled to be in northern afghanistan then travel to kandahar to organize "medical activities and activities for children " according to kim hyung suk president of the korean foundation for world aid which organized the trip the koreans were seized at gunpoint while riding a bus on the highway from kabul to kandahar their captors have demanded the release of taliban prisoners in exchange for the hostages but the afghan government has refused missionaries in asia have long faced violence a hundred years ago american and european christians streamed into the region to convert the chinese and koreans during the boxer rebellion in china foreign missionaries were targeted and in many cases killed but they kept coming because asia houses some of the worlds largest non christian populations today christians in asia number million up from about million in according to statistics from the center for the study of global christianity and as christianity flourishes more and more believers often asian begin to heed jesus instruction to his disciples to spread their faith across the world the presence of south korean christian aid workers is one of the most visible examples of the trend toward "majority world" missionaries those hailing from continents other than europe and north america south korea for example sent only missionaries abroad in but by there were over and this number doubled by south koreas fervor is unique in that its a relatively new christian nation the example set by the missionaries mostly american and british who came to work in korea is still a recent memory like its neighbors china and japan the korean peninsula was traditionally influenced by buddhism and confucianism a small number of catholic missionaries came in the late th century their protestant counterparts arrived about years later but it wasnt until the s that the number of christians began to increase dramatically the traumas of the japanese occupation and the korean war had left the country reeling and some see christianitys growth as a response to those difficult times although about half of korean missionaries go to other east asian countries a growing number settle in places like jordan turkey and syria korean missionaries were present in iraq until the beheading of a korean translator there the flow of majority world missionaries goes from west to east as well one underground church in china is run by a missionary who felt called to go there from his home in nigeria as the missions increase in size and scope so do the risks however in korea the hostage situation has provoked a backlash bloggers and local media outlets have attacked the hostages for being na&amp iuml ve and churches for competing with one another to see who can perform the most dangerous missions some web postings even suggested that the hostages had gotten their just deserts within the christian establishment the incident has triggered a reassessment "vacation missionaries go to war zones like iraq and afghanistan and you get them in situations where they are way out of their depth " said tim peters a christian living in korea in the wake of the kidnappings several churches and organizations have canceled their trips to afghanistan the korean government has restricted its citizens from traveling to afghanistan without explicit government approval meanwhile family members of the victims are gathered at saemmul church praying and watching newscasts christians around the country are keeping vigil amid the onslaught of critical voices many in koreas christian community feel misunderstood "its not about competition i think missionaries are sharing because they have boldness " says kim hee chan who works at the middle east team a group that helps organize missionaries and she says "missionaries sacrifice " a fact the hostages in afghanistan know only too well ms hook is an editorial writer at the wall street journal asia
