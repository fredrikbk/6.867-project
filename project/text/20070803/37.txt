in race to find water its science vs witchers napa calif on a recent afternoon here at the delectus winery rob thompson tapped two thin metal rods to the ground holding the rods in front of him he slowly pirouetted staring down into the dust when the rods swiveled in his hands he mumbled to his instruments " gallons at feet gallons at feet gallons at feet " miles from a mainstream water supply mr thompson was looking for water to create a well for the winery he says the rods help signal water crossing when near what he calls "water veins " the rods he says move on their own he typically will mark a water source indicate how many feet below the surface its located and how many gallons per minute its likely to yield he says he gets all the information through intuition mr thompson years old is a "witcher" or "dowser" someone who says that they can detect underground water using twigs rods or a pendulum hes one of what the american society of dowsers estimates to be more than water witchers in the u s many of whom are paid for their services even though many geologists say the field is unscientific mr thompson says business has never been better thats because western states such as california and arizona are experiencing a well drilling boom amid one of the driest stretches in years and a surge of new properties being built in areas off the municipal water system property developers typically look to modern technology first hiring geologists to search for water using high tech tools such as satellite imagery and magnetotellurics a method of creating images of things beneath the earths surface but because their investments could flop without a water source developers building luxury resorts orchards and wineries off the water grid arent taking any chances some are hiring witchers as well as geologists pitting them against each other in the water hunt meanwhile some well drillers have witchers on staff other drillers offer witcher referrals or subcontract with independent witchers steve arthur vice president of arthur &amp orum well drilling inc in fresno calif says that witchers can be effective "our customers just want water and dowsers find water " says mr arthur delectus the winery hired mr thompson after geologists data purportedly led to dry wells mr thompson charges &# an hour plus &# for each gallon per minute produced in a well he has located he gets paid his hourly rate whether or not he finds water when a well yields abundant water he says he can make &# in a days work though he sees only a couple such days a year mr thompson began water witching as an year old the profession runs in his family his uncle and his grandfather were also witchers people who claim the ability to locate groundwater have been around for hundreds and perhaps thousands of years according to the u s geological survey the witchers divining rod was used in the mines of western europe in the th century witchers explain their abilities in myriad ways faith in god electrical impulses magnetic fields and intuition chief among them most witchers say anyone can learn to do it water witching raises many geologists hackles the scientific community tends to explain any success witchers have by saying they look for signs of water on the earths surface such as changes in vegetation george dunfield chief of the professional standards unit at the california board of geologists and geophysicists says many witchers are frauds who swindle customers but water witchers he says are protected by the first amendment mr dunfield says by hiring a witcher consumers are essentially signing onto a religious doctrine "like voodoo" and the state can do little to protect them he says there have been a growing number of complaints recently from people who say they paid witchers to find water and were led to dry wells enforcement officers from the california geologists board and the contractors state licensing board are now planning sting operations targeting witchers and well drillers who use them says mr dunfield while low tech witching isnt illegal a few witchers who purport to be scientists and use high tech equipment such as radar to supplement their witching are violating a law that bans practicing geology without a license all of this hasnt stopped some thirsty developers from turning to witchers as a hedge against geologists when a group of investors called aqua trac llc launched a &# million mile water pipeline project in western nevada in they hired geologist walt martin to locate groundwater but the aqua trac investors also hired a witcher named jack coel "weve seen dowsers find wells out on ranches where no ones ever found water before " says investor tom gallagher a fifth generation nevadan who grew up ranching "we just wanted to have all our bases covered before spending a few million dollars drilling " one of the coordinates mr coel provided ultimately produced a gallons per minute water gusher even mr martin the geologist concedes he was impressed "he was within a stones throw of the locations i chose " says mr martin when winemaker gerhard reisacher looked to buy delectus winery located on a previously dry mountainside outside calistoga calif in late his purchase was contingent on finding water "i put the geologists report down picked up the phone and called a water witcher " he says mr thompson began work at the acre winery in october and promptly located a well drilling spot that yielded more than gallons of water per minute to find water he says he follows a few basic rules to trust himself and to stay hydrated since "you cant find water if youre thirsty " he says in may mr thompson was tasked with finding water for the napa valley golf course and estate homes project hes being pit against a hydrogeologist on the project mr thompson believes that finding water is becoming all too easy "what id really like is to try dowsing for oil " he says
