bridge collapse could spur infrastructure fixes even as the u s focuses on building st century projects such as municipal wireless networks it continues to be haunted by the crumbling state of its th century roads bridges and pipes the spectacular collapse wednesday of a year old bridge across the mississippi river in minneapolis could be the event that moves concern about americas "crumbling infrastructure" beyond the usual blue ribbon commission and magazine cover stories in contrast to similar tragedies that dot american history deaths caused by the collapse of a bridge over the ohio river this one comes at a time when there is broad consensus about the perilous condition of these national building blocks following the collapse of levees in new orleans during hurricane katrina and the recent rupture of a steam pipe in new york the demise of the interstate w bridge is likely to become exhibit a in the effort to improve infrastructure quality it was officially deemed "structurally deficient" by state inspectors in more than bridges across the country bear that designation it doesnt necessarily mean the spans are unsafe but that they need additional monitoring maintenance or repair work the american society of civil engineers says of the nations bridges are structurally deficient or obsolete "if there is a silver lining to all of this it will be the renewed focus on the enormous needs of our transportation infrastructure system " said janet kavinoky director of transportation at the u s chamber of commerce "we owe it to the memories of those who died to react productively and thoughtfully to this tragedy by renewing our roads rails waterways ports and aviation systems " in its latest report card the civil engineering society gave the nations infrastructure a "d " bridges received one of the highest grades at "c " it said the nation must spend &# trillion over the next five years to meet its needs and by coincidence shortly before wednesdays bridge collapse democratic presidential candidate sen chris dodd of connecticut and republican sen chuck hagel of nebraska proposed the creation of a national bank to finance infrastructure projects the bridge failure could also focus attention on the sometimes confusing relationships between local state and federal regulators which some say leads to problems going unfixed it might also recharge a debate over whether private investment should be embraced to fill states funding gaps four people were confirmed dead yesterday and others are presumed to have perished and remain trapped beneath concrete blocks in the mississippi river about are believed still missing officials from a multitude of federal agencies yesterday rushed to the scene where emergency responders and engineers set about the tasks of recovering bodies removing debris and figuring out exactly what happened terrorism was all but ruled out as a cause and minnesota gov tim pawlenty ordered an immediate inspection of all bridges in the state governors in other states followed suit and federal officials have alerted states to immediately inspect all bridges similar to the minneapolis bridge bridges are inspected at least once every two years but the w span which bore the passage of cars and trucks each day was being examined annually it was first designated as "structurally deficient" in due to corrosion according to dan dorgan the state bridge engineer at the minnesota department of transportation later "fatigue cracks" were found in the approach spans and repaired mr dorgan said a university of minnesota expert in found that similar cracks were not expected to plague the trusses that held up the roadway across the river and "that we could expect continued years of service from that structure " mr dorgan said more recent inspections including some conducted by urs corp an engineering company based in san francisco revealed no additional cracking and concluded the bridge was "fit for service " "in light of what happened we thought we did all we could but obviously something went terribly wrong " he said in a statement urs said it made recommendations to minnesota officials in including "retrofit measures to add redundancy and eliminate the possibility of member fracture " the company also said it had recommended further detailed inspections of the bridge in the s the federal government and states paid roughly equal amounts to fund infrastructure projects but state and local governments bear most of the costs these days according to the center for strategic &amp international studies a washington think tank "the commitment of the federal government has been sharply reduced " said felix rohatyn a former wall street banker and csis trustee who helped to develop the senators bank proposal at the same time rising costs for steel and other construction materials have reduced the purchasing power of public funds engineers are also in short supply and many are not interested in staying in positions where maintenance and inspections are their primary functions "its getting serious " said arun shirole senior vice president of new jersey based arora &amp associates engineering firm and a former engineer with the new york state department of transportation "if you have people sticking around for three years and moving out the quality of the inspections does not stay the same " the federal highway trust fund is slated to have a nearly &# billion deficit in the fiscal year an indication that the funds for transportation projects which come primarily from a cent per gallon tax on gasoline arent keeping up with the nations needs victor mendez president of the american association of state highway and transportation officials says the fuel tax needs to rise by three cents to sustain spending at levels authorized by the last major highway bill in a few years ago an effort to raise the gas tax was defeated amid white house opposition states generally own roads and are responsible for maintaining and inspecting them a process that is overseen by the federal highway administration a study by the department of transportations inspector general last year found a high prevalence of inaccurate calculations of how much weight a bridge can bear or other errors in of bridges it reviewed aside from encouraging the highway administration to improve its oversight of inspections the report found that mixed lines of responsibility for ownership and maintenance can delay repairs "state officials we interviewed said that in some cases this division of duties and responsibilities can hinder prompt resolution of problems " the report said
