politics &amp economics in europe does devolution of power cost too much business leaders warn of toll local rules take spains retail norms madrid a growing number of spanish business leaders and policy makers are warning their countrys devolution of powers to regional governments has gone too far creating barriers to commerce and investment within the european unions fifth largest country at a time when european countries are working to strengthen eu institutions many are rethinking the balance of power between their own central and regional governments germany last year moved to streamline its legislative process ceding to its states authority over areas such as shop opening hours and trade fairs while limiting their participation in federal legislation at the same time countries such as spain and the united kingdom have been handing over basics such as health care and education in an effort to assuage ethnic tensions and improve government accountability spain also has devolved wide powers for regions to legislate over transportation commerce and the environment among other areas in the years since dictator francisco francos death spain has gone from being one of europes most centralized countries to one of its most decentralized its constitution recognized autonomous communities and launched a process to gradually pass decision making authority to them in recent years the socialist led government has encouraged regions to draft new charters granting them greater autonomy as the european common market becomes a working reality the acceleration of devolution has sparked fears spain could rupture its own internal market denying companies economies of scale offered by a relatively large market of million people "the proliferation of regional legislation means that in some cases companies have to abide by different regulatory frameworks in their domestic market posing obstacles and higher costs for private enterprise " said gerardo diaz ferran head of spains employers association confederacion espanola de organizaciones empresariales or the ceoe in spains heavily regulated retail sector more than national and regional norms dictate opening hours sales periods and other aspects of business according to anged a spanish association of large retailers including el corte ingles sa carrefour sa and ikea international as national law dictates that most types of shops can only open eight sundays a year each region can then decide whether or not to allow more openings though most dont the regions also choose which sundays they will allow store openings and when to let retailers hold sales "we cannot coordinate marketing campaigns or logistics on a national scale which translates into higher costs " said anged managing director javier millan astray many spanish regions have banned new store openings of large retailers usually defined as outlets of more than square meters square feet the balearic islands has had a ban in place for years anged estimates that billion euros or more than &# billion in investment which could create more than jobs is on hold as a result of these bans increasing regulation of retailers reflects the political clout in regions such as the balearic islands and catalonia of small shop owners who seek to curb the expansion of large chains restrictions on opening hours for example protect small shops that dont have enough staff to stay open late more regulation also reflects the growth of regional administrations which employ nearly three times the staff of spains central government "decentralization has brought more interventionism " said jose maria de areilza vice dean at madrids instituto de empresa business school the organization for economic cooperation and development says spanish retail regulations are the third most rigid among those of its member nations behind greece and belgium it says inefficiency in this important sector contributes to spains low productivity and high inflation to be sure fragmentation of its internal market doesnt seem to have dented spains economic growth rate the highest among the large countries of the euro zone for more than a decade spain continues to benefit from the massive stimulus of historically low interest rates and large immigration flows business leaders though warn excessive regulation will undermine the competitiveness of spanish companies over the long run they are calling on the central government to take steps to unify economic legislation in part by applying eu directives that have supremacy over national legislation fernando eguidazu head of economic policy for spanish business association circulo de empresarios says it isnt easy to quantify the negative effects of decentralization on investment and efficiency "but its something that companies from all sectors are starting to complain about " mr eguidazu also is managing director of the fraternidad muprespa an agency affiliated with the spanish health service providing medical services to workplace accident victims he said it took two years for his company to obtain permission to operate in some spanish regions for its prevencion unit which advises companies on how to improve workplace safety the spanish finance ministry is working on draft legislation to transpose the eu services directory in and the government has shown itself able to resist regions demands for more economic autonomy a ministry spokeswoman said the government for example refused catalonia spains most industrialized region the power to collect corporate taxes for the regions new tax agency but a spokesman for spains chemical industry association federacion espanola de la industria quimica espanola or feique said the cost of compliance with pollution control regulation in catalonia is times as high as in neighboring aragon spains parliament last year approved a new charter for catalonia which has been challenged in the countrys constitutional court by the opposition popular party in a recent speech in barcelona catalonias capital bank of spain gov miguel angel fernandez ordonez warned against rupturing the countrys internal market "we need to reflect and take the strong and positive aspects of decentralization and avoid those phenomena that hold risks for the efficiency of the economy " he said andrew peaple in london and andrea thomas in berlin
