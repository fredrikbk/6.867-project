barack obama neocon democratic presidential hopeful barack obama is taking heat from liberals and conservatives alike for his comment that he wouldnt hesitate to send u s troops into pakistan to capture or kill al qaeda leaders actually its the best thing weve heard yet from the junior u s senator from illinois "i understand that pakistan president pervez musharraf has his own challenges " mr obama said in a speech wednesday at the woodrow wilson international center for scholars in washington d c "but let me make this clear there are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered americans they are plotting to strike again if we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets and president musharraf will not act we will " as a candidate recently pilloried by fellow democrats as a foreign policy naif mr obamas remarks may be no more than an effort to don a mike dukakis helmet and given the senators consistent opposition to the war in iraq it may seem peculiar that he should now propose invading a nuclear armed muslim country all the more so since mr obama let slip yesterday in an interview that as president he would rule out the use of nuclear weapons "in any circumstance " before he backtracked but in a primary contest where democrats seem to vie with one another for the title of who will pull out of iraq the fastest mr obamas speech is at least a recognition that hed be willing to use military force somewhere its also a reminder to antiwar democratic voters that the terror threat wont vanish when the bush administration does and that u s soldiers will have to be put in harms way again sometimes the easiest but worst decision for a president is not to take military action this was part of president clintons failure against al qaeda in the s which his wife and presidential candidate hillary clinton now wants to bathe in nostalgia as a simpler time when life wasnt so hard but no one should forget that throughout the s mr clinton was storing up trouble with his failure to react forcefully to the first world trade center bombing and to the al qaeda attacks against u s embassies in east africa in and the uss cole in mr obamas comments also showed some welcome realism about the problem that confronts the u s in pakistan following mr musharrafs ill conceived truce last september with taliban connected warlords in the pakistani province of waziristan terrorist raids into neighboring afghanistan rose threefold al qaeda has also been able to substantially reconstitute itself in the area according to the latest u s national intelligence estimate if pakistan is unwilling or unable to police its own territory then no prudent u s president can afford to rule out special forces raids or predator strikes or more incidentally mr obamas words assuming they are sincere indicate that as president he would have overruled former secretary of defense donald rumsfeld who in is reported to have vetoed a u s commando raid into waziristan on grounds that it might have destabilized mr musharrafs government the senator describes that decision as "a terrible mistake " and anyone who wants to run to the right of rummy on counterterrorism cant be all bad too bad then that mr obama instantly squandered an opportunity for seriousness by insisting that iraq is "the wrong battlefield" in the war on terror in case he hasnt noticed iraq today is the main battlefield where u s forces are confronting and killing al qaeda on a daily basis and gis dont have to invade another country to do it the senator is also misguided to say that the struggle in afghanistan and pakistan is "the war that has to be won " as if fleeing iraq in defeat would make that easier if we let al qaeda emerge victorious in iraq or even allow it to claim a partial victory we will contribute a chapter to its mythology of islamist invincibility help it gain new recruits and encourage further assaults the best way to defeat al qaeda and the taliban in pakistan is first to demonstrate the national will to stay and win in iraq still mr obamas willingness to draw appropriate conclusions from realities in pakistan stands in refreshing contrast to his democratic opponents tragic as a premature withdrawal from iraq would be it would be compounded if democrats draw the lesson never again to use or threaten force abroad by distancing himself from his partys pacifist wing mr obama is growing up as a candidate see related letters "letters to the editor no aggression in pakistan" wsj aug
