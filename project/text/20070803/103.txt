weekend journal review television smoke and mirrors like the robert littell novel its based on tnts miniseries "the company" is a potboiler spanning years of the cold war the next three sundays p m edt the main theme is cia perfidy and bumbling in the struggle against an idealistic if determined kgb we watch mainly through the eyes of cia agent jack mcauliffe chris odonnell as he runs an agent in postwar berlin meets with hungarian freedom fighters in budapest organizes cubans at the bay of pigs and tries to navigate counterespionages hall of mirrors at langley the series mixing of fictional characters with real ones and its mangling of history for dramatic purposes can be jarring for people familiar with the era jacks appearance waldo like at the center of every maelstrom gives the entire enterprise a ludicrous air but if you can view "the company" as a basic thriller and ignore its gaffes youll find entertainment here the opening episode introduces us to yalie jack and his friend leo kritzky alessandro nivola as they are recruited by the cia in jack winds up in occupied berlin with tough talking superspy harvey torriti alfred molina his assignment is to make contact with a beautiful ballerina who is passing information that will help the agency crack soviet codes jack falls in love but it cant end well someone in britains mi is a soviet mole or is the operation doomed some viewers may wonder because jack openly meets his prime spy in the soviet sector where she draws top secrets still warm from her leotard over in moscow meanwhile jacks college friend yevgeny tipsin is recruited by the kgb not because he doesnt love the american people as the old propaganda line goes but because he hates a country where " million people go to bed hungry " never mind that stalin has been busy killing tens of millions of soviet citizens through deliberate starvation among other means in the russia of "the company " nearly everything is bathed in golden light the second installment finds jack in budapest where he has been sent to tell the ragtag leaders of an incipient anticommunist uprising that the u s will not risk starting world war iii by coming to their defense after a nasty encounter with the secret police he ends up in the thick of street fighting that culminates in the arrival of soviet tanks true to its theme of immoral equivalence in which american awfulness must match or exceed anything we see on the soviet side the hungarian experience plays out as an indictment of washington for egging on the freedom fighters only to leave them in the lurch reasonable people can disagree about the events of but little reliable will be gleaned from this account "the company" is truly gripping when it leaves mushy romantic plotlines aside and stops banging the pox on both your houses drum this happens primarily in the final episode which focuses on real cia mastermind james jesus angleton and the smoke filled world of counterespionage the hunt for soviet spies buried inside western intelligence agencies is one of the most fascinating aspects of the cold war you get the flavor here yet this show about deception engages in some lies of its own for example british kgb mole kim philby referred to as adrian philby here actually fled to moscow from beirut not washington after his cover was blown placing philby played by the marvelous tom hollander in d c to serve a tv plot is not a mortal sin and if it werent for the fabrication that has angleton actually catching the big mole "the company" might have no dramatically satisfying ending even so its painful to think that for some viewers such fictions will be mistaken for truth and how many will groan as they should at the final words of "the company " in which two old cia operatives look back on the just ended cold war "there were good guys and bad guys " says one to which the other replies "which side were we " thats almost a cliche take by now shocking in its display of smug idiocy only to the poor souls who spent the cold war behind the iron curtain the hbo documentary "white light black rain" monday p m comes on the nd anniversary of the nuclear bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki it opens with a series of eerie vox pop interviews on the bustling streets of hiroshima today where young people all say that they have no idea of the significance of august thats unsettling particularly because soon after that we are introduced to many survivors of the blast some have horrific physical scars while others reveal only psychological ones yet the stories they tell are uniformly chilling as is their collective fear that the world will forget and so it will happen again in this film at least the survivors dont express much anger at america their bitterness is directed mainly at japan where they note they have become outcasts still their chief concern now seems to be for the rest of us who may be doomed to experience the worlds next nuclear attack "make love not war" isnt the explicit theme of vhs new reality series "the pickup artist" mondays p m but the guys recruited for this hilarious show are so desperate to meet women that they have no time for much else their teacher is professional babe magnet erik von markovic aka mystery his book "the mystery method" is a sort of "the rules" for men along with some nonsense it reveals an uncanny grasp of human nature and what women want whether this knowledge can be absorbed by the eight dipsticks here remains to be seen one guy cant help giving off strong if false gay vibes another longs to meet a woman of "moderately jewish appearance" so that their children will "look like white people with tans all year round " as fascinating as it is to peer into the minds of insecure guys mystery steals the show when he appears with his "wingmen " matador and j dog in keeping with their theory of attention getting or "peacocking " all three men sport two earrings this week matador appears to be wearing silver lip gloss and j dog looks like a miniature helen mirren with a wacky dye job mystery has a long dark ponytail and possibly uses eyeliner the overall effect is of a serbian war criminal in halloween drag but you know what after the geeks bomb out in a bar full of single women a hidden camera shows mystery and his wingmen strutting into the room and bam within seconds they have clouds of females surrounding and even pawing them once you stop laughing you cant take your eyes off the spectacle two other shows worth checking out "the fashionista diaries" wednesdays p m on soapnet follows six entry level assistants in new yorks fashion publishing and p r worlds as they cling to the edges of glamordom its fun to watch them jostling for a better perch then theres
