the evening wrap an overdue ethics overhaul online edition congress passed and sent a far reaching overhaul of ethics and lobbying rules to president bush as the ghost of jack abramoff and new ethics probes continue to haunt the capitol the senate voted on the bill which had been approved in the house by a vote its arguably the most ambitious attempt to shore up congressional ethics rules since at least the mid s and its passage was a priority plank in the democratic agenda dems jumped on ethics issues as a political issue in the wake of scandals tied to mr abramoff and the issue helped them retake both houses in the mid term election campaigns and as such it became a legislative priority still the senate vote wasnt just a party line affair as some republicans including minority leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky and the partys longest serving member alaska sen ted stevens joined with democrats on a crucial vote to cut off debate on the bill as the wall street journal noted the debate came at an awkward time for mr stevens on monday the fbi raided his home in girdwood alaska as part of a grand jury investigation related to his dealings with an executive at an oil company who has been convicted of bribing state legislators on the losing side of the debate were some conservative republicans who argued that it didnt go far enough to end the practice of adding special interest "earmarks" to spending bills conservative taxpayer associations and minority whip trent lott of mississippi added their voices to the opposition and notably arizona sen john mccain broke from his presidential campaign to argue against the bill a position that put him up against old allies from past bids to revamp campaign finance while good government groups said the final bill was a bill less stringent than previous versions they were largely happy with the outcome what would it do the bill would bar lawmakers from taking gifts from lobbyists or clients and make senators cool their heels for at least two years after they exit government before they start cozying up to their ex colleagues on behalf of special interest groups house members would have to wait one year it also would train a much needed ray of sunshine on lobbyists bundling activity in which they gather gifts from a number of people and steer large amounts of cash to politicians on the earmark front the bill would force lawmakers to publicize planned earmarks hours before a vote as well as certify that they dont have a direct financial interest in the spending clause also "secret holds" a piece of procedural black magic in which a single senator can anonymously stall action on a bill would be another no no under the bill as would accepting trips on private planes also legislators convicted of some serious crimes such as bribery would lose their congressional pensions the white house hasnt yet said whether president bush will sign the bill stocks stage second straight late day surge stocks were higher
