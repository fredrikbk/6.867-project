weekend journal hollywood report up next your favorite album in concerts bands play cds first track to last battling the ipod effect they are the words that for many rock fans are a cringe inducing cue to head for the bar "and now wed like to do one from our new album " for a growing number of older musicians the remedy is to give fans exactly what they came for live performances in which the set list comprises an entire classic album played in sequence from start to finish the catch as an encore the artists usually serve up second sets made up almost entirely of their most recent works the artists who have deployed the gimmick or plan to do so soon are a diverse lot pink floyds roger waters has played live versions of the bands epic commercial juggernaut "dark side of the moon" while sonic youth hit the road this summer to play its indie rock landmark "daydream nation " and the trend isnt limited to the most revered works of these performers lou reed spent part of the summer in europe performing "berlin " a downbeat record that was panned by critics and fans alike upon release but has gained status over the years this fall alternative country singer songwriter lucinda williams will play weeklong stands in new york and los angeles with each night featuring a complete performance of one of her five most prominent albums such as s "car wheels on a gravel road " but during a second set shell play selections from her release "west " playing an album in its entirety would seem to be a counterintuitive move at a time when the long form album is supposed to be dead as both a commercial and artistic force one of the most commonly heard complaints about the music industry in recent years was that albums forced people to buy to songs when they only wanted one or two sales of complete albums have cratered with combined sales of cds and digital albums down more than this year alone as fans gravitate toward online digital music services that allow consumers to pick only the songs they want individual songs represented about of paid digital music downloads so far this year an estimate based on nielsen soundscan data and the standard prices of cents per track and &# per album the tactic also seems risky in a concert business in which profit margins are razor thin in the first half of the average ticket for the top grossing concerts cost &# according to

first quarter of of &# million more than its &# million loss for all of live nation also lost money in the impetus behind the current wave of live album concerts comes from england and in particular from barry hogan the year old london based founder and director of an influential music festival called all tomorrows parties "when you see a band you love how often are you sitting there thinking why are they doing this new stuff " mr hogan asks and after having asked himself that question one too many times he decided to do something about it in he launched a concert series related to all tomorrows parties called dont look back that series has presented around two dozen alt rock artists playing beloved albums in their entirety from iggy pops stooges playing s "fun house" to the cowboy junkies doing s "the trinity session " this year mr hogan has brought his series to the u s presenting concerts by such influential acts as sonic youth mudhoney and the rapper gza mr hogan says he conceived of the series in part as "a rebellion to the ipod shuffle where people download odd tracks " "that kind of thing is ruining music " he insists "were celebrating the album as an artform " but some artists have taken the practice to extremes in after their independent record label went out of business cheap trick was desperate for a thematic hook for a concert tour they settled on promoting reissued versions of their first four albums one of which was the classic "at budokan" itself a live recording of the band in peak form before a frenzied japanese audience playing an album a night the band settled into a series of cities for three and four night stands rock star friends such as pearl jam signed on as opening acts in some cities on nights when the band played the material from "at budokan " lead singer robin zander even went so far as to re create his stage patter from the album which has become nearly as beloved by fans as the songs themselves thanks to the comically awkward delivery that was supposed to be intelligible to a tokyo audience "he was speaking slow and clearly so the fans could understand him " recalls cheap trick drummer bun e carlos twenty years later in front of american audiences perfectly capable of understanding him mr zander introduced the hit "surrender" with the same stilted delivery mr carlos recalls "this next one is the first song on our new album " despite sellout crowds mr carlos acknowledges that in some ways the concerts were "goofy " for one thing the order in which songs appear on an album might not make sense in concert "if the producer didnt think there were or killer songs hed top load the sequence" with potential hits mr carlos says that means that in concert a band might end up closing with the weakest material of the night another problem there were some songs on the albums that the band had never played live and they struggled with them a few were rearranged as acoustic numbers to give themselves a breather "we were young men when we did em originally " mr carlos says even when playing old material doesnt present technical challenges it can still be frustrating for an artist "im a better singer than i was in " says ms williams "and i find that my later songs are my better songs thats the way it should be " nonetheless ms williams will employ the album based strategy in her l a and new york engagements with the albums featured ranging from her self titled release to s "world without tears " her plan to finish up with newer material mimics a tactic that worked for others including sonic youth who have closed recent performances of "daydream nation" with songs from their newest album ms williams is playing the shows in part as "a big party to celebrate my work i guess " to that end she has invited several prominent musician friends to perform with her during her second set the guest list isnt yet confirmed but performers she has spoken with include bruce springsteen steve earle and elvis costello ms williamss manager and fiance tom overby says ticket sales in l a have been strongest for her commercial breakthrough "car wheels on a gravel road" a development that slightly bugs ms williams who says the album has never been a favorite for her the way it is with fans "thats the challenge " she acknowledges "as an artist you always want to feel youre presenting your best work but you dont always know what your best work is " in los angeles fans can buy tickets for all five nights at a modest discount in new york city where the shows are split between two venues there is no discount mr overby says all the shows in both cities are on track to sell out ms williams says there is a limit to how far shell go to re create her albums shes playing them with the backing of her usual three piece touring band not with keyboard and horn players and other additional musicians who feature in more elaborate studio arrangements "i would love to do that " she says "but to be honest it would defeat the purpose financially " other artists have taken a more maximalist approach for the just completed european tour during which he played his album "berlin " lou reed was backed by a piece orchestra mr reed played a brief series of "berlin" concerts in new york last year but his manager tom sarig says he is unsure whether the rocker will perform the album elsewhere in the u s whether the phenomenon proves short lived or a new way for artists late in their careers to make a living on the road remains to be seen ms williamss manager mr overby is optimistic "we hope that it will be successful enough that well do it yearly " he says
