in a strange universe we stick to search for familiar life in this universe life is not just stranger than we know it may be stranger than we can imagine would we recognize it if we ever did chance upon alien life researchers recently found water on a world outside our solar system for the first time offering the firmest evidence yet that life as we know it may be possible elsewhere in the universe as astronomers continue to find more planets by latest count revolving around suns beyond our own the discovery of water on one of them strikes a hopeful note using nasas &# million spitzer space telescope astrophysicist giovanna tinetti and her colleagues at the european space agency in paris detected water molecules on a planet trillion miles away they reported recently in nature this world known only as hd b orbits a cool dim star in the constellation vulpecula a stellar landmark so remote that its light takes about years to reach us in the atmosphere of this giant planet water may exist only as steam in boiling skies slightly larger than jupiter the planet is just th the distance to its star than earth is to the sun the scientists said consequently its normal temperature is degre fahrenheit hot enough to melt silver "our discovery shows that water might be more common out there than previously thought " said dr tinetti "i hope we can find water on planets less hostile " water crucial for the origin of life on earth has animated nasas search for life forms on other worlds for decades probes have detected oceans of slush on europa a moon of jupiter and active geysers on enceladus a moon of saturn tomorrow morning the u s space agency expects to launch a &# million probe to once again seek water on mars astronomers hoped that water also would be plentiful on so called extrasolar planets circling other stars but researchers tried and failed to find it until now these extrasolar explorations tax the ingenuity of astronomers "you cant actually see the planet " said harvard university astronomer heather knutson who published the first temperature map of an extrasolar planet in nature in may "you can only measure the light from the system " to detect water light years away dr tinetti and her team used the spitzer telescope to measure tiny variations in wavelengths of infrared light as the planet orbited in front of its star and eclipsed it "you stare at the planet watch the dip in light and measure it " said sean casey at caltechs spitzer science center in pasadena calif they saw that for each wavelength a different amount of light was absorbed by the planet the pattern matches that of water molecules all told ground observatories and satellites are scanning tens of thousands of stars for signs of alien worlds according to the online extrasolar planets encyclopedia the newest europes &# million corot space telescope discovered its first planet in may astronomers have catalogued a menagerie of planetary curiosities including a goliath times the size of the planet jupiter and a collection of gas giants so close to their stars that they orbit them in a day compared with the days it takes mercury our systems fastest planet to circle the sun in all there may be six billion such hot jupiter like planets researchers working with the hubble space telescope estimated last year it is unlikely any of them harbor life dr tinetti said in nasa plans to launch a &# million space telescope called kepler capable of finding smaller earth size planets our knowledge of the universe we call home and the search for water worlds hospitable to life is expanding almost as quickly as the cosmos itself look up on any midsummer midnight and consider the high dome of stars it still reverberates from the big bang of its creation billion years ago by current scientific understanding it mostly contains not the stuff we normally can see and touch but a dark matter that no one so far can measure directly black holes inhale entire galaxies gamma ray bursts release more energy in a blink than our sun can produce in a billion years super nova explosions scatter elements like pollen on the stellar wind in the face of so much strangeness it may be only human nature to seek out the familiar those searching for extraterrestrial life however ought to abandon the assumption that alien organisms would utilize the same biochemical architecture as life on earth a research panel recently urged "it is clear that nothing would be more tragic in the american exploration of space than to encounter alien life without recognizing it " said university of washington oceanographer john baross he is chairman of a national research council panel that recently issued a report called "the limits of organic life in planetary systems " life the panel speculated might arise as readily in seas of liquid methane in streams of ammonia or in caverns of nitrogen ice still we stare longingly into the mirror of the cosmos lonely hearts yearning for a
