toy recall shows challenge china poses to partners mattel inc s recall of nearly one million lead tainted toys shows the challenge chinese companies increasingly pose for u s partners how to benefit from low priced goods without getting torpedoed by safety and regulatory risks the mattel recall comprising types of toys from its fisher price unit involves excessive levels of lead paint in toys a common problem in china despite lead paint regulations both there and in the u s china makes nearly of the toys that come into the u s and is a leading exporter of products from electronics to apparel to auto parts recent weeks have brought a spate of quality control concerns about chinese exports from pet food to toothpaste to tires which besides spooking consumers has heightened existing trade tensions with washington the events also are triggering questions about the role western companies should play in monitoring the complex supply chain that links them to low cost production facilities in china the chinese government has tried to reassure consumers about the safety of its products chinese minister of commerce bo xilai said this week that more than of chinese exports are safe and of good quality the toy industry along with other businesses has moved so much manufacturing to china in order to cut costs that it remains exposed to problems despite laws and efforts on the ground to contain them public health experts say chinese manufacturers repeatedly revert to lead paint regardless of the rules because it is cheap and readily available and helps factories meet relentless pressure to contain costs such violations slip through because of regulatory gaps in both nations while the recent recalls have ignited health worries in the u s lead exposure is a major public health problem in china where millions of children have unsafe levels of lead circulating in their blood one study by researchers at peking university in beijing found of young children in china had blood lead levels that exceed the safe limit set by the world health organization though exposure rates have improved in recent years "were obviously concerned about the toys reaching the u s " says scott clark a professor of environmental health at the university of cincinnati "but there are kids in china who are exposed to this stuff all over the place " he has found unsafe levels of lead paint in india indonesia ecuador and nigeria in the u s a crescendo of lead related product recalls has encouraged calls for more rigorous standardized product testing for toys made in china about a third of the toys being recalled in the u s which include popular elmo dora the explorer and sesame street characters reached stores this spring and summer before mattel began the recall process last month mattel wont publicly name the manufacturer until the el segundo calif company completes an investigation of how the toys were tainted but jim walter the companys senior vice president of world wide quality assurance said "its my understanding that they are producing toys for other companies " he said if products from the factory were sold to other companies it would be the responsibility of the factory owner not mattel to alert them "we have no right to go in there to ask who else are you producing for and what else are you making " mr walter said he added that he had personally received no calls from toy companies seeking the name of the factory the toy industry association which has close ties to mattel said it hadnt asked for information on the toys source u s retailers and toy makers including mattel have attempted to devise processes to prevent products with lead contamination and other problems from reaching shelves but the systems vary and they havent kept problem toys from slipping through the process sometimes toys that have passed inspection more than once are later found to contain excessive levels of lead paint a sign chinese companies may have been able to game the safety inspections in mattels case its own inspection process praised for being an industry standard also failed mattel allowed the manufacturer to perform its own tests the company said because it has a trusted year relationship with it mattel says it performed monthly audits of the manufacturers toys which sometimes involved testing samples and other times involved reviewing the manufacturers own testing records "they didnt perform the testing they should have " said mr walter "and the audit we performed didnt catch it " "were certainly taking a hard look as an industry for a common set of requirements or procedures " mr walter added such incidents are one reason for calls to mandate independent third party testing meanwhile some critics say u s regulators such as the consumer product safety commission are ill equipped to police toy imports from china "the cpsc does not test the products in advance " says ed mierzwinski the consumer program director at the u s public interest research group "even if it were ordered to its underfunded understaffed and has inadequate authority to even impose recalls " last month cpsc chairman nancy a nord sent a letter to members of congress asking them to help modernize the commission it was last reauthorized in said agency spokeswoman julie vallese and its regulatory powers werent written for a globalized marketplace the reauthorization didnt include how to deal with purchasing over the internet for instance ms vallese said adding that the cpsc is "seeking st century tools for st century problems " at the same time chinese regulators are seen as lax in enforcing their own lead paint standards china has laws banning lead paint from consumer products but a lack of regulatory enforcement means such laws are routinely ignored over the past three years mr clark at the university of cincinnati has tested paint samples from china representing brands he found more than had lead levels exceeding the u s safe limit of for paint lead is a neurotoxin that hijacks the developing brain it causes damage by mimicking helpful metals found naturally in the body such as calcium iron and zinc lead displaces those and disrupts brain circuits critical for learning occasional exposure to small amounts is unlikely to have serious health effects but repeated exposure can cause declines in iq and in extreme cases severe brain damage new research suggests there is no safe level of lead exposure and the world health organization has tightened its guidelines over the past year that has sharpened concern over whether industry or governments can stop chinese manufacturers from using lead paint a series of recalls so far this year has involved not just mattel but millions of pieces of childrens jewelry thomas &amp friends trains made by rc corp and other goods the recalls can be costly for companies mattel which had sales of &# billion said today it expects to take a charge of &# million for the second quarter for the incident mattel could face liability lawsuits over the recall even though the toys were made by a third party rc faces several suits with allegations including negligence and unfair and deceptive trade practices some plaintiffs are asking for funds to medically monitor children who played with the toys an rc spokeswoman said the company believes it has taken "the right steps to protect the safety of the children and assure their parents the safe high quality products they expect " lead can make paint more resistant to corrosion stabilize it and fend off mold it also helps it dry quickly speeding up production and reducing costs two decades ago mattel was one of the first u s companies to move manufacturing to china the gritty industrial province of guangdong in southern china now has more than toy factories where the majority of the worlds toys are made lead experts say the scale of the recall suggests the use of lead paint wasnt uncommon at the factory at issue in the mattel recall "from the size of the recall were not talking about accidental use of paints " says paul mushak a toxicologist at pb associates a durham n c risk assessment firm specializing in toxic metals "were talking about something thats been a conventional practice " mattel disputes this claim how to prevent lead paint use has bedeviled u s toy makers in for example toys "r" us inc voluntarily recalled lead laden sticks of sidewalk chalk afterward the company ramped up safety measures by evaluating products before full scale manufacturing as well as enlisting third party labs to perform spot checks an internal team was also established to bring products beyond cpsc standards even so lead contamination has remained an issue for the retailer in march toys "r" us voluntarily recalled about military toys produced by toy century industrial company ltd of hong kong that were found to contain high levels of lead paint according to rick ruppert the companys executive vice president for product development and global sourcing the toys had originally passed two safety inspections first before they were put into production and then on the first shipment no lead was found subsequent shipments arent always tested mr ruppert said but periodic spot checks were done by a third party inspector as well as annual tests it was during one such spot check that a hong kong lab detected the lead since the most recent incident toys "r" us says it has stepped up testing for lead and has increased its quality assurance budget by but mr ruppert said the cost of moving operations from china were too high given chinas unique ability to produce high toy volume "the cost of the transition would be disruptive " he said mcdonalds corp one of the worlds largest toy buyers says the problem of lead paint is so widespread in china that the company has developed a system to monitor paint all the way through the supply chain back to the paint suppliers the company requires its chinese toy makers to agree to use only those suppliers "we never go on the open market so we know exactly who were dealing with " said walt riker vice president of corporate communications john mccary amir
