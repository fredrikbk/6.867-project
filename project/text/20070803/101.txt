weekend journal review books skewering the elvis of politics the rake a novel by william f buckley jr harpercollins pages &# some three decades ago william f buckley agreed to write his first novel he soon realized that he hadnt a clue how to begin perhaps suggested his doubleday editor a likable protagonist mr buckley bought a guide for novice novelists and set to work he ran into problems "i kept forgetting the names of my characters " he told a california audience in but he soldiered on sketched a plot threw in a couple of racy scenes and periodically indulged the temptation to note that "there is in fact a difference between joe mccarthy and joe stalin even though i know that will offend most of my reviewers " the result was "saving the queen" the first of the blackford oakes series and a new york times best seller since that initial spy story and its sequels a pleasing mix of ian fleming and russell kirk mr buckley has published more than a dozen novels in recent years ranging through history to re create for instance the nuremberg trials the elvis phenomenon and the rise and fall of cia spymaster james jesus angleton in "the rake " mr buckley takes his inspiration from a figure closer to our own time the elvis of american politics sen reuben castle comes of age in the late s and rises to the cusp of a candidacy for the democratic presidential nomination castle is a nimble politician able to "assume seniority without giving others any reciprocal sense of inferiority " he is "intelligent not learned but quick as a light hare and renowned for his good looks " his chief aide observes "the earnestness on his face when he was arguing a political position was followed so quickly so disarmingly by an affability nearly aggressive first appeasing then disarming his critics " such skills for attracting admiration and votes though cohabit with self indulgence narcissism and foolhardiness the result a wily calculator capable of stupefying miscalculations sound familiar from the outset castles sole and unshakable conviction is that he is in his own words a "golden boy " destined for greatness and entitled to follow his own code he machinates his way to the top of the student council and the school paper at the university of north dakota and draws national attention for an antiwar protest that is equal parts abbie hoffman and woodstock he never misses a shortcut "by a shrewd application of practical and psychological intelligence " castle reasons "he could increase the prospects of success while diminishing the pains of achieving it " so he serves in vietnam but cannily avoids combat futzes around in law school without getting a degree and snags and then neglects a trophy wife a former miss america who lapses into bitterness alcoholism and adultery though her record in the last category cant match his despite these specks of tarnish the golden boy charms his way from democratic party apparatchik to presidential aspirant as he is preparing to announce his candidacy though a potential obstacle abruptly appears a notre dame student believes that castle is his father and not just that the young man is out to prove that castle married his mother and dumped her without bothering to get a divorce with enough lip biting apologies spiritual advisers and hugs all around castle might survive the revelation of a heretofore unacknowledged unsupported son castle might have sinned but arent we all sinners the flurry of deadbeat dad laws came later bigamy though inconveniently breaches not just scripture but the criminal code castles efforts to tamp down his troubles with typical corner cutting and rashness only exacerbate them his greatest vulnerability proves to be his innate sense of invulnerability habitual self deception threatens to kindle self destruction as one character remarks "why are some bright people so stupid " mr buckley begins and ends his incendiary tale in and adroitly jumps through time and space to fill in the background the story is rife with missteps misunderstandings and lies not all of them castles mr buckleys wry humor often takes aim at the left when elected to chair the college student council castle pledges "the end of the vietnam war a repeal of the sentinel missile emplacements expedited student loans and the elevation of water hockey to ncaa status " and descriptions throughout are pitch perfect one character feels "a shaft of fear and the dull pain of sin coveted and acquiesced in " the story ends with an unexpected but entirely fitting act of charity not of course performed by castle during one crucial encounter castle tells himself to act natural unfortunately "he had this difficulty which many first rate politicians caught up in the theater of politics have namely that he wasnt sure what was in fact natural " beyond that astute observation mr buckley rarely generalizes he doesnt ponder whether a sense of entitlement drives most politicians for instance or whether a hunger for votes tends to accompany less appealing hungers whether in other words castle resides at the outskirts of the bell curve for his species or whether he represents a different species altogether what mr buckley does do is vividly portray a sammy glick for our time a hubristic hustler unburdened by conscience and thats quite an accomplishment one difference budd schulberg published "what makes sammy run " in his mid s when he himself was a young man on the make whereas mr buckley is almost and since april a widower in his acknowledgments to "the rake " he says that his literary assistants "patience and ingenuity keep me alive " even after a plot suffused with suspense and surprise nothing jars the reader as much as this note of mortality mr bates
