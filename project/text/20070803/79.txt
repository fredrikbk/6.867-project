speedy recovery heart attack survival plan airlifting patients to surgery minnesota transfers patients to a big center mr femlings close call new prague minn drenched in sweat and short of breath frank femling approached the front desk of queen of peace hospital in this rural town of and collapsed hospital staffers rushed to his side hoisted him onto a gurney and wheeled him around the corner to the emergency room where an electrocardiogram confirmed their suspicions mr femling was having a heart attack the year old excavation contractor and father of five could have been treated almost immediately with a clot busting drug the mainstay heart attack remedy at a majority of hospitals in the u s instead the emergency room doctor on duty activated a carefully designed plan to whisk mr femling from the tiny bed hospital to a medical center in downtown minneapolis miles to the north there his artery would be opened with an angioplasty balloon and a tiny metal scaffold called a stent if he got there in time mr femling was treated under an initiative introduced by cardiologists at minneapolis heart institute to improve heart attack care since the minneapolis cardiologists have treated more than patients who were transferred to the citys abbott northwestern hospital via ambulance or helicopter from community hospitals as far as miles away the strategy is patterned after trauma centers that handle victims of car crashes and gunshot wounds "we think people in out state communities are entitled to the same level of care available to people who live near a major medical center " says barbara unger head of cardiac emergency services at the minneapolis heart institute the program isnt cheap the bill for a helicopter ride alone can top &# proponents believe the approach may ultimately save money by shortening hospital stays and reducing costly long term effects of heart attacks research suggests that opening up a heart attack causing blockage with an angioplasty balloon and a stent yields better results than clot busting drugs that finding remains unchallenged even as some recent studies have raised concerns about overuse of stents in less serious cases but only of the hospitals in the u s are equipped with cardiac catheterization laboratories or cath labs the operating room like facilities where angioplasty procedures are performed that leaves about half of major heart attack victims in the u s without timely access to the best treatment one solution is to build more cath labs but that may result in a proliferation of low volume facilities increasing health costs while diluting quality of care no matter which treatment is used studies suggest patients do better in high volume centers where heart attack experts are on duty around the clock studies from denmark and the czech republic have supported the idea of transferring patients between hospitals these patients had better results so long as the transfer happened within two hours in the u s many have been skeptical the strategy could work partly because smaller hospitals might be reluctant to give up lucrative heart attack patients doctors say the minneapolis experience is helping to change that perception cardiovascular disease remains the no killer of americans it claims nearly lives a year although that number has fallen thanks to factors such as cholesterol lowering drugs and a reduction in smoking nearly americans arrive at a hospital each year with a major heart attack in which at least one of the three major arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle is totally blocked intravenous clot busters transformed treatment when they arrived two decades ago but in about of cases they fail to dissolve the clot and stop the heart attack moreover doctors steer away from using them with elderly patients because of a heightened risk of a bleeding or hemorrhagic stroke a catastrophic event angioplasty is a surer bet to open the artery and the chances of it causing a stroke are low whichever course is chosen every minute counts heart muscle quickly begins to die once it loses its blood supply the american college of cardiology and the american heart association say clot busters should be delivered within minutes of a patients arrival at a hospital or if doctors are ready to do an angioplasty that should happen within minutes current performance falls far short of those goals studies indicate only of patients get one treatment or the other within recommended times some dont get either treatment when patients are transferred to another hospital for angioplasty they have just a chance of getting their balloon within minutes shortening treatment times could save tens of thousands of lives a year and reduce cases of heart failure a chronic ailment in which the heart muscle cant pump blood effectively but few hospitals have a standardized plan for speeding patients to the right treatment "we fritter away time at every opportunity " says harlan m krumholz professor of cardiovascular medicine at yale university to address the issue the american college of cardiology announced a "door to balloon" alliance last year with a goal of achieving door to balloon times of minutes or under in of cases so far hospitals with cath labs have signed on says dr krumholz who is leading the effort a similar project dubbed mission lifeline was started in may by the american heart association one idea being tested in the boston area is to have ambulances take heart attack patients directly to a medical center with a cath lab rather than the closest hospital in less populated areas smaller hospitals are working out ways to send patients quickly to bigger ones thats what minnesota is doing as mr femling found out his heart attack began around a m on june fathers day he was shoveling dirt while helping a friend install a drainage channel when he suddenly felt light headed and started to cough minutes later while he was resting in the shade pain began to radiate in his chest he asked his friend to drive him to the hospital it was a m when he fell to the floor just inside the main entrance at queen of peace hospital five minutes later hospital records indicate james oreilly the doctor on duty in the emergency room read the electrocardiogram and declared a "level " thats the name for the protocol aimed at getting patients like mr femling to minneapolis and clearing the blockage within minutes an emergency room staffer reached for the hotline phone at to summon a helicopter the next call went to abbott northwestern in minneapolis prompting a single page that alerted nearly doctors nurses and even a chaplain there to prepare for a level patient that would bring cath lab staff to the hospital within minutes no other calls were required while awaiting the helicopter nurses at queen of peace grabbed a tool kit with drugs intravenous tubes and other supplies designed for a level patient the contents are identical at each of the participating hospitals and are typically kept in a fishing tackle box purchased at wal mart the kit means nurses dont have to wait for doctors to decide what drugs to order or take time retrieving them from the hospital pharmacy it was all happening like clockwork for mr femling the nurses gave him aspirin and the drug plavix to thin his blood next came nitroglycerin for pain then a beta blocker to ease the load on the heart nurses inserted two iv tubes in his wrist they dripped heparin another blood thinner in one and drew blood for a lab test from the other the helicopter arrived at a m dr oreilly recalls thinking that this one might happen in record time but as nurses and emergency workers moved mr femling to the helicopters stretcher he went into ventricular defibrillation a runaway heartbeat then his heart stopped he was in cardiac arrest the most common cause of death from a heart attack dr oreilly the nurses and the emergency squad scrambled to apply defibrillator paddles to mr femlings chest and shocked him "his heart came back to normal rhythm fairly quickly " dr oreilly says they continued with the initial plan to rush mr femling to abbott northwestern the helicopter lifted off at a m minutes after he arrived at the hospital the queen of peace team transmitted a copy of mr femlings vital data including his ecg and blood test to a dedicated fax machine in the cath lab at abbott northwestern the pharmacy there readied medicines based on his weight the flight took minutes it took another nine minutes for mr femling to make the trip from the hospital roof into an elevator and down five floors to cath lab no where his procedure began immediately at an angioplasty balloon was inflated to open the blockage in his right coronary artery restoring blood flow to the right side of his heart mr femlings time from the floor near the front desk of queen of peace hospital to an open artery minutes the performance was consistent with findings of a study based on patients treated at abbott northwestern under the level protocol through last november the figure includes more than patients who were transferred from outlying hospitals as well as some who came to abbott northwestern from the start the study published online yesterday by the american heart association journal circulation found that half the patients arriving from hospitals within miles of abbott northwestern had door to balloon times of minutes or less for those transferred from more than miles out the door to balloon time was minutes or less in half the cases the latter group of patients was given half the standard dose of a clot buster at the outlying hospital overall of patients got their balloon within two hours and got it within minutes "you take average time in the u s minutes weve almost cut that in half " says timothy d henry a cardiologist at minneapolis heart institute and lead author of the study patients in the study averaged three days in the hospital below the national average of five death rates of transferred patients were similar to those of patients who were brought directly to abbott northwestern and generally lower than those observed in other studies of heart attack patients about of level patients died within days of their heart attacks the average in all minnesota community hospitals those without cath labs was in just before the project began alice jacobs director of the cath lab at boston medical center and leader of the heart associations mission lifeline project cautioned against making firm conclusions on survival saying not enough patients have been studied door to balloon times didnt quite meet the minute guideline for a majority of cases still she said "these numbers are impressive this is a high risk group of patients " a second report in the same journal based on patients shows that the mayo clinic achieved comparable results with a similar initiative "the key part of the protocol is that the local physician is empowered to make the call " says kevin graham president of minneapolis heart institute and a leader of the project many major medical centers are reluctant to accept a heart attack diagnosis from a community doctor and require confirmation by a cardiologist before cath lab personnel are mobilized that step alone can waste minutes to more than an hour in the study only of cases were false alarms standardization of procedures is also crucial doctors say when a level heart case is declared everyone has a specific job to do one rural hospital assigns its cleaning lady to help push the stretcher to the helicopter "level is all you have to say " says david larson an emergency room doctor at ridgeview medical center who helped develop the protocol "youre all on the same page right off the bat " another advantage says dr larson is that abbott northwestern agrees in advance to find a bed for all level patients previously he says "i remember cases where i waited minutes just to get a call back to find out whether a bed was available " less clear is the impact on medical costs the bill for mr femlings chopper ride was &# an ambulance ride over the same distance would be &# managing the program and ensuring adequate staffing at the medical center add expenses however the minneapolis doctors believe the upfront costs can be recouped preliminary data indicate that after one year just of level patients needed a &# procedure to implant a defibrillator to protect against life threatening runaway heartbeats that likely reflects the programs success in limiting major damage to the heart muscle say the doctors they estimate more than of patients with major heart attacks typically become candidates for the devices the shorter hospital stay also reduces costs such findings have helped the minneapolis cardiologists win the support of local health insurers for the program says minneapolis heart institutes dr graham "mortality is the ultimate bottom line not dollars " says dr graham when doctors can show data indicating lives are saved "that is a compelling argument with the payer whether you are in minnesota maine or illinois " dr oreilly of queen of peace hospital agrees "when it started out i thought it was excessive " he says "but when you look back and look at the results its money well spent " by p m on fathers day mr femling was recovering in the hospitals coronary care unit and talking to members of his family he remembered nothing after hed gone into cardiac arrest dr oreilly and his staff got the word that same afternoon he was particularly relieved to learn mr femling was talking and his brain appeared to suffer no ill effects from the brief cardiac arrest "it was very lucky that he came in immediately " dr oreilly says "he was having the big one we made a huge difference in his life " mr femling was discharged from the hospital and went home three days later "from being dead to back alive and feeling really good well feeling fairly well within three hours in my book thats astounding " he says
