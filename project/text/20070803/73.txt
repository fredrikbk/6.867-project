senate passes health bill for children washington the senate last night passed a childrens health bill with enough votes to beat a threatened veto setting the stage for difficult talks with the house and a clash with president bush the vote represented a strong show of support from republicans on democrats top health care issue of the year sen max baucus d mont who led the talks that produced the measure said he is "baffled" by president bushs opposition to it he said he hoped the show of broad support for the senate measure would cause the president to reconsider but a white house spokesman said the veto threat would stand regardless of the final vote the administration has said the bill is too expensive and emphasizes government financed coverage at the expense of private sector options the bill calls for an increase of &# billion over five years in the childrens health insurance program a grant program to help states cover low income children the spending is offset as required under budget rules with an increase in the federal tobacco tax that translates into cents per pack of cigarettes before anything reaches mr bushs desk the senate must hammer out its differences with the house which passed its own chip bill wednesday the house vote was largely along party lines and the majority wasnt large enough to override a veto supporters of the senate bill said this would give them leverage when the chambers meet in september to work out their differences the two bills are closest on their approaches to chip the house would spend about &# billion more over five years than the senate but both versions focus funds on increasing outreach for the program for which millions of children are eligible but not enrolled the senate version would phase out payments for state coverage of adults who dont have children it would also reduce funding for coverage of low income parents such limits helped win republican support but they will be a flash point with the house where many democrats say state flexibility to expand coverage is crucial the senate bill would reduce the number of uninsured people mostly children by an estimated four million compared with a reduction of five million under the house plan the house bill also includes changes to the medicare program for seniors including a &# billion five year increase in payments to physicians senators want to stop medicare cuts scheduled for physicians this year and next but mr baucus said he didnt know whether such provisions would be included in a final house senate chip bill the house bill also includes &# billion of cuts over five years to private insurers that operate in medicare advantage a managed care alternative to the federal health program this level of cuts is unlikely to survive the senate certain cigars which are taxed at less than five cents each would be subject to higher rates under both bills the senate bill caps the tax at &# a cigar compared with &# in the house bill
