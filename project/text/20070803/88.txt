the dead too find hong kong really overcrowded traditional resting places are now hard to come by niche for ms muis father hong kong for six months sharon mui a year old hong kong office clerk had been waiting to lay her father to rest the former metal workers ashes were being held in storage until ms mui could get a government allocated lockerlike home for his ashes known as a "niche" and located in a building devoted to such remains but hong kong lacks space she did have options earlier this year the hong kong government made it easier to apply for permission to scatter ashes at sea it is also trying to promote the use of communal "gardens of remembrance " where cremated remains can be sprinkled free of charge but ms mui wanted none of that "my parents would never do sea burial or sprinkling " she said outside the nd floor office of hong kongs board of management of the chinese permanent cemeteries "theyre too traditional " that is a problem for hong kong which is running out of facilities to keep its dead and where many people cling to the chinese tradition of visiting ancestors graves for the living and dead alike hong kong is one of the most densely populated areas in the world many of the citys seven million residents live in public housing in apartments that by law can be as small as square feet a quarter of the territorys population is now older than and the number of deaths is increasing the construction of new facilities called columbaria isnt keeping pace by the government says half of the people who die each year may not get a resting place even morgues dont have room earlier this year the body of an year old man was mistakenly released to the wrong family because space constraints forced the hospital to keep two bodies in one compartment city planners are installing double capacity cremators to deal with the backlog at the citys mortuaries the government estimates that people will die here this year and that deaths will increase to in space is so hard to come by that those who manage to get a plot in a government run graveyard can stay there for just six years after that a body is exhumed and the remains are returned to relatives either as ashes or as bones while the grave is readied for a new occupant a few cemeteries offer permanent burials at about times the usual charge families must pay roughly &# half a century ago hong kongs british administrators coping with the territorys limited real estate and overcrowded cemeteries began to encourage cremations that flew in the face of chinas longstanding tradition of burial to attract people to the idea the colonial regime offered the service at a substantially lower price than burials today more than of hong kongs dead are cremated the average cremation for an adult costs &# to store the ashes the government built giant multistory columbaria like the one at the diamond hill cemetery in the kowloon district an austere eight story building it holds more than numbered niches on the face of each niche is a plaque for a photograph and other information about the deceased at the base of the wall is a trough where families burn incense nearby are large incinerators where they can burn offerings and paper money that the ancestors are thought to need in the afterlife two or three spaces may become available a month says geoffrey tang the cemeterys assistant venue manager because some families move remains to new locations some must wait as long as two years for a niche new supply is hard to come by as communities often object to the construction of columbaria near their homes "they dont want to have the demons ghosts of the dead next to their neighborhood " explains bernard chan a legislator who is trying to raise awareness of the shortage "we hope with the passage of time more and more people will accept other options " says yeung shun kui a government official with the agency in charge of columbaria and crematoria who notes that "all our new niches have been sold out " thats why earlier this year the government decided to let people scatter ashes at sea for the first time since the mid s to help overcome what mr yeung refers to as psychological obstacles the government charges only about &# for sea burials a government sponsored niche can cost up to about &# while privately run columbaria can charge more than &# both options unfortunately conflict with basic chinese traditions "this is exceedingly fraught " says james l "woody" watson an anthropologist at harvard university who has studied southern chinese death rituals for decades hong kongs government is "basically running an assault on peoples views of the ancestors " there is for one the belief that the remains of one person shouldnt be mixed with another a problem in a communal garden its also unclear what people would do during annual festivals when hundreds of thousands of families here make pilgrimages to their forebears resting place to clean graves bring flowers burn incense and say prayers sea scattering poses other issues "nobody would want the body separated into the stomachs of different fish " says y y wong a taoist leader in hong kong "we want to keep the body together " still things may be less of a problem for the next generation of chinese who feel less bound by tradition at diamond hill cemetery mr tang says hes considering sea burial for himself "the sea is no problem " he says the ashes after all are "just calcium " ms mui who at the end of july finally got a niche suitable for her father says that she and her two sisters might themselves opt for one of the governments new initiatives "hong kong doesnt have a lot of space and i dont want my family to have to pay for a piece of land for me " she says "sprinkling is cheaper and more practical " jonathan cheng contributed to this article
