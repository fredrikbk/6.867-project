weekend journal tastings first growths make their debut high end bordeaux hits one low note a &# bargain we will be on vacation for the next four weeks but before going away we noticed that the first growth bordeaux had hit the shelves so we conducted a tasting to find out if you should put these on your "buy" list we now have an answer along with a very uncomfortable question the first growths chateaux haut brion lafite rothschild latour margaux and mouton rothschild have been a gold standard since even before bordeaux wines were officially ranked by "growth" in mouton was added in while some wines now are equally famous and even more expensive chateau petrus is one example the first growths offer a consistent window into every vintage we have been tasting all of the first growths each year for this column since the vintage because was framed by two years that each were declared "the vintage of the century" yes the hypesters declare a "vintage of the century" just about every other year now and the s were indeed excellent the best group weve tasted for this column we thought it was possible they might be good deals indeed the average price we paid was &# down dramatically from &# for the vintage still this is about double the price we paid for the and vintages partly this is because those were lesser years but its also partly due to the increased interest in wine and greater affluence all over the world that has made these wines even more prized each chateau produces about to cases a year and when demand rises so do prices the average price on futures for the five first growths put your money down now for delivery when theyre released is an astonishing &# a bottle while futures are an average of about &# a bottle by contrast the s with the most expensive latour at &# and the least expensive mouton at &# could be bargains as these things go if theyre good as always we did not taste these wines blind but opened them on successive nights so we could savor each over several hours both with and without food these are newborns and wont be fully ready to drink for years so we give them plenty of time and all of our attention so they can show their stuff having tasted the wines were happy to report that this is an excellent group of wines overall they are not as dramatic as the s but they are very good and certainly better than the collective shrug the vintage is getting in some quarters these are the kinds of red wines that remind us what red wine should taste like not like sugar not like wood not like a lab made product but like fully ripe grapes picked at just the right time to leave plenty of zesty acidity and underlying minerals and earth few of us are likely to drink first growths every night but having a wine like this from time to time is important to remember what classic bordeaux is all about for our latest piece on inexpensive bordeaux drop us a note at wine wsj com our favorite for the second time in three years was mouton rothschild which makes it a relative bargain considering that it was the least expensive wine its a blockbuster big rich and earthy certainly the densest most concentrated mouton weve ever had this will get better and better in the years to come we also rated lafite haut brion and latour very good or better and were impressed with each one for different reasons all this left us however with this uncomfortable question what in the world is up with chateau margaux we have loved margaux for more than years while the other first growths are known for power or structure or great mineral tastes margaux to us has always been about elegance through the years weve found it fetching and romantic because it whispers instead of shouts beckoning us to discover its mysteries the mystery now though is where all that class went in the past seven years margaux has been our least favorite or second least favorite every year but one that was in when it rated delicious two years ago when we tasted the vintage we wrote "one bottle was so simple and two dimensional that we tried a second which was no better " last year the margaux was our least favorite and darned if we didnt have exactly the same experience this year that we had two years ago the first bottle we tasted was so thin acidic and lacking real taste that we bought another and this was painful at &# a bottle especially since we paid far less &# for the first bottle the second bottle was somewhat worse clearly flawed with potty and cereal on the nose and an odd creaminess in addition to its thin acidic tastes so we tried a third bottle and it was somewhat better still thin but with no off smells or tastes this was so disappointing and sad to us that we called the general manager of chateau margaux paul pontallier to ask if anything had changed new winemaker new leadership more production "im very surprised " he told us "there havent been any major changes in fact weve become more selective so were making less wine so many people have tasted this wine and were very happy with it all reports that we have received have been extremely favorable " of the three bottles we tried he said "this has to be a kind of bad luck which is incredible i am so sorry " we are too our column will resume after labor day the dow jones first growth index after a tasting of the five first growth bordeaux from the vintage we have listed our preferences in order wed wait at least five years before drinking these and maybe for lafite and latour but that doesnt mean theyre unpleasant now by any means if you do open one soon give it plenty of time to breathe and serve it with a simple steak because these are just being released prices are all over the map for instance we paid &# for margaux at one store and &# at another vineyard chateau mouton rothschild pauillac price &# rating delicious tasters comments best of tasting and best value the richest deepest earthiest mouton weve had with concentrated super ripe fruit terrific balancing acidity and all sorts of layers soul satisfying vineyard chateau lafite rothschild pauillac price &# rating very good delicious tasters comments classy and structured with tightly wound fruit cedar on the nose and juicy blueberries on the taste great fruit but acidity and minerality make it far more than a fruit bomb vineyard chateau haut brion pessac leognan price &# rating very good tasters comments marvelous minerals from the first smell to the finish make this restrained classy and interesting some bittersweet chocolate and a bit of pepper with an endless dry finish after an hour a hint of sage shows through vineyard chateau latour pauillac price &# rating very good tasters comments black color and a big inky nose and it tastes like that too hard and black and so far not very giving but this is clearly a significant wine with power and intensity and big fruit thats waiting to explode in a few years vineyard chateau margaux margaux price &# rating ok tasters comments for the second time in three years our first bottle was so thin acidic and unimpressive that we bought a second which was less enjoyable in a different way with a funky cereal smell and an odd creamy taste a third bottle was better still thin but with some genuine tastes of grapes and minerals note wines are rated on a scale that ranges yech ok good very good delicious and delicious these are the prices we paid at wine stores in new york we paid &# for lafite and &# for latour but these prices appear to be more representative prices vary widely
