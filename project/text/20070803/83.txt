the daily fix teixeira gives braves a boost in battle with mets phillies online edition back in the atlanta braves added slugger fred mcgriff at the trade deadline that night the press box caught fire and mr mcgriff hit a home run as the braves overcame a deficit the team went on to a finish catching the san francisco giants at the wire in a thrilling pennant race except for that part about the press box fire atlanta hopes history repeats itself and so far so good mark teixeira hit a three run blast in his debut as the braves pummeled the houston astros a thrilling pennant chase certainly could be in the cards the win kept the braves games behind the powerful yet underwhelming new york mets who beat the milwaukee brewers but jumped them over the gritty but flawed philadelphia phillies who lost to the chicago cubs and are now back on si com john donovan writes about how braves general manager john schuerholz made his deadline day deals for mr teixeira and a bevy of relievers and how the gm remains a master trader despite shrinking payrolls "the braves do some things differently than other teams do but whats important is that what they dont do differently they seem always to do better " mr donovan writes "their team philosophy is not unique they scout and draft carefully they develop their players and then they use them if not as their own players then as bargaining chips to get players from other teams the braves dip into free agency only occasionally and then only on an as needed basis that blueprint seems simple enough but it doesnt work without players that other teams want and thats where the braves excel " the braves gave up a lot sending off five well regarded prospects but as mr donovan writes "schuerholz isnt denying that the braves gave up a ton but schuerholz has the perfect comeback too the braves traded those players because unlike so many other teams they could they had the players to trade and now theyre a better team because of it " espn coms jayson stark echoes that praise saying that mr schuerholz "might be the greatest general manager who ever lived watching schuerholz work this week was like watching einstein scrawl e mc &lt sup&gt all over again " the braves rivals have certainly noticed his work "there are two months to go in the regular season and the national league east is still hanging out there waiting for someone to grab it by the throat and say mine " writes jim salisbury in the philadelphia inquirer "the atlanta braves might have done that " the teixeira deal clearly helped the braves the mets acquired second baseman luis castillo and the phils picked up second baseman tadahito iguchi and pitcher kyle lohse deals that might or might not prove wise so it goes in the trade deadline world but no one in baseball can figure out why the pittsburgh pirates acquired matt morris from the san francisco giants the veteran starter has a era since mid june and will cost the pirates nearly &# million through next year the giants were trying desperately to dump his contract but the decidedly small market pirates assumed all of it mr morris amazingly is now the highest paid player in franchise history what the heck in the pittsburgh post gazette dejan kovacevic tries to think along with the bucs front office but theres as much talk about gm dave littlefields job security and previous disastrous deals the pirates spent &# million last year on jeromy burnitz and joe randa as there is about payroll and the market for starting pitching yesterday the post gazettes bob smizik was harsher "dont call the pirates cheap dont you dare you can however continue to call them clueless " mr smizik also ponders how much of this move has to do with mr littlefield not wanting to have to update his resume but he reminds readers that "in acquiring such a contract littlefield clearly had to get permission from owner bob nutting and that such permission was forthcoming it again brings into question as have so many other moves in the past whether anyone in the pirates organization knows what theyre doing " ladies and gentlemen your nl central leading chicago cubs yes after a horrid start left them nine games under after being ridiculed for getting nothing for an offseason spending spree after worries about lou piniellas sanity the cubs have passed the brewers for the top spot in their division ok its just a percentage point but still so cub fans pop quiz kerry wood is returning friday against the mets good omen or bad omen in the chicago sun times greg couch predicts a standing ovation for mr wood "when he takes the mound its going to be a special moment his persistence through all the pain has been amazing " but he then strikes a foreboding note "deep in cub fans hearts though there is doubt its not just that hes always hurt but also its about what he stands for he represents an era that never made it its an era the cubs have moved on from " all this talk of mr wood reminds the fix of one of its favorite dugouts one written by brandon stroud after mr wood somehow injured himself getting out of a hot tub in february stick with it for the fate of poor mark prior buddy bell announced yesterday that he will step down as skipper of the kansas city royals at the end of the season mr bell said his september surgery to remove a cancerous growth from his throat began months of reflection about his priorities mr bell is part of a three generation baseball family his father gus played for four teams over a year big league career and his sons david and mike followed him to the majors baseball fans generally celebrate such continuity but as mr bell made clear it takes a toll "when i grew up my dad wasnt there when my kids grew up i wasnt there now my grandkids are growing up and i havent seen them " in the kansas city star joe posnanski writes that "buddy bell is above all else a good guy they dont incorporate that into a managers won loss record which is too bad because everybody knows that bells won loss record isnt much to look at he could use a few character witnesses " if that sounds like damning with faint praise hang on "when buddy bell took the job the royals were a national joke now as he steps down the royals are playing their best baseball in years they have been playing better than break even baseball for almost three months they have an impressive young bullpen the makings of a fearsome middle of the lineup a few promising starting pitchers they are viewed by many as up and coming the next big thing buddy bell had an awful lot to do with that "
