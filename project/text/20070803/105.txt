weekend journal sports by the numbers the best at keeping batters off base as top flight pitching in major league baseball becomes an increasingly valuable commodity the question of which hurlers are the games best really does become a multimillion dollar proposition so what is the best way to find out who the best pitchers are some standard measuring sticks can come up a little short in this regard take win loss records over a season they can be deceiving dependent on run support and just plain luck while earned run average is more reliable it can be a bit like judging a batter only by his rbis and runs scored whip or walks plus hits divided by innings pitched has a fatal flaw under this method a single counts the same as a home run our favorite metric is simplicity itself babe or bases per batter babe begins with a pitchers total bases allowed the sum of his hits allowed plus one extra point for each double two extra for each triple and three extra for each homer when you add in walks issued and batters hit by a pitch the sum is grand total bases divide gtb by the number of batters a pitcher has faced and the result is babe the lower that number the better a pitcher has been at minimizing the number of bases issued to opposing batters how a pitcher gives up bases singles walks or extra base hits isnt the point what matters is his overall ability to limit batters productivity babe uses the same kind of logic that our overall batting statistic bop bases over plate appearances uses to pick the most productive players at the plate so who leads the babe list this year tops overall is chris young of the san diego padres the foot righty currently on the disabled list with a strained oblique muscle leads the majors with a babe meaning that he yields a base on average to every third batter right behind is his teammate jake peavy at so perhaps some credit should go to petco park one of the more pitcher friendly parks in the majors as well as to padres manager bud black who was the pitching coach for the los angeles angels during their world series run but dont be too quick to dismiss the accomplishments of these two young pitchers as products of their environment their teammate david wells has a babe th among the pitchers who had pitched or more innings as of games of july in the american league the babe list also is topped by two young pitchers each of whom were crucial pieces in big trades dan haren of the oakland as acquired from the st louis cardinals for mark mulder has posted a babe underscoring billy beanes acumen in identifying promising young pitchers is the fact that as draft pick joe blanton is third in the al with a babe behind mr haren is josh beckett of the boston red sox whos rewarding the faith that general manager theo epstein displayed when he traded two prized prospects to the florida marlins for the hard throwing righty one thing that the babe list shows us is how volatile the pitching side of the game is the bop list of top hitters tends to be quite consistent from season to season with such players as barry bonds albert pujols and alex rodriguez keeping their places at the top alongside sleepers such as carlos guillen of the detroit tigers but many of the leagues top pitchers are pretty far down on the babe list this season last years national league babe champ brandon webb of the arizona diamonsbacks is th on this seasons list with a mark two slots behind john maine of the new york mets roy halladay of the toronto blue jays the al cy young winner and last years al runner up in babe is th on this years list behind journeyman ted lilly of the chicago cubs and oliver perez of the mets rd who a year ago was demoted to the minors by the pitching starved pittsburgh pirates ranks ahead of two time cy young winner and defending al babe leader johan santana th babe also can show general managers and for that matter fantasy players that a players real value may not be in sync with first impressions for example with a record matt cain of the san francisco giants would seem to be having a disastrous year but his babe is nearly identical to that of teammate noah lowry whos gone giants general manager brian sabean shouldnt fret about his young pitchers but should be very worried about his high priced free agent barry zito st on the list another high profile young pitcher who should have his team and fans fretting is felix hernandez the seattle mariners super prospect looked like an early cy young contender after yielding no runs and four hits in his first two starts despite coming back from a mid april injury hes hardly been untouchable since then as his babe st suggests among those pitchers who were on the trading block earlier this week and could still be dealt in waiver deals babe suggests their current teams may know something that potential suitors dont after making last years all star team jose contreras of the chicago white sox dwells near the babe basement with a mark rd in the majors then there is mr becketts former florida teammate dontrelle willis who once scared batters with his baroque motion and knee buckling curve his babe th in baseball should only frighten floridas few fans and the chicago cubs front office which reportedly still covets him having once traded him away as a minor league throw in caveat emptor
