the daily fix barry bonds traveling circus heads for maddux san diego online edition the traveling circus that is the barry bonds show left los angeles without home run no let alone as the dodgers did just about everything in their power to keep the san francisco giants slugger stuck on the circus is now headed for san diego where greg maddux and the padres will try to keep bonds at bay tonight in the san diego union tribune tim sullivan praises bondss superhuman ability to concentrate bonds he writes "can hardly move without a flurry of flashbulbs or on the road a chorus of catcalls but he remains remarkably unruffled within the small sanctuary of the batters box there he is as deaf as beethoven and comparably brilliant " mr sullivan writes that "basketball players grow accustomed to shooting free throws while facing spectators devoted to distracting them football players strive to move as one when the snap count is drowned out by the din of the crowd yet the ability to hit a moving twisting target and with authority while thousands scream and lights flash requires more than sharp reflexes and photographic muscle memory to do it at bonds level and under bonds specific and trying circumstances requires a talent that has left other big league ballplayers in awe " writing last month in slate tommy craggs decried the medias use of home run king hank aaron for their own purposes charging that hammerin hank "has been reduced to a sportswriters cheap trope the great sluggers dignity is of interest only insofar as it can be picked up by the likes of george will and swung in the general direction of barry bonds this is baseball telling fairy tales to itself pretending the bad things away using a hall of famer as a rhetorical bludgeon and in doing so diminishing the very man it pretends to exalt " instead of fuming and fussing over bonds and his possible chemical enhancements maybe we all need to take a step back way back "whats the job of an athlete really " asks sally jenkins in the washington post as part of an uneasy examination of the long long history of cheating in sports and what if anything we ought to do about it "it is to seek the limits of the human body for our viewing pleasure athletes are astronauts of the physique explorers some of them choose to explore by making human guinea pigs out of themselves so maybe we should quit assigning any ethical value to what they do and simply enjoy their feats as performance artists " ms jenkins reviews ancient greek efforts to cheat asks if theres a difference between laser surgery sleeping in an altitude tent and getting epo from a needle and warns that the coming age of gene therapy will make steroids seem "as crude as sugar cubes soaked in ether " and she reminds us that athletes are not just freaks of nature but "quite often profoundly cold elitists whose moral code is different from ours too to many of them the performance is all and what they find unnatural is to leave some physical possibility untapped " "in an odd way legalizing performance enhancers might restore some candor to what were watching " she writes "it would end a charade and help us sort out truly criminal behavior from that which merely offends our idealism but personally every time i come to that conclusion i find myself backing away from it reluctant to say its the definitive answer the price of legalization is that we give up our ideals about athletes once and for all and thats a painful prospect " with their hosting duties for the bonds circus over the dodgers will begin a key series with the diamondbacks who lead l a by a game in the nl west for the new york suns tim marchman the series will be a baseball morality play the diamondbacks are a young team six regulars are or younger and no reliever older than has recorded an out for them this season and theyre getting younger phenom justin upton made his big league debut last night mr marchman writes that the diamondbacks are "a team built to win now and dominate in the future los angeles by contrast is largely a team of bland veterans which makes no sense the teams farm system is rated right alongside arizonas as one of the best in the game and yet the dodgers lard the lineup with the likes of juan pierre luis gonzalez and nomar garciaparra even when better younger players are often available " given that contrast mr marchman knows whose side hes on and he won the fix over by launching a pre emptive strike on the new york mets and their stubborn attachment to the profoundly useless shawn green "the world is not just and rewards do not always descend on those who deserve them audacity is often thwarted by cautious time serving and we can often do nothing about it " he writes "in baseball though we can at least cheer on the deserving and so if you have the time try to catch this weekends arizona los angeles series and throw out a cheer or three for the snakes " depressed by a summer of scandal espn coms bill simmons has retreated to his time honored way of escaping sporting disasters videogames "just know that three summers have been ruined by sports in my lifetime and " he writes "each one lingers the same way youd remember a motorcycle accident or a tragic family event " after remembering the baseball strike he played intellivision mr simmons writes that "of course wasnt worse than which kicked off with o j s being accused of double murder the threat of a baseball strike the knicks and rockets butchering the finals and our greatest living athlete mj playing the wrong sport in august baseball went on permanent hiatus and o j s trial took center stage never did i think that the sports summer of could be bottomed but it could happen in " having played nhl during the last scandal mr simmons tries to find silver linings in the five scandal stories he finds most depressing that quest yields mixed results but brings us a hilarious take on why children playing soccer means nothing for the sports future popularity and his madden anecdote winds up being sneakily charming when ichiro suzuki signed a five year &# million contract extension with the seattle mariners last month he said one of his key advisors had been his dog ikky "he said woof woof woof which meant stay stay stay of course i listened " on slate com sasha issenberg examines that and other recent ichiroisms ichiro on daisuke matsuzaka "i hope he arouses the fire thats dormant in the innermost recesses of my soul " on cleveland "if i ever saw myself saying im excited going to cleveland id punch myself in the face because im lying " what swimmer dara torres is doing is so extraordinary that "comeback" seems hopelessly inadequate as a description ms torres won her first national title more than years ago she competed in the olympics retired after returned in to win five medals retired again and then gave birth to a daughter in april during and after her pregnancy she was swimming for fitness and the old itch came back a nice story but heres what makes it extraordinary at the usa swimming championships wednesday she won the meter freestyle winding up with a time just slower than her personal best recorded at sydney in in the washington post eli saslow looks at ms torres and her holistic training regimen he also gets this great quote from year old swimmer leila vaziri "shes like a different species if i come back from a two week break i feel awful and unmotivated six years thats crazy dara could probably make another four olympics if she wanted to she just doesnt get old " tip of the fix
