weekend journal review theater the bard takes a break and stoppard steps in shakespeare &amp company  kemble st lenox mass &# &# rough crossing closes sept blue orange closes sept lenox mass not all summer shakespeare festivals stick loyally to the collected works of the bard some of the best ones present wide ranging seasons that cover several centuries of theatrical ground though shakespeares plays are rarely very far from the stage shakespeare &amp company one of massachusetts finest summer troupes is currently performing four mainstage productions in repertory two by shakespeare and two not having seen both of last summers shakespeare offerings i opted to skip the swan of avon this time around and see how the company handled contemporary fare once again i was much impressed in recent weeks ive been checking out regional productions of the plays of tom stoppard whose "coast of utopia" trilogy dominated the new york theater scene this past season perhaps not coincidentally shakespeare &amp company decided to have its first go at a stoppard play this summer and shrewdly picked one of his lesser known works "rough crossing" is mr stoppards english language performing version of "play at the castle " a ferenc molnar comedy best known outside the authors native hungary in a adaptation called "the plays the thing" that was written by none other than p g wodehouse in all its varied manifestations its a backstage comedy about a pompous playwright whose new show a musical gets into trouble when the young composer draws the mistaken conclusion that the leading lady whom he loves is having a fling with the leading man whom she used to love hijinks ensue fur flies prats fall you get the idea just as "the plays the thing" sounds more than a little bit woosterish so is "rough crossing" jam packed with the dizzy wordplay to which mr stoppard long ago accustomed us "how ironical that tongue trippery should come in my shape and tripped uppery in yours" parts of it sound like abbott and costello rewritten by bertrand russell but for all its verbal virtuosity "rough crossing" is first and foremost a farce meaning that it requires a combination of flawless timing and flamboyant physicality accordingly kevin g coleman the director has whipped his six person cast into a veritable frenzy of laugh getting not since the peccadillo theater companys off broadway revival of "room service" have i seen such manic energy expended to such potent effect all six actors are outstanding but the clown in chief is undoubtedly elizabeth aspenlieder who plays natasha navratilova the actress whose long concluded affair with ivor fish malcolm ingram now threatens to scuttle the premiere of "the cruise of the dodo " ms aspenlieder who was the sparkling mistress ford of last years "merry wives of windsor " turns out to be a born comedienne not only does she pull faces worthy of lucille ball in her prime but she delivers her lines in a richly goofy pseudo slavic accent and a half in which "afternoon" comes out sounding something like "if tair nuhn " i would gladly have paid at least bucks just to hear her garble the line "i worship you as the moth worships the candle flame " the fun thing about repertory theater is that it allows you to see a troupe of gifted actors in more than one play sometimes in a single day mr ingram jason asprey and leroy mcclain all of whom made me laugh myself silly in "rough crossing " changed costumes and left me spellbound a few hours later in joe penhalls "blue orange " a three hander that is as different from "rough crossing" as well as blue is from orange mr penhalls play which was first seen in london in and has since been making the rounds of american regional theaters is that rarest of rarities a nominally political play that steers scrupulously clear of crude propagandizing mr mcclain plays christopher a young black man who has been packed off to a mental hospital by the police apparently for good reason bruce mr asprey his doctor in training thinks hes schizophrenic but robert mr ingram bruces arrogant supervisor wants to release him at once arguing that bruces diagnosis is brace yourself ethnocentric sounds suspicious huh thats what i thought especially when robert started spouting the gospel according to r d laing the renegade psychiatrist who argued that mental illness is not a disease but a social construct only instead of doling out the usual politically correct cliches mr penhall starts pitching curve balls and by plays end you find yourself tangled up in knots of real uncertainty is christopher crazy or a victim of racism or just maybe both that you go away from "blue orange" not knowing for sure is a tribute to the complexity of mr penhalls vision of race relations in england at the turn of the st century i missed the american premiere of "blue orange" at new yorks atlantic theater but i dont see how it could have been much better than this production which was directed by timothy douglas whose credits include the yale repertory theatres world premiere of august wilsons "radio golf " mr douglas and his players keep the tension high and the laughter nervous from start to finish even if i hadnt seen all three actors in "rough crossing" earlier in the day i would have found their performances formidably assured given the fact that theyd spent the afternoon flinging themselves around the same stage like handballs i can only write of their work in "blue orange" with something like awe in addition to "blue orange" and "rough crossing " shakespeare &amp company is also performing "antony and cleopatra" and "a midsummer nights dream" through sept and you can see all four shows each weekend yes thats a lot of theater to consume in a hour span but i wouldve if i couldve mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com
