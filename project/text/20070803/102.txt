weekend journal review film an indie festival that loves film more than hype new zealand provides a welcoming arena for challenging movies auckland new zealand when the new zealand international film festival was playing here to large and enthusiastic audiences in recent weeks it has since decamped to wellington the nations capital for a run that ends this weekend the social columnist for the new zealand herald filed a minority report shed been assigned to spend five days at as many festival screenings as she could squeeze in and found the experience "psychologically draining " many of the films were provocative she conceded "but the filmmakers have set the agenda of what i think about as a result i have become virtually incapable of personal thought " maybe movie overload has left me cognitively impaired without knowing it but i like the idea of filmmakers setting agendas if they dont who will and far from feeling drained ive taken particular pleasure in this event which lacks most of the trappings that have come to make better known festivals a trial instead of a treat no agents trolling for talent no studios or distributors dealing outlandish deals no frenzied schedules no juries bestowing awards no municipalities clamoring for attention no publicists pushing clients at thunderous parties and no red carpets or itinerant stars the festivals organizing idea almost revolutionary in its simplicity is to give movie lovers throughout this island nation a chance to see some features and shorts including some american classics of the s a program of films that for the most part would never get commercial distribution the most spectacular festival venue aucklands civic theatre opened in was refurbished in and stands as one of the worlds great movie palaces a rapturous dream of moorish gardens minarets indian buddhas and art deco flamingos the civic is crowned with a starry sky complete with drifting clouds and shooting stars that represents the constellations of the southern hemisphere as they were in june of the theaters first year soon after of course the sky fell on wall street and starting as it does in the middle of winter more than the constellations are upside down here new zealands annual cinema feast is moveable in the extreme traveling not only to wellington but in scaled down form over the next four months to other cities and towns around the country as for agendas some films had them and some didnt drama doesnt always need explicit subjects while others made much of delicate but evocative pretexts of the agenda free features my favorite by far was "private property " an ambiguous but sexually charged belgian drama directed and co written by joachim lafosse starring isabelle huppert as the permissive eerily passive mother of twin sons with twin gifts for sloth and decadence theyre played by yannick renier and his real life brother jeremie renier whose performance is at least as powerful as those he gave in "the promise" and "the child " in one of the most enthralling single shots in memory the latters character hides behind a tree in the foreground facing the camera while a life or death drama plays out behind him in the upper right hand corner of the screen the pretext for "forever " a stunning documentary by the dutch filmmaker hedy honigmann is a ramble through pere lachaise thats the cemetery in paris where such diverse artists as chopin proust oscar wilde apollinaire and jim morrison are buried as well as the final resting place of ordinary people who lived unsung lives the film makes no distinction between humble and great as visitors to the tombs and graves tell their stories to the camera an elderly spanish widow recalls what franco did to her country a parisian cleaning lady leaves a ball point pen for proust an iranian taxi driver pays homage to his late countryman the writer sadegh hedayat a young japanese pianist recounts how her love of chopins music sustains her loving memory of her father a businessman who she says died of overwork little by little the movie reveals its real subject the enduring nature of art and lest that sound banal the power of art to reach beyond the grave by connecting people inspiring them and giving their own lives meaning the film festival had its disappointments mainly a paucity of features made by new zealanders as opposed to those made here by others to take advantage of new zealands spectacular scenery the main problem is the countrys sparse population four million people arent enough to foster and sustain a domestic film industry according to an interesting kiwi documentary called "the comics show " the country still lacks a distribution system for comic books yet the festival allowed me to catch up with "manufactured landscapes " which had just opened in a few u s theaters when i went off to new zealand for a working vacation the agenda of jennifer baichwals landmark documentary is straightforward and dictated by the work of the canadian photographer edward burtynsky whom she follows on a tour of industrial asia "manufactured landscapes" strives to show without engaging in polemics the scale of mans activities and their impact on the planet not just strives but succeeds as only big screen film can i never understood the meaning of mass production in the st century until i saw peter mettlers paradigm shattering images the cinematography is equal to the subject of factory interiors the size of towns industrial dumps that could fill asteroids and chinas three gorges dam a project of literally earth shaking scale a shudder was detected in the rotation of our planet when the backed up waters of the yangtze river were finally released into the depopulated canyon the perfect companion piece to ms baichwals film is zhang ke jias "still life " a beautifully slow yet vividly modern chinese drama i was tempted to say postmodern but its much more human than that with a lyrical soul and a documentary sweep that only seems to be constrained by literal reality the setting is once again the three gorges at the feverish moment when the cities on the rivers banks are being demolished by the people who lived in them so the mighty waters can flow and once again scenes of titanic construction play against those of comparable destruction and epic displacement theyre the birth and death rhythms of a momentous new age "manufactured landscapes" shows us what this new age looks like while "still life" helps us fathom how it feels the film does this through the simple but effective device of telling its story through two people from shanxi province a work worn miner played by tao zhao and a pretty young woman played by sanming han who come to the three gorges in search of loved ones theyve lost the result is deep unforgettable resonance zhang ke jia is a long shot in every way for ultimate residence in pere lachaise but art like his is what "forever" celebrates like the festival itself its all about connection
