weekend journal taste de gustibus on his armor its not every day that you get to take a heavy armor panel into the family backyard and blast away at it with a shotgun but on this occasion i was doing my brother in law david warren a favor we were testing a new kind of armor he developed that he hoped would protect american soldiers that day three years ago was among the first of many tests bringing him from a workshop in his garage to the pentagon and eventually to the front lines in iraq something of an american success story david arrived in this country in an year old refugee from vietnam his father a u s soldier disappeared and was likely killed in action during the war his mother couldnt manage to fend for her family when the communists took control of the country so david lived on the streets in saigon for a while before thanks to a little divine intervention he ended up on a flight that eventually took him to new york he was adopted by an american family and grew up on a farm in the hudson valley when he graduated from high school he joined the marines and during his four year stint he served very briefly in the persian gulf just before the liberation of kuwait david always liked to tinker he used to make a good living at a security company that designed surveillance systems and he held nearly a half dozen patents but none for armor after reading a story i had published on opinionjournal com and a later one in this paper about u s soldiers in iraq not receiving all the armor they needed to shield themselves from insurgent attacks he changed course why he asked me was the u s military unable to move armor to the front lines fast enough i explained that it wasnt just the bureaucratic snafus in washington that held up the armor plating it was also the manufacturing bottlenecks that made it difficult to quickly fabricate and ship hardened steel and other materials used for armor and so david decided to design a new kind of armor that would be lighter than steel and easier to produce part of him he tells me was drawn to the difficulty of it "you challenged me to stop a bullet " hed say on several occasions over the next few years but there was another reason as well as a refugee and a former marine he empathized with both the american soldiers and the iraqi civilians caught in the crossfire he saw the fight in iraq as more than toppling a dictator he saw it as a return of the u s to the kind of war that it had abandoned in southeast asia and this was his opportunity to turn his talents to the aid of a country that had taken him in "it all really leads up to this " he told me so david took a steep cut in pay and pulled away from his security business though the company kept him on the payroll to support his venture he played around with several different types of metals and other substances he found a financial backer and a plastics manufacturer wayne schaeffer who helped him work on the armor designs and within a few months i found myself in davids backyard about to test his home made product to my amazement and maybe davids too the panel withstood the shotgun blast it also withstood a shot from a high powered rifle seeing his armors success david sold the rights to one of his patents to raise more funds eventually he got to show his armor to the folks at the defense advanced research projects agency darpa who put it through several rounds of tests including a few bomb explosions after david made more improvements he was contacted by some soldiers in iraq who had heard about his armor and wanted to put it on their vehicles late last year david went to baghdad he spent several days with soldiers to see first hand what they needed in the coming months he expects to send large panels of his armor to iraq where they will be bolted onto military vehicles if all goes according to plan hell get orders for more panels which he and his partners will build in a factory theyre setting up in kingston n y during the course of the past three years as david worked his way through several prototypes he received plenty of help nearly every manufacturer he approached about a dozen has donated time or materials sometimes they moved him to the top of their order lists each it seems feels he owes it to the men and women fighting to protect our way of life but maybe david feels it a little more mr miniter is assistant editor of opinionjournal com see related letter "letters to the editor moon and back but not iraq" wsj aug
