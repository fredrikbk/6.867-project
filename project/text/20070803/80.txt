the afternoon report hiring labors online edition the latest monthly u s jobs report shows a less active hiring market consistent with a more sluggish economy but the slowdown most likely isnt sharp enough to draw ben bernankes attention away from inflation fighting friday mornings payrolls report showed that manufacturing construction and government job losses in july counteracted relatively healthy numbers from service industries as job growth slowed and the unemployment rate rose slightly nonfarm payrolls rose in july below junes and mays so far this year monthly job growth has averaged the job gain fell short of the new jobs wall streets oracles had predicted unemployment edged up percentage point to in light of the housing slowdown some construction jobs were expected to evaporate and of them did though morgan stanley economists in written commentary expressed surprise that the bulk of the drop was attributable to nonresidential building commercial construction has been a bright spot of late in the industry mission residential economist richard moody wrote that construction payroll numbers are still "very much out of alignment" with data from the housing industry and he expects that revisions to the payroll data in january will hammer residential construction job counts back into alignment in their written comments some economists also tried to pick apart a drop

adjustments for normal seasonal variation when the school year calendar is less uniform and is changing " he wrote as far as job creators were concerned a relatively robust private sector added jobs in july in line with its average the health care sector was the hero adding jobs in july morgan stanley economists noted that health care jobs have represented a quarter of the overall payroll gains over the last year morgan stanley economists also said the addition of financial service jobs was "a notable upside surprise " leisure and hospitality largely restaurant jobs also tossed another jobs

certain fed chairman with an alliterative name might be heartened by the report but the consensus seems to be that theres nothing in this report that would make him quickly shift his focus from
