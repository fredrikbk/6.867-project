readers hopes and fears for journal after purchase i have read your paper for over years and am a print and online subscriber over the years i have convinced more than two dozen of my friends and colleagues to become subscribers as well i have read with interest the aug editorial "a new owner" and gordon crovitzs publishers letter i have not followed the new york times or financial times coverage of the news corp deal with the bancroft family and what the editors of these papers have to say holds little credence for me in any case i recognize and appreciate your leadership and your staffs integrity and look forward to many years of "free people and free markets " larson voss new york the journal has given me an incredible edge in business with clients colleagues and now in running my own agency not a day goes by that i cant refer to something in the journal that impacts my business or that of my clients i have had the pleasure of meeting or speaking with many journal reporters over the years and i have total trust in their objectivity to news and news value i will continue to have that same faith in the journal based on the people i know and their own integrity to the business and commitment to the journal ones commitment to a craft doesnt change because the boss does alec j rosen miami that rumble you hear is the sound of slump shouldered dejected readers walking away from their paid subscriptions of many years out here the scene is a mass of formerly loyal subjects in rumpled clothes having waited out the bancroft saga with collective breath held perhaps however there is a silver lining even in this most unthinkable cloud all the time we will save now by being able to simply tune into fox news for a few minutes instead of spending three quarters of an hour with the journal every morning marc cristol san francisco the journal is now in a position to become even more powerful as a reader and subscriber for the last years i can tell you im delighted bill bruce houston as an unabashed liberal and a long time dedicated reader of your newspaper i am writing to plead with you to maintain your independence in editorial writing and in the news sections even though i disagree with many of your editorials but dont tell my liberal friends i agree with some your independent and "sharp" voice is something i look forward to reading each and every day when paul gigot took over the editorial page he stated that he wanted the editorials to be pointed and sharp you certainly have lived up to that standard and i hope that continues to be the case as to news coverage i have truly enjoyed the changes especially the saturday paper one note of trepidation i read that rupert murdoch may want to shorten some news articles this would be a large mistake we the readers appreciate the in depth coverage that long pieces entail some days we are too busy to read them however many of us read the journal online a few days later and these longer stories are often the most incisive howard bunsis ann arbor mich i for one am not ready to mourn the death of the journal i dont have &# billion but the renewal check i sent a few days ago is my vote of confidence i really appreciate the hard work of all your professionals and im proud to be a subscriber keep up the good work joe bobbey loveland ohio i have been setting aside the invitations to renew my subscription to the journal pending the outcome of news corp s bid to purchase dow jones in light of the news i regretfully am unwilling to renew my subscription given mr murdochs history i dont believe that the journals editors will be able to maintain journalistic independence i hope that i am proven wrong and that the journal will be able to continue its high standards but as a consumer in this society of "free people and free markets" i will voice my reservations by electing not to renew my subscription i wish the journalists and employees of the journal the best of luck john shin berkeley heights n j having been a subscriber to the wsj and a big fan of its editorials for nearly two decades i hope that you keep your promises of editorial integrity mentioned in your aug commentary we all realize that times change for i read this article at a m in the comfort of my home on a computer six hours before the paper will land on my front porch i finished typing this about minutes later we do live in a fascinating time where technological changes occur at lightning speeds i just hope the editorials of this paper do not change i will be watching closely and keeping my fingers crossed at the same time kenneth schnoll mahwah n j my congratulations on what we have found to be complete remarkably objective and factual coverage of mr murdochs bid for dow jones it has been remarkable not that it differs from the usual practice of the journal but by the fact that it does not it would have been closer to the "normal operating procedure" of much of the print media to choose to simply not publish with such transparency and thoroughness and thus avoid controversy at the expense of quality journalism as far as we can tell you successfully traversed the murky waters as the acquisition became more probable there must have been a temptation to ingratiate yourselves to the possible new mogul a tendency that you appear to have successfully avoided your coverage was as complete as most others if not more so it was more transparent than most others if not more so it was as objective as any other if not more so you had more on the line than anyone else could possibly have and still you produced the best coverage of the subject bar none including wednesdays astonishing edition a mark parker m d metairie la thank you for the past years or so god bless and please continue as promised jim currie erie pa your readers are counting on you to keep doing what you do so well let time deal with the issues of ownership transition many of us know that distracting forces and thoughts can consume in times of transition please resist the distractions we depend on you we need you harlan janes chocowinity n c today will be i suspect for many a sad day money clearly speaks on wall street and certainly the offer by news corp was generous however the independence that the journal has enjoyed to date has made it an icon of journalism as one who has read the publication for years it has offered a perspective that is trusted certainly i will continue to read the journal but now with suspicion my thanks to the bancroft family for its pristine care of the journal for the or so years that i have read the paper its been a good ride as an old friend of our family would say when he closed the evening news on the radio "good night and good luck " sort of rings true today jeff bowen denver i subscribe to the journal because its news articles are concise and free of political bias i am extremely skeptical that mr murdoch whose other news holdings are blatantly partisan will allow the journals news stories to retain their impartiality i and countless others who are nauseated by fox news and the new york post will be watching very closely chris visser falls church va ive been reading the journal since and think it is the finest newspaper in the world mr murdoch bought the journal because it is just that he paid a premium for something that doesnt need to be fixed and it is a great fit for his new financial channel kenneth r orzel pompano beach fla whatever the takeover means do not let it mean the death of the only newspaper in america worth quoting you alone have become a standard bearer for actual journalism the absence of which will leave intelligent readers bereft of the one mainstream bastion available anthony l laporte houston ive said many times that the journal is the best newspaper in the world youve had my respect and subscriptions for years i think the objective high quality reporting and strong editorial independence of the journal come from your core values these are what have given your newspaper its prominence i am somewhat concerned that rupert murdoch might compromise those values i will vote with my subscription if that happens however as a legitimate owner mr murdoch will be able to make those choices commensurate with his investment if he destroys the journal that would be a stupid business decision tom barnard atlanta goodbye my old and trusted friend i will miss you rob rishmawy kenmore wash as an ardent fan of the journal i am both distressed and encouraged by mr murdochs successful bid for dow jones like so many others i fear the possible degradation of the last great news organ in the u s it is my studied opinion that the reporting and writing in the journal far surpasses even that in the new york times friends family and clients receive articles from me on a regular basis even those who subscribe just in case i learn enough every day in the paper to be able to converse with just about anyone on nearly any topic and thus abhor even the suggestion that the journal might lose its thoroughness integrity and brilliance i subscribe to both the paper and online editions because i find the paper edition much easier to read but love being able to email articles hither and yon i worry that the online edition if turned into a free for all will no longer serve as this valuable resource on the other hand lots of cash may generate wonderful new things that will benefit subscribers we can only hope and in the meantime appreciate all of you who work so hard to make the journal second to none thank you alexandria hayes stratham n h
