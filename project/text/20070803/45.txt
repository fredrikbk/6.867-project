mexicos job creation problem why do so many mexicans leave their families friends and homes to make the arduous journey to the united states its a central question to the immigration debate and is essential for setting workable policies but its also a question that has rarely been asked after looking at the numbers what i discovered is that mexico has a job creation problem during president vicente foxs six years in office his goal was to create six million jobs across all sectors of the economy mr fox fell far short of that goal between and the period when he was in office mexico created only million jobs though accurate figures are difficult to arrive at the government accountability office estimates that during each year of mr foxs presidency between and illegal immigrants arrived in the u s from mexico the number of illegal immigrants from mexico was roughly equal to the number of jobs mr fox did not create if one were to do a cat scan of mexicos economy one would find a country with the potential to become a job creators paradise mexico has far more oil than fast growing dubai a net labor importer and almost as much as qatar another labor importer if mexicans working in the u s are any indication mexico has a work force that is trained and disciplined with thousands of miles of coastline mexico is a tourist haven it shares a border with its largest trading partner but even with these positive attributes mexicos job creation engine has stalled research shows that big companies especially big mexican companies do not create many jobs jobs are created by entrepreneurs who start companies from scratch to perform their job creating function entrepreneurs need access to capital which is where mexico falls short according to the milken institutes capital access index mexico ranks a dismal rd with regard to capital access out of countries studied to compare the u s the worlds top job creating developed country ranks no and hong kong asias most vibrant entrepreneurial hub ranks no mexicans with drive ambition and a willingness to take risks sneak across the border to the u s but they dont just come for jobs they also come for the capital when these immigrants arrive they dont just sell their labor many start small businesses in the food construction maintenance and landscaping trades when those businesses are launched illegal mexican immigrants hire other illegal mexican immigrants a great deal of mexicos job creation takes place inside the u s mexicos financial and economic structures fail at providing entrepreneurs with the capital they need to create jobs the economy is too concentrated with nearly half of it controlled by a single family that of the billionaire carlos slim a handful of other families own the bulk of mexicos remaining wealth mexicos legal and business structures effectively fence off from competition whole sectors of the economy in telecommunications petroleum and much of the real estate and tourism sectors real competition is restricted mexico could jumpstart its job creation engine by opening these sectors of its economy to real competition mexicos oil wealth is another job creators nightmare it is controlled by a single government owned company pemex even with todays high oil prices pemex is the worlds most heavily indebted oil company and one of the least efficient producers pemex whose monopoly status is protected by the mexican constitution is so bogged down by bureaucracy conflicting interests political meddling and sweetheart union deals that it has failed to find any new oil reserves in years it is not that new oil reserves dont exist last year chevron found huge deposits in the u s portion of the gulf of mexico the problem with pemex is that it isnt really looking for oil if mexicos oil industry were opened up to competition even within the confines of its constitution not only would more oil be found more jobs would be created mexicos financial system is to entrepreneurship what sharks are to a swimmers beach banking which is conservative and risk averse dominates mexicos financial system accounting for about of all financial assets compared with just of all financial assets in the u s in the u s the capital markets and a diverse array of funds provide most of the capital if that werent enough mexicos top three banks control of all banking assets if entrepreneurs are turned down by the first bank they really have only two more places to apply for a country its size mexicos stock and bond markets are hugely underdeveloped when measured as a percentage of gdp household credit is also scarce in mexico and amounts to only about of gdp versus in the u s without access to credit mexicos consumer and retail sectors have not grown sufficiently these sectors could be vibrant job creation engines if mexicans had wider access to credit but perhaps most strikingly mexico has not yet succeeded in building a robust residential mortgage market whereas the u s has &# trillion outstanding in residential mortgages mexico with a population a third the size of u s has just &# billion outstanding not only that more than half of mexicos homes are self built and substandard as a result the federal reserve bank of dallas estimates mexico has a housing deficit of five million units if mortgages were cheap and plentiful through the increased use of mortgage securitization tools for example the epicenter of demand for mexicos trade and craftsmen would not be california arizona texas and florida it would be in mexico solving the immigration problem will not happen unless mexico solves its job creation problem to do that mexico needs to modernize and open up to competition its antiquated and concentrated economic and financial systems for decades mexico has argued that if it were to do so america would take over its time to dispel that urban myth with a little reality if mexico can succeed in providing capital to risk taking mexicans they will create jobs in mexico not just in the u s mr kurtzman a senior fellow at the milken institute is co author of the forthcoming book "global edge using the opacity index to manage the risk of
