in addition jeremy philips a news corp executive vice president is a board member of one laptop per child news of mr negropontes ties to news corp was reported by reuters yesterday a dow jones spokesman referred to language in the merger document that defined independent people as those "who in the sole judgment of the special committee are able to consider and evaluate objectively any issue that comes before the special committee and whose judgment is not impaired by any interest in or relationship with the company news corp dow jones the murdoch family the bancroft family or their respective affiliates employees directors and consultants of the company dow jones or their respective affiliates shall be deemed not to be independent " a news corp spokesman said "dow jones thinks mr negroponte is independent we think he is independent " the spokesman added that "there is no objective standard of independence " the spokesman also noted that another of the committee members thomas bray once worked for the journal "we didnt care " the spokesman said the spokesman said he didnt know whether news corp advised dow jones of mr negropontes ties to mr murdoch it isnt clear whether dow jones was aware of news corp s ties to mr negropontes group although it hasnt been a secret and was reported by the journal in november "we have confidence that nicholas negroponte can be an effective and valuable member of the special committee on editorial independence " said wall street journal managing editor marcus brauchli and editor of the editorial page paul gigot in a statement "we did not envision that members of the committee news corp and dow jones would have no associations among or with each other only that they would be people of integrity who are committed to ensuring our editorial independence " and dow jones spokeswoman linda dunbar said "we are confident of the capability of the individuals to make independent decisions " bob steele an ethics scholar at the poynter institute said "it is certainly an issue that could create competing loyalties if mr negropontes foundation is significantly dependent on financial wherewithal from mr murdoch then there is an interlocking relationship that could create competing loyalties " mr negroponte didnt respond to emails seeking comment mr bray who wrote a column for opinion journal said "ive really been gone from the wall street journal in any real capacity since " mr bray is the former editorial page editor of the detroit news and also worked for the journal from to he says he wrote his last regular column for opinion journal toward the end of mr bray says he has no financial relationship with dow jones "obviously i value the journal and my years at the journal i dont pretend to be neutral about the wall street journal or my regard for what it provides " the other committee members are louis d boccardi retired chief executive of the associated press jack fuller former president of tribune publishing and jennifer blackburn dunn a former congresswoman from washington state theodore b olson the former solicitor general of the u s had been considered for the committee but wasnt named because his current employer law firm gibson dunn &amp crutcher has worked for both news corp and dow jones mr olson couldnt be reached for comment each member will be paid &# per year plus expenses meanwhile democratic presidential candidates christopher dodd a senator from connecticut and former north carolina sen john edwards yesterday both called on democrats to fight the dow jones purchase mr dodd said he worried it would be "very difficult for the journal to offer fair and balanced reporting" while mr edwards also called on his opponents to return any political contributions from news corp executives a dig at front runner sen hillary rodham clinton who has received donations from mr murdoch and other company executives meanwhile federal communications commission member michael copps a democrat repeated comments yesterday at a blogger convention in chicago that the agency should carefully review the deal "our responsibility is to protect the public interest when it comes to media consolidation " mr copps said noting that news corp has several television station license renewals before the fcc which would provide an avenue for such a review news corp attorneys dont believe the dow jones deal has to be reviewed by the fcc since there are no broadcast licenses to be transferred in the past the wall street journal has been categorized by the fcc as a national newspaper which would exempt it from local cross ownership rules but mr copps suggested yesterday it might be considered a local paper since it competes with the new york times separately dow jones director christopher bancroft a member of the family that controls the company continued his effort yesterday to have the company pick up advisory fees he and other family members incurred during the bancrofts deliberations over the news corp offer according to people familiar with the matter dow joness board with news corp s acquiescence agreed to pay &# million to cover most of the familys costs in order to secure enough family support for the deal the familys fees will likely exceed this sum however once the fees for advisory bills incurred over the past three months by mr bancroft and other family members are included mr bancroft tried to find an alternative to the news corp deal he argues that if he and other family members are left paying for their own hefty expenses then they will realize less for their shares than the &# paid to others mr bancroft had offered in exchange for having his fees paid to abstain from a vote on the deal in his capacity as a trustee for the familys largest trust which has a voting stake in dow jones under trust rules the shares cant be cast in favor of the deal if he abstains according to people familiar with the situation it is unclear whether he would agree to vote yes on the deal in exchange for having his fees paid previously mr bancroft has insisted news corp pay &# a share &# more than it is offering to the family in order to win his support for the transaction hemenway &amp barnes partner michael b elefante a dow jones director and the bancroft familys lead trustee is in charge of distributing the funds including those that will be paid to his law firm mr bancroft has been pushing mr elefante to have all of the familys costs paid including his personal advisory fees according to the people familiar with the matter dow jones said yesterday it wasnt involved directly in the talks with mr bancroft even though mr elefante is a dow jones board member and will be distributing funds approved by the dow jones board "since the signing of the merger agreement with news corp on tuesday dow jones has not had any discussions with christopher bancroft about reimbursing his expenses or how he will vote on the proposed merger "
