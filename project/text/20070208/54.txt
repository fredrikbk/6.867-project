hillary on iraq one pleasant surprise of hillary rodham clintons tenure as new york senator has been her tough minded approach on national security she responded to by supporting president bushs strategy of taking on not just terrorists but the states that harbor them she also voted for the war in iraq and has refused to follow much of her party in alleging that mr bush "lied" about weapons of mass destruction but as mrs clinton bids to win the democratic presidential nomination she is taking a marked turn to the left pressured by other candidates and by her partys left wing she is walking back her hawkish statements and is now all but part of the antiwar camp the polls show her to be the favorite to be the next commander in chief so what she really believes and how firmly shell stick to it deserves to be debated heres a summary of the arc of mrs clintons public thinking on iraq october mrs clinton addresses the senate on the use of force resolution "the facts that have brought us to this fateful vote are not in doubt " she declares citing saddams record of using chemical weapons the invasion of kuwait and his history of deceiving u n weapons inspectors "as a result president clinton with the british and others ordered an intensive four day air assault operation desert fox on known and suspected weapons of mass destruction sites and other military targets " she continues adding that saddam "has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including al qaeda members " while she expresses her preference for working through the u n if possible she adds "i believe the authority to use force to enforce that mandate is inherent in the original u n resolution as president clinton recognized when he launched operation desert fox in " december it is clear by now that no large stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction will be found in iraq but mrs clinton tells the council on foreign relations that "yesterday was a good day i was thrilled that saddam hussein had finally been captured we owe a great debt of gratitude to our troops to the president to our intelligence services to all who had a hand in apprehending saddam now he will be brought to justice " she adds "i was one who supported giving president bush the authority if necessary to use force against saddam hussein i believe that that was the right vote " as for iraqs prospects she declares herself "a little optimistic and a little pessimistic we have no option but to stay involved and committed " april mrs clinton tells larry king "i dont regret giving the president the authority because at the time it was in the context of weapons of mass destruction grave threats to the united states and clearly saddam hussein had been a real problem for the international community for more than a decade " asked whether she thinks she was "fooled " she replies "the consensus was the same from the clinton administration to the bush administration it was the same intelligence belief that our allies and friends around the world shared about the weapons of mass destruction " october antiwar fervor on the left is picking up and activist cindy sheehan compares her to rush limbaugh after mrs clinton tells the village voice "my bottom line is that i dont want their sons to die in vain i dont believe its smart to set a date for withdrawal i dont think its the right time to withdraw " november mrs clinton posts a letter to constituents that marks her first dovish turn "if congress had been asked to authorize the war based on what we know now we never would have agreed " she writes but invoking retired general eric shinsekis estimate of more american troops necessary to pacify iraq she demands not withdrawal but a new plan "it is time for the president to stop serving up platitudes and present us with a plan for finishing this war with success and honor not a rigid timetable that terrorists can exploit but a public plan for winning and concluding the war " august mrs clinton calls for donald rumsfeld to resign as defense secretary asking for "new leadership that would give us a fighting chance to turn the situation around before its too late " december her march left gains speed on nbcs "today" show mrs clinton renounces her war vote unequivocally for the first time "i certainly wouldnt have voted that way " january from baghdad mrs clinton responds to mr bushs plan to send more troops to iraq to secure baghdad "i dont know that the american people or the congress at this point believe this mission can work and in the absence of a commitment that is backed up by actions from the iraqi government why should we believe it " january mrs clinton calls for capping the number of u s troops in iraq saying she will introduce legislation to do so and while she says she wont block money for the troops she suggests withholding funds for the iraqi government it is precisely such a funds cut off to the south vietnamese government in that led to the final u s flight from saigon january on the campaign trail in iowa mrs clinton demands that president bush "extricate our country from this before he leaves office " and she promises that if elected she will end the war quickly all politicians change their minds about something at some point but whats troubling about mrs clintons record on iraq is that it tends to follow rather than lead public opinion when the war was first debated and she couldnt easily walk away from her husbands record against saddam she was a solid even eloquent hawk then for a time she laid low and avoided the antiwar excesses of john kerry and others but now that the war has proven to be difficult and her fellow democrats are outflanking her on the antiwar left she is steadily even rapidly moving in their direction so in the space of merely months and as the presidential campaign begins in earnest mrs clinton has gone from advocating a new plan to "win" the iraq war with "honor " to vocally opposing president bushs new strategy to try to do precisely that and oh yes she now wants the "surge" to be in afghanistan instead of iraq the question wed ask is whether this is the kind of stalwart drift that mrs clinton would bring to the oval office
