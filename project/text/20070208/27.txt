dover meets darwin the battle for biology class monkey girl by edward humes ecco pages &# breathtaking inanity " thats how u s district court judge john e jones iii described the actions of the school board in dover a central pennsylvania town population when it required students in the local high school to be made aware "of gaps in darwins theory of evolution " the judges ruling handed down in december was the end point of a long ordeal for dover and its residents a year before several parents had sued the school board claiming that such a requirement breached the wall between church and state a long trial during the summer of brought a lot of attention to dover and more tellingly to the theorists who oppose darwinian teaching in "monkey girl " pulitzer prize winning journalist edward humes tells the story how did it all begin not with unanimity darwin supporters and evangelical christians wrangled over whether to revise the content of dover high schools ninth grade biology classes until then devoted to a classic darwinian approach eventually in october the school board ignored the advice of counsel and voted to require that a school official read out a statement to ninth grade biology students expressing skepticism toward darwins theory of evolution by natural selection "because darwins theory is a theory it continues to be tested as new evidence is discovered " the statement said "the theory is not a fact gaps in the theory exist for which there is no evidence students are encouraged to keep an open mind " the board also encouraged students to consult "of pandas and people " a textbook that promotes intelligent design part of what made the lawsuit so interesting was this intelligent design component according to id as it is nicknamed a "designer" is responsible for the life forms we see around us including our own species in the u s supreme court had held that "scientific" creationism cant be taught alongside evolution in public schools but no court had ever ruled on the permissibility of introducing id into biology classes the "designer" referred to by id theorists is theoretically non denominational although with some notable exceptions most proponents are evangelical christians and conservative catholics during the trial the plaintiffs lawyers supplied by a prestigious philadelphia law firm and the aclu made monkeys of the school boards witnesses even michael behe of lehigh university a professor of biochemistry and one of ids leading advocates came off badly he handled himself well enough on direct examination but crumbled on cross when he finally admitted that his book "darwins black box" in which he argued that cellular structures are irreducibly complex in ways that natural selection cannot explain did not undergo peer review other id luminaries like william dembski refused to testify feeling at odds with the school boards actions judge jones decided appropriately in light of the facts that the school boards statement about what should be taught in biology classes was motivated by religion and did not belong in the public schools by then the people of dover had tossed out the pro id members of the school board making a judicial decision unnecessary mr humess account is thorough but disappointingly self righteous "the evolution war " he writes "had become part of a larger political campaign the republican leaderships controversial culture of life in which religion politics and government at times seemed all but indistinguishable " there are certainly those who think so but mr humes might have been more persuasive had he shown some minimal respect for the religious side of this debate instead of treating all id proponents as benighted fanatics with a crude political agenda he even spends four pages bashing ann coulter as if she is an important thinker in need of refutation mr humess account also feels hastily put together all the ingredients for good narrative nonfiction are there courtroom drama legal quarrels and colorful characters including william buckingham the oxycontin addicted school board member who insists that "the united states is a christian nation " and tammy kitzmiller the timid single mom who became the named plaintiff in the lawsuit but "monkey girl" the title comes from a schoolyard taunt aimed at the daughter of another plaintiff often reads like a college term paper written the night before it was due mr humes quotes a lot of people at times he even tells us what they were thinking but these conversations and thoughts arent footnoted and there is no bibliography we dont know whether he talked to the people he quotes or to people who talked to them or drew from court records or newspaper accounts mr humes did score one big interview with judge jones himself the judge is thoughtful but the interview is inappropriate most judges feel ethically compelled to refrain from public comment on cases that have come before them mr humes claims that the vatican has unequivocally embraced darwin true in a address pope john paul ii did acknowledge the scientific proof for evolution but nowhere did he endorse the mechanism of evolution posited by darwin the godless and random forces of natural selection that render the human species a mere accident of nature mr humes omits entirely the statewide battle in over the teaching of evolution in pennsylvania the state department of education ended up passing a science curriculum requiring that evolution be taught without reference to id or "gaps" in darwins theory surely this state decision was worth mentioning mr humes dismisses as "baloney" criticism of the famous british experiment conducted in the s purporting to show that in response to industrial pollution peppered moths evolved from light to dark to camouflage themselves from predators but a article in the journal evolutionary biology and a book review in nature hardly venues for tendentious religious thinkers proved that the experiment was close to a hoax its "findings" without value and then there is the books view of the constitution mr humes says that the founding fathers "adamantly fashioned a nation in which government and religion were never to interfere with each other" in part because of "learned deists" like "jefferson and franklin and washington " as it happens none of these men had a hand in writing the first amendment but even granting mr humess point about deist skepticism the claim is overstated the history of the first amendments establishment clause along with its inconsistent interpretation by the supreme court shows it to be far more complex than mr humes allows indeed much of the material in "monkey girl" is more complex than the author allows ms winnick is an attorney and former reporter for the pittsburgh post gazette
