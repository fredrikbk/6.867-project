fiscally fit everybody loves a quitter terris husband stops smoking cold turkey but is that the best way to kick the habit late last year just after my husband gerry turned he promised me that at new years hed quit smoking for good so far im happy to say hes kept his promise stopping now may add years to gerrys life the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that adult male smokers lose an average of years of life and female smokers lose an average of years of life because of smoking while im thrilled gerrys trying to live a healthier lifestyle hes made it tougher on himself by quitting cold turkey gerry doesnt believe in medicating his way to quitting because he doesnt believe in medicating his way to anything seriously its easier to get our dog to swallow a pill he also balked at the cost of smoking cessation treatments nicotine replacement patches and gum costs &# to &# per kit which can cover up to weeks of treatment while pfizers antismoking drug chantix costs about &# a day quitting cold turkey has definitely saved us money but five weeks of a smoke free gerry has been hard on everybody hes been extremely irritable snapping at my family and his coworkers though apologies soon follow his hands are also shaky causing him more frustration because hes constantly dropping tools at work and hes gaining weight from eating everything in sight despite the drawbacks gerry says he can already feel the difference in his body after almost years of smoking hes breathing a bit easier and the rattling cough that greets me each morning is fading what delights gerry is how much better things smell and taste "i feel like im tasting pizza for the first time " he said one night while we were dining out this may be one of the reasons hes eating so much more hes also saving money gerry was a relatively light smoker going through a pack every three days at &# a pop hell still save &# a year by breaking the habit its impossible to put a price on the potential benefit to his health smoking is the most preventable cause of serious illness and premature death according to the u s centers for disease control and prevention roughly million americans smoke and one in five deaths each year are smoking related the cdc says in fact gerrys fathers brush with throat cancer last year strengthened my husbands resolve to quit like gerrys dad my parents smoked heavily in their younger years i remember vividly when i was a child helping my mom take down curtains for cleaning white curtains stained yellow from the smoke that permeated our apartment it turned me off smoking for life for her part my mom remembers all the times i urged her to quit and as the medications and doctors visits mount she now wishes shed stopped sooner when my mom finally decided to give up smoking at age she stopped cold turkey and she says it was one of the hardest things shes ever done how early in life you quit smoking has enormous consequences a june study of nearly male british doctors showed that the doctors who stopped smoking at age gained at least three years of life expectancy those who stopped at age gained six years and those who stopped around age gained nine years smokers who quit before age had nearly the same life expectancy as non smokers the study found i knew gerry was potentially shortening his life by smoking but i never urged him to stop i believed the only way hed successfully quit would be to resolve to do it on his own besides i begged my parents to quit for years to no avail so what good would nagging gerry do the fact is i didnt need to convince him for the last years gerrys been saying he knows he needs to stop each time hed say it id agree and point out that hes not getting any younger when he finally told me that turning and dealing with his fathers cancer had convinced him it was time to quit i was relieved feeling hed finally give it up for good still i urged him to consider medication to deal with withdrawal typical of gerry he was determined to tough it out but is that a good idea corinne husten epidemiology branch chief at the cdcs office on smoking and health says trying to quit on your own without the help of smoking cessation aids is the least effective way to quit just about any type of assistance to quit smoking can double your chances of success she says studies have shown that products such as nicotine replacement patches and gum and services such as individual or group counseling are more effective at getting smokers to quit than going cold turkey some studies have shown that prescription drugs may be slightly more effective than over the counter medications dr husten says still while most studies show that smoking cessation products and services are more effective than going cold turkey in the near term theres debate in the health care community over whether thats true over time as this article explains even in trials where medicine doubled success rates about of users relapsed critics also question the pharmaceutical industrys influence on studies the government uses to make recommendations about medication to help smokers quit ideally smokers should talk to their doctors first about which way to proceed in case there are issues with medical history that might dictate one treatment over another regardless its a good idea for smokers to try various smoke cessation treatments and services to determine which works best for them dr husten says "if one treatments not working try something else " people who want to stop smoking can find support services both in person and by telephone by calling quitnow callers will be referred to local treatment centers where they can get counseling and other assistance to help smokers quit for those who cant afford treatment programs or medication some states offer free services a month into his mission to stop smoking gerrys grown even more adamant that he doesnt need help still its clear the worst isnt over hes as tense as ever and his food binging is starting to worry me if his withdrawal symptoms dont ease soon ill urge him to reconsider trying to go it alone i also jotted down the quitnow number and placed it in his wallet in case theres a time when he feels an overwhelming urge to have a cigarette so whats gerry doing with the money hes saving by quitting smoking to show gerald how much money we save by not smoking gerry drops a &# bill into the college savings section of geralds four slotted piggy bank each week eventually well deposit the money into his college savings account gerry tried his best to never smoke where our son could see him in fact he was so paranoid about it that i wonder if gerald even knows of his fathers habit but at seven hes old enough to have seen adults and older children smoking and like any child to be curious about it even if gerald doesnt know about his father hes seen what smoking can do to the people he loves we talked with gerald about the dangers of smoking back when his grandfather was diagnosed with cancer the oncologist provided a photo of the tumor in my father in laws throat that helped drive that lesson home gerry hopes his frequently pointing out the cost of smoking combined with our continuing to talk about the health risks will be enough to discourage gerald from picking up the habit how do you convince a loved one to stop smoking former smokers did you quit cold turkey or use smoking cessation treatments what tips do you have for preventing a relapse write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com and then join me and your fellow readers in an ongoing discussion on the best ways to kick the habit readers responding via email to last weeks column about property taxes shared their own experiences with reassessments while others said the real problem isnt reassessing homes its runaway government spending read on for some of their thoughts then join me and your fellow readers in a continuing discussion about property taxes new hampshire has a requirement that towns complete reassessments periodically and during the recent period of ever increasing real estate prices our municipal officials have developed a habit of doing it frequently when this happens our municipal officials always mention how the tax rate will decline based on the results of the reassessment increases what they fail to mention is that tax rates arent decreased in direct proportion to the increase in the communitys total property assessment this little trick allows them to enact a significant increase in property tax revenue while touting that tax rates are declining local politicians will take any opportunity to increase tax revenue and this is one method most residents dont notice patrick r spooner your article on revaluations of property taxes was interesting but not reflective of my experience in chatham n j the borough and the firm it hired told us that we wouldnt see much of a change in our property taxes after the revaluation my taxes went from approximately &# to about &# other homeowners with similar experiences went through a mass appeal process there werent many successful appeals and in my opinion people were treated poorly in an open forum at morris county courthouse paul e gorman in austin texas property taxes are based on fair market value and i do pay in the six figures theres no adjustment for household income whether my income is &# annually or &# i was unemployed for months i had to come up with &# for property taxes in the annual cap on increases is so that means my property taxes go up &# every year since the appraisal rose so rapidly because my house is on expensive dirt i am taxed an amount equal to my mortgage payment to be fair texas doesnt have a state income tax however i believe that there should be more equity in our system of taxation i hope legislators in every state can bring wisdom and fairness to this issue donna boykin your column hit home as a reassessment is happening to us in brunswick county north carolina this is a coastal community where property values have skyrocketed since the last reassessment in many people who have lived here all their lives are having to leave this year the state approved a increase in homeowners insurance premiums as well so were being hit from all sides but theres a bigger issue here we need to re establish the concept of private property ownership in a free society a "tax" is paid once on the purchase when a tax is paid every month as property taxes are the more appropriate term is "rent " if we fail to pay the rent the landlord seizes our homes people who purchase a home today on a year mortgage can expect that once their mortgages are paid the government "rent" will equal or exceed their mortgage payments weve lost sight of the fact that private property rights are fundamental to a free society steve baker you circled around the issue property taxes equal assessed value times tax rate as taxpayers we vote on the total taxes to be collected in that scenario doubling assessments requires halving the tax rate clearly this doesnt happen reassessments are only supposed to reallocate the tax burden not increase revenue to be squandered the only way to keep the tax burden in line is to keep spending in line this means getting government completely out of activities that either the private sector can do more efficiently or that shouldnt be provided in the first place james m mulcahy your analysis of the impact of revaluation in your town was at best an academic exercise you can rest assured that your property taxes wont increase into the five digits what you need to do is compare your assessed value to the current estimated market value and see how that stacks up against other homes in your town if most homes have appreciated more than yours in the past years then youll see a tax decrease rest assured of one thing if the governor and legislature dont fix the root causes of disparity in new jersey taxation analyses such as yours are nothing more than parlor games akin to rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic jon riesberg you pay for get what you get new jersey has one of the highest average sat scores and a very high high school graduation rate because of this your son has a better chance of getting a scholarship or being admitted to an ivy league college i used to live in new jersey and now reside in florida where taxes are lower and the graduation rate is half that of new jersey and by the way your annual property tax increase is about the rate of inflation thats not bad joseph vigna homeowners in high growth or high profile areas love to talk about the appreciation of their homes and how much more they could sell for versus what they paid however when its time to reassess value to recognize all the equity theyre shocked appalled and claim the system is unfair if people are going to live in these areas homeowners must accept having to pay more taxes as their asset appreciates the more youre worth the more you pay right or wrong its the basic premise that our tax system is based on mike klein write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com
