nicotine fix behind antismoking policy influence of drug industry government guidelines dont push cold turkey advisers company ties michael fiore is in charge of revising federal guidelines on how to get smokers to quit he also runs an academic research center funded in part by drug companies that make quit smoking aids and he personally has received tens of thousands of dollars in speaking and consulting fees from those companies conflict of interest no says dr fiore who has consistently declared that doctors ought to use stop smoking medicine he says his opinion reflected in current federal guidelines is based on scientific evidence from hundreds of studies now debate is growing about that evidence and about who should be entrusted to interpret it some public health officials say industry funded doctors are ignoring other studies that suggest cold turkey is just as effective or even superior to nicotine patches and other pharmaceuticals over the long run not to mention cheaper at stake is one of the most important issues in the nations public health policy cigarettes kill an estimated americans a year helping americas million smokers kick the addiction could save untold numbers of people the public health service part of the department of health and human services issued guidelines in calling for smokers to use nicotine patches gums and other pharmaceutical aids to quit with a few exceptions such as pregnant women dr fiore a university of wisconsin professor of medicine headed the member panel that created those guidelines he and at least eight others on it had ties to the makers of stop smoking products those opposed to urging medication on most quitters note that cold turkey is the method used by the vast majority of former smokers they fear the federal governments campaign could discourage potential quitters who dont want to spend money on quitting aids or dont like the idea of treating their nicotine addiction with more nicotine "to imply that medications are the only way is inappropriate " says lois biener a senior research fellow at the university of massachusetts at boston who has surveyed former smokers in her state "most people dont want them most of the people who do quit successfully do so without them " the panel is now working on a revision of the guidelines scheduled for completion early next year dr fiore an internist is again chairman he says this time only seven of members have industry ties karen migdail a spokeswoman for the revision effort says it involves so many voices that "its hard for one perspective to have an influence on the process " she says dr fiore is "one of the leading experts" in smoking cessation and well suited to the job dr fiore says his panel will give a fair hearing to all points of view on smoking cessation he says the process is sufficiently collaborative to prevent bias his or anyone elses from creeping into the final product he notes that many of the studies questioning the effectiveness of stop smoking medication arose after the publication of the guidelines the panel will scrutinize them closely before reaching any conclusions he says david blumenthal director of the institute for health policy at massachusetts general hospital questions the governments choice of dr fiore "the chairman of the committee should be unquestionably impartial " says dr blumenthal who has published extensively on conflicts of interest pharmaceutical companies make several products to help smokers quit some give a nicotine fix without a cigarette such as glaxosmithkline plcs nicorette gum and nicotine laced commit lozenges nicotine the addictive agent in cigarettes is considered benign relative to the carcinogens in cigarettes bupropion an antidepressant and pfizer inc s chantix both pills available only by prescription aim to reduce cravings without using nicotine many clinical trials have randomly assigned smokers to take one of these products or a placebo such randomized trials are considered the gold standard in many medical fields and they have consistently shown that nicotine replacement therapy or other medicine confers a benefit but these trials have limitations they tend to compare quitters who wanted medication and got it with those who wanted medication and didnt get it which is a different group from quitters ready to try going cold turkey also clinical trials tend to attract highly motivated quitters who may not represent the population as a whole even the placebo group in these trials often boasts double the success rate of the population of quitters generally studies of quitters outside clinical trials have shown no consistent advantage for medicine over cold turkey the pharmaceutical industrys primary competitor an unpublished national cancer institute survey of people who tried quitting found that at three months users of the nicotine patch and users of bupropion remained abstinent at higher rates than did users of no medication but at nine months the no medication group held an advantage over every category of stop smoking medicine the study was presented at a world tobacco conference last summer similar so called population studies which review results of people who already quit or tried to rather than prospectively randomizing subjects into groups have also suggested that cold turkey quitting can compete with medication in real world situations these studies in california massachusetts and australia have their own limitations one is that they depend on people to remember what they did rather than monitoring them in a controlled experiment kenneth strahs glaxosmithklines vice president of smoking control research and development notes that his companys products won approval from regulators at the food and drug administration who demand randomized clinical trials "the fda does not conclude either safety or efficacy based on retrospective population studies " says dr strahs smoking control products account for a small fraction of the companys revenue the researcher who raised the first serious questions about nicotine replacement therapy says it may fall into a rarely discussed gap between efficacy in clinical trials and effectiveness in the real world greater use of medication is not "associated with any increase in successful quitting in the population " says john pierce a university of california san diego professor of medicine who was lead author of a journal of the american medical association article finding no superior benefit from over the counter nicotine substitutes in california "if were going to be intellectually honest we have to be willing to examine the issue of whether current users of medication are obtaining long term rates of abstinence that are higher than anyone else " says kenneth warner a tobacco researcher and dean of the university of michigan school of public health "thats going to be very hard for people to do in the smoking cessation community " because belief in the value of medication runs so deep he adds all sides in the debate agree that intervention by doctors and other health care providers to confront smokers can be effective in encouraging quitting dr fiore says the primary goal of the guidelines is to spur such intervention and he says they have been successful in sharply raising the proportion of doctors who discuss smoking with their patients also undisputed is that behavioral support whether from professional therapists or quit line counselors can be valuable as the federal government weighs the data in making new recommendations many of its advisers are receiving money from companies with a stake in the outcome dr fiore holds a chair at wisconsin that is funded by glaxosmithkline he directs a tobacco research center that received nearly &# million in funding from makers of quit smoking medicine in and &# in between and dr fiore personally pocketed &# to &# a year from the quitting aid industry for honorariums and consulting work he says he stopped such work in in the u s governments civil case against the tobacco industry it chose dr fiore as an expert witness he was asked to estimate the damages owed to federal taxpayers as a result of smoking and to devise a plan for spending those damages dr fiore came up with an estimate of &# billion and a plan to spend about &# billion a year of that mostly on counseling and medication a measure that could have doubled the size of the stop smoking medicine market later the government reduced its request for damages to &# billion the american cancer society has allowed its logo to be placed on stop smoking products in exchange for money a cancer society spokesman defends that decision crediting the pharmaceutical industry for bringing invaluable marketing muscle to the societys great american smokeout every november those who advocate medication sometimes fail to disclose that they have financial ties to companies in an article on voice of americas web site last year jack henningfield identified only as a smoking cessation expert urged smokers to "go to the consumer friendly web site that i like which is www quit com " dr henningfield is a principal of pinney associates a consulting firm whose largest client is glaxosmithkline operator of the quit com site other articles citing dr henningfields views on smoking have identified him as a professor at johns hopkins school of medicine without mentioning the glaxosmithkline connection dr henningfield who holds a doctorate in psychology is an adjunct professor at johns hopkins he says only of his income comes from hopkins dr henningfield says he always tells journalists about his financial ties to industry but in an interview with the wall street journal last summer dr henningfield promoted the use of stop smoking medicine without volunteering any information about those ties he says he thought glaxosmithklines public relations firm had already provided the information in an least two medical journal articles that dr fiore wrote or co wrote promoting the use of stop smoking medicine no mention was made of his financial ties to the makers of those treatments dr fiore says the editors of those journals may have ignored his disclosure or he may have failed to provide it if the latter "i am sorry about that " he says adding that those are two of more than medical journal articles he has published dr fiore and other members of the society for research on nicotine and tobacco refuse to accept any funds from the tobacco industry even unrestricted research grants smoking control activists say theres a big difference between tobacco companies which they say engaged in scientific deceit for a half century and drug makers that are trying to help smokers quit reflecting the view of many in the antitobacco camp harry lando a university of minnesota nicotine researcher says "i view the pharmaceutical industry as our ally " after the federal panel with industry funded scientists came out with its guidelines in a campaign against cold turkey took root the web site of the highest ranking physician in america the surgeon general calls it a "myth" that cold turkey is the best way to quit in november during the week of the great american smokeout doctors around the country participated in a campaign called "dont go cold turkey " the creator of the campaign was glaxosmithkline the how to quit web site of the federal centers for disease control and prevention rejected a request from john polito an ex smoker in mount pleasant s c to include a link to his web site whyquit com which advocates cold turkey quitting in a letter explaining the rejection the agency told mr polito that drug therapy has been shown to double quit rates in an interview cdc epidemiologist corinne husten says the real reason for the rejection is that the cdc doesnt recommend private web sites however the cdc site long included a link to glaxosmithklines quit com site asked about that dr husten says "some things have gotten on the cdc web site that shouldnt be there " after the interview the cdc removed the quit com link pressure may be growing for doctors to follow the federal guidelines an article in the december issue of the journal tobacco control argued that failure to follow the guidelines could be deemed medical malpractice some health officials dont go along with the federal governments tilt against cold turkey the state of californias help line for smokers presents cold turkey as an equally viable option to medication "the effectiveness of pharmaceutical aids has been proven short term long term its still in debate " says hao tang a research scientist with the state department of health services california has succeeded in reducing its smoking rate to six percentage points below the national average after three decades of smoking linda holstein quit nearly three years ago using a nicotine patch as well as nicotine gum which on occasion she still pops into her mouth elated at being free from cigarettes ms holstein a minneapolis attorney says "the gum helped very much " others say ingesting medicinal nicotine prolonged withdrawal leading them ultimately back to cigarettes during the years that tanya blakey a georgia teacher smoked two packs a day she tried to quit countless times using nicotine replacement therapy "every time i stopped using the nrt i was smoking again within two or three days " says ms blakey this week she is celebrating two years without a cigarette this time having used no medication
