westminsters co host is the dog shows best friend the westminster kennel clubs st annual dog show madison square garden feb www westminsterkennelclub org new york david frei knows he cant go with the latin thing again this year the "multum in parvo" business a lot in a small package cant do the little song and dance about what a useful expression it is for describing a pug he did that whole spiel last year during his gig as on air commentator at the westminster kennel club dog show or was it the year before anyway mr frei whos geared up for his th stint as the venerable competitions co host is busy flipping through his note cards to unearth some other savory nuggets for the almost four million viewers wholl be tuning in to learn which of breeds and varieties will be judged best in show at westminsters st canine conclave so how about this for a fun fact the poodle originated in germany not france or this one a pug saved william of orange in by alerting him to the imminent arrival of spanish invaders want more mr frei is your man "when i first started the message was this is the greatest dog show in the world that was our only message " said mr frei whos also communications director for westminster "but through the years we have come to present the show as a celebration of the dogs in our lives the great show dogs at westminster are their representatives " while viewership is not quite as robust as it once was blame another competition "american idol " which airs at the same time as westminsters final round of judging "weve managed to hold our ratings " said mr frei people continue to tune in he believes because of westminsters high entertainment content and because its the nature of the sports fan to want to see who in this case what is going to win there is also something mr frei refers to as the alma mater factor at play this notion is embodied by the fellow who cozies up to the plasma screen with his dandie dinmont or dalmation eager to see if the dogs "relative" will triumph "people cant imagine going head to head with michael jordan " said mr frei "but with maybe a bath once a week and a little more roadwork and one or two fewer biscuits they can imagine their dog on the green carpet at madison square garden " mr frei wholl be paired this year with "weekend today" anchor lester holt previous co hosts include al trautwig bud collins and joe garagiola sees the commentator position at least in part as a bully pulpit "to get the message out about responsible dog ownership " as well as a signal opportunity to demystify an event that seems to many as arcane as kabuki "people who watch football on television have probably been to games and understand whats happening on the field " said mr frei "most people who watch the dog show have never been to a dog show and maybe never will be its my job to explain what theyre seeing out there and why we go about things in the way we do " why for example do judges want to see a dog in motion to assess its basic soundness what if the contestant um leaves a little something behind in the ring well now ladies and gentlemen this is a dog show isnt it whats with the poodles goofy haircut the singular coiffure dates back to the breeds early day as a sporting dog and served to protect the poodles organs in cold water most critically how do the folks at westminster feel about the movie "best in show" "we thought it was very funny " said mr frei of christopher guests lampoon of the canine competition world "i like to say were a character rich environment but if you hang out at a nascar event youll see characters there too " mr freis voice and face have become sufficiently familiar both from westminster and his appearance as a dog show judge on "sex and the city" that when he stops to chat with fellow dog owners during evening strolls with his two brittany spaniels no introduction is needed but fame can be an awkward business the day after one westminster broadcast mr frei was getting into a hotel elevator with his wife and some friends "and a very nice looking woman turned to me and said you were great last night " recounted mr frei still blushing at the memory "i told her thats a fine thing to say in front of my wife but i hope you were talking about my work on television " the oldest of five children mr frei grew up in eugene ore where his father was a college football coach as a year old he got his first dog an afghan hound at the behest of his girlfriend "the girlfriend is long gone but dogs are still in my life " said mr frei who subsequently became a breeder of champion afghans a handler and dog show judge his avocation no doubt served him well in day jobs that included publicity posts at abc sports where he handled "monday night football" announcer and celebrated pit bull howard cosell he also worked in public relations for the denver broncos and the san francisco ers mr frei did an audition tape for the westminster commentator slot in january at the behest of the kennel clubs president and got the nod to come back the next month and do the show there was just this one little thing mr frei had his champion afghan stormhills whos zoomin who entered in the competition "it was zoomies last chance she was going to retire and get into the breeding program i told them if it was an issue thanks but no thanks to the tv job " he got the go ahead to show his dog and still do the show "zoomie got beat in the breed " said mr frei referring to the first level of judging "that was disappointing " his own experiences in the ring both as winner and also ran color his commentary "at westminster you can count on me to say that every day is a new day in the dog show world " said mr frei "no matter a dogs standing coming in to the show we are only judging it on what we see here " "david is the singular television personality in the dog show world " said gordon beck senior vice president for sports at usa network which has been airing westminster since "hes been in the community for years as a breeder and handler but he knows how to communicate to a lay audience whats magical about westminster people sometimes think of this show as being a bunch of stuffed shirts but david has a very down to earth demeanor theres no pomposity " mr freis unforced golden retriever friendliness admirably suits his cause "i want audiences to see that were real people in a wonderful fun family sport that we love " he said "the dogs they see in competition dont spend their lives on cushions eating bonbons when theyre not at dog shows theyre out in the yard chasing squirrels they sleep on our beds and shed on our clothes and steal food off the counter " and yes confessed mr frei "they drink out of the toilet " ms kaufman
