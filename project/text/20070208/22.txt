debt driven deals shake up holders of highly rated bonds the flurry of debt driven corporate mergers spinoffs and buyouts is putting a normally staid group of investors investment grade bondholders on the defensive typically a genteel bunch populated by life insurers and pension fund managers these risk averse investors are learning the hard way that their bets on high quality corporate bonds some of the safest debt around are more vulnerable than believed holders of highly rated bonds in companies like casino operator harrahs entertainment inc or energy firm kinder morgan inc have seen their investments dropped in value overnight after private equity shops launched bids for the companies the bids came with plans to load the companies up with new debt the heavier debt burden meant existing bondholders became more exposed to default they had added exposure because the new debt would be paid off first if a default actually occurs in both cases the credit rating on the existing bonds tumbled from investment grade to junk "the whole culture of high grade bondholders for a very long time was lackadaisical where nobody was ever worried " says robert haines a bond analyst in new york at creditsights an independent debt research firm that might be changing as buyout shops search out more big high quality companies to take over in a rare show of solidarity some debt investors are fighting back blackstone groups purchase of equity office properties trust the nations largest office landlord for &# billion is one example eops shareholders voted yesterday in favor of a buyout deal concluding blackstones bidding war with vornado realty trust the deal came with significant gamesmanship between existing bondholders and the company on dec before vornado appeared on the scene eop and blackstone announced plans to buy back all of eops &# billion in bonds as part of the blackstone buyout the offer covered short term bonds due within the next years and longer term bonds due as late as but debt investors rallied against it rejecting the terms as too little for the long term bondholders "it was an impressive effort especially the way bondholders seemingly looked out for each other " says sid bakst a bond manager at robeco weiss peck &amp greer who wasnt involved in the eop affair in that case bondholders had some leverage against the company they were protected by provisions in the debt known as covenants that limited the amount of new debt eop could take on in a buyout without the consent of existing bondholders in other words blackstone might not have been able to finance the deal aig global investment group which held both long term and short term bonds banded other investors against the offer by jan eop and blackstone agreed to boost the offer to long term bondholders by about paying nearly &# million for the &# million in outstanding bonds for the remaining &# billion in debt eop and blackstone agreed to pay about &# billion in total bondholders will be paid about &# billion for their &# billion in bonds bondholders in tyco international ltd which is undergoing a restructuring that will split the conglomerate into three separately traded pieces are bracing for a potential replay of the eop situation says one tyco bondholder like eop bondholders investors in tyco bonds have covenants that allow them to get their money back in a merger in many other cases high grade bondholders dont have these protections making them especially vulnerable even targets without covenants they have little negotiating leverage with buyout shops and because the bonds are high grade and pay relatively low interest rates they are appealing to buyout shops looking for companies that can bear more debt now more investors are demanding these provisions home depot federated department stores and black &amp decker were among the companies that included such provisions "its one of the first things we ask for nowadays " says mr bakst of robeco weiss "its an insurance policy that protects against the worst case scenario " if companies choose not to include covenants they may have to commit to higher interest rates before investors will buy their bonds even with the provisions some bond investors are finding themselves vulnerable this week some bondholders in junk rated lear corp found themselves on the losing end of a buyout offer by carl icahn even though their bonds contained change of control provisions lear had issued &# million in bonds last november with terms that ensured the bonds would be paid off in full if
