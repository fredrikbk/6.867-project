wonder land the snake eater subject a case study of how the u s got bogged down in iraq problem if a cop in anytown usa pulls over a suspect he checks the persons id remotely from the squad car hes linked to databases filled with whos who in the world of crime killing and mayhem in iraq there is nothing like that when our troops and the iraqi army enter a town village or street what they know about the local bad guys is pretty much in their heads at best solution give our troops what our cops have the pentagon knows this for reasons you can imagine it hasnt happened this is a story of can do in a no can do world a story of how a marine officer in iraq a small network design company in california a nonprofit troop support group a blogger and other undeterrable folk designed a handheld insurgent identification device built it shipped it and deployed it in anbar province they did this in days from dec to jan compared to standard operating procedure for iraq this is a nanosecond before fastening our seatbelts lets check the status quo as a high defense department official told the journals editorial page "were trying to fight a major war with peacetime procurement rules " the department knows this is awful indeed a program exists the automated biometric identification system retina scans facial matching and the like the reality this war is in year four and the troops dont have it beyond baghdad the u s role has become less about killing insurgents than arresting the worst and isolating them from the population obviously it would help to have an electronic database of who the bad guys are their friends where they live tribal affiliation in short the insurgencys networks the marine and army officers who patrol iraqs dangerous places know they need an identification system similar to cops back home the troops now write down suspects names and addresses some like marine maj owen west in anbar have created their own spreadsheets and powerpoint programs or use digital cameras to input the details of suspected insurgents but no iraq wide software architecture exists operating around the town of khalidiya north of baghdad maj west has been the leader of a team of nine u s soldiers advising an iraqi brigade this has been his second tour of duty in iraq when not fighting the iraq war hes an energy trader for goldman sachs in new york city it had become clear to him last fall that the iraqi soldiers were becoming the areas cops and that they needed modern police surveillance tools to help the iraqi army in khalidiya do its job right maj west needed that technology yesterday he was scheduled to rotate back stateside in february this month since arriving in iraq last year maj west had worked with spirit of america soa the civilian troop support group founded by jim hake in early december soas project director michele redmond asked maj west if there was any out of the ordinary project they could help him with and maj west said why yes there is he described to them the basic concept for a mobile handheld fingerprinting device which iraqi soldiers would use to assemble an insurgent database mr hake said his organization would contribute &# to build a prototype and get it to khalidiya in new york goldman sachs contributed &# to the project two problems they needed to find someone who could assemble the device and the unit had to be in khalidiya by jan to give maj west time to field test it before he left in february to build the device they approached a small california company computer deductions inc which makes electronic systems for law enforcement agencies over the dec weekend cdi went to work building a machine for iraq tom calabro a cdi vice president assembled a team of six technicians its basic platform would be a handheld fingerprint workstation called the mv made by cross match technologies a maker of biometric identity applications the data collected by the mv would be stored via bluetooth in a hardened laptop made by getac a california manufacturer from knowledge computing corp of arizona they used the coplink program which creates a linked "map" of events the laptop would sit in the troops humvee and the data sent from there to a laptop at outpost headquarters meanwhile soa began to think about how theyd get the package to maj west by jan they likely would have less than seven days transit time after cdi finished soa normally used fedex to ship time sensitive equipment into iraq but given the unusual nature of the shipment they were concerned about customs and clearance this wasnt a case of soccer balls jim hake thought of an alternative find someone who would hand carry it like a diplomatic courier on a flight to kuwait and from there to taqaddum air base in central iraq this meant finding someone who could get into iraq quickly the someone was bill roggio mr roggio is a former army signalman and infantryman who now embeds with the troops and writes about it on his blog the fourth rail or for the soa web site he was at home in new jersey about to celebrate his birthday with his family he agreed to fly the mv to iraq as soon as it was ready in conjunction with an embed trip with soas michele redmond he started working out the logistics for getting to iraq asap on jan cdis tom calabro emailed the group including maj west in iraq "things are progressing at a furious pace i may be able to ship by end of day tomorrow worst case is thursday or friday " four days later a glitch mr calabro said a vendor mistakenly shipped via the u s postal service and a crucial part arrived late on jan "my guys are going to work through the night to finish testing " he said they shipped the kit via ups to bill roggio for monday arrival later that day he boarded a lufthansa flight from newark to kuwait city after an overnight hotel stay he took a c military transport to taqaddum miles north of baghdad maj wests marines drove him to their outpost minutes away and so a month from inception bill roggio handed the electronic identification kit to maj west on the night of jan maj west his marine squad and the "jundi" iraq army soldiers took the mv and laptop on patrol their term of endearment for the insurgents is "snakes " so of course the mv became the snake eater the next day maj west emailed the u s team digital photos of iraqi soldiers fingerprinting suspects with the snake eater "its one night old and the town is abuzz " he said "i think we have a chance to tip this city over now " a rumor quickly spread that the iraqi army was implanting gps chips in insurgents thumbs over the past days maj west has had chance encounters with two marine superiors maj gen richard zilmer who commands the joint forces in anbar and brig gen robert neller deputy commanding general of operations in iraq he showed them the mobile id database device i asked gen neller by email on tuesday what the status of these technologies is now he replied that theyre receiving advanced biometric equipment "like the device being employed by maj west " he said "in the near future" they will begin to network such devices to share databases more broadly "bottom line the requirement for networking our biometric capability is a priority of this organization " as he departs maj west reflected on winning at street level "were fixated on the enemy but the enemy is fixated on the people they know which families are apostates which houses are safe for the night which boys are vulnerable to corruption or kidnapping the enemys population collection effort far outstrips ours the snake eater will change that and fast " you have to believe hes got this right it will only happen though if someone above his pay grade blows away the killing habits of peacetime procurement write to henninger wsj com see related letter "letters to the editor the quick fixers" wsj feb
