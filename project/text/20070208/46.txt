of resolution resulting in grainy shots and no flash or focus capabilities they could only store a few dozen shots and many phones couldnt move pictures to printers or pcs without going through the wireless network until pictures often couldnt be shared between different cellular carriers because of a lack of standards confusing pricing structures some carriers based charges on an images size rather than a flat rate per picture were another deterrent now even traditional camera makers see the pattern changing "you will take some of the point and shoot market and it will shift to the cellphone " says brian marks general manager of eastman kodak co s mobile photography business in rochester n y kodak and other camera makers are supplying technology and components to cellphone makers angela granfield an office manager for a construction company in medfield mass says her boss previously used a digital camera to take pictures of damage in apartments to show to building owners

director messaging category for verizon wireless a joint venture of verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc verizon allows customers to store as many as pictures or second videos free on its pix &amp flix web site friends who download the videos pay as much as cents for the privilege while camera makers will always be able to make dedicated devices that can take better pictures the camera

cameras obsolete "theres a generation of kids who dont own wrist watches because they have the time on their phones " he says "the same thing will happen with cameras someone will say are you gonna
