things that go boom it seems that no one in the s forecast the doubling of home prices since in cities in the u s and many other countries harry s dent published a book in "the roaring s building the wealth and lifestyle you desire in the greatest boom in history " which was a new york times best seller wouldnt you imagine from the title that it predicted a huge housing boom it didnt it said of the suburbs that "there will be only a modest appreciation of home values despite a booming economy " the book concluded only that some "select real estate" should be part of ones portfolio mr dent was really preoccupied with the stock market which was booming when it was written books really predicting the housing boom started to appear only after it was well underway when their forecasts were simple extrapolations david lereah chief economist for the national association of realtors published "are you missing the real estate boom why home values and other real estate investments will climb through the end of the decade and how to profit from them" in in contrast his book "the rules for growing rich making money in the new information economy " written just before the very peak of the dot com boom and published in june spoke first about the stock market and then added only that "real estate investments have proven over the years to be worthy additions to anyones portfolio " we shouldnt blame these people for not seeing the boom coming nobody did but those economists who say today that the real estate boom has been justified by "fundamentals" have to explain why they werent able to forecast the high home prices we have today based on those fundamentals with the failure of anyone really to predict todays high home prices one may well conclude that no one can predict today whether a home price bust is coming or whether the housing market will land softly or even is poised to resume its upward climb that may be the right conclusion about our ability to forecast the markets on the other hand there is another perspective on this colossal failure to predict maybe it doesnt mean that no one can forecast but instead that the high home prices today are just an enormous anomaly that will have to correct downward sometime if not right away this has been the biggest housing boom in world history and when one looks at a long term chart of u s home prices this boom stands out among the other price increases like the highest kite in the park it certainly looks anomalous and maybe it is moreover home price booms and sometimes at least real estate busts seem awfully persistent lately so that it looks like we should be able to forecast them the market for homes has become very different from the stock market which is somewhat well approximated as a random walk home prices have been going in the same direction for quite some time according to the city composite standard &amp poors case shiller composite home price index which karl case and i and now david stiff from fiserv inc helped design and is now traded on the chicago mercantile exchange futures and options markets the growth rate of home prices was negative prices were actually falling for four consecutive years and then after a brief period of oscillation home prices started accelerating prices increased every year from to and in six of the eight the rate of increase itself increased to in home price changes hardly look unforecastable the next thing that happened was home prices started decelerating the rate of increase dropping to in and then down to just in month change ending in november the latest month to month data from s&amp p includes an even broader set of indices for u s cities and these show that prices are actually falling in of the cities so shall we conclude since price changes appear to be so persistent that we are in store for strongly negative growth in home prices for a number of years the trouble is we havent seen really long and significant strings of price decreases in the u s since the first half of the th century the consecutive year home price declines in the major u s cities from amounted to a total drop of only from peak to trough more recently we have seen sharp reversals of sudden price drops san francisco home prices dropped between and and then resumed a strong upward climb london home prices dropped between and and then resumed an upward climb a string of negative home price changes has been underway in japan for a long time they came after a boom in major japanese cities in the s culminating in home prices so high they were the talk of the world japans is the principal prior example we have of the aftermath of a spectacular home price boom like the one we have just seen in the u s and other countries after the peak in japanese urban land prices in large city areas declined for years until prices ultimately fell by by japanese private residential investment as a share of gross domestic expenditure fell gradually with the urban land prices over the same year period in the early s construction remained at fairly respectable levels feeding the supply of new homes and helping to bring down home prices further but as home prices continued to fall so too did construction contributing to prolonged weakness in the japanese economy which post boom scenario is more likely in coming years that of the recent reversal stories in the u s u k and australia or that of japan after or something in between do the recent declines in home prices in the u s mark a historic turning point some short run indicators have been interpreted as showing that the recent weakness in the housing market may be correcting upward notably people took heart when the national association of realtors reported that after declining for six consecutive months seasonally adjusted existing home sales picked up slightly in october and november but seasonally adjusted sales fell again in december the u s census reports that the sales of new houses have been rising since october and increased between november and december but the increase may be attributable in large part to unseasonably warm weather and sales incentives although the cme housing futures market is still relatively thinly traded the prices there reflect the collective view of multiple investors hedgers and speculators the futures market still predicts home price declines in all traded cities over the next year though modestly lower declines than in the recent past these are only short run indicators and they do not tell us a lot about the major correction in home prices that might be in store the fact that home prices have risen so high relative to construction costs and other indicators suggests that home prices might fall back substantially in some markets and maybe that is what is going on but one can hardly be sure about whether and when it will happen it could take many years for new construction to completely close the unusual builders profit opportunity created by high home prices and many unpredictable things could happen over that time we are left with a deeply uncertain situation but one in which it would seem that a sequence of price declines continuing for many years has some substantial probability of happening traditional finance theory has trouble reconciling even a semi predictable sequence of price declines with basic notions of market efficiency the situation we are facing is a reminder of the glaring inefficiencies and incompleteness of existing markets for residential real estate and may be regarded as evidence that institutional changes will be coming in future years to fundamentally change the nature of these markets mr shiller professor of economics and finance at yale university is chief economist at
