the numbers guy nielsens new college numbers nielsen tv ratings are finally going to college for the first time the research company is including the roughly l million college students who live in dorms in its national estimates of tv viewing habits nielsen co has long excluded such people from its national ratings and adding them has a dramatic impact on some shows nielsen said an additional men aged to on average watched the racy animated show "drawn together" on comedy central over one period it examined that translated to a increase in ratings for the show in that demographic which is a key one for advertisers in another example nielsen said the new monitoring meant ratings for "greys anatomy" jumped by among women in that same age group an increase of more than but to calculate these estimates nielsen is extrapolating from the viewing habits of just students around the country who have agreed to have electronic monitors installed in their dorm rooms that means the decisions of a handful of those students can lead to a huge swing in ratings that jump for "drawn together" was based on people in nielsens survey group who tuned in to the show for the broadcasters and advertisers who rely on nielsen the recruitment of the college students is essentially a better than nothing addition to what has been criticized as a flawed antiquated ratings system "this is a major step forward if only because it eliminated the false assumption that students residing on campus were viewing zero television " david poltrack chief research officer of cbs corp told me the use of just college students to project the viewing preferences of millions and the prior omission of that group from a measurement that is the currency for billions of dollars in tv advertising highlights a significant challenge for nielsen it is measuring the audience for hundreds of national and local stations using a relatively small panel of volunteers &lt ndash&gt nielsens national panel includes households in a system designed for a time when three national networks monopolized the ratings "the nielsen system was really designed the way tv was and the way it was viewed years ago " alan wurtzel president of research for nbc universal told me adding "as the tv audience atomizes among hundreds of networks it becomes a challenge from a statistical standpoint to break out a niche demographic " yet thats just what advertisers want nielsen to do so that they can direct their ad dollars to shows that appear to be particularly popular with a relatively narrow demographic group nielsen has drawn criticism for being slow to change until all nielsen families had to keep track of their viewing habits in paper diaries though the company has since installed electronic devices in viewers homes each time a member of the household enters the room and starts watching he or she is supposed to log in by pressing a button on the box or using a remote control the data are zapped to nielsen broken down by demographic group and extrapolated into scientific seeming estimates of audience size down to the nearest thousand for the latest effort nielsen asked the households if they had any college students living away from home with a tv set for those who said yes nielsen asked the students if theyd be willing to be monitored and about one third agreed nielsen previously counted college age tv viewers only if they lived somewhere other than a dorm such as at home or in their own apartment "is the sample size ideal for college students no probably not " james webster professor of communication studies at northwestern university told me nielsen spokesman gary holmes told me that " is an adequate sample size for a narrowly focused demographic like this " he said the new measurement project began five years ago "when we were approached by some of the networks who thought that our sample wasnt as complete as it could be because we werent including college kids once they went to school " statisticians ive spoken with told me national surveys typically include at least people to limit the margin of error an ongoing princeton university survey of college students examining minority students academic progress tracked about students political pollsters often survey just or so people to determine broad national trends but sampling error is less of a problem when respondents are choosing among two presidential candidates its a different matter when asking someone which of or more channels they are watching mr holmes said nielsen isnt calculating a margin of error for the college group news reports and promotional press releases usually dont make it clear how small samples can influence ratings they sometimes crown networks shows and personalities as winners based on differences of just rating point representing about households "the ratings just arent accurate to that point " said lynne s gross professor of radio tv and film at california state university fullerton nielsens mr holmes said the company supplies information to clients that would allow them to calculate an overall margin of error that they could publicize the new ratings went live last week and this week several shows popular in college dorms including cws "gilmore girls" and nbcs "the office" saw jumps in viewing of at least among people aged to according to nielsen that demographic included more than million people in according to the census cbss mr poltrack told me that for the mens college basketball tournament in march he expects a jump of at least in male viewers aged to compared with a year earlier nielsen remains distant from its goal of something called anytime anywhere media measurement and broadcasters have complained about the lack of measurement outside traditional home settings the company doesnt track viewership among the nearly six million americans who according to the census bureau live in group quarters like military barracks hospitals nursing homes and prisons nor does it track viewing in sports bars at work or in hotel rooms cbss mr poltrack said "the bigger missing element right now is people who view at home but who do more and more of their viewing out of the home " nielsen is taking steps to change this it is developing portable meters that would detect audio signals in radio and television programs such "passive" measurement would represent a major improvement on todays system relying on people to actively log their viewing cbss mr poltrack said he said some people dont join nielsens panels at all because of the burden and others do join and try to comply "but just from human nature they dont always remember " nbcs mr wurtzel said the diligence required in being a nielsen panel member could hurt the efforts to monitor dorm dwellers "you cant get your teenager to clean a room much less push a button every time" they watch tv he said nielsens mr holmes said portable passive meters are "probably a couple of years away " he added that the company is planning a major study to validate its results it will include checks such as calling nielsen households to ask what theyre watching at a particular moment and comparing it with the data viewers are submitting on the electronic meters thanks to everyone who posted to the most recent forum about my column on a coke promotion ill be reading and responding
