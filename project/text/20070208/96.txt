politics &amp economics capital bushs course on budget parallels iraq the numbers in president bushs budget add up arithmetically if his assumptions come true the deficit will evaporate in but there are a lot of ifs if iraq and afghanistan cost only &# billion in and nothing thereafter if the president and congress hold growth in annually appropriated domestic spending well below inflation if they let the alternative minimum tax reach deeper into the middle class or raise taxes on others to prevent that if congress squeezes &# billion from medicare over five years ok give him a break a presidential budget is an opening bid not an attempt at stating a consensus but is it sound if former republican treasury secretary james a baker iii and former democratic rep lee hamilton led a budget commission like their iraq study group what would they say they would hardly need to rewrite their cover letter "there is no magic formula however there are actions that can be taken to improve the situation and protect american interests " they said in the iraq report "many americans are dissatisfied not just with the situation but with the state of our political debate our country deserves a debate that prizes substance over rhetoric and a policy that is adequately funded and sustainable " william gale of the brookings institution think tank populated by deficit fearing democratic wonks who have been trying to find common ground with deficit fearing republican wonks has been thinking a lot lately about the parallels between mr bush on iraq and mr bush on the budget "the bush administrations two signature policies have been the war in iraq and consistent pressure for tax cuts " he argues "on the surface they look quite different and were advocated by different parts of the administration look a little deeper and some common patterns emerge so maybe this says something about the principles or management style of the bush administration " it is a provocative and illuminating exercise let mr gale kick it off the president took the u s into iraq with "falsely rosy scenarios" about the post saddam landscape there he says mr bush built his tax cuts in on a similarly unrealistic hope that the budget surplus was large enough to cut taxes without creating deficits let us keep going as iraq proved different and more difficult than anticipated and contingency planning was regarded by the bush white house as a sign of weakness rather than prudence mr bush vowed to "stay the course " when then treasury secretary paul oneill and federal reserve chairman alan greenspan argued for "triggers" to undo tax cuts if budget reality didnt match projections the white house scoffed even when the sept attacks and the wars in iraq and afghanistan drove spending on homeland security and the military far above projections mr bush didnt revisit his fiscal strategy smart critics even inside the administration were disregarded and shunned gen eric shinseki on troops levels in iraq treasury secretary oneill on deficits only true believers remained to give the president advice eventually mr bush changed his team hiring new secretaries of defense and treasury but too late to get credit from the public or to forge bipartisan consensus in congress imagine what might have happened differently had mr bush installed josh bolten as chief of staff rob portman as budget director and hank paulson as treasury secretary at the start of his second term instead of waiting two years might the conversation on mr bushs ideas for limiting tax breaks for health insurance be bearing fruit not just taking shape might overhauling the tax code be a legislative issue instead of the title of another report gathering dust on treasury bookshelves might mr bush have something besides scars to show for his call to fix social security might he have a shot at leaving the nations long term fiscal health better than he found it instead of leaving a deeper hole for his successors ok take a breath the u s economy is not iraq and todays headlines are upbeat the economys vigor is producing tax revenue that is keeping todays deficits in check and the unabated willingness of foreigners to lend to the u s is keeping interest rates down but look ahead and there is an unwelcome parallel between iraq and the budget current policy is unsustainable but there is no easy way out extend the presidents tax cuts beyond their scheduled expiration in and and the fiscal hole is enormous let them expire and the tax increases could derail the economy messrs baker and hamilton had little apparent effect on the presidents iraq policy maybe they would have better luck on economics mr wessel responds to reader comments at wsj com capitalexchange or email him at capital wsj com
