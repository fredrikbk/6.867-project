sudden reversal the medicare drug benefit that congress passed in and which took effect last january has exceeded every expectation not only is the program more popular than we imagined it is also more flexible and less expensive of the million seniors with prescription drug coverage about million have already signed up for the benefit called part d many of the remaining million get an indirect subsidy from part d through their pre existing plans four out of five enrolled say they are satisfied and why wouldnt they be monthly premiums expected to cost &# average &# part d is honored at neighborhood pharmacies nationwide those who prefer home delivery can arrange for that too and critically it covers nearly every drug approved by the fda nevertheless some in congress want to make over part d to resemble the drug benefit program of the veterans administration where the government sets a price on drugs that it can get at the cheapest rate and limits access to those it cant as a result the va benefit excludes three out of four drugs available through part d including some of the most innovative treatments for arthritis high cholesterol breast cancer and other ailments retired veterans who want crestor humira or revlimid have to go elsewhere or go without it also takes three years for new drugs to make it onto the vas list and enrollees can only directly fill prescriptions at about government run facilities nationwide no wonder more than one million retired veterans have signed up for medicare in the last year alone why the difference between the programs unlike the va benefit part d partners with a number of private sector drug plans that were already negotiating prices with drug makers in other markets costs are then driven down even further from competition among plans the savings flow not just to seniors but to every taxpaying american part d has already cost &# billion less than originally expected it is now projected to cost another &# billion less over the next years when was the last time a government program ended up costing less than projected all of which brings us back to the medicare bill that democrats recently passed in the house which would scrap the competitive pricing mechanism that has made part d such a success the democrats senate version is short on details but its call for senators to express their "sense" that part d should be changed is a clear sign of whats in store this despite the findings of the nonpartisan congressional budget office along with every other major study of the issue which say that fixing prices wont lead to lower costs just fewer options both parties used to oppose rationing for example tom daschle the former democratic senate majority leader proposed a reform in that called on health plans to bargain on behalf of seniors bill clintons health and human services secretary donna shalala argued for the same thing the sudden reversal is a mystery are democrats unaware of their history on the issue are they unaware of the facts ultimately the answer to these questions doesnt matter more than million seniors say they are happy with the drug benefit we put together four years ago and republicans are eager to defend it even if we cant imagine why its being threatened in the first place mr mcconnell is the senate republican leader
