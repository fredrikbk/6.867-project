florida insurance law fuels growing debate florida escaped last years hurricane season without any devastating storms but upheaval in its insurance system is intensifying fueling a debate about the role of free markets in a turbulent industry floridas legislature and its republican governor last month approved legislation that would make the state a bigger player in the market for catastrophe coverage the new law gives a state created insurer wider latitude to compete with private insurers like allstate corp and state farm insurance cos in selling homeowners insurance the state also is expanding its hurricane fund into a &# billion giant that will compete with companies like warren buffetts berkshire hathaway inc and hedge funds to provide a backstop to the insurance industry the moves place florida at the center of fresh battles brewing across the country in a debate over the appropriate role of government in the insurance market though the economic backdrop differs from state to state the underlying theme is the same who should have the back of americans when disaster strikes in washington lawmakers are considering an extension of a national terror insurance program that backstops private insurers the program was created after the sept terror attacks and was extended for the first time in in california gov arnold schwarzenegger another republican has proposed an expanded role for the state in providing universal health insurance the issues florida is wrestling with arent unique after florida acted louisiana gov kathleen blanco and the states insurance commissioner met with insurance executives and told them the state wants the private sector to play the major role in insuring louisiana homeowners but gov blanco said if prices continue to spiral upward and insurers seek to drop customers in the wake of hurricane katrina "theyre going to drive government into creating a government solution " as for the insurers she added "i think they did heed our warnings " floridas initiative aims to lower the insurance premiums paid by the states homeowners in the wake of severe storms in and the states homeowners on average are paying twice as much for property insurance today as they were before those storms and in some parts of the state rates have more than tripled last year alone property insurers like allstate and state farm asked florida regulators for rate increases of or more in some parts of the state arguing their own costs for hedging their risks known as reinsurance were going through the roof the increases they received were much smaller than their requests "floridas homeowners are carrying the heavy load of property insurance costs " florida gov charlie crist said when the legislation was being considered "this burden is weighing our people down with worry and harming our way of life " some in the industry bristle at floridas strategy critics contend the state is distorting the sense of risk in one of the nations biggest insurance markets potentially setting floridians up for a major financial blow if disaster strikes again and residents of the state have to cover it "faced with a pay me now or pay me later situation florida has unfortunately opted for the pay me later approach " john degnan vice chairman of home insurer chubb corp told analysts in a conference call last week florida is one of the nations largest insurance markets the states efforts are concentrating the risk of hurricane losses inside the state rather than spreading it around the world via the insurance industry said robert hartwig president of the insurance information institute an industry trade group another big storm could force floridians to pay higher prices on an array of insurance policies if the state created entities face major losses some of that burden could fall on inland dwellers and businesses less exposed to hurricane risk raising "issues of equity" over who should bear the financial burden for coastal dwelling said mr hartwig floridas state created insurer of last resort citizens property insurance corp is the largest insurer in the state with million customers most of its clients are homeowners who couldnt get private coverage the florida hurricane catastrophe fund which is overseen by the states governor chief financial officer and attorney general is a reinsurer which before the legislation had the authority to write up to nearly &# billion of reinsurance this year reinsurance is coverage that insurers sell to each other to spread risks the new florida law allows citizens property whose board is appointed by state officials to have rates that are lower than those of private carriers under some circumstances previously citizens was required to keep its rates as high or higher than the private market the states separate hurricane fund could end up taking on a larger role in catastrophe reinsurance the u s market for property catastrophe reinsurance is estimated at &# billion to &# billion according to the reinsurance association of america and the hurricane funds reinsurance capacity was increased to as much as &# billion florida is a valuable but risky market for reinsurers because the danger of hurricane damage means the price of reinsurance is high there and profitable when storms dont hit the new law aims to cut consumer rates in part by having the fund offer much of the reinsurance at low prices and requiring insurers to pass on the savings to consumers "its going to change the competitive dynamic in florida theres no question " said chris kise counselor to gov crist some fear the new law could undercut the private reinsurance market but the impact wont be clear until june when many reinsurance contracts for florida are renewed the share prices of several reinsurers fell when the law passed last month but some have since risen the fund itself could buy private reinsurance which could buoy demand for their policies the fund is taking on significant risk it incurred losses of &# billion after the storms of but had a little over &# billion on hand it had to issue bonds to cover the shortfall of &# billion those bonds are being paid back by additional charges on an array of insurance policies sold to consumers and businesses by the end of the coming hurricane season the fund should have about &# billion on hand said its head jack nicholson
