breakingviews financial insight so blackstone won right vornado cedes bid for eop but payoff might fall short for victor given high price vornado realtys withdrawal from the battle for equity office properties trust hands blackstone group boss steve schwarzman the biggest collection of office buildings in the country but he isnt just buying it for cash from a seasoned investor sam zell his rival for eops affections vornado realty boss steve roth is also a world class landlord can blackstone do better than the smartest guys in the property universe it is certainly paying a hefty price to try at &# billion as well as &# billion in debt the cap rate or the yield from rents comes in at around once transaction fees are included that isnt much better than the yield on treasury bills it is also lower than other recent deals including by blackstone which had cap rates closer to vornados unwillingness to top blackstones &# a share offer also raises questions given vornados track record of extracting greater value from its properties than rivals this was a surprise investors had bid eop shares up to &# on expectations that vornado would deliver another couple of dollars it isnt clear why vornado backed off one explanation is that it felt the price just got too high it may also have been the conditions vornado attached to its bid that eop wanted removed yet these moves left the impression that mr zell strongly favored cash over vornados mix of cash and stock which would have left him exposed to commercial real estate during the bidding eop at one point recommended a blackstone offer that once discounted for the time value of money was about cents inferior to a competing offer by vornado still blackstone may have some tricks up its sleeve hours after clinching the deal it lined up the sale of &# billion of individual properties and it could probably shop others to walton street and starwood capital which planned to buy &# billion of assets from vornado blackstone probably also believes it can generate higher returns from the acquired properties than eop did in one of the biggest buyout battles before eop kohlberg kravis roberts nabbed rjr nabisco but its returns suffered mr schwarzman has now snatched the lbo crown whether blackstones investors will reap the riches of this kingdom remains to be seen go shop or no shop go shop" provisions have become a common feature of the lbo landscape these clauses are meant to sound shareholder friendly because they lock in a bidder while allowing a board to beat the bushes for others so how to explain the extra &# billion that eop extracted for shareholders after agreeing to a "no shop" with blackstone in november as the jargon implies a "no shop" limits boards from soliciting rival offers so "go shops" must be better for shareholders right not so fast two of the biggest buyouts of the past year of hospital chain hca and chip maker freescale included "go shop" clauses and in neither case did competitors emerge this is partly why investors regard "go shops" with suspicion they see it as a form of legal cover for independent directors worried they will be perceived as favoring managers buying out the companies they run on the cheap but that leaves the question of how eop despite a "no shop " got such a robust battle going between blackstone and vornado rather more critical to the outcome was the size of the fee that anyone wanting to top blackstones first bid would have had to pay at the outset eop insisted on just a break fee well below the industry standard of as a carrot to blackstone eop ratcheted that up as the private equity firm raised its offer this suggests that whats more important than the shopping label is the intent of directors to seek the highest price and an extra low break fee is a better signal that directors are looking out for shareholders lauren silva rob cox and robert cyran this column is written by breakingviews com an online financial commentary site
