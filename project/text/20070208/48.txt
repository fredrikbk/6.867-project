faulty assumptions in home lending push banks misjudged risk hsbc borrowers fall behind on payments hiring more collectors when the u s housing market was booming hsbc holdings plc raced to join the party sensing opportunity in the bottom end of the mortgage market the giant british bank bet big on borrowers with sketchy credit records such subprime customers have always been risky but hsbc figured it could control that risk in and it bought billions of dollars of subprime loans from other lenders lured by the higher interest rates they carry now the party is over for hsbc and for lots of other bankers who aimed to cash in on the housing boom of the first half of this decade when interest rates ticked up and the market cooled hsbc reached a disconcerting conclusion its systems for screening subprime borrowers and for assessing the default risk they posed were flawed many of those loans have soured sometimes quickly the percentage of hsbc mortgages more than days past due is climbing fraud by borrowers has been higher than expected "we made some decisions that could have been better " says tom detelich the hsbc executive in the u s spearheading an effort to clean up the mortgage portfolio in a surprise announcement late yesterday hsbc said its subprime mortgage problem was worse than previously indicated it said the capital it sets aside to cover all bad debts including the soured mortgages would be or &# billion higher than analysts consensus estimates "the impact of slowing house price growth is being reflected in accelerated delinquency trends across the u s subprime mortgage market particularly in the more recent loans " the bank said hsbcs mortgage woes provide a window into the economic hangover brought on by the end of the housing boom in recent months mortgage bankers have taken a place beside home builders condominium developers and real estate agents all of them struggling to adjust to a new housing landscape london based hsbc the worlds third largest bank by market value and one of the biggest subprime lenders in the u s is one of several lenders to stumble in its dealings with low end borrowers subprime mortgage lending surged over the past several years and these days subprime mortgages comprise about of the roughly &# trillion u s mortgage market up from of the market in late according to first american loanperformance a san francisco research firm seattle based washington mutual inc said last month that its subprime mortgage portfolio suffered in the fourth quarter four smaller mortgage lenders from which hsbc bought loans have disclosed problems carrollton texas based sebring capital said that as of dec it had ceased operations and was no longer accepting loan applications ownit mortgage solutions inc of agoura hills calif filed for bankruptcy court protection just after christmas and fieldstone investment corp and accredited home lenders holding co both public companies have reported disappointing financial results hsbc is working to contain the damage and to persuade investors that it has learned from its mistakes it has hired more people to seek payments from borrowers and has installed an executive schooled in workouts at the worst hit division hsbc mortgage services the troubled subprime mortgages represent only a small slice of hsbcs overall consumer loan portfolio but some analysts attribute the poor performance of hsbcs stock to the weakness of its u s consumer finance operations over the past year its shares have been flat in london trading while the dow jones wilshire global banks index has risen hsbc a year old bank with operations in countries and territories got into the u s consumer finance business in with its &# billion purchase of household international inc household a big subprime lender based in prospect heights ill had been criticized for allegedly predatory lending practices and shortly before the hsbc deal had reached a &# million settlement with state regulators hsbc saw household as a way to diversify beyond europe and asia and viewed subprime mortgage lending as a far less competitive business than lending to more credit worthy customers after the deal was announced households then chief executive william aldinger bragged that household employed ph d s skilled at modeling credit risk household had developed a system for assessing consumer lending risk called the worldwide household international revolving lending system or whirl which it used to underwrite credit card debt and to collect from consumers in the u s united kingdom middle east and mexico the mortgage market in the u s is a complicated web of mutually dependent businesses mortgages are frequently bought and sold several times over and the default risk often lands far from the institution that originated a mortgage banks and mortgage brokers size up would be borrowers and make the loans these lenders sell many of the loans to mortgage wholesalers which gather them into pools and flip them to large financial institutions or banks like hsbc some of these buyers including wall street investment banks package the mortgages as securities for sale to investors a process known as securitization hsbc mortgage services a south carolina based arm of the bank was active in several parts of this web one unit called decision one mortgage co originated mortgages many of them to subprime borrowers hsbc sold some of these loans but it held others as investments collecting the interest income they generated and shouldering the risk of loss if they soured but the old household branch network didnt reach everywhere and hsbc was eager to boost the size of its mortgage business quickly so it became a big buyer of subprime loans originated by others which it held in its own portfolio it purchased loans from approximately wholesale mortgage companies which themselves bought the loans from independent brokers and banks in the main operations of hsbc mortgage services moved from charlotte n c to a new fort mill s c facility which hsbc said offered more space to accommodate expected growth the unit also added to its mortgage processing staff in florida hsbc focused on buying second lien loans also known as piggyback loans they allow home buyers who are unable to scrape together down payment money to borrow it by cobbling together a bigger first mortgage from one lender and a second lien loan often from another home buyers can borrow of the purchase price of a home in the event of default the first mortgage lender has first claim on the property which leaves the second lien lender in a riskier position for that reason second lien loans carry higher interest rates making them potentially more lucrative for lenders hsbc bought lots of mortgages it was the top buyer of loans from fieldstone investment in columbia md a large mortgage originator according to fieldstones securities filings hsbc bought fieldstone mortgages with a face value of &# billion in by march the second lien loans on hsbcs balance sheet totaled &# billion up from &# billion in september bobby mehta hsbcs top executive in the u s said the bank was building its mortgage portfolio in a disciplined manner "weve done them conservatively based on analytics and based on our ability to earn a good return for the risks that we undertake " he told investors in may assessing the quality of big mortgage pools and predicting how many of the loans will go bad is a tricky business typically hsbc would first specify to a mortgage wholesaler what kind of loan pool it was looking for based on the income and credit scores of borrowers then it would send in its analysts to review the portfolio zan hamilton chief executive officer of lime financial in oregon says his mortgage origination firm got used to having hsbc employees hunched over their computers sorting through mortgages for sale trying to ensure they met hsbcs standards some decisions later proved to be mistakes to speed up these purchases from other lenders hsbc accepted loan paperwork that didnt verify whether borrowers made as much as they claimed mortgages that rely on the borrowers word about that are called "stated income" loans more conservative lenders might demand full documentation of income as the real estate market boomed in recent years subprime loans were in hot demand by wall street banks and other investors thanks to the higher interest rates paid by subprime borrowers this competitive market prompted hsbc and others to seek riskier loans from less credit worthy borrowers lenders typically base their calculations of a borrowers credit worthiness on credit ratings known as fico scores which are generated by fair isaac corp of minneapolis fico scores are used to assess applicants for credit cards auto loans and fixed rate mortgages among other things but fico scores had not yet been put to the test in predicting the performance during a weakening housing market of second lien loans taken out by subprime borrowers the same was true for adjustable rate mortgages to subprime borrowers which hsbc also purchased "there was very little data on loans to subprime borrowers where the borrower put very little down " says thomas lawler a housing economist in vienna va chris freemott president of all american mortgage inc in naperville ill says it was a time when "everyone lowered their credit standards" in what he refers to as "a race to the bottom " adds mr hamilton at lime financial "people got way too aggressive in pricing and they werent pricing for the risk " hsbc acknowledges that it erred in the way it assessed such subprime mortgages "what is now clear is that fico scores are less effective or ineffective" when lenders are granting loans in an unusually low interest rate environment douglas flint hsbcs finance director told investors in december a spokesman for fair isaac says the company simply provides credit scores and it is up to lenders to decide how to use them in hsbc stepped up its mortgage buying by early interest rates were rising and home price appreciation was slowing the rate increases made it difficult for some borrowers to lower their monthly payments by refinancing one way that borrowers in a financial pinch try to avoid default some of hsbcs loans turned bad swiftly cynthia soto and her husband frank got a second mortgage from hsbc in may on their grove city ohio home ms soto now years old says she was struggling with disabilities connected to heart troubles and that she needed a kidney removed her husband works at an auto parts plant the sotos wanted the money to pay off credit card debt second mortgages can be risky for lenders because the first mortgage lender has first claim on the home in event of default just one year after getting the &# loan the sotos filed for chapter bankruptcy protection "after raising three kids and having to come down to that it was pretty hard " mrs soto says in bankruptcy court documents the sotos whose first mortgage is also with hsbc maintained that there isnt enough equity in their year old home to cover the second hsbc loan loans that hsbc purchased from other originators also began going bad hsbc for example held the mortgage on radames mendez jr and shana ramoss pennsylvania home bay capital a maryland lender had made the loan in june then transferred it to hsbc according to federal court records by april the borrowers had fallen behind on their payments according to a complaint hsbc filed last september seeking payment of &# in principal due on the mortgage in court papers a local sheriff said hed been unable to locate the couple to serve them with the foreclosure papers mortgage lenders expect to see delinquencies and defaults climb in such an environment and they plan for it but by early hsbc was seeing indications that delinquencies were going to be worse than expected at first hsbc executives say the bank thought the defaults were tied to a change in u s bankruptcy laws in which prompted a spike in bankruptcy filings by consumers but after a few more months of data rolled in hsbc officials concluded they had a broader problem last august hsbc issued a memo to companies from which it was buying loans the paper called "threads of early payment default " reported that delinquencies were rising hsbc said mortgage lenders had seen "a wealth of surprising data" on loans originated in including "surges" in day past due delinquencies particularly on "borrower friendly" second lien loans and "heightened fraud incidents " when borrowers didnt have to verify their incomes the report said they were overstating them and they bolstered their false claims by overstating their job positions hsbc recommended that originators verify employment by phoning human resources departments and asking questions such as "how many years has john worked there " and "what is his title " hsbc has told investors that its second lien loan portfolio represents just of hsbc finance corp s &# billion u s consumer loan portfolio which includes mortgages auto loans and credit card receivables the percentage of loans in that larger pool that are days or more past due rose to at the end of september from three months earlier hsbc is trying to limit the damage last august it installed a new head of hsbc mortgage services mr detelich who had overhauled hsbcs u s consumer lending business after households predatory lending settlement with state regulators hsbc doubled to the number of employees in tampa and nearby brandon who contact customers about missed payments and try to work out payment plans that operation now runs seven days a week hsbc is using computers to try to identify borrowers who will have the most trouble making monthly payments after their adjustable rate mortgages or arms adjust upward this year is expected to be particularly tough for some holders of adjustable rate subprime mortgages holders of arms originated in and and that reset after two years could face monthly payment increases of as much as &# according to fitch ratings that could mean more trouble for hsbc which holds many such loans hsbc is hiring "arm modification specialists" in tampa to help troubled borrowers the bank says it is willing to stop short of jacking up rates as much as it is entitled to if that would help borrowers avoid default but only case by case the bank has stopped making and buying loans where borrower income hasnt been verified and it has raised the fico scores needed for certain loans "ensuring the customer can make payment is good for us and good for the customer " says mr detelich
