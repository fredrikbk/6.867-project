house readies a tax compromise breaks for small business could mollify the senate in minimum wage tussle washington house democrats are preparing a &# billion package of small business tax breaks to be paired with an increase in the federal minimum wage hoping to break a stalemate with the senate over one of their top legislative priorities in doing so the house is likely to avoid many of the revenue increases passed by the senate in its small business tax package increases that have caused heartburn for business groups and lawmakers in both parties the house package is far smaller than the &# billion year package of tax breaks the senate approved last week as part of its minimum wage increase package still it represents a nod by the house to the senates insistence that tax breaks are needed to get republican support sufficient to enact a phased in &# an hour increase in the minimum wage the house ways and means committee is set to consider the package as early as monday which could pave the way for full house action later in the week passage of a tax bill in the house would solve a major procedural issue that had been holding up progress on the minimum wage increase the house package also moves the two chambers closer on substance although many differences remain in january the house easily passed a minimum wage increase without any tax breaks and many democrats there had said the senate ought to do the same the houses tax breaks would be offset with revenue increases house aides said but in a bright spot for business groups the pared down approach means the house will be able to avoid many of the senate passed offsets that businesses are lobbying against such as new limits on the amount an employee could place in certain tax deferred compensation plans some house lawmakers including ways and means chairman charles rangel d n y and rep jim mccrery r la have been leery of the some of the offsets passed by the senate the house package is still in flux house aides said but it will propose from &# billion to &# billion over years in breaks for small businesses affected by the minimum wage increase among the tax sweeteners being considered an extension of a credit for companies that hire disadvantaged workers and an extension of more generous expense write offs another provision the house may consider would use a tax credit to offset the extra income tax that restaurants would pay on workers tips if the minimum wage increases to pay for such changes its also likely the house will look to reduce the so called "tax gap " the amount of revenue the government is legally entitled to collect but doesnt along with the senate passed changes in the tax treatment of executive pay the house is also likely to avoid a restriction on a tax shelter known as a "sale in lease out " or silo transaction in silo transactions a tax exempt entity such as a city government sells property to an investor and then leases the property back for use the investor in turn can take advantage of tax breaks associated with the property that wouldnt benefit the seller the senate restriction would have hit banks that have entered into such transactions
