politics &amp economics u s strives to delay iraqi hanging officials criticize legal procedure fear damage to government credibility u s officials are working to spare saddam husseins former vice president from a rapid trip to the iraqi gallows fearful that his execution following the flawed hangings of mr hussein and a co defendant could further damage the credibility of the american backed government the former vice president taha yassin ramadan was among seven officials including mr hussein convicted in november by the iraqi high tribunal an iraqi run court established by the u s to try members of the ousted regime the trial court imposed a life sentence but an appeals court in december directed that mr ramadan be executed the appeals court offered no legal rationale for the change and legal experts hired by the u s government to advise the iraqi high tribunal say the appeals ruling violated due process legal observers say prosecutors failed to provide direct evidence tying mr ramadan to the specific killings for which he now faces execution and that was a likely reason the trial court declined to order a death sentence "weve had two botched executions " said a senior administration official in washington "we would like to prevent additional debacles " today the united nations high commissioner for human rights louise arbour plans to ask iraqi officials to reconsider the death sentence because of flaws in the appellate process according to a person familiar with the matter a u n representative in baghdad is scheduled to meet today with the iraqi tribunals chief judge aref shahin to deliver a letter detailing ms arbours concerns this person said the ramadan case places the bush administration in a difficult dilemma on the one hand officials fear the bad publicity claims of martyrdom and street violence a questionable execution could provoke yet they also want to avoid appearing to intervene in the iraqi legal system undercutting broader u s attempts to portray iraq as a sovereign nation "theres no question that we have raised concerns with this appeals process " an administration official in washington said adding that the u s uses "funding and other things as leverage" to influence tribunal conduct but "i dont want to substitute our judgment for the judgment of the iraqi courts" or "micromanage the process " the official added on nov mr hussein and two co defendants received death sentences from the trial court and after the appeals chamber rapidly affirmed their verdicts were hanged in a manner widely criticized as vengeful and amateurish the dec hanging was captured on video showing the execution party jeering mr hussein as he stood at the gallows two weeks later mr husseins half brother former secret police chief barzan ibrahim al tikriti was decapitated by his noose the third man was hanged apparently without incident u s officials worry the perfunctory appeals rush to the gallows and gruesome execution footage fueled perceptions that the american backed shiite dominated iraqi government was more interested in vengeance than justice for the ousted sunni regime "they turned him into a martyr " egyptian president hosni mubarak said of mr hussein western officials in baghdad who have worked with the tribunal worry the ramadan case could similarly inflame passions saying it is the latest example of iraqi political interference in the courts proceedings several judges considered too lenient by the government have been removed they say and throughout the trial prime minister nouri al maliki and other officials suggested the verdicts in the trial of mr hussein and his co defendants were a foregone conclusion mr malikis liaison to the tribunal basam ridha said in an interview that the government had not tried to influence the court and that iraqi law allows the appellate chamber to approve harsher sentences than trial courts hand down mr ridha noted that the sole defendant acquitted by the tribunal former baath party official mohammed azawi was released to ensure mr azawis safety "we kept it secret we gave him bodyguards and support to make sure hes ok and that nobody could hurt him " mr ridha said "we let go the guy who was ordered to go free " few doubt that mr ramadan the ten of diamonds in the pack of "most wanted" playing cards given to u s soldiers was involved in atrocities over the years in mr ramadan suggested baghdad and washington settle their differences with a duel he and mr hussein against vice president dick cheney and president bush nevertheless u s officials western legal advisers and human rights observers in baghdad say prosecutors never adequately linked mr ramadan to the killings for which he is now expected to die an execution now they say will foreclose the chance of holding him to account for other crimes where stronger evidence might more clearly justify a capital sentence the trial concerned a retaliatory crackdown on the shiite village of dujail after mr hussein escaped a assassination attempt there evidence showed nearly men died in custody or by execution and some villagers were arrested sent to camps or tortured and much of their property was destroyed dujail was a stronghold of prime minister malikis dawa party mr ramadan headed the popular army a baath party militia that carried out the dujail attacks his conviction apparently was based on the theory of command responsibility in which superiors can be held accountable for the crimes of subordinates the trial chamber scheduled a hearing to confirm the sentence on jan but after u n and u s officials raised concerns that was postponed to feb should the death sentence be confirmed iraqi law provides for an execution within days mr ridha said
