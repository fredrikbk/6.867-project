the daily fix amaechi announces hes gay will active nba player follow john amaechi who played his last nba game nearly four years ago has become the first player in league history to say publicly that he is gay sports columnists ask in response why are you telling us only now and not when you were playing the best answers come from nba players outsports com compiled some of their comments which are outwardly accepting of homosexuality but betray discomfort with the idea of a gay teammate in the locker room shavlik randolph of the philadelphia ers said "as long as you dont bring your gayness on me im fine " more colorfully all star tracy mcgrady said much the same "you could be the most flaming guy on earth and answer to boyfriend and kiss him after the game as long as you dont try it with me " a portland trailblazers player once told oregonian columnist john canzano "if i had a gay teammate id probably just tell him dont be bumping up against me in the showers and leave it at that " presumably most players would let their no bumping policy cross sexual orientation lines as the minneapolis star tribunes steve aschburner was getting reaction from timberwolves guard troy hudson he overheard a player say of mr amaechi "i hope he tells on everybody i want to know " the language would have been more fitting if the nba was an elementary school and being gay was the equivalent of cheating on homework what would happen if an active nba player came out "it would be like an alien dropping down from space " one player said "thered be fear then panic they just wouldnt know how to handle it " who was that player john amaechi speaking in to scotland on sundays mark woods "an openly gay active player would pose security challenges for a league thats been repeatedly embarrassed by ugly exchanges between players and fans " mitch lawrence and michael okeeffe write in the new york daily news "corporate sponsors might be spooked by even the whiff of controversy " the nfl which also hasnt seen an out active player is far from gay friendly cyd zeigler jr president of outsports reported last week that indianapolis colts coach tony dungy a devout christian raises money for the indiana family institute a group whose web site features commentary depicting gays as "trapped by satan in the homosexual lifestyle " and gay groups were angered by a super bowl ad for snickers seeking laughs from the dismay of two men who accidentally kissed baltimore sun columnist david steele wants gay athletes to have their own jackie robinson "if you buy the notion that robinsons integration of the national pastime was the first big wedge in the door to real societal change the way that black entertainers were not then you ought to buy the notion that breaking that barrier for gay athletes today can do the same " mr steele writes there are plenty of out athletes as compiled in a list on outsports but none in the major u s pro leagues john amaechi is no jackie robinson shaun powell writes on newsday "john amaechis admission that he was a gay player in the nba seems courageous except he shouted it from london where he lives in retirement " mr powell writes "thats like challenging the neighborhood bully while backpedaling furiously " mr powell doesnt expect an active out player "whats unlikely to change is the homophobia surrounding the major male dominated sports especially on the professional level asking male athletes to totally shed this mentality is like asking them to stop sweating " and sportslines ray ratto agrees writing "there is not a progression of fights ahead for gay athletes but the same fight fought over and over again in seeming perpetuity acceptance is grudging denial is everywhere and the truth apparently sets nobody free " but san antonio express news columnist buck harvey thinks change is afoot "going by the percentages of society there have probably been several hundred gay men in the history of the nba eventually an active player will cross this same line and there will be a firestorm and things will be said eventually this will come to pass as other issues have eventually this will be as accepted as tony dungy and lovie smith were on sunday until then there will be these snickers moments " whether three indiana pacers were innocent bystanders at a club fight earlier this week or as the police report suggests attacked the clubs manager one local columnist is fed up with the teams behavior the indianapolis stars bob kravitz says pacers management has gotten a free pass despite repeated trouble from its players mr kravitz calls them "the trailpacers " which made the fix laugh "if their names werent donnie walsh and larry bird wed be calling for their heads " mr kravitz writes "if one wasnt a saintly presence with a long record of success and the other wasnt larry legend the official state bird of indiana wed be running them out of town instead the indiana pacers ceo and president get the benefit of the doubt its all jamaal tinsleys fault or marquis daniels fault or the fault of the club manager who kept sticking his face in the way of peoples fists the other night during an incident at the seconds saloon on the westside well no more its time for the pacers owners the simons herb and mel or mel and herb if you prefer to hold donnie and larrys feet to the fire demand accountability for what has become a joke and an embarrassment of an organization " and then this the ultimate dis "at this point id rather be the boston celtics " mr kravitz doesnt mean he wants the no pick college
