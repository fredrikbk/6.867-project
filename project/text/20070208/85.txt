nucor states position on carbon emissions kimberley a strassel "if the cap fits " potomac watch jan incorrectly implies that nucor does not want to limit carbon emissions in the u s but rather advocates protectionist restrictions on foreign products nucor endorses installing the best achievable environmental control technologies and reasonable emissions standards for products sold in the u s whether produced here or abroad and encouraging other countries to adopt similar policies for products sold in their markets alternatively a carbon use tax on products sold in the u s market regardless of origin could serve the same purpose and should be considered simply capping emissions in the u s and allocating licenses among incumbent polluters as is currently being proposed would only instigate political jockeying for preferences among competing u s companies while encouraging manufacturing to leave the u s for china and other developing countries where few reasonable standards are currently enforced this is the current practice in europe while ghg emissions in china are now larger than the european unions and will soon overtake the u s emissions but with a gdp less than one fourth as large attempting to slow or halt global warming by failing to address the global nature of the problem will never be effective global problems require global solutions or something that has a global impact the u s markets are uniquely positioned to provide that global impact steven j rowlan p e director environmental affairs nucor corp charlotte n c
