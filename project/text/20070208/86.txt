palestines house divided at least palestinians were killed last week in gun battles pitting forces loyal to president mahmoud abbass fatah party against members of prime minister ismail haniyehs hamas hundreds more have been killed in this internecine fighting of the last two years most of the killing has taken place in the gaza strip following israels withdrawal of settlers who once were seen as the primary obstacle to palestinian development so much then for the notion that what is mainly needed for an israeli palestinian settlement is a change in israeli policies instead messrs abbas and haniyeh made a diplomatic pilgrimage to mecca yesterday where saudi arabias king abdullah attempted to mediate talks on a unity government good luck with that every previous such effort has collapsed usually within days for king abdullah as for the palestinians the main challenge is not simply to midwife an agreement its the principles of their prospective statehood if the experience of gaza from which israel removed its settlements in demonstrates anything it is that the absence of israeli occupation is not a sufficient condition for a palestinian state the first such condition would be a monopoly on the legitimate use of force that doesnt exist today in the palestinian authority where various militias answer to contending sides of the same government a second condition is that it honor the agreements on which it is based the pa is a creature of the oslo accords which require palestinians to recognize israels right to exist by refusing to do so hamas calls into question the legal basis of the authority itself a third condition is that the state be self governing but prime minister haniyeh answers to hamas supremo khaled mashaal who is based in damascus and was present at yesterdays conference with king abdullah all this raises fundamental questions about the political viability of a palestinian state there are still good reasons for israel eventually to push forward with territorial withdrawals the much maligned security fence which has proved effective in stopping suicide bombers could serve as a de facto border there are also good reasons for the u s to funnel money to mr abbas to boost his political support via fatahs extensive patronage network but the u s must also insist that mr abbas dismantle hamas as a military entity by force if necessary lebanon already provides a depressing example of what happens to a state that tolerates an independent militia such as hezbollah within its borders as with hezbollah iran has now become hamass primary financial and perhaps military backer nor will it help much if a palestinian unity government serves mainly as the fig leaf the international community read europe was looking for to resume aid palestinians were entitled to elect hamas to parliament but that choice hardly obliges the world to support a government part of which is sworn to israels destruction the aid cut off has been the one effective tool in bolstering mr abbas and delegitimizing hamas among palestinians a decade ago it may have been plausible to believe that the answer to the palestinian problem rested in outside hands israel the u s the arab world it is now clear that the deepest problems are of palestinian making that may not be much comfort to diplomats hungry for the next breakthrough but no breakthrough will be worth the effort if the result is a state that cannot govern itself
