my wrestling match with insurance gators in regard to your feb editorial "robin hoods" about the mississippi katrina related insurance litigation state farm did not settle out of fear but because an independent federal judge ruled that the law was not on its side state farm originally ordered engineering reports on the damaged homes of its policyholders in cases where only a slab was left its engineers could not determine what had caused the loss yet state farm totally denied these claims and illegally tried to place the burden on the policyholders to prove what caused the damage the federal judge simply applied mississippi law and held that in an all risk policy such as a homeowners policy that the burden of proof was on the insurer to show exactly what percentage of the excluded peril caused the damage since state farm could not meet the burden of proof it decided to settle shortly after katrina i actually read the dry language in mississippi law that is why i filed the suit not for political gain as you allege i would not have put myself and my family in the vortex of this storm simply for politics i gained a couple of years worth of grey hair and my familys christmas was dampened while i was locked in a death roll with an alligator during several months of negotiations the thought of my fellow mississippians still living in tiny metal fema trailers during the holidays is encouragement enough for me to fight to hold the insurance companies accountable i settled the case because i wanted to stabilize our insurance market and rebuilding efforts however unless allstate nationwide usaa farm bureau and other companies settle in the next few weeks then we will be given no choice but to continue our state court action to hold them accountable in the future before you again act like the sheriff of nottingham you might do well to at least check with friar tuck before blaming robin hood jim hood attorney general state of mississippi jackson miss
