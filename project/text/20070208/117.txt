the morning brief hedging on hope with north korea the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here as talks resumed today in beijing there was more optimism about a possible deal for the u s north korea and their negotiating partners than at any time since a nominal breakthrough fell apart in but the repeated eruptions of mutual distrust over the past six years have bolstered the skepticism that will greet any signs of a deal north korean rhetoric has the biggest reputation for capriciousness in the diplomatic realm yet kim kye gwan the envoy from pyongyang was treated as a possible messenger of hope when he expressed a readiness to discuss "first stage measures" for a deal on the norths atomic weapons program chris hill the u s assistant secretary of state nursing the talks since the standoff began said he sensed "a real desire" for progress among the north koreans u s officials tell the wall street journal theyre cautiously optimistic north korea will agree to shut down its plutonium enriching yongbyon reactor in exchange for economic aid from the u s china japan russia and south korea and as the new york times reports two respected american envoys returned from pyongyang last weekend suggesting north korea was prepared for such a deal especially if washington agreed to lift financial sanctions approved by the united nations after the norths nuclear bomb test last october so why after all this time and hostile suspicion voiced from both sides does progress look achievable this winters food crisis in north korea seems to be particularly fierce especially with the onset of new economic sanctions and south korean aid agencies tell the journal that food rations last month in pyongyang amounted to three days of rice for ordinary citizens and days for the elite the rest of the country is generally in poorer shape than the capital such desperation hasnt been enough to force concessions in the past and both south korea and china see it in their interest to help keep north korea fed still the north korean leadership has reportedly been upset about the tightening banking and cash flow restrictions imposed by the u s aimed especially at a macau bank accused of laundering counterfeit dollars on behalf of pyongyangs black market activities this could be a key bargaining point for mr hill if the white house is willing to yield but it could take a lot more than that to make north korea give up its sole lever of global power the bigger changes have taken place in washington where as the journal notes "the election of a democratic congress and the departures of john bolton the ambassador to the united nations and defense secretary donald rumsfeld both of whom took a hard line against north korea have given moderates in the state department more leeway to compromise " u s international clout needed for a host of crises these days has been significantly weakened by the war in iraq and some kind of deal with north korea especially one favored by china and russia could buy washington more cooperation on the nuclear negotiation front with iran the biggest question is whether the bush administration is willing to relax its rhetoric and demands enough to let leaders in pyongyang grow comfortable with nuclear concessions recent white house decisions on iraq and some on iran have suggested administration hawks may still have the final say a record intersection of real estate and private equity and so the bidding for equity office properties trust is over with blackstone groups &# billion offer sealing the largest private equity buyout ever in a deal now being dissected as an object lesson for american finance to the chicago tribune the drama of blackstones victory over vornado realty trust which bowed out yesterday in the contest for the largest owner of u s office buildings "illustrates the continuing allure of real

deal "will send ripples through the real estate world with a good chance it will raise the ceiling on already record prices " the new control of prime properties will likely put blackstone "in position to demand prices on its individual buildings high enough" to justify the increase over its original bid the journal adds and the new york times notes the deal is yet another example of one of the hottest trends in deal making the "growing power of private money " blackstone and its private equity counterparts have accumulated huge war chests and "even now blackstone is raising a new &#
