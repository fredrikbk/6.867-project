mortgage refinancing gets tougher as adjustable loans reset at higher rates homeowners find themselves stuck due to prepayment penalties tighter credit with rates on many homeowners adjustable rate mortgages rising some who would like to refinance into a new loan are finding they cant in some cases that is because their loan carries a prepayment penalty which would force them to come up with thousands of dollars if they refinance in the first few years such penalties are common with so called option adjustable rate mortgages which typically carry a low teaser rate that rises sharply after an introductory period other borrowers are getting caught short by a changing housing market one in which home prices have flattened and lenders are beginning to tighten their standards after a long period of making mortgages easier and easier to get the challenges are greatest for homeowners whose credit has declined since they took out their last loan and for those who have little if any equity some of these borrowers are still able to refinance but are finding it more costly than they expected these new challenges come at a time when many borrowers who took out adjustable rate mortgages are facing higher payments there are about &# trillion to &# trillion in arms that will face rate increases this year according to the mortgage bankers association the mba expects borrowers to refinance as much as &# billion of those mortgages "the decrease in property values combined with prepayment penalties is making it very challenging for people to get out of these loans " says ed shanks an executive vice president with u s bank home mortgage a unit of u s bancorp u s bank is seeing more loans fall through particularly in markets such as arizona california colorado and ohio where home values have softened it could be "the tip of the iceberg " mr shanks says in recent years many homeowners refinanced repeatedly to get a better rate lower their payment consolidate debt or pull out cash even now mortgage rates remain relatively attractive though they have moved up from their recent lows in early december and most borrowers still should be able to take advantage of them the challenges for homeowners could increase if lenders continue to tighten standards and the housing market remains soft antonio papa a construction worker took out an option arm with a introductory rate in on a second home he owns in jupiter fla the rate jumped to in september and has since climbed to "i was looking to refinance to have more stability " he says he has decided to hold off because his option arm carries a prepayment penalty that would force him to pay six months of interest if he refinances within the first three years mortgage brokers often receive higher payouts for putting borrowers into a loan with a prepayment penalty says person name "barrett sandra"sandra barrett a loan officer in palm beach gardens fla who was working with mr papa prepayment penalties are most common with option arms and loans made to borrowers with scuffed credit some of option arm loans made last year carried a prepayment penalty according to an analysis by ubs ag that looked at mortgages that were packaged into securities and sold to investors the challenges facing borrowers are becoming more apparent at a time when opportunities for refinancing are narrowing rates on year fixed rate mortgages dropped to their lowest levels in months in december but have recently drifted higher rates on year fixed rate loans currently average according to hsh associates in pompton plains n j up from in early december "the best deals in going from an arm to a fixed rate are passing " says doug duncan chief economist at the mortgage bankers association "if anything rates are likely to move up rather than down " meanwhile there are signs that some lenders are beginning to tighten their standards the shift comes after a long period of liberal lending practices that made it easy for borrowers to finance of a homes value or get a mortgage without documenting their income and assets in a survey released monday by the federal reserve board roughly of domestic banks reported that they had tightened credit standards on residential mortgage loans in the past three months the highest share since the early s this month wells fargo &amp co will begin reducing by the maximum amount it will lend to certain riskier borrowers in "declining" markets those markets covering more than counties in two dozen states include parts of california florida michigan and ohio the change "reflects the tighter requirements of our investors " a wells spokesman says "i think all lenders are experiencing this kind of tightening of credit standards " investors who buy mortgage backed securities have been growing more concerned about credit quality as defaults have increased citimortgage a unit of citigroup inc last month began requiring that borrowers who take out a "stated income" loan sign an affidavit attesting to the fact that information about their income in the application is accurate and hasnt been modified by their mortgage broker or loan officer the change is designed "to protect the borrower as well as the lender " because borrowers may have trouble repaying the loan if their income is overstated a company spokesman says on jan fannie mae the government sponsored mortgage finance company tightened its standards for so called interest only loans which let borrowers pay interest and no principal in the loans early years other homeowners are being flummoxed by lower appraisals those most likely to be affected bought a home or refinanced in the past year or two and have little if any equity "the block to refinancing is mainly located in those areas of the u s where there is little or no appreciation " says peter lansing a mortgage banker in denver michelle thompson a medical claims associate in north glenn colo pulled out &# when she refinanced her mortgage last year boosting her loan to &# she would like to refinance again in order to lower her monthly payment but when she went to apply for a new loan she discovered that her mortgage debt

their primary homes in order to pay down a portion of the debt on an investment property and be approved for a refinancing other borrowers have had to take a mortgage with a higher interest rate because their high debt load makes them a less attractive borrower some borrowers facing prepayment penalties are sitting on the sidelines for now david lorentz a high school teacher in san francisco recently tried to refinance the option arm on a four unit apartment building he owns as an investment he wanted to pull out cash to pay for renovations and college tuition for his children but found
