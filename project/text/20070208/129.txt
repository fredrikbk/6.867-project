plans to retire at the end of this year capping a tenure at the australian mining and oil giant marked by surging profits amid a world wide boom in commodities underscoring the flush times mr goodyear also unveiled a rise in fiscal first half net income and a &# billion share buyback that cheered investors industry observers said the buyback also underscores a quandary faced by bhp and other miners and shared by other natural resource companies some have struggled to launch large new mining projects because they face increasing competition to secure supplies inflation for everything from labor to equipment and foreign governments angling for increasing stakes in projects within their borders that has contributed to higher costs for developing properties at what some investors say is a relatively late point in the commodities boom leaving some companies with fewer options for spending their growing cash piles also many resource rich countries such as indonesia and mongolia are taking a long time to provide regulatory approval for new projects forcing miners to delay some of their most promising assets analysts said bhp will want a chief executive who can find the next major growth target "the company needs to move into more of a growth phase with potentially a higher risk profile " said rob clifford an analyst with abn amro "it is about getting someone who has the personality to do that " morgan stanley analyst craig campbell said that while the share repurchase doesnt rule out major acquisitions by bhp it could signal none are planned in the near future mr goodyear brushed aside suggestions the hefty return of funds will limit bhps ability to pursue sizable acquisitions and said his impending departure wont be a barrier to deal making "with regard to significant m&amp a it is by no means on hold " he said bhp said there are strong internal candidates for the job with some analysts suggesting south african born divisional chief marius kloppers as a likely successor chris lynch a bhp board member alongside mr kloppers and mr goodyear who was also identified by industry observers as a candidate has held the purse strings as chief financial officer mr kloppers in a media briefing in cape town south africa said "i havent thought about it its too fresh " mr lynch couldnt be reached mr goodyear said the board will also consider external candidates

copper zinc and coal despite expectations of moderating global economic growth mr goodyear said rapid growth in china india brazil and russia coupled with steady growth in japan and europe has eased fears that a slowdown in the u s could crimp demand and force commodity prices down "a u s slowdown doesnt have the same impact on resource demand that it might have had or years ago and it does illustrate the potential that we see coming from emerging countries " he said mr goodyear who succeeded brian gilbertson as chief executive in january has presided over rapid profit growth and orchestrated the &# billion acquisition of uranium and base metals miner wmc resources analysts said the change of management is well timed and the new chief executive is expected to have a mandate from the board to aggressively pursue new growth options although many analysts believe commodity prices are likely to remain above their historical averages for some time to come prices for some key bhp billiton products like copper have fallen significantly from their recent highs meanwhile mining companies costs remain high as shortages of tires trucks and skilled workers persist that means that profit margins for some miners could be squeezed in the coming year if commodity prices dont snap back "you cant continually just conduct buybacks with huge amounts of cash you have got to look
