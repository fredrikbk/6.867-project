a cultural conversation with rebecca w rimel a foundation head central to the philadelphia story theres a word for people like rebecca w rimel especially when its used and pronounced the way the french apply it to a certain kind of woman formidable ms rimel has led the pew charitable trusts since with some &# billion in assets the pew a legacy of the family that started sun oil expects to disburse almost &# million this fiscal year by any standard it would be a heavyweight in the foundation world except that the pew is no longer a grant giving foundation in it transformed itself into a public charity putting itself into the program business enabling it to spend sizable sums on lobbying and enhancing its power in recent months ms rimel pronounced rhyme el has been at the center of two controversial cultural initiatives with the pews &# million contribution to a &# million campaign she led the way for the famed barnes foundation to move from the suburbs where visitors have been limited and restricted to three days a week into a new gallery in central philadelphia more recently with the pews &# million contribution ms rimel helped rescue thomas eakinss masterpiece "the gross clinic " from the clutches of alice waltons crystal bridges museum in arkansas and the national gallery of art in washington which had agreed to purchase the painting from thomas jefferson university for &# million some critics including one who called the barnes move a "takeover " see hypocrisy in the two ventures while the pew and its partners intervened to entrench one painting in the city they deliberately snatched the barnes collection from its idiosyncratic home in merion pa ignoring the intent of its founder dr albert c barnes as soon as i arrived in her modern th floor aerie in philadelphia ms rimel started in on what may be her favorite subject her adopted city shes from charlottesville va but has been with the pew since the message she exudes contrary to those critics is "its not about me its about philadelphia " ms rimel sees culture as one way the city of brotherly love which has slowly been rising from its beaten down past will thrive again "philadelphia will keep its nose up if it has more product to offer " she says she envisions a day when art lovers will plan visits to philadelphia and make side trips to new york instead of vice versa the metropolitan museum of art and the museum of modern art are rich she concedes "but there is no collection like the barnes collection " which can boast of one of the largest collections of impressionist post impressionist and modern paintings in the world among its treasures are cezannes picassos and matisses including his masterpiece "bonheur de vivre " its that kind of thinking that led the pew under ms rimel to intercede with the barnes and the eakins "both will be accessible to more people " she explained "ultimately my board and i believe that art in the public domain ought to be accessible to all who want to see it " so relocating the barnes which was broke is a source of pride with no reservations dr barnes ms rimel said wanted the collection to be accessible to "plain folk " and she added he wrote an "if all else fails" clause which suggested that if ever his restrictions made life for the barnes impossible the collection could be moved to philadelphia ms rimel called the idea of a pew takeover "nonsense " rather than control the barnes "we are passing the baton to the barnes which is building a national board " she said the barnes initiative also laid the foundations for "the gross clinic" maneuver as had a previous rescue a few years ago the pew had stopped the departure of "dream garden " a mosaic created by maxfield parrish and louis comfort tiffany to las vegas helping the pennsylvania academy of fine arts buy it when the sale of "the gross clinic" was announced ms rimel got on the phone and "called my partners" from the barnes bailout chiefly the annenberg foundation the lenfest foundation and the neubauer family foundation "it was all hands on deck " she said within weeks they raised about half the &# million and arranged a bridge loan for the rest ms rimel agreed that other communities may well have to grapple with the same issue "we have to help people realize that the benefit to risk ratio of having these riches and marketing them instead of monetizing them is higher " she said the pew is no stranger to cultural ambitions as recently as it announced an unprecedented plan to invest &# million to develop a national cultural policy on issues like arts financing arts education intellectual property rights and zoning in historical areas when the stock market went to pieces however the pew retreated deploying its reduced cultural spending almost exclusively in philadelphia it has remained near of the pews own spending down from double digits but less than that if donor committed funds are considered money pledged for the barnes and the eakins is part of "special projects " not core culture "now we are coming back out the other end " ms rimel said but the pew is not returning to a cultural policy initiative instead for example "were taking national the pennsylvania cultural data project " that initiative which streamlined the grant making process of many funders statewide with common application forms also produces standardized operating data from cultural institutions that help guide programming and policy making "we are in discussions with four other states " ms rimel said including california "well run it but they pay the costs this is our first foray back into the cultural policy arena " the pew was instrumental in the development of phillyfunguide com which centralizes information about arts and humanities programs and provides access to discounted tickets noting the proliferation of performing arts groups ms rimel said she may attempt to encourage stretched groups to share services ms rimels eyes light up when she mentions another initiative under study a subsidized "arts train" that would offer visitors to philadelphia amenities like hors doeuvres while they traveled to a package of cultural activities for say &# the pews new status as a public charity may help here because the pew is seeking corporate partners for the arts train in fact while critics of the change focused on the pews new lobbying capacity the more potent weapon may be its new fund raising ability in the past three years a diverse group of about corporations foundations and individuals have given the pew about &# million for programs ms rimel thinks this "smart outsourcing" is one way philanthropy will evolve it saves on the creation of infrastructure and minimizes the learning curve inherent in giving away money fruitfully and by the way she notes the pew did this after a few years of study and petitions to the irs in long before warren buffett decided to give his fortune to the bill and melinda gates foundation for efficiency reasons "we didnt know if anyone would knock on the door or if everyone would " ms rimel said "we are wowed by the size of it " this year the pew plans to undertake a review to "determine if this should grow weve had no marketing its all word of mouth " ms rimel is not interested in just growth though the pew has turned down gifts that could not be put to good use in one case for example the cause was noble but "the issue was not winnable " she said even after the would be donor offered to up the ante she does not want to get "off mission " to go where the money is for her its all about victory ms dobrzynski is a writer in new york
