home &amp family cranky consumer casting for a smooth translation online language services offer assistance avoiding a wince special to the wsj science fiction writer douglas adams envisioned a world where translation of any language is possible by putting a small fish in ones ear until that day comes a rising number of translation services are available on the web knowing how to at least make an effort to communicate in another language as part of business protocol is an essential skill especially for the estimated million americans employed by foreign owned firms and the many more working for u s companies that do business abroad but seriously who really has time for language classes to see if we could come up with a translation that wouldnt make a foreign speaking business associate wince or break into hysterics we wrote a sample word business invitation in english and ran it through five language services we threw in a few linguistic curve balls by using slang expressions like "shindig" and "crash course " the document was translated into chinese japanese german spanish russian and where available arabic the two free services we tried babelfish altavista com and www google com language tools both use software to translate text instantly without a human or fish involved the alta vista babel fish offers translations between pairs of languages including chinese japanese and all major european languages but no arabic you just copy and paste a document into a text box and choose the original language and desired language from a pull down menu the babel fish help section says users can translate up to words at a time although we translated more than words at a time but despite the word limit users can translate as many blocks of text as they wish although cutting and pasting a lengthy document would eat up time google language tools has the same simple interface but no specified word limit and a test version of arabic translation software but no russian both sites translated our invitation to come and eat "dogs" as just that and transliterated words such as "barbecue" rather than finding an equivalent although they both claim to be only a rough guide our in house experts found both sites ranged from "pretty poor" to "laughable" and much too literal to make sense to a business contact translatorsbase com is basically an online marketplace to connect clients in need of translators and free lance translators looking for work clients register with the site and post descriptions of jobs and translators apply for them setting their own fees there is a word minimum for each project posted and fees vary from four cents a word for spanish to a flat fee of &# for japanese and &# for russian we received up to emails for applicants for each project within minutes of posting it clients must pay translators individually so it is important to see what form of payment an applicant accepts or you may end up sending cash to mongolia before a project can go ahead we had many offers from translators for future jobs and more exotic languages no thanks for businesses with a one off project this approach is a little time consuming but the site has a lot to offer for those who are looking to find a steady and reliable translator who is willing to learn their company jargon and negotiate an acceptable rate because this site is a clearing house for translators the quality of work can vary substantially our japanese translation had us "begging for sweets" instead of trick or treating and was generally the poorest of the human translations but the spanish translation scored higher marks despite careless mistakes such as misspelling the signature asetquality com offers free quotes online but a company representative called to discuss the project rather than check it out online the usual per project fee starts at &# but because our project was only words she offered to have our invitation translated into five different languages for &# there was no extra charge for a variety of formats and a representative followed up to make sure we could access the finished translations asetquality produced consistently good translations and their japanese work was the only one to correctly translate trick or treat but the arabic translation closed using the masculine adjective for the writer who is female freetranslation com owned by sdl international offers both software based translation services and on staff translators you can have up to words at a time translated free or become platinum club members for &# a year and be able to have up to words translated at once sdl international also offers professional translation services and when users paste text into the free translation box they are also given a price for a professional one users who choose a human translation complete a registration form and then upload microsoft word documents mac documents did not appear to work for an instant quote fees ranged from &# to &# for common business languages with russian the cheapest and traditional chinese the most expensive the company provided the translations as both word documents and pdf files and followed up with us later our own translators characterized the software translation as "useless but hilarious" but the translations by actual people scored the highest marks of all avoiding slang and using well chosen synonyms sarmad ali marina cronk peter landers li yuan and merve zefer contributed to this article write cranky wsj com web site cost freetranslation com free software translation up to words at a time &# a year for up to words at once or individual human translations priced per word count format options translators deliver any format requested
