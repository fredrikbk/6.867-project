senators debate wireless network for safety workers emergency workers have long complained that their communications systems are outdated and underfunded now convinced that the federal government alone cant answer their concerns public safety groups are turning to commercial wireless companies for help first responders cant always communicate with each other during major disasters because their telecom equipment is incompatible with that of other agencies whats more much of the equipment is both expensive and out of date in some cases police agencies are paying &# each for two way radio devices to improve communications among emergency workers cyren call a mclean va company launched by nextel communications founder morgan obrien has been lobbying feverishly for a plan to involve the private sector in public safety upgrades under the plan a slice of the radio spectrum would be reserved for public safety use and licensed to an entity called a public safety broadband trust a private bidder would be selected to manage the creation of a broadband network shared by consumer cellphone users and public safety workers such as firemen and policemen in an emergency public safety users would take precedence small rural operators would pay to build out the infrastructure in exchange they would be able to offer services over frequencies they didnt have to pay for the new congress is taking a hard look at the idea republican presidential contender sen john mccain of arizona announced plans to introduce legislation that would take a similar approach today the senate commerce committee is planning to hold a hearing to consider it and senate staffers say it has support from some top democrats but getting any legislation through a divided congress this year will be difficult especially given the controversy the plan is generating in the wireless industry critics say it amounts to a corporate giveaway to cyren call there are better ways to go about improving public safety communications they say without setting aside valuable frequencies for public safety use the debate highlights how coveted radio spectrum is in the u s wireless industry which now services more than million cellphone customers to acquire a license for such spectrum cellphone companies have to bid in auctions that the government holds from time to time putting down billions of dollars so they can provide coverage for more users and offer new services such as web access they say the obrien plan will sap auction revenue for the government to counter that argument mr obrien proposes that the trust pay the u s treasury &# billion up front for the spectrum by raising private capital through government backed loan guarantees the trust would recoup that cost over time by taking a share of revenue from the commercial wireless operators the network manager cyren call if mr obrien has his way would get a cut of the proceeds the large cellphone operators including verizon wireless a joint venture of verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc at&amp t inc s wireless unit and sprint nextel corp all declined to comment on mr obriens proposal but said they support improving public safety communications but industry lobbyists particularly verizons are fighting cyren calls plan ferociously people familiar with the matter say giving the issue urgency is the timetable for the federal communications commissions next major spectrum auction which could come as soon as august and no later than next january unless congress enacts legislation before the auction along the lines proposed by sen mccain the plan backed by mr obrien will die because the sought after slice of the airwaves will have been licensed to commercial operators mr obriens plan fell flat at the fcc but his lobbying of congress appears to be paying dividends public safety groups have generally embraced the cyren call proposal "it provides public safety with the access to the spectrum it needs but doesnt deny the use for other purposes " says robert gurss lobbyist for the association of public safety communications officials international still the idea of sidestepping auctions displeases watchdog groups "we favor the auction process " says thomas schatz president of the nonpartisan citizens against government waste none of the major cellphone companies are testifying at todays hearing but their trade group ctia the wireless association is sending steve largent its president and chief executive officer in a statement last week jot carpenter the groups vice president for government affairs said public safety groups have enough spectrum to serve their roughly four million users nationally "more spectrum is clearly not the answer " he said
