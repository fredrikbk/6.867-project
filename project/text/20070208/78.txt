for the first trans atlantic stock exchange company in the next few weeks euronext investors are expected to vote to swap their shares for a piece of the new company nyse euronext inc with management in both new york and paris the two exchanges current bases nyse officials expect the deal to close in late march or april creating a &# billion company that will for the first time link two big stock exchange firms a move the two companies hope will make trading easier for customers and rack up larger profits for shareholders "we are in the middle of a pretty massive transformation " said nyse chief financial officer nelson chai the new company with about employees will list shares of of the largest companies in the world ranked by market value including general electric co and total sa it will be a major player in the fast expanding futures and options markets or "derivatives" whose contracts derive value from other instruments such as bonds and commodities jean francois theodore the head of euronext will oversee the new companys international operations but nyse chief executive john thain has been pushing his own international agenda by pursuing more global deals in january nyse expanded its alliance with the tokyo stock exchange and agreed to pay &# million for of indias national stock exchange nyse would also like to expand further in china the integration of the nyse and euronext will take time and users will have to be won over one big worry trading glitches common when two firms merge may scare away customers this issue will be critical for nyse euronext which as with all exchanges relies on technology savvy traders using it the nyse faces competition from rivals such as the nasdaq stock market and the london stock exchange derivatives markets such as chicago mercantile exchange holdings inc as well as from upstart platforms launched by big brokerage firms looking to handle more client trades internally "generally trans atlantic deals fall short of their goals because of the complexity of integrating across cultures and time zones " said roger freeman an analyst with lehman brothers holdings inc who follows exchanges and has a "hold" rating on nyse shares still he said "these two businesses even without substantial integration can grow nicely side by side " under the new companys management both home continents will be represented by directors the chief executive of the company will be american but only when the chairman is european the companys major markets new york paris london and amsterdam will continue to maintain some independence in policing their exchanges a nod to national regulators who still have jurisdiction in their own backyards despite some international efforts to cooperate more the two exchanges offer largely different products on different sides of the atlantic and they also use different technology systems to match trades they hope to merge those systems a move that will translate into an estimated &# million in cost savings by most of the savings will come from slashing the number of electronic trade matching platforms it manages to two from six meanwhile nyse euronext hopes to expand its revenue by encouraging more cross border trading and creating products in hot areas such as exchange traded funds derivative contracts based on corporate credit and real time market data that can be sold to hedge funds and wall street trading desks analysts expect nyse euronext to encourage global companies to list their shares on both nyse and euronext especially when those companies already have investors in the u s and are subject to u s securities rules nyse euronext hopes the new combination will stem gains by the london stock exchange in listing international companies who fear the often tougher u s regulatory climate in europe the new company will push to make it easier for individuals to buy shares of u s listed companies which in turn could expand the shareholder base of blue chip u s companies "it is really becoming a global platform " said peter horowitz a managing director at consultancy bearingpoint inc s financial services practice which doesnt work for either exchange "this will make getting exposure to international issuers a lot easier " nyse president and co chief operating officer jerry putnam has said the companys plans to merge systems and data centers would likely take as long as three years lehmans mr freeman said this area is the clearest path to increased profits for nyse euronext encouraging more trading and cross listing another way nyse euronext hopes to make money could be more difficult he said nyse went public through a march merger with electronic exchange archipelago holdings inc and it continues to work on improving its own system that marries electronic trading with the big boards centuries old floor trading system nyse euronexts other priorities include expanding its derivatives business where it could run into competition from the chicago merc cme has dominated the trading of u s financial futures and agreed to buy rival cbot holdings inc parent of the chicago board of trade in a deal that will create a company valued at &# billion it will be tough to take business from the chicago exchanges in their established futures contracts big board officials admit still if nyse euronext is able to expand its derivatives business in europe and create new exchange sponsored derivative products it could become a force in this lucrative corner of wall street "if you look at the growth in derivatives its obviously an opportunity that cant be ignored " said brad bailey senior analyst at technology research company aite group llc which doesnt rate stocks nyse euronext will have to be mindful of not alienating the brokerage firms that send trading business its way for more than a century financial exchanges were owned by brokerage firms and operated as not for profit cooperatives now that exchanges are shareholder owned and profit driven they have in some instances raised trading fees which has ruffled feathers on wall street at the same time faster trading and easier access to foreign markets could ease the tension the exchanges "overall play is looking for scale across time zones across products across currencies " said aites mr bailey "for global investment managers it will make it easier for them to find opportunities "
