fashion journal how fashion makes its way from the runway to the rack j c penneys trend director interprets style for the masses it is all about the turtleneck in a quiet windowless conference room in plano texas cyndie washburn nester huddles over a computer screen scrutinizing designer clothing on the new york runways more than miles away focusing on trends for fall she zeroes in on womens turtlenecks "when you look at the fall runway there are a few cardigans " she says scrolling through style web sites showing images of runway models at new york fashion week after looking through collections by designers such as nanette lepore oscar de la renta abaete and alice roi ms nester sees a definite trend "certainly it is all about the turtleneck " ms nester is trend director for womens apparel at j c penney co the countrys third largest department store with &# billion in revenue last year her observations of trends from new yorks eight day fashion week are an important link in the fashion food chain its ms nesters job to filter out all the high fashion noise and figure out which styles will play to the mainstream middle income shoppers at penneys stores "these cute jumper dresses were seeing on the runway with so many pinafores the turtleneck really looks cute under all of those styles " she says trend spotters at penney rivals such as dillards inc kohls corp wal mart stores inc and target corp are also monitoring new yorks runway shows this week to see where styles are heading because they dont buy designer collections these mass market apparel stores generally arent invited to see the designer runway collections live in new york instead they comb through style web sites from style com to new york magazines nymag com to see the trends in real time next week penneys trend forecasters will more closely review the runway looks using two online sites wgsn and style sight the sites allow them to screen all clothing of a particular type that was shown on the runways and lets them zero in on say every jumpsuit jean and jacket that appeared on the runway monitoring runway trends has become increasingly important for mass retailers as consumers have become more fashion savvy and demanding and retailers compete to grab a bigger slice of the upper middle fashion market with "cheap chic" looks as recently as years ago penney and other mass retailers waited as long as two years after runway fashions arrived in department stores before their customers would expect to see similar looks but the internet and the arrival of fast fashion retailers such as swedish clothier hennes &amp mauritz ab known as h&amp m and zara in the u s has forced american retailers to speed up the entire fashion cycle penneys goal now is to have its own stylish goods in stores at the same time as corresponding runway looks are sold in exclusive boutiques under ceo mike ullman penney has made shortening its turnaround time from sketch to store delivery a priority if it pushes hard it can get new fashion inspired merchandise into its stores in as little as days more typically its turnaround time is weeks penneys goal is to get the average cycle down to weeks the average for fast fashion retailers such as h&amp m last year penney doubled the number of its in house designers to it also created a trend team in june it recruited ms nester former fashion director at retail brand alliance the parent company of brooks brothers and adrienne vittadini and a year ago it hired karolyn wangstad a year fashion veteran who pioneered the trend effort at target and spent the last five years at saks inc the chain now creates roughly items of clothing a year roughly half for women the stakes are high penney says of its revenue now is from sales of apparel and other goods it creates in house the consequences of misreading a trend mean bigger markdowns on clothing and lower margins some large retailers are putting to of their clothing on a fast fashion cycle hoping it will move quickly but "it is more expensive to deliver and you can run into a problem bringing in the wrong trend " says erika serow partner at bain &amp co consultancy in new york this week penney was putting finishing touches on its early fall clothing which will ship to stores in august the company had already made the risky bet that turtlenecks would reign over crewnecks and other shirt styles as the quintessential layering piece for fall it is planning to present the style in a multitude of colors with prominent floor space and plenty of plugs online but monday a top penney executive asked ms nester for confirmation that turtlenecks would appeal to shoppers even in a warm month like august "we do a very limited number of styles and buy them in a big way it really needs to be right " ms nester says she and ms wangstad stayed glued to the internet to get clues from the shows if they were wrong about turtlenecks there was still time to make adjustments for the second round of fall clothing that will hit stores in october "we really have to pick our shots " ms nester says "what are the most important things what can we capitalize on " penneys initial hunch that turtlenecks might be big for fall came last august when ms nester and ms wangstad surveyed trend services such as esp trendlab and doneger group as well as their own "runway recap" book which showcase key runway looks for fall the recap photos are arranged in terms of colors and styles and mix looks from dkny chaiken and jeremy laing among others as well as styles shown on the runways in new york milan and even brazil what they noticed was a proliferation of collarless jackets as well as a strong "gentry english country" look including tailored jackets plaids and tweeds both of which suggested that turtlenecks would be big in january ms wangstad reviewed images from the haute couture collections in paris these made to order pieces created by hand by design houses such as jean paul gaultier and christian dior can sell for more than &# for a dress while out of reach for most penney consumers the styles nevertheless set important trends after surveying the couture collections of mr gaultier and others ms wangstad decided penney should move fast to have a short sleeved turtleneck in stores as a transition piece for fall not all of her inspiration comes from the runways penney sales data from last fall showed that shoppers were buying lots of sweaters with a dolman sleeve a full sleeve that is very wide at the armhole and narrow at the wrist and ms wangstad thought that look would be popular in a turtleneck version too the result is that penney would carry at least three turtleneck looks a fine gauge a short sleeve and a dolman ms wangstad and ms nester also attend trade shows and subscribe to a number of trend services that monitor street fashion around the world "there are so many points of inspiration lifestyle style preferences and the latest greatest hottest place " ms wangstad says she recently went with a staff member to sweden to watch what teens there are wearing as research for penneys junior line "its a denim culture " she says where she gleans ideas for new washes new details and fits she is also planning a trip to sydney australia and montreal among other places to monitor what teens there are wearing on sunday ms wangstad was getting a pedicure when she got a call from barbara fields a los angeles trend consultant who had just returned from tokyo "she said oh karolyn you must own turtlenecks " ms wangstad recalled ms fields had spotted lightweight turtlenecks as the layering piece of choice for teens on the streets of tokyo on monday browsing through a donegar trend book ms wangstad pointed to high waisted pants ms fields the consultant had told her "those pants were all over tokyo " putting two and two together ms nester said she had also seen high waisted skirts on the runways this week "no more muffin tops " she said referring to the belly rolls that low cut pants tend to display penney plans to have at least one new high waist pant look for the fall and is moving some of the waists up in skirts to go with shorter jackets in addition to the turtlenecks ms nester was also looking for other fall trends from new yorks fashion week she closely monitored skirt and shorts hemlines noticing a lot of very short lengths often worn with tights "were seeing lengths really rise " she said while not for the older penney customer the trend might translate for its mixit brand aimed at young women "with a nightlife " while looking at jackets from carolina herrera diane von furstenberg and others ms nester notices many are cut above the hip "sure there are some boyfriend jackets and well keep an eye on that but they are few and far between " she notes confirming her notions about where styles are heading in most cases "its short " by wednesday ms nester said she felt somewhat reassured by the turtlenecks on the runway the clincher when trend setter marc jacobs sent turtlenecks down the runway to accompany his tailored coat jackets monday night "his collection looks different it is classically derived " ms nester said yesterday "it really makes me feel great the message is you are right on target were on the same page "
