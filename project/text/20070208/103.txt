scoping out the hunting gear harrisburg pa to quickly understand the focus and political tenor of the eastern sports and outdoor show all you have to do is pass by the booth selling t shirts that read "theres room for all gods creatures right next to my mashed potatoes " needless to say peta and greenpeace are not exhibitors it was clear after just one day of walking the aisles of what is billed as the largest consumer trade show in the country for hunting fishing and camping that the people who flock here every year have a deep love for the wilderness and a voracious appetite for killing and eating the animals that live there supplying them with the necessary tools and seasonings is a multibillion dollar business the show opened last saturday in the state farm show complex and runs through sunday at the ribbon cutting were local politicians an honor guard from the pennsylvania federation of muzzleloaders and zach nissley age of elizabethtown pa his great grandfather james nissley has attended all but two of the shows over the past years "its always been a family affair for us " said the elder mr nissley "i took my son once he was old enough he took his son and now were bringing zach " theyre not alone when the gates opened an estimated people many of them with young children in tow converged on the square feet of show space before its all over about of them will file through here shopping for camouflage hunting gear that new fishing lure theyve heard about or signing up for their next outdoor adventure my first stop was the fishing hall which featured a dozen aisles of bass boats canoes kayaks rods and reels and fishing guides from around the world frank stelmach of the island point lodge in petersburg alaska has been coming here for years "its the biggest show in the country " he said "we generate a lot of business here " indeed outfitters took up much of the space in addition to mr stelmach there were freshwater and saltwater fishing guides from wyoming maryland north carolina and mexico but they were clearly outnumbered by outfitters specializing in hunting trips to exotic locales like botswana and south africa as well as kansas and kentucky grant adventures international advertised an eight day hunting safari to namibia for about &# it includes access to a acre private hunting preserve a guide lodging and airfare from dallas or new york the license entitles hunters to take one each of kudu gemsbuck mountain zebra and warthog for an extra &# you can bag a giraffe baboons are only &# apiece jackals &# i also chatted up bob dunn one of the few outfitters advertising polar bear hunts unfortunately theres at least a two year wait not because polar bears are scarce but because the permits to hunt them are in the northwest territories only about permits a year are issued mostly by the native inuvialuit this brings up an important point contrary to popular belief hunters are some of the most avid environmental stewards mainly because they dont want to eradicate the animal population and habitat that support their favorite pastime mr dunn was asking for a &# deposit to show that youre serious about hunting polar bear on the frozen beaufort sea once your number comes up the total cost would probably be about &# he said if thats too rich for your blood the stirling lodge miles north of here in rural ontario was offering four night fishing packages with meals and a boat for &# the cannonball co a north dakota outfitter had basic hunting packages starting at &# a day for those who like to bowhunt there was a whole exhibit hall to peruse including a yard "try before you buy" archery range set up to test new equipment a local bowhunting club also had a yard competition range with three dimensional targets of elk boar and mountain lion while i was watching an early match a really cute twentysomething woman who looked like shed be just as comfortable at a dance club in new york as she would be in the wilds of namibia walked in looked at the range and said "sweet " before unpacking her bow for competition most bowhunters today use a compound bow which costs about &# and features a series of pulleys that make it easier to draw the string back and hold it while you aim at your target but recurves s shaped bows like the bear grizzly i had as a kid are making a comeback and cost just a few hundred dollars "its starting to turn " said al purrelli an exhibitor indeed in just the past year his bowhunting club has changed to the point where more members use recurve bows than compounds "its more of a challenge " he said trick shot artist randy oitker showed how challenging it can be with a compound bow putting on a demonstration several times a day he shot three arrows at once breaking three balloons about feet away he also broke a lifesaver from the same distance hitting it dead center mostly though this show is about the latest gadgets one that caught my eye was the space bobber a lightweight plastic fishing bobber thats easier to move around and reposition once its in the water the safedehooker is a tool that helps you get a hook out of a fishs mouth if hes swallowed the bait the hunters ear is a fleece headband equipped with two decibel earpiece amplifiers its purpose to help hunters better hear approaching prey the amplifiers are designed to cut out when you fire your gun so that you dont destroy your eardrums also here were portable duck blinds bottles of artificial scent to lure prey and more camouflage and day glo clothing than you can imagine and because this is a meat eating crowd there were numerous stands selling jerky buffalo burgers and bbq sauces like any consumer trade show there were a few odd items for &# you could buy a ghillie suit the camouflage bodysuit traditionally worn by military snipers entirely necessary for nailing al qaeda in tora bora but probably a bit of overkill for getting your first buck in tioga county pa formal sportsman a port matilda pa clothier had a wide variety of camouflage sport coats ties and cummerbunds there was even a childrens camouflage tuxedo for &# in case you ever need such a thing while the parents shopped there were activities to keep the kids busy such as ranges to shoot bb and paintball guns there was also a small pool stocked with fish that hosted five minute fishing tournaments throughout the day bait your hook put your pole in the water and whoever catches the most fish in five minutes wins i didnt get a nibble but the year old kid next to me pulled out two nice sunfish on sunday there was a turkey calling and owl hooting contest but i got my fill on saturday when i walked through the bird hunting booths it was as if everyone in the place had one of the &# duck calls that were on sale my heads still aching that aside i think ill be back for avid outdoorsmen the show is well worth the trip more important its one of the few places left in american culture where man can still revel in the fact that hes at the top of the food chain and proud of it mr yost is a writer in lake elmo minn
