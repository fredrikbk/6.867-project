announcement in washington united wal mart chief executive h lee scott and andy stern president of the service employees international union who has criticized the bentonville ark retailers pay and benefit policies the inclusion of wal mart the nations largest private employer and an industry bellwether in any push to overhaul health care is significant "our current system hurts americas competitiveness and leaves too many people uninsured " said mr scott who responded to mr sterns invitation last year in letters to ceos of every fortune company to revamp health care "we put aside disagreements to drive this debate forward " the campaign which is also supported by at&amp t inc intel corp staffing firm kelly services inc the communications workers of america and three public policy groups comes amid a surge of interest in how to extend health insurance to the million americans without it in recent weeks proposals have come from the white house capitol hill the presidential campaign trail and a coalition of business health and insurance groups in some cases parties that disagree on other issues have found common ground on health care while there is interest in doing something about the uninsured consensus is lacking on what should be done how much money to spend and how many americans to try to cover the new partnership offers no solution only general goals such as that individuals business and government "all should contribute to managing and financing a new american health care system " wal mart remained noncommittal yesterday as to who should take the lead "we have to work together business labor government and our communities " mr scott said members of the group who met with lawmakers on capitol hill after the announcement said they would recruit other business and labor and civic leaders to join the campaign convene a national summit of the membership by the end of may lobby national state and local elected officials and launch

and labor representatives are sending the message that our nations health care system is broken and if we dont fix it it will die under its own weight " several experts said it is hard to gauge the partnerships effect "im skeptical that they at this point agree on anything other than broad general principles " said william custer an economist and professor of health administration at georgia state university "i do think its going to have an effect because its another fairly weighty voice entering the debate and pushing for something to be done " some labor experts suggested that at least part of wal marts motivation lay in an effort to deflect criticism from its own practices "i would say probably half the announcement is public relations " said gary chaison a professor of industrial relations at clark university in worcester mass sarah clark a wal mart spokeswoman said the company didnt join the partnership to buff its image "this is about engaging leaders at all levels to bring about real and meaningful change to the health care system " she said wal mart said it recently made progress in health care though critics say the factors behind the gains dont favor workers with above average health care needs in january wal mart reported that of its u s workers had enrolled in its health benefits plans up from the previous year the national average percentage of retail workers enrolled in company sponsored health benefits plans is according to the henry j kaiser family foundation it was clear that mr stern who has been criticized within the labor movement for sometimes being too willing to collaborate with business will need to walk a fine line while working with wal mart yesterday mr stern who is a board member of wal mart watch an activist group backed by the seiu said the group would continue to draw attention to wal marts practices "i think our members and most americans expect us to stand up as an organization for people that work and we will continue to do so " he said david nassar wal mart watchs executive director issued a statement that both praised wal mart but also criticized its current health care plan saying the retailers "unaffordable plan" is part of the nations health care problem the partnership isnt likely to silence wal mart critics one of them wakeupwalmart com which is funded by the united food and commercial workers union called wal marts support for universal health coverage "disingenuous " the group released a statement that also carried an implicit criticism of mr stern "what is surprising is how anyone in good conscience would give wal mart a stage to make empty statements that will not give health care to one more uninsured wal mart worker " laura meckler and kris hudson contributed to this
