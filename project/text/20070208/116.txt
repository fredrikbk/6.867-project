the magic kingdom looks to hit the road walt disney co ponders spinoffs of theme parks pirate resorts wine tours ever since walt disney opened disneyland in walt disney co has rarely strayed from his original vision of what a theme park should be but at a top secret development unit these days the company is plotting a new spurt of theme park expansion that goes well beyond its traditional model of luring people to disney resorts in florida or california disney is hatching plans to take its theme park experience to the masses rather than the other way around instead of building more big parks the company is sketching out a string of niche resorts and attractions around the world that could include such things as stand alone disney themed hotels in cities and beach resorts disney branded retail and dining districts and smaller more specialized parks in the near term the company is using the disney name to expand in other areas of the travel business for example it is ramping up an operation called "adventures by disney " in which travelers pay for guided disney tours to popular destinations including italy and ireland the company also plans to build its presence in time share vacation homes in places like the caribbean and it is bulking up its popular cruise line with more disney ships in the cards "instead of saying where will the next disneyland be we need to think more in terms of where around the world we can deliver an immersive experience appropriate to the size of the market " says jay rasulo chairman of disneys theme park and resorts business "not every market can support a full on disney location " the expansion comes after a long stretch of rebuilding in the wake of only recently has disneys theme park business returned to the margins seen before after the success of last years global campaign pegged to the th anniversary of disneyland a big question has been what the theme parks will do next mr rasulo says his strategy is aimed at tapping into a burst of growth in the travel market particularly in the asia pacific region branching outside of walt disneys theme park vision isnt without risk disney has tried it before and in some cases failed it closed an indoor interactive theme park project called disney quest in that drew sparse crowds in chicago its childrens play center club disney shuttered two years earlier after failing to sustain an initial burst of interest mr rasulo who took over as head of the parks in says his division learned an important lesson from those ventures they made the mistake of trying something that didnt already have an established consumption pattern as disney began thinking about a new strategy it conducted research on why people go to disneys parks among the conclusions people wanted to experience disney in places other than the parks disney set to work sketching out some ideas one concept is to create stand alone versions of the downtown disney dining and shopping districts or resorts like the boardwalk at walt disney world which includes a hotel clubs arcades and other entertainment an alternative is building a resort around an attraction like an indoor water park or a theme like pirates or princesses another approach is building a family version of a casino without the gambling a big focus will be asia japan for instance has an insatiable appetite for everything disney but already has two parks while a third park in another part of the country is unlikely adding a boutique attraction could theoretically be possible one issue is how to avoid cannibalizing existing parks with such attractions disney says the goal is to give guests in new markets a taste of disney with the hope of driving them to the bigger parks with guests at the domestic parks visiting on average every four years the thinking is that the smaller attractions will also serve existing guests between visits another challenge is tailoring the niche attractions to local markets while keeping the disney brand intact something that has proved challenging with hong kong disneyland mr rasulo says there are no firm plans for any projects yet with such ideas still in the conceptual or "blue sky" stage more concrete are plans for the cruise lines mr rasulo says that business could double in the next few years with a "few more cruise ships " disney has been waiting for better contract terms and prices before going ahead with more ships although it is likely to approve some soon disney cruise line now accounts for between and of the divisions &# billion annual revenue after quietly experimenting in the guided tour business "adventures by disney" is meanwhile rolling out itineraries in north central america and europe with two guides leading groups of up to people "its not mickey mouse goes to the mountains " says ed baklor who heads the adventures business "instead were telling a local story with local characters " the "spirit of america" tour of philadelphia washington d c and williamsburg va for instance includes meetings with local characters like benjamin franklin the trips also try to entertain both adults and kids on the tuscany trip adults go on a wine tasting while kids do a gelato tasting the "adventures" project raises a question if the tours dont feature mickey mouse why will families want to go on them scott lerman ceo of brand consultancy lucid brands says a big part of what guests expect from disney is "fantasy " rather than "authenticity" and "reality " disney says it believes its selling point is offering a family vacation with the safety and quality of the disney brand as well as disney quality guides they argue the story doesnt need to be disney to be "immersive " mr baklor notes that each trip includes some disney "magic " one of example of that is on the london paris trip which includes vip tickets to disneys "mary poppins" stage show and a backstage tour afterward disneys time share business disney vacation club is also plotting new locations outside of florida the company may consider locations such as california mexico and the caribbean says mr rasulo it could take several years for such new ventures to really move the needle however disney will work its traditional theme parks harder it has a second full scale park in china in its sights that wont happen before though recent changes in local government have slowed discussions in shanghai and mr rasulo says they are "waiting to re engage when a new government is appointed "
