qwest treads slowly in fiber rollout more financial flexibility and threat from cable may intensify push at&amp t inc and verizon communications inc have poured billions of dollars building superfast fiber optic lines to bolster television offerings in competition with cable companies but another regional telephone giant qwest communications international inc has largely sat on the sidelines during the spending spree while qwest of denver offers tv service in select markets and through a partnership with directv group inc it is the only major telecom not working on a proprietary video product or large scale fiber network deployment many observers believe that will start to change because of newfound financial flexibility on qwests balance sheet and the threat from cable companies bundles of television high speed internet and web based phone services "i do believe over time they will head down that road " said ubs ag analyst john hodulik dan yost who runs product development and marketing for qwest said the company is working to replace copper lines with fiber ones in some markets though he acknowledged the deployment was "not that extensive" in qwests state operating territory "were continuing to push fiber out into our network " he said "were laying the infrastructure necessary to offer video solutions in the future " he declined to comment on specific plans phone companies have joined with satellite tv providers to keep pace with cable companies but they see their own network upgrade and video projects as the real opportunity to provide higher margin services these include faster and pricier internet connection high definition tv and other services that differentiate them from cable companies verizon and at&amp t which like qwest were formed from remnants of the old bell telephone system began to upgrade their networks in recent years but qwest wasnt in a financial position to make such an investment in qwest posted a net loss of &# million which was an improvement over a loss of &# billion in at the same time the company was saddled with roughly &# billion in debt little cash accounting problems and strategic challenges it also had lost out on its bid to buy long distance provider mci inc to eventual acquirer verizon a sale of assets helped qwest post a profit in the first quarter of and cost cuts helped fuel profitability through the rest of the year the company reports fourth quarter results today throughout this time qwest has waded into the video business with a digital tv service in denver and phoenix and an older analog service in omaha neb markets where it faces stiffer cable competition qwest still has nearly &# billion in debt but some believe the company can afford to upgrade its network with fiber optic lines it is unclear however how much the company would spend and how the deployment would look in its more sparsely populated operating areas verizon is spending &# billion to connect many of its homes to the fiber optic network the company hopes to make fios tv service available to million homes out of the million homes in its landline operating area by the end of at&amp t is spending &# billion to upgrade parts of its network with fiber optic lines while using software to increase the speed of its network enabling an internet tv service called u verse it hopes to make u verse available in at least million homes by the end of next year qwest may follow the at&amp t model of internet tv deployment because it is unclear whether verizons bet will pay off "i dont think qwest will go ahead with this until at&amp t works it out " ubss mr hodulik said "theyre letting at&amp t trailblaze with this " mr yost said qwest was exploring different options in video with an eye toward its peers "we certainly see ourselves as a fast follower when that opportunity gets stabilized " he said qwests spending is likely to be concentrated in areas where it faces the most competition from cable those include phoenix and omaha where cox communications inc operates and denver minneapolis and seattle where comcast corp has a presence mr hodulik believes the company has flexibility to make network investments despite its debt level he estimates the company generated &# billion last year in free cash flow and should generate another &# billion this year the analyst doesnt own a stake in qwest but his firm maintains an investment banking relationship with the company still others arent as certain "with qwest trying to get its financial house in order i have trouble seeing them make those capital investments " said jay pultz an analyst for research firm gartner inc mr pultz said qwest will continue to lean on its partnership with directv to provide tv service for many customers similar to its relationship with sprint nextel corp for wireless phone service that may change however as content such as video and games drive the need for more bandwidth which in turn would prompt qwest to focus more on network upgrades mr pultz said corrections &amp amplfications asset sales improved qwest communications international inc s results in the first quarter of an article yesterday on the companys slow pace in rolling out fiber optic lines incorrectly said the sale helped the company post a profit in the first quarter of wsj feb
