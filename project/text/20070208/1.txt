a loving family plus part of my sons liver thank you for publishing "the high price of keeping dad alive" page one jan i received part of my sons liver in and its always interesting to see how other families are adjusting i had autoimmune hepatitis and was ill for more than years my family life was totally different from that of the fosters my very loving and close family was very supportive and my husband was my caregiver i found it very troubling that mark fosters father hesitated for even a second after mark asked him to promise that he would take care of himself it was made clear to me that i was responsible for taking care of me eight years later im still taking my medications going for my labs exercising and having my annual checkup i feel absolutely wonderful i have seen my son marry and i now have a granddaughter i hope john foster truly realizes the sacrifice his son made to give him a second chance at life he should be very thankful for the gift he has received and never forget that his son mark is truly a hero kathy reilly williamsburg va
