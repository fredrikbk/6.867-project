anyone can produce and star in a video just like mine everyone can now be a video producer youtube and other web sites are filled with short amateur videos created on typical home computers even print journalists like me have joined the trend for the past couple of months ive been recording brief video commentaries to post along with my columns on the wall street journals web site wsj com but how exactly does one make such a video ive had multiple readers ask me about how i do mine so i thought id explain the process because the journal employs professional producers who help me the method i use isnt a purely amateur experience but most of it is the same as what anyone could do at home one look at my ahem production values confirms that you can see for yourself at wsj com mossbergvideo my method is pretty simple shortly after writing the columns each week i sit down in front of a computer with a built in video camera and record the commentary using the free software that comes with the computer then using the same software i convert the movie into a format our web producers can use and upload it to them they add titles and insert footage of any products im discussing i have recorded most of these videos in my home office in maryland using a desktop computer but when i am on the road i have used a laptop in hotel rooms from las vegas to new york city to munich at home i use a professional microphone supplied by our producers but on the road i just use the laptops built in mic and i dont use any special lighting in both settings but especially in hotel rooms i make sure the parts of the room that get in the shot arent too messy or distracting nobody wants to see a used room service tray in one of these videos so far i have done all my videos on a macintosh either an imac desktop or a macbook pro laptop and ive used apples built in imovie software mostly because it is simple and reliable and produces good videos despite unpredictable conditions it also easily exports the videos into quicktime files an apple format that our producers who also use macs can easily use youtube can use this format too along with other formats such videos could also be created on a windows computer that has a camera and accompanying video software i have tested this on a hewlett packard pavilion dv laptop with a built in camera using the free windows movie maker program in windows xp the videos recorded fine and i was able to save them in microsofts windows media video format which the journal producers or sites like youtube can use unfortunately on this particular h p computer ive had problems with the video and audio being out of sync an obstacle ive never encountered on the macs but i assume that doesnt happen on all or even most windows machines my videos are very basic its just me talking into the camera and occasionally holding up a product im not moving around much or including other people i dont usually record multiple takes and i dont have time to do editing because i dont care much about production values there are shadows and the sound is hardly perfect but you could use the same hardware and software to make more elaborate videos with better lighting and sound both imovie and windows movie maker allow extensive editing the use of video effects and the addition of titles and transitions you could also buy better video software for instance our producers in new york edit my videos using off the shelf macs running a high end apple video program called final cut studio which costs &# a simpler version final cut express costs &# on windows there are video programs like adobe premiere pro for &# or the simpler premiere elements for &# what if you want to use a digital camcorder or the video function of a digital still camera to shoot your videos well you can easily do that and just import your videos from the camera into your mac or windows computer using a cable and most video software after youve imported the video and saved it to your hard disk you can either directly upload it to youtube or another web site or edit it first before uploading while my computers have built in cameras if yours dont you can buy an add on such as the external isight camera made by apple for windows computers logitech and others make a variety of external cameras if you use a mac i also recommend a small program called iglasses a terrific &# utility that can tweak apple cameras to compensate for poor lighting or to enhance images it is available at www ecamm com two other tips remember to look into the camera not at the screen so you dont appear to be looking away from the viewer and if you wear glasses as i do turn off the screen so it doesnt reflect in your glasses if i can make videos so can you email me at mossberg wsj com see video versions of my reviews at wsj com mossbergvideo
