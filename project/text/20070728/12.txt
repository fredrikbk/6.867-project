cross country indiana tax fight indianapolis on july hundreds of tax protestors showed up in front of the governors mansion here theyve been back several times since as a result gov mitch daniels has been scrambling and the citys mayor has ordered a hiring freeze and a cut in his budget there have even been calls for a special session for the legislature and even a state constitutional convention runaway property taxes are an issue wherever property values have shot up in recent years but now indiana may be at the forefront of a homeowner rebellion against a tax system that has come to be seen as arbitrary unfair and unpredictable whats driving this angst is the first reassessment of property values in six years in marion county the city of indianapolis average property taxes increased by across the state the average increase is many homeowners bills have increased much more one thing that is really stirring anger marion county businesses mostly avoided an increase this year while almost all homeowners got nicked to cool tempers mr daniels a republican ordered another reassessment in the meantime there will be a property tax freeze in marion county delaying increases for at least six months he has also given counties a few months to rethink whether theyd like to increase local income taxes to offset the need for higher property tax revenues and taxpayers will now be able to pay their property taxes on an installment plan all of this is a nice start but none of what the governor has done so far gets at the underlying problem taxing property at a value that periodically increases can stick homeowners with a surprisingly high bill the system punishes those who made smart or lucky decisions with their home purchases and can force people out of the neighborhoods theyve raised their families in property taxes also at the margin lower property values retired indiana university economist morton marcus calculates that for every &# increase in property taxes the value of a home falls by almost &# moreover high and uncertain property taxes make it more difficult to attract workers and capital investment to the state gov daniels should not be singled out for hoping that a quick fix will do the trick house speaker patrick bauer a democrat from south bend wants to use some of the states budget surplus to issue qualified homeowners a tax rebate but the state is already scheduled to implement another band aid thanks to mr bauers leadership last year paying out some &# million in property tax abatement indy mayor bart peterson also a democrat wants to borrow &# million to pay for cutting property tax increases and he has proposed to hike local income taxes by perhaps the most promising short term fix being considered would accelerate a "circuit breaker" to cap a total property tax bill at of a propertys assessed value the legislature passed this last year but didnt schedule it to go into effect until next year implementing it a year early could mitigate the current crisis but politicians may not be able to finesse their way out this time theyve been tinkering with the system since when lawmakers faced similar problems with property taxes and tried to fix them by for example allowing local governments to impose income taxes and doubling the states sales tax indianas property tax may be so flawed and the public sufficiently cynical that changes to the system may not gain necessary public support the best option might be to toss the property tax out the window and replace it with higher income sales or consumption taxes this would dismantle an unwieldy system where some town assessors evaluate property values and pass their assessments on to county assessors who then pass their assessments to state officials property taxes are of course useful in that they provide a stable and independent revenue source for local government they are also highly visible and remind homeowners how big a bite they take because they are paid only once or twice a year unlike income taxes which are automatically deducted from regular paychecks nevertheless the public backlash is producing some interesting political results mayor peterson faces voters in the fall which may explain why he has reacted so swiftly speaker bauer wants to protect a slim majority in the house after next years elections which may explain why hes eager to put his name on tax rebates for homeowners for his part mr daniels has called on his staff to brainstorm for ideas has encouraged them to meet with affected people and is weighing whether to call the legislature back into town to enact reforms he has expressed interest in eliminating the property tax and he seems quite interested in another significant issue reducing the number of local governments in the state indiana has local taxing authorities eliminating some of these may improve efficiency and therefore reduce property taxes but the history of government consolidation is not encouraging mr daniels is favored to win a second term as governor next year but if hes not careful he could stumble eric miller mr danielss primary opponent and a vociferous property tax opponent might be tempted to challenge him again and a set of seemingly weak democratic challengers could suddenly become competitive against a governor unable to handle such a thorny issue will mr daniels play it safe on property taxes or work for significant change now that the public has spoken will mr daniels listen mr schansberg is a professor of economics at indiana university new albany an adjunct scholar for the indiana policy review and the author of "turn neither to the right nor to the left a thinking christians guide to politics and public policy" alertness books
