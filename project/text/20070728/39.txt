pursuits books starship enterprise how private investment has launched a new space race rocketeers by michael belfiore smithsonian pages &# american space exploration had a rough time of it on thursday nasas already bruised reputation took a one two punch with revelations that on at least two occasions astronauts were allowed to fly even though they were intoxicated and that a computer due to be delivered to the international space station in august had been sabotaged the news might have bolstered the case for the increasingly robust efforts at privately funded space ventures except thursday also brought news of a deadly explosion at a mojave desert airport where a propellant system for a space tourism vehicle was being tested three workers were killed and three others injured in the accident at a testing facility owned by scaled composites the company that built spaceshipone the first privately owned manned craft to reach space but despite these setbacks as with past misfortune in the space industry the push to venture far from earth will no doubt continue the only question is just when commercial enterprises will begin to pose a serious challenge to government funded space exploration the answer soon that at least is the message of "rocketeers " michael belfiores enlightening survey of the entrepreneurs bent on conquering space in the old days of science fiction the recipe for conquering space was simple take some genius rocket scientists maybe add a rich guy who shared the dream and provided funds stir in a lot of backyard style tinkering and soon youd have a spacecraft that did the job from e e smiths "the skylark of space" to robert heinleins "rocket ship galileo" the assumption was that spaceflight would take off pretty much the way aviation had taken off thanks to the skilled hands of dedicated amateurs who would blaze a trail soon to be followed by big business and big government it didnt work out that way of course the earliest days of rocketry when robert goddard and wernher von braun built rockets in garages in the s and s did look like the early days of aviation but by when the first sputnik satellite was launched it was clear that space exploration was going to be mostly a job for federal agencies and tax dollars the big government approach did get us to the moon the process might have been expensive and complicated but it had also been fast and it had worked unfortunately the big government approach stopped working the apollo program was ended early the promised follow up missions didnt appear and talk of going to mars quickly died down we spent most of a decade waiting for the space shuttle and when it arrived it was a disappointment an orbital trucking service and not a cheap or reliable one either the international space station was likewise slow overpriced and in some ways even creakier than the mir and skylab stations that had preceded it as nasa has lost its glow in recent years space enthusiasts have begun to wonder whether early science fiction writers might have been right after all and indeed private sector space initiatives are heating up again so far as michael belfiore shows in "rocketeers " the results look promising mr belfiore opens with a discussion of peter diamandis the communications entrepreneur who in announced an open competition for what he called the x prize it was renamed the ansari x prize after two venture capitalists amir and anousheh ansari put up &# million for the award the challenge to competitors develop a spacecraft able to carry three people to an altitude of roughly miles generally regarded as the point where airspace ends and outer space begins and safely return them to earth then repeat the trip within two weeks the x prize contest was reminiscent of aviations early days when privately funded prizes inspired design competitions and trial and error efforts with comparatively little governmental help charles lindbergh didnt fly the atlantic with the assistance of a federal grant he was chasing the orteig prize and lindbergh was one of many aviators competing for the &# award it touched off a frenzy of creative thinking and problem solving the ansari x prize was won in by aerospace engineer burt rutans spaceshipone the excitement over the contest prompted others to look afresh at the possibilities of space transportation mr belfiore offers an inside look at many of these "newspace" entrepreneurs including john carmack the creator of the doom video game in he launched the armadillo aerospace project currently competing for the million dollar nasa lunar lander prize elon musk the founder of paypal has started spacex a startup that has launched everything from naval research payloads to the ashes of "star trek" actor james doohan not every newspace venture has its roots in technology and engineering budget suites owner robert bigelow has gotten into the game with bigelow aerospace his goal orbital hotels the company has already launched two spacecraft and outdoor advertising mogul george french is behind rocketplane which bills itself as "a commercial space transportation company focused on providing safe reliable and low cost access to space " if private sector space exploration efforts bring to mind aviations early days they also evoke the personal computer world circa a lot of creative energy and a critical mass of engineers early adopter customers bold financiers and start up suppliers and subcontractors like bill gates and steve jobs in the pioneering days of the pc the rocketry folks display a sense of mission as they pursue transformative breakthroughs rather than short term gains on memorial day weekend in dallas i attended the national space societys international space development conference for the first time in more than a decade and the change was striking in the early s the gathering had the atmosphere of a star trek convention now its something different with brioni suited venture capitalists and prosperous big firm lawyers filling auditorium seats and schmoozing with tech geeks between panel discussions shortly afterward it was announced that northrop grumman was buying burt rutans company outright the amount paid was undisclosed but old space clearly wants a piece of newspace and is willing to pay serious money to get it the combination of lavish investment entrepreneurial zeal and technological inventiveness may well give a big lift to nongovernmental efforts at space exploration mr belfiore does a terrific job of capturing the dream chasing that is already under way if we ever see cities on the moon or mars the kind of thing science fiction once promised so enticingly im betting that the lions share of credit will go not to nasa but to st century rocketeers mr reynolds is the author of "an army of davids how markets and technology empower ordinary people to beat big media big government and other goliaths "
