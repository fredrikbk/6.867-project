politics &amp economics house passes big farm bill pelosi holds together democratic coalition sticky tax provisions washington a five year &# billion farm bill cleared the house giving speaker nancy pelosi a much needed victory as she tries to put more punch in her partys domestic agenda before going home for the august recess lobbying reform legislation and a measure to expand health insurance for the children of poor and working class families are to be taken up next week and late friday the house sent on to president bush a package of homeland security related measures that promise to better target federal money to high risk areas and demand tighter screening of air and sea cargo the farm bill adopted extends major loan and price support programs for producers but also tightens subsidy payments and requires more transparency fruit and vegetable growers long ignored in past farm bills dominated by big commodities such as cotton and corn will receive greatly expanded assistance the measure invests new money in bioenergy research and the development of cellulose such as from grass and woody plants as feedstock for ethanol the bill mandates country of origin labels for meat and both at home and overseas the bill reflects an expanded commitment to nutrition programs food stamp benefits would be updated to reflect higher costs and an estimated &# million is promised to provide school meals to poor children in developing countries "more needs to be done but we have gone in the right direction " ms pelosi said of the bill but she had to struggle all week to hold together her rural urban coalition in the face of republican defections and a white house veto threat fourteen democrats chiefly liberals who had wanted more cuts in farm subsidies opposed the package only republicans finally supported the measure which the house agriculture committee had unanimously approved just a week ago the major partisan dividing point was a set of tax provisions added by the democratic leadership to help offset the bills costs and satisfy new pay as you go antideficit rules chief among these is a provision to raise &# billion over the next years from foreign corporations with u s subsidiaries the choice of tax targets could reflect growing tensions between agriculture interests and more trade oriented multinational business lobbies that support the world trade organization the bush administration has complained for example that the house measure would raise marketing assistance loans for some crops which could have the effect of artificially raising commodities prices and in preserving a "safety net" for u s producers the bill shows little retreat from the current subsidy level that has been criticized as excessive by protrade advocates even as the bill was passing a new wto ruling related to u s cotton subsidies appears to have gone largely in the favor of cotton industries in brazil and west african nations that have claimed to have been harmed by u s payments house agriculture committee chairman collin peterson d minn said later that he was unfamiliar with the details of the reported ruling but expected an appeal would consume months more time and have little immediate impact on the farm bill "we will deal with issues as they come up " he said not hiding his frustration with the u s trade representatives office "we just seem to be willing to give up subsidies before anyone else " he said "the committee is going to do what they think is right and a lot of times that is not in sync with the trade representatives office " at the same time business groups stepped up their attacks labeling the tax provisions in the farm bill as "protectionist " and republicans argued that the end result will be to pit farm interests against urban workers depending on manufacturing jobs generated by foreign investment but in this atmosphere more substantive changes in farm programs advocated by "reform" groups gained little traction the most serious attempt led by rep ron kind d wis was buried by an almost margin late thursday night and relatively modest efforts to target sugar and cotton support programs were easily defeated as mr peterson rolled toward passage
