pursuits sports golf journal why golf is so hot in india despite degree heat the courses are packed our writer plays a sweaty round new delhi mad dogs and englishmen go out in the midday sun so do indian golfers in droves june before the monsoon rains arrive is usually the hottest month here the average daily high this year was degrees fahrenheit on days it exceeded degrees the city sank into a desultory lull the white sun enough to make your eyeballs sweat but neither sun nor heatstroke nor the red dust that sweeps through the city in the dry months keeps delhis golfers from their appointed tee times courses in the area were packed in the mornings starting at first light around and just slightly less full in the afternoon a few players used golf carts most walked usually with caddies in tow "forty five degrees degrees fahrenheit is nothing " scoffs ishwar verma a year old retired indian army colonel who plays five days a week and has a handicap of eight "for me golf is a passionate and obsessive mind game it is mentally absorbing and so the temperatures dont really affect me " he wears a cap his playing partners he adds "are more cautious carrying their umbrellas water bottles and head gear to protect them from sun stroke " it was in fact englishmen who brought golf to india the first club known today as royal calcutta golf club was established in until recent years the sport was dominated by indias elite and retired military officers like col verma who has been playing for more than two decades the summer crowds now can be partly explained by the sports broadening appeal as incomes rise indias middle class swells and the price of equipment drops real estate developments with homes surrounding golf courses are popping up around the country the delhi area has courses designed by arnold palmer and jack nicklaus indian professionals meanwhile are making a dent internationally creating buzz at home indias sports pages tracked the daily rounds of indian great jeev milkha singh at this years u s open and masters he tied for th and th respectively one sweltering june saturday at our local sports complex there was a line for the berth driving range youthful hackers sent balls into the shimmering haze three men walked back and forth across the range retrieving balls while the golfers kept hitting they carried umbrellas not to protect against the sun but against the balls raining down around them according to the india meteorological department sunday june was the hottest day in new delhi so far this year with the thermometer hitting degrees about players teed up at the delhi golf club one of the citys most prestigious "they are very crazy golfers " says krishan lal the chief starter the course last year entered an arrangement with a nearby hospital to send a doctor and ambulance if needed they have yet to be called heat resistant golfers hit the links in other hot spots too but rarely on delhis scale at furnace creek inn &amp ranch resort in death valley calif where the temperature reached degrees on june only golfers teed off many of them were hotel employees says phil dickinson the resorts director of sales and marketing at the alice springs golf club in the australian outback where summer temperatures in january and february regularly exceed degrees sunday tournaments attract around players not far off the or so who show up at more temperate times "were in the middle of australia so its golf or nothing " says doug maiden the clubs pro "theres not much else to do out here except drink " mr maiden says weekly tournament scores in the australian summer actually improve by five or six strokes because the course is heavily watered then and the greens slow a bit such fierce heat is the opposite extreme of what i grew up with in scotland where the goal is to keep warm not cool to try the other end of the thermometer i arranged an afternoon round in delhi with my neighbor sunil anand a year old insurance salesman he plays three or four times a week year round when it gets really hot mr anand dips a towel in cold water and secures it with a rubber band around his cap he redips throughout the round his friends call him "the sheikh " he wears dark glasses against the glare and carries cookies gum water juice and a first aid kit so much stuff that hes also dubbed the "grocery store " his playing partners are more typical of indias hot golfers they do nothing special at the end of the round they head to the bar for three or four whiskeys this is the time of year in india when the humidity rises adding an element of stickiness to the conditions that you wouldnt find in other golfing hotspots like scottsdale ariz or san diego brigadier surinder singh anand no relation to sunil a military doctor and avid golfer says golfers acclimatize over time and that indians are simply used to functioning in extreme heat he says the most important factor is to stay hydrated preferably with a drink of fresh lime juice mixed with sugar syrup salt to replace minerals and prevent cramps water and ice a concoction that is served in many restaurants here the temperature when we played earlier this month i confess reached only degrees the venue was the qutab golf course so named because it affords views of the qutab minar a th century sandstone tower that is one of the citys architectural treasures tee time was p m just after the days temperature usually peaks in the summer thanks to a shield of a hat sunglasses and factor sunblock the temperature at first didnt make much difference i dutifully worked my way through a liter of water i didnt hear about the fresh lime tip until after we played for the first five holes i racked up my usual bogeys and doubles with one par only gradually did the heat take its toll even as i knew logically that it was getting cooler as the round progressed i eyed with some envy the stray dog sleeping under a tree by the sixth tee parts of my body forearms cheeks neck started to sting as we started the back nine the sun felt like it was targeting my face like a laser beam at the th green we stopped at a snack hut mr anand asked for hot coffee for no other reason than he likes it i went for iced tea from the th on as mr anands game improved mine deteriorated i kept drinking water and eating macadamia nuts for energy and for the salt but the bogeys became doubles the doubles became triples what had with at least some consistency been yard drives became yard grass cutters my concentration evaporated by the time we reached the par four th and got stuck behind a very slow foursome id had enough we finished the hole i had a triple bogey and skipped the last two as we headed for the clubhouse i asked mr anand how this rated for heat on a scale of one to "three " he answered he hadnt even bothered with the wet towel headgear vibhuti agarwal contributed to this article john paul newport is on vacation email golfjournal wsj com
