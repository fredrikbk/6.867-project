pursuits travel the carbon neutral vacation travelers are running into an uncomfortable reality going green means sacrificing some luxuries the tough choices ahead as resorts try to cater to eco conscious consumers great bear rainforest canada no" is a word seldom heard by the guests of king pacific lodge a deluxe floating inn on the remote british columbia coast a three night stay starts at about &# per head including the float plane flights to and from the front door but not the spa treatments or the cuban cigars but "no" is the answer california investment banking executive aaron gurewitz got one saturday this month when he requested three of the lodges twin engine boats to ferry seven people in his corporate party out for an afternoon of salmon fishing a lodge staffer refused explaining three boats would represent too much horsepower per person when mr gurewitz offered to pay extra for the fuel he was informed the issue wasnt money it was global warming this spring king pacific lodge pledged it will halve its emissions of carbon dioxide over the next five years a decision that has begun to affect the lodge in ways big and small the chef no longer makes his own cooking stock as that might require extra flights to bring the organic produce up from vancouver about miles to the southeast the fishing boats have been fitted with governors limiting their engine speeds meaning it takes guests more time to get where the salmon swim and in a deluxe version of carpooling mr gurewitz and his colleagues had to crowd onto two fishing boats instead of three "it took me back for a second " said mr gurewitz a year old managing director at roth capital partners "we pay all this money you want to be able to do what you want to do " leisure travel offers a stark look at the tough battles ahead as the fight against global warming ventures into areas where real people feel it themselves though it surprises most people vacationing even at seemingly environmentally friendly places can generate huge emissions of carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas the farther into the wilderness a resort sits the likelier it is that getting there will require long plane flights and that the place will be powered by inefficient methods like diesel generators leisure travel also is discretionary and emotional people forking over big sums on a vacation tend not to like being told to restrain their urges for fossil fueled fun the challenge is toughest at the most luxurious resorts where energy intensive amenities are plentiful and clients are particularly accustomed to getting what they want there are few easy solutions for resorts that want to cut their "carbon footprint " updating machinery to energy efficient models takes time and money buying carbon offsets tradable dispensations said to represent emission cuts achieved less expensively elsewhere on the planet raises concerns about environmental legitimacy asking guests to sacrifice in the name of the planet might mean they wont come back travelers who consider themselves environmentally minded often dont think about the carbon impact of their globetrotting ways rob and tric topsfield retirees from a suburb of adelaide australia have a solar powered hot water heater on their house and like to visit national parks this year they bought round the world plane tickets and embarked on a month multicontinent tour halfway into their trip this month they got word that their mothers were ill and they headed back home even the topsfields shortened trip emitted about tons of co in plane travel alone for each of them according to offsetters climate neutral society a vancouver based nonprofit thats one of several sellers of travel related carbon offsets thats more than the average french resident emits in a year according to the international energy agency "youve got two very sober australians starting to wonder if they should be doing any traveling at all " mr topsfield sighed while flying on one leg of his journey back home calls for big cuts in emissions of co a gas thats produced when fossil fuel is burned and thats contributing to global warming raise a basic question how much can be accomplished through painless technological fixes and how much will require people to change the way they live thus far the campaign to curb emissions has focused on factories far from most consumers everyday lives but as the fight against global warming intensifies it will start hitting consumers much more directly global warming emissions arent the only environmental concern raised by resorts localized air and water pollution also can be a problem but curbing co emissions tends to be a thornier challenge instead of merely installing a filter on a smokestack or pipe it requires reducing the amount of fossil fuel the resort burns in the first place many hotels refuse even to broach the subject of carbon with their guests says brian mullis president of sustainable travel international nevertheless this year the colorado based nonprofit launched its "travel green" program in which participating hotels can sell per night emission offsets to guests each offset represents money paid to bankroll a project somewhere else that reduces pounds of co emissions the amount estimated to be produced by the average one night hotel stay a hotel doesnt make a direct profit from the program it pays sustainable travel international &# for each offset dubbed a mini green tag and then sells the tag to a guest for the same price the hotel gets marketing materials complete with its logo telegraphing its interest in things green of the &# that sustainable travel international gets for each credit it uses cents to pay administrative expenses and cents to fund emission reductions mr mullis says that cents buys either north american "renewable energy certificates" a tradable currency that bankrolls the installation of renewable sources of electricity such as solar panels and wind turbines or helps fund projects in developing countries to curb fossil fuel use or to plant or preserve co eating trees last month the san juan marriott resort &amp stellaris casino in san juan puerto rico became the first big chain hotel to sell mini green tags customers can choose to offset the emissions from their flights making a round trip flight between new york and san juan "carbon neutral" costs &# if guests decide thats too rich they can buy a hotel stay offset for &# per night "so it doesnt freak you out " said hans georg rohrbein the resorts general manager "its just like christmastime when theres a charity you put a buck in it " concerned he couldnt vouch for the environmental legitimacy of offsets funding carbon cutting projects thousands of miles away michael luehrs director of operations at the doubletree hotel and executive meeting center in portland ore chose a different approach the hotel has pledged to become carbon neutral through on site energy efficiency moves and purchases of offsets from the climate trust this portland group organizes local emission reduction projects such as synchronizing traffic lights to reduce fuel consumption from idling cars at the doubletree guests who chose to offset their footprint would have to go onto a computer and calculate their individual emissions including travel although the hotel has sold offsets to a handful of meeting planners who then can tout their gatherings at the hotel as carbon neutral no individual hotel guest has bought a doubletree offset since they became available in february some hotels are launching major makeovers with an eye toward cutting emissions soneva fushi a villa resort in the maldives an island chain in the indian ocean last month announced plans to cease emitting carbon by by the end of this year it plans to have installed projects including a biodiesel plant to convert oil from island coconuts and used cooking oil from the resort into fuel that can be mixed with conventional diesel to power the resorts two generators those moves are expected to cost &# million and to have paid for themselves through lower fuel bills in two years says juergen seidel director of the carbon reduction program for six senses resorts &amp spas the bangkok based company that owns soneva fushi and several other resorts soneva fushi also plans later this year to start slapping customers with a mandatory surcharge to pay to offset the customers flight related emissions six senses officials say working with a nonprofit group six senses plans to use the money to build its own emission offsetting projects such as a wind turbine in nearby india rather than buying commoditized offsets on the international carbon market more controversial are moves that might affect guests directly one is a system to turn off air conditioning in a villa if the door is kept open for more than a minute soneva fushi plans to install the system in or and then to have to explain it to some of its well heeled guests "the guest needs to be educated if you want to be cooled close the door " mr seidel says "some of the guests they think we paid the money and now the resort needs to provide me the services regardless of what i do we are not doing this to be stingy we dont want to have a finger pointed at us saying you could have done this but didnt " high on the luxury travel food chain sits king pacific lodge a room barge owned by hideo morita the nagoya based son of sony corp co founder akio morita its towed into place each spring at princess royal island an uninhabited island in a saltwater archipelago about miles southwest of kitimat british columbia the nearest town accessible by road to vancouver getting to the lodge means flying to vancouver then boarding a king pacific charter flight to the tiny town of bella bella british columbia then taking a chartered float plane to the lodge itself fronting the lodge is a dock with more than a dozen fishing boats and a helicopter that for an extra fee of about &# will whisk away guests for a day of even more remote fly fishing or hiking arriving guests are greeted by a masseuse bearing glasses of chilled sparkling wine the lodge caters to a high powered and demanding clientele "guests at king pacific lodge dont go beyond alpha " says michael uehara king pacifics president although it seems an eco paradise the lodge is a voracious energy consumer the flights to and from the lodge the helicopter the fishing boats the staffs work related travel and the two kilowatt diesel generators that power the place and produce a faint but constant rumble throughout it collectively cough out tons of carbon dioxide in an annual may september season according to tabulations prepared on behalf of king pacific by offsetters that translates into about tons of co emissions for each king pacific lodge guest in his or her day stay thats as much co as the u s emits per capita in a month those figures result from a campaign launched earlier this year by king pacifics president michael uehara inspired he says by al gores global warming movie "an inconvenient truth " and by the calls of his friend the canadian environmentalist david suzuki mr uehara announced the lodge would cut its co emissions over five years mr gores movie urges people to reduce their carbon emissions and " sounded better than " mr uehara says mr uehara wants to help the environment but he figures the moves also may attract green minded customers "there are very few people who are going to say i want to go to a resort thats overly consumptive totally hedonistic and doesnt care about the environment " he says there are however downsides the cost is likely to run to the hundreds of thousands of dollars then theres the danger of offending clients who dont expect to be asked to sacrifice given the sums theyre paying for their vacations "its a concern " he says "were asking our guests to make those sacrifices in hopes that a little bit will do a lot for us but i cant guarantee that all the guests will understand that " the job of identifying ways to cut emissions at king pacific fell to robert penman the lodges general manager with the floating lodge still docked at prince rupert a town to the north one of his first moves was to replace its "perfectly good" electric kitchen appliances and clothes dryers with propane powered models that switch which cost about &# removed a big load from the lodges twin diesel generators allowing the lodge to run more often on just one of the generators and thus reducing fuel consumption and generating heat by burning propane is more efficient than by converting diesel fuel to electricity mr penman persuaded the lodges reluctant executive chef to buy his cooking stock from a company in vancouver loading it onto the barge at the start of the season and keeping it in the freezer rather than flying up fresh organic vegetables to make his own stock weekly "less planes less gas consumption " says the chef maxim ridorossi one of the lodges biggest energy consumers is its fleet of fishing boats which had a top speed of about miles per hour "thats real fast " mr uehara says "we dont need that " in mid february mr penman asked representatives of mercury marine which makes the engines whether the lodge could use smaller models mercury said the boats needed the power mr penman then asked the lodges boat and motor distributor to test smaller engines on the boats he told the distributor to fit the existing engines with governors devices that limit the engines top speed to about miles per hour he also instituted the carpooling requirements the lodges twin engine boats must have at least three guests plus a guide before leaving the dock and its single engine boats must have at least two guests plus a guide its that rule that surprised mr gurewitz the investment banking executive it drew a more heated protest a few weeks ago from a guest from texas when mr penman refused to give the man and his party as many of the twin engine boats as he wanted "we drive hummers we drive big suvs and when we go away on vacation we dont care about the environment " the guest said according to mr penman and another lodge staffer who was present king pacific also has begun setting aside money to buy offsets for the emissions from its guests flights and its hotel operations it estimates those offsets will cost about &# yearly the lodge will pay the money itself rather than pass along the costs to its guests of greater concern to mr uehara than the money is that he hasnt found any offsets hes confident are environmentally real "theres a lot of offset money chasing very poor investments " he says "but by the end of the year since ive committed publicly to being carbon neutral i have to put &# into something which bothers me " meanwhile king pacific has hired an energy consultant to study whether it can install a hydroelectric system on a nearby stream further reducing its need for diesel generators the consultant kevin pegg suggests the lodge could do a lot to curb emissions by ditching its helicopter "an inherently dirty and unsustainable operation " mr uehara says hes "not sure we can" get rid of the helicopter a big attraction for guests robert kaufman a year old divorce lawyer and avid fisherman from beverly hills chartered the helicopter to take his wife and him fishing one afternoon this month he has little patience for calls to curb motorized recreation at resorts like king pacific lodge to combat global warming "its putting a band aid on a world wide sore " he says over a chef prepared dinner of salmon he caught that day "its great for liberal people those who are antagonistic to the wealthy who are able to afford to ride in a helicopter please "
