a modern day chicago creating an industrial gateway that opens the country to its vast rural heartland that might be a tougher challenge than officials admit the economist says chongqing whose core city population tops six million has been a magnet for rural workers seeking jobs in chinas urban areas in recent years the regional government has worked to develop the city at an astonishing rate chongqing is one of chinas biggest car manufacturing centers the industrialization and drive toward modernization have prompted the comparisons with chicago in the th century james kynge noted in a recent book about china that both cities represent gateways to "largely undeveloped lands to the west " hubs where roads rail lines and waterways converged that comparison pleases chongqing officials who set a goal to have of the region urbanized by currently some of the regions population lives in urban zones in greater chongqing an area roughly the size of scotland many of the regions million or so residents live scattered in thousands of towns and villages to achieve the growth target by country dwellers would need to move into urban areas at a rate of more than half a million a year the economist says moreover chongqing must compete for job seekers with chinas big coastal cities the lure of places such as beijing and shanghai underscores chongqings biggest challenge the rural workers who havent already migrated elsewhere can be reluctant to make a permanent move to places like chongqing that is because by registering as urban residents they might lose their usage rights to small plots of farmland which many see as more reliable than the promise of future welfare benefits offered by cities aware of the problem one village has begun to let some farmers swap their land for

lawyers " says george m cohen a legal ethics expert at the university of virginia school of law that is partly because it is difficult to demonstrate that lawyers know the details about the deals they work on but the hollinger prosecution could signal the arrival of a higher standard in past prosecutions of attorneys the lawyer played a more central role in the case than mr kipnis did as both employees of corporations and as legal advisers in house attorneys find themselves in a potentially thorny position says stephen gillers a new york university school of law ethics professor "they have to be aware of the risk that their bosses are violating a duty to their clients and its a real challenge because you dont want to accuse your boss of illegal activity " mr gillers says mr kipniss attorney who plans to ask the judge to overturn the verdict says the only thing his client did wrong was failing to be as diligent as he should have been in ascertaining all the details of the
