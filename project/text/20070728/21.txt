hot topic pakistan endgame for musharraf a suspected suicide bomber killed at least people near islamabads red mosque on friday two weeks after security forces expelled islamic militants in a weeklong siege that killed people the violence underscores a u s intelligence report issued earlier this month warning that al qaeda and the taliban had reconstituted in the semiautonomous tribal areas on pakistans northwestern border meanwhile the countrys supreme court dealt a blow to pakistans president gen pervez musharraf two weeks ago when it reinstated chief justice iftikhar mohammed chaudhry the middle class loudly protested the governments removal of the judge in march in one of the sharpest challenges yet to gen musharrafs authority the timing couldnt be worse for gen musharraf a key ally of the u s as he tries to placate radicals and moderates ahead of elections this fall heres a closer look why is gen musharraf so unpopular pakistanis barely complained when gen musharraf came to power in a bloodless coup in because the democratic government he replaced was seen as corrupt but pakistani moderates increasingly see him as willing to do anything to remain in power while islamic radicals see gen musharraf a secularist as an obstacle to the creation of an islamic state efforts he might mount to oust pro taliban fighters from border areas could be resisted by elements of the nations security forces how has pakistan fared under gen musharraf pakistans economy has grown rapidly expanding at an average rate of over the past five years an ambitious privatization program fueled by gulf country investments and led by prime minister shaukat aziz a former citibank banker is widely regarded as the reason for that growth total direct investment reached &# billion in the past fiscal year up from &# billion in the fiscal year the u s has also funneled billions of dollars in military and economic assistance to the country since the sept attacks but those benefits havent reached the majority of pakistanis and inflation remains high at political instability also threatens economic gains standard and poors recently lowered its outlook on pakistans credit rating has gen musharraf furthered u s aims while pakistan claims to have netted more than suspected terrorists including senior al qaeda leaders like khalid sheikh mohammed washington has grown increasingly skeptical about whether gen musharraf especially as his legitimacy erodes has the will to clamp down on homegrown muslim insurgents who meddle in neighboring afghanistan and india critics point to the red mosque as evidence that gen musharrafs unwillingness to confront islamic militants in rural areas has allowed them to take root in bigger cities the collapse of a month truce with pro taliban militants in the tribal areas this month further set back gen musharrafs strategy last year the pakistani army turned over control of the border area to tribal elders who were supposed to keep taliban fighters from entering afghanistan but the u s military says that taliban attacks in afghanistan have tripled since the truce took effect gen musharraf also helped restart negotiations with rival india over the disputed kashmir region in both nations have nuclear weapons and the u s on friday said it had finalized a civilian nuclear fuel and technology deal with india why hasnt the u s been more critical of pakistan the u s has been unwilling to criticize gen musharraf for fear of losing cooperation the cia remains "utterly totally dependent" on pakistani intelligence services for leads on insurgent activity in pakistan says george perkovich a vice president at the council on foreign relations congress passed legislation this past week that would make aid to pakistan conditional on a crackdown on islamic militants in tribal areas where does that leave the u s gen musharraf intends to stand for re election this fall but so far has indicated he will not give up his position as chief of the army which could provoke mass protests his dual role has been challenged as unconstitutional washington recognizes gen musharrafs limitations and risks damaging its long term influence in pakistan if it continues to embrace an unpopular and authoritarian leader but pakistans democratically elected civilian governments have a poor track record and former prime ministers benazir bhutto and nawaz sharif were widely viewed as corrupt could an islamic government win an election while islamists arent believed to be widely popular today islamist political parties won just of the vote in the legislative elections moderates worry that prolonged authoritarian rule by gen musharraf could weaken existing political parties and build extremists appeal just as the authoritarian rule of egypts hosni mubarak has weakened democratic opposition while building the appeal of extremist groups like muslim brotherhood nick timiraos points of view pakistan is a frontline partner in the war on terror nevertheless it remains a major source of islamic extremism and the home for some top terrorist leaders " john negroponte former director of national intelligence facts the karachi stock
