big change to teachers funds clearer rules new options are coming in b plans the retirement savings plans available to most teachers and many nonprofit employees are about to get a dramatic makeover the treasury department and irs have issued long awaited regulations that will make the b savings plan look more like its younger cousin the k retirement savings plan for investors in these plans the changes will mean clearer explanations of the plans from their employers and eventually lower cost investment options with potentially higher returns some of the big mutual fund firms may benefit at the expense of some insurance firms and the agents who sold investments to teachers however investors will lose much of the flexibility they now have to move their assets to any investment manager offering a b vehicle and plan sponsors the employers will have to ratchet up their oversight and involvement in their employees retirement plans "theres going to be a shake up in the industry " says d j lucey an analyst at cerulli associates a consulting firm like k s b plans are defined contribution retirement plans where the amount of money withdrawn at retirement is determined by how much money is set aside and how that money performs when its invested money is set aside pretax usually colleges school districts and not for profit employers including hospitals are eligible for b plans the plans were introduced in the s with few administrative demands on the employers sponsoring them sales were originally dominated by insurance companies which typically sold annuities annuities still account for more than of the investments in b plans the k plan wasnt launched until when it took off in another direction toward mutual fund investments which often included an employee match these savings plans offered mostly by private companies had more stringent rules and fiduciary requirements of plan sponsors the new rules bring b plans more in line though not entirely with the requirements of k plans forcing plan sponsors to take a more active role in administering them the irs sought the new rules because it was difficult for it to track b contributions and withdrawals as with k plans there are limits and tax consequences for contributions and withdrawals while the b plans available at many colleges and hospitals already have made many of these changes the new rules will have a profound impact on school districts and small not for profit employers who had little oversight or involvement in their plans by forcing b sponsors to actually look at and think about their plans and shoulder more administrative burdens the new rules may boost the big investment management firms that offer low cost products and have the administrative support school districts will now need even before the new rules some investors have sued over high cost investment options in their b plans earlier this month two members of the national education association sued alleging that the nea had breached its duties because it had accepted millions of dollars in payments from two financial firms whose high cost annuities were recommended to members in association sponsored retirement plan dan otter a former teacher who owns and operates the bwise com web site says the new rules provide school districts with "the opportunity to do the right thing for their employees" by giving them less expensive investments and more information as plan sponsors face the new paperwork though investors should expect fewer choices of investments until now many b plan sponsors did almost nothing but direct the money from teacher paychecks to the investments unlike k sponsors some didnt screen the investment providers or track contributions and withdrawals
