the weekend interview with charles schwab talking to chuck san francisco perhaps no one on the globe has come to symbolize the rise of the investor class in america in recent decades more than charles schwab when mr schwab or "chuck " as nearly everyone calls him opened his first brokerage office in the stock market was pretty much the exclusive sandbox of the richest of americans today thanks in no small part to his companys financial market innovations investing has been thoroughly "democratized " as he puts it with more than half of working class adults now owners of stock creating wealth is what mr schwab has come to regard as his "lifes pursuit " hes accomplished that not just for himself his stake in the company is estimated at &# billion but also for the millions of small investors who first came to be owner capitalists by opening a schwab account so who better to discuss the future of financial markets and investing than the man who revolutionized the brokerage business i visited mr schwab recently at the firms headquarters in the heart of downtown san francisco mr schwab is astonishingly muscular and fit for a grandfather who turns this weekend throughout our conversation which took place in his th floor office overlooking the bay he is cordial but intense he speaks of the company as if it is one of his children and he doesnt seem to be in any hurry to surrender the helm i ask him what he means by his favorite term "democratic capitalism " he replies that the stock market today is "an open tent for anybody to come into " ever the salesman he adds "for as little as a thousand dollars you can open an account at schwab i mean its not a big barrier to entry " mr schwab pioneered the use of the internet and helped create the concept of the online brokerage firm this innovation has enabled investors to behave like informed consumers by leisurely shopping around online for mutual funds tailored to their particular financial circumstances it wasnt always like this when mr schwab started his firm after working in insurance banking and financial consulting the mutual fund industry was just getting off the ground "there were a few high load mutual funds that charged a sales load" or fee he recalls shaking his head "the investor had a huge cost to get in and out and faced a big spread between the bid and the ask price there were big commissions on the top of that to boot there was all kinds of friction in the system to prevent small guys from investing " mr schwab sweat those transaction costs out of the process so that even small traders could have a go at it brokers have become "commoditized" agents he likes to say schwabs fees on its money market funds are as low as and they keep shrinking other factors he cites to explain the growth of the investor class and the bullish market returns of the past quarter century were the marginal tax rate cuts in and the financial deregulation that started under president carter and then accelerated under ronald reagan an even bigger factor mr schwab says "was when congress and the sec both got together and mandated the deregulated stock exchange in the securities exchange act of the stock exchange had a fixed rate on stock trading fees for years before that it operated like a cartel brokers couldnt compete on the basis of price service speed and all the things that improved the environment for investors to have confidence in the efficiencies of the market " when those restrictions were lifted schwab stores began to open their doors in big and small towns around the country and the online services later exploded perhaps mr schwabs greatest business achievement wasnt in building the firm to the investment titan that it became in the s but in rebuilding it after the market meltdown in the early s he had resigned as ceo in but in july he was asked by the board to lay away his putter golf is one of his life passions and rescue his ailing company the stock had slid down to &# in from a price of &# in march of "the price during the boom was totally unsustainable " he insists "i told people it was overpriced but what else could i do we were the last of the internet companies" to take a hit "our activity level certainly collapsed as we moved into and through " he recounts with anguish in his voice mr schwab believes that the firm had become too diversified and that it had "lost our focus on our core function of providing exquisite financial services to investors " the most painful part of the restructuring was cutting staff "it was emotional " he says "we had to let go of a lot of wonderful young people who we had trained " the workforce shrank from to today the path back to financial health required relentlessly cutting costs and passing the savings onto schwab customers as lower prices today the stock is selling at about &# or three times the price when he came back "were growing like crazy again " he boasts mr schwab describes the bush administrations capital gains and dividend tax cuts as exactly the right prescription for the ailing stock market after the dot com crash in those tax cuts of course are under constant assault by democratic presidential hopefuls and the democratic majorities in congress what would be the stock market response to repealing them "oh i think it would probably cost the market to " he predicts "that may not happen on a single day but it will certainly suppress prices and the market is already anticipating these higher tax rates " he assures me which means stock prices are already being suppressed by tax uncertainty "i would say were probably in the neighborhood of &# trillion of unrealized capital gains" mr schwab says of the present economic situation "if you put a tax on it of course the governments going to get none of that if youre at zero you would get none with the rate for capital gains were probably at the optimum rate " then he adds something that house ways and means committee chairman charlie rangel should take to heart "bear in mind that the higher capital gains tax is principally directed toward individual investors not foundations or pension funds it will be the individual who takes the hit " mr schwab is a republican and hes cozy with president bush the white house courted him briefly for the treasury secretary position in but he took his hat out of the ring because this was the height of the market collapse and his highest priority was saving his company he is not a strict proponent of laissez faire capitalism when i ask him to expound upon the type of policies needed to increase prosperity in america two of the highest priorities he says are more government investment in education and transportation infrastructure hes also surprisingly sanguine about the sarbanes oxley accounting law "its not a big problem for us but it is a big cost for small firms " he adds "i have total confidence when we go into the room for that final sarbox session we have our chief accounts and auditors outside auditors outside counsel inside counsel something like people in the room and i go around asking each one individually to sign " they can be held liable for accounting mistakes too i interject "personally and physically " he says clenching a fist he doesnt seem to be kidding mr schwab says that his inner drive for success dates back to his childhood he says he grew up in "the post depression era" of the late s and s when "there was not much money around to do anything i remember my first bicycle was very much a used bike i wasnt going to wal mart buying a flashy speed bike from china are you kidding me " in that era he recalls "you always had to worry because you didnt have enough money i hated limitations and wanted to do something" about it mr schwab believes that americans now live in an underappreciated era of prosperity "just drive into any wal mart parking lot and its just loaded with people and theyre just delving into all of these products that are so cheap i went yesterday to best buy to get a cd player i looked at the price and i looked at this thing and i said how could it be any good at bucks i mean there must be a catch here ive got to try this thing twenty nine dollars for this incredible cd player with earphones and all the things i love to listen to " mr schwabs entrepreneurial success is all the more remarkable because he suffers from dyslexia how did he do in school "man i struggled i really struggled there was no science around this so i didnt know what i had you certainly didnt want to disclose it to anybody you had a deep little dark secret you didnt want to tell " but handicaps like this one can sharpen the other senses and skill sets "i think it leads to a better visualization capability conceptual vision " he theorizes he points out that many successful ceos including richard branson suffer from dyslexia one of his primary charitable activities is funding research on the condition its said that to be in the investment business you must by nature be an optimist or you wouldnt bet your money on the future so mr schwabs sunny outlook is fitting "the wealth creation potential of this country is unbelievable and its going global " he says excitedly he insists that one of the best policy changes in washington in recent years was the pension protection act of which provided for the automatic enrollment of workers into k plans this is going to turn a generation of year olds into investors he says and he predicts that workers at firms with k s will become acculturated to saving and this will vastly expand the investor class in america this is the one subject we talk about that seems to visibly get mr schwabs heart beating faster and not just because it will expand the companys client base in the years to come he predicts that more investors will mean "a much more informed citizen who has a stake in the economic machine of america if you own a few shares of stock or mutual funds you have a piece of the action a persons a much better citizen when they know that theyre personally benefiting from the success of the country the success of american companies " he envisions a day not too far off when " of american workers own stock and have a stake in the game " when that happens just maybe charles schwab will feel ready to retire and get back to his golf game mr moore is a member of the journals editorial board
