politics &amp economics intel assails eus claim it violated antitrust rules brussels the european commission relied on unfounded "assumptions" and a "failure of logic" in reaching its preliminary conclusion that intel corp violated europes antitrust rules according to intels general counsel bruce sewell on friday the commission gave a skeletal outline of its concerns following a confidential "statement of objections" it sent to intel thursday in which it alleged that the company boxed out chief rival advanced micro devices inc in the market for computer microprocessors the commission said intel paid special rebates to computer makers if they kept amd to a small portion of their product line made payments to manufacturers for slowing down or canceling launches of products using amd chips and sold server chips below cost when necessary to keep amd from winning key customers the statement by europes antitrust watchdog was a pivotal step in a long running case that like the european unions investigation of microsoft corp indicates europe is willing to tackle the business practices of a u s technology giant with dominant market presence mr sewell said friday that the company disagreed with the commissions statement and argued that the chip market is "enormously competitive " he added "the commission has made some assumptions and drawn some conclusions which we think we can correct " intel has weeks to make a formal reply an eu spokeswoman said the commission would analyze intels concerns when it receives the reply at the heart of the eus objections appear to be the rebates offered to computer makers at issue is whether the payments were contingent upon a manufacturers using intel chips exclusively or nearly so mr sewell said the payments were simply discounts that were offered to good customers who bought intel products how to characterize the payments and indeed what sort of price incentives a dominant player ought to be allowed to use is likely to be a core area of contention "the commission has chosen certain facts which it uses to conclude that there is an exclusivity arrangement " mr sewell said "we have other facts that dispute that " mr sewell also said the commission misunderstood the payments that it characterized as inducements to cancel or delay amd based product launches any payments were part of a regular discount program he said adding that it was "failure of logic" to link the payments to any anti amd activity as for the allegation that intel sold chips at a loss mr sewell said "we reject the notion " intel he said would present an alternative calculation europes investigation has been percolating for years it was borne of a complaint to the authorities in by amd which also has brought suit in the u s and japan and filed a complaint with the german competition authority intel and amd are bitter rivals for the market in so called x chips which are at the heart of most desktop personal computers and countless millions of basic computer servers amd cheered the commissions decision to proceed with the case intel has been engaged in a "scheme using several exclusionary practices to erect a blockade to prevent consumers from using our technology " said tom mccoy amds executive vice president of legal affairs after intel replies to the statement of objections it has the right to an oral hearing and further proceedings the eu could assess fines which can be appealed mr sewell said he was watching closely microsofts appeal in its own case which is set to be decided by the european court of first instance in september
