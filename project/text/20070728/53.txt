pursuits sports memories growing up on indias links the venerable club tolly is a refuge from kolkatas chaotic street scene kolkata india even though i sliced my shot off the first tee with a borrowed driver i couldnt help but smile the last time i had played golf at the tollygunge club here was more than a quarter century earlier when as a year old i would take a five iron and tag along as my father and his friends played a round my golf playing ended shortly after i became a teenager my dad says that instead of spending four hours on a scorching sunday chasing a white ball i decided i would use the time to chase girls unsuccessfully i might add much to the delight of my father who had long ago abandoned hope of my returning to the links i took up golf again last year at a nine hole course near my then home in washington but the idea of playing golf at tollygunge with my father stuck with me and so last december i popped up unannounced in kolkata to surprise my father for his th birthday with a bottle of his favorite single malt scotch and a plan during my week long visit to play golf with him at tollygunge or "tolly " as its affectionately called a few golf purists know about the royal calcutta golf club because its the oldest golf club in asia but for those growing up in calcutta now kolkata tolly founded in was the place to be an oasis from vehicles belching smoke and blaring horns amid masses of people in a city with little greenery tolly afforded a privileged few a lush golf course on the site of a former indigo plantation for us kids though golf wasnt the real attraction while royal was for serious golfers who seemed to frown on teenage layabouts tolly had tennis courts squash courts and most important a pool it was our equivalent of the mall every sunday there was movie night where some english language film would be shown outdoors on a giant bedsheet like cloth strung between two bamboo poles our first glimpses of hollywood clint eastwood in "every which way but loose" was on those sunday nights intermission was a highlight for we would dash out to get a soda and some food many of us made a beeline for the hamburgers as good hindus we never dared eat beef in our houses but we happily gobbled the overdone burgers slathered with ketchup and powerful mustard that would shoot up your sinuses i go back to tolly every time i visit kolkata in addition to the vibrant birdlife several jackals now roam the course they are harmless and seemed well fed by the club employees and "ball boys" who hang around the water tanks fishing out errant golf balls in exchange for a few rupees i was a very good customer after stopping for sandwiches and a cool drink of coconut water or daab on the th hole i walked ahead to the th but not before my caddy stopped me from stepping on a snake next spring i plan to take my year old son and his snoopy clubs to tolly and have him follow his dad and grandfather as they play a round hopefully he wont wait years to play again
