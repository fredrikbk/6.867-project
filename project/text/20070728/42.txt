pursuits food &amp drink eating out where ribs are an art form readers weigh in on our critics search for the best barbecue sending him to alabamas top pits tuscaloosa ala shortly after i reported the results of my state tour to assess the state of our barbecue nation last month i received an impassioned email from one charles perry of birmingham ala he and many dozens of other readers wrote to tell us about favorite q haunts i had neglected to mention "the best barbecue " pursuits june all of you who wrote in tied for first in the high quality of your recommendations and i intend to keep trying them out as long as life and gut allow but mr perry rose to remarkable heights of eloquence in praise of his regions hickory smoked ribs here is some of what mr perry said "in a small town outside of birmingham cahaba heights now part of the suburb of vestavia there lies a dark carbon encrusted pit surrounded by a quaint brick structure with concrete slab floors and grease stained walls from years of preparing some of the best slow cooked swine one could ingest miss myras bbq awaits your review miss myra has truly captured the essence of the southern palate and adorns her joint with historical memorabilia of bygone days of tuscaloosa football when bear bryant showed the rest of america how football should be played not to be totally one sided she has provided a small space approximately two feet square to the other school in our state the cow college we now know as auburn " who could resist such a pitch not me and so it was that mr perry and his friend jordan brooks took me to three extraordinary shrines of the barbecue art one in birmingham and two in tuscaloosa an hour away where they both graduated from the university of alabama in the previous century mr perry a real estate developer and mr brooks an investment banker both now live in birmingham alabama is rib central just as texas emphasizes beef and this trio of restaurants all are basically rib specialists each was different but all of them represent a rooted local way of cooking and eating something that doesnt travel easily away from its home ground in the deep south eating ribs in alabama convinced me all the more that like politics in tip oneills dictum all barbecue is local its a performance art enacted by one pitmaster with a specific combination of setting ingredients goals customers in alabama that means hickory fires spicy charred ribs white sauce all prestidigitated by an individual sensibility rooted in local tradition even a brick by brick transplant of the really great joints to say the cours napoleon of the louvre with the same pitmaster as curator and all the ingredients flown in on air france wouldnt couldnt be the same of the three q temples i visited miss myras pit bar b q in birmingham was easily the furthest from those shacks in the piney woods of dixie where this most durable and ribsticking of our regional cuisines was born for example it has a sculpture collection a veritable museum of swine art consisting of hundreds of effigies of the genus sus in all its pink piggy majesty this enthusiasm for porcine imagery doesnt prevent the cheerful staff at miss myras from subjecting the racks of a multitude of hogs to moist indirect heat that produces ribs better than any i had eaten anywhere up until that moment miss myras also turns out a sublime barbecued chicken and serves white sauce spicy mayo with vinegar loyal customers started lining up at noon among them alabamas favorite son bart starr the winning quarterback for green bay in super bowls i and ii and just as important here amid so many u of alabama gridiron memorabilia also field marshal of the crimson tide back in the day he looked lean and hungry waiting to order his lunch we pressed on toward tuscaloosa and the university of alabama campus holy ground for my hosts "cant you feel your pulse quicken " mr perry asked me when we were still miles away once there we drove around the campus stopping at the football stadium to pay our respects "youll want to take your shoes off now " mr brooks announced he was only half kidding we paid our respects to full length life size statues of all the alabama coaches who had national champions notably paul "bear" bryant in coat tie and fedora looking stern then like thousands of students and alumni so loyal they show up on thursdays to set up for tailgate celebrations the week of home games we went to dreamland for ribs founded here in by the aptly named john "big daddy" bishop dreamland now has seven branches a thriving mail order business plus hats and t shirts blazoned with its slogan "aint nothing like em nowhere " big daddy is gone but his extra wide throne remains as does his ribald daughter jeannette bishop hall on football saturdays dreamland loyalists wait two and three hours to be served in this small but densely decorated adjunct of the university athletic department the ribs are worth waiting for they are smoky your taste buds tell you that when you bite into one hickory gives them a milder smokiness than the post oak they use in texas so dreamlands pit turns out a subtler taste of fire with peppy seasoning and no whiteboning the ribs pull off the rack without falling off the bone the classic indication of ideal doneness getting ribs to that point requires constant diligence and lots of poking around in a hot pit the best place to witness this precise cooking is at archibalds in a nondescript location across from a pallet factory in nearby northport archibalds is and i say this with respect a real mythic q shack the green clapboard walls arent falling down but the boards are definitely not plumb the pit is a concrete block affair attached directly to the small building and a stack of wood sits a few feet away "you know the barbecue is good if the woodpile is bigger than the restaurant " mr perry said the ribs are good indeed why not say fabulous very crisp outside moist inside betty archibald serves them in a pool of orange vinegary hot sauce their taste stands up nicely to the sauce the side dishes here are literally on the side of the wall next to the pit little bags of munchies the ribs are what counts here all three of us marveled at mrs archibalds intensity she kept opening the pits door and fussing with racks of ribs moving them around with a pitchfork the little dining room filled up with a rainbow coalition of frat boys from the university and black kids from the neighborhood and two alums staying in touch with their heritage "once betty retires " said mr perry after wed left "youll never get ribs like that again " email me at eatingout wsj com
