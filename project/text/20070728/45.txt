pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations rich man boor man so we are agreed we are living in the second great gilded age a time of startling personal wealth in the west the mansion after mansion with broad and rolling grounds in the east the apartments with foyers in which bowling teams could play or on another level the weeks vacation in disneyland or dublin with the entire family this in a nation in which well within human memory people with a week off stayed home and fixed things in the garage or drove to the beach for a day and sat on a blanket from one of the kids beds and thought this is the life the dow jones industrial average has hit the wealthy live better than kings there isnt a billionaire in east hampton who wouldnt look down on tatty old windsor castle we have a potential presidential candidate who noted to a friend that if he won the presidency the quality of his life would go down not up the gap between rich and poor is great and there is plenty of want and also confusion what the superrich do for a living now often seems utterly incomprehensible and has for at least a generation there is no word for it only an image theres a big pile of coins on a table the rich shove their hands in raise them and as the coins sift through their fingers it makes a bigger pile of coins then they sift through it again and the pile gets bigger again a general rule if you are told what someone does for a living and it makes sense to you orthodontist store owner professor that means hes not rich but if its a man in a suit who does something that takes him five sentences to explain and still you walk away confused and castigating yourself as to why you couldnt understand the central facts of the acquisition of wealth in the age you live in well chances are you just talked to a billionaire there are good things and bad in the gilded age pluses and minuses i write here of a minus it has to do with our manners the ones we show each other on the street i think riches or the pursuit of riches has made us ruder youd think broad comfort would assuage certain hungers it has not it has sharpened them heres a moment in the pushiness of the gilded age i walk into a shop on madison avenue daydreaming trying to remember what it was i thought last week i should pick up what was it "hi let me help you find what youre looking for " she is a saleswoman cracking gum with intensity about years old and she has made a beeline to her mark that would be me "mmmm actually " "we have summer sweaters on sale what size are you " her style is aggressive friendliness in another shop as soon as i walk in the door "how are you today how can i help you " those dread words "oh im sort of just looking " "i like your bag " "um thanks " what they are forcing you to do is engage if you engage "um thanks" you have a relationship if you have a relationship its easier for them to turn you upside down and shake the coins from your pockets it is like this in all the shops i go in now except for the big stores macys duane reade drugstore where they ignore you there are strategies you can do the full garbo "leave me alone " but theyll think youre a shoplifter and watch you or the strong lady with boundaries "thank you if i need help ill ask " but your reverie is broken or the acquiescent person "take me under your leadership oh aggressively friendly salesperson " but this is bowing to the pushiness of the gilded age you leave the floor for the street and meet the woman with the clipboard "do you have two seconds for the environment " again not a soft question but a challenge her question is phrased so that if you dont stop and hear her spiel you are admitting you wont give two seconds for the environment or two cents for it either you give the half smile nod shake your head walk on she looks at you as if youre the reason the earth is going to hell do they know theyre being manipulative if they have a brain they do their trainers certainly know do they know its also why no one quite trusts them do they care why would they theyre the manipulators on the street or im in a local restaurant with a friend we sat down seconds ago and are starting to catch up when "what do you want to drink " an interruption but so what we order talk my friend is getting to the punch line of the story when "we have specials this evening " not "let me know when youre ready to hear the specials " we stop talking listen the waiter stands there pad in hand "you ready " if you ask for a minute hell nod and be back in exactly one minute "do you know yet " again this is not a request one is being told to snap to it get em in get em out move em its funny in a time of recession youd think salespeople would be more aggressive because so much might hinge on the sale a commission a job in a time of relative wealth youd think they might be less aggressive but the opposite seems true technology has not helped in this area cellphones are wonderful but they empower the obnoxious and amplify the ignorant once they kept their thoughts to themselves they had no choice now they have cellphones into which they bark "im on line at duane reade yeah ex lax " oh thank you for sharing how much less my life would be if i didnt know blackberrys empower the obsessed we wouldnt have them if the economy werent high and we werent pretty well off once a political figure in new york invited me to a private dinner i was seated next to him and as the table conversation took off he leaned back quietly took out his blackberry and began to scroll it occurred to me that if i said something live in person it would not be as interesting to him as if id blackberryed him it occurred to me that if i wanted to talk to him id have to blackberry him and say "please talk to me " and then hed get the message it is possible that we are on the cellphone because we are lonely and hunger for connection even of the shallowest kind that we blackberry because we hope for a sense of control in a chaotic world that we are frightened of stillness and must interrupt conversations that we are desperate to make the sale in the highly competitive environment of the banana republic on th street and must aggressively pursue customers its also possible we have grown more boorish i think its that one many things thrive in the age of everything including bad manners
