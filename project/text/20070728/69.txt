steep discount to peers such as cadbury schweppes plc and groupe danone sa some thought the price was so low that private equity groups could make a bid for the company since then mr cescau has jettisoned unilevers frozen foods business and laid off dozens of top executives that temporarily took some of the wind out of speculation of a private equity assault but since march activist shareholder nelson peltz has acquired stakes in rivals kraft foods inc and cadbury driving their shares higher as he pushes for change that is feeding demand for similar action at unilever taking on unilever is a tougher and costlier job for rabble rousing shareholders its market capitalization is about &# billion compared with krafts &# billion moreover unilevers new chairman michael treschow has a reputation as an executive more open to shareholder complaints than predecessor antony burgmans the company also is searching for a new finance chief who some think might support the sort of changes that unilever has long resisted such as selling off its u s and european laundry detergent brands and dumping some of its worst performing food brands recent deals have highlighted the potential for bolder moves by unilever which has headquarters in london and rotterdam in july danone sold its cookie brands to kraft for &# billion and announced a deal to buy infant formula maker numico nv for billion euros &# billion a few days later cadbury has given in to shareholder demands and is selling its soft drinks arm which includes u s brands dr pepper and up possibly for as much

have that before in europe if were ever going to get change at unilever this is the time " fashion fate of jones apparel could hinge on barneys deal by rachel dodes when jones apparel group inc reports second quarter earnings wednesday beyond the numbers will lurk a more basic question can management fashion a turnaround amid a spate of executive departures and other pressures on the company that answer could start to come next week when the long awaited sale of joness top performing barneys new york retail division may be announced that would leave the apparel maker in a precarious position with its remaining brands exactly the type of department store labels that have been squeezed by retail consolidation "the most important factor is not the strength of the brand " but the strength of retailers who sell the companys brands says brad stephens an apparel industry analyst at morgan keegan &amp co in june same store sales or sales at stores open at least a year at macys joness biggest customer fell a worrisome sign the wall street consensus is that jones will earn cents a share in the second quarter a decline compared with the year earlier period for full year jones reported a &# million loss in spite of acquisitions cost cutting and design overhauls joness stock has been in a slump for several years after masterminding the deal to sell barneys last month jones chief executive peter boneparth resigned and was succeeded by wes card the chief financial officer the shake up left industry observers wondering if the company which tried unsuccessfully to sell itself last year was preparing again for a sale joness board is still open to it according to people familiar with the situation mr boneparth increasingly at odds with the board over its decision to put itself on the block said in may that jones was seeking to exit some poorly performing moderate brands jones plans to give some proceeds from the barneys sale back to shareholders while also investing in its core businesses the question is whether increased investment can save traditional brands like jones new york anne klein and gloria vanderbilt as department store square footage declines and emphasis on higher margin private label apparel grows when jones bought barneys in industry watchers were baffled arguing a maker of midtier apparel had no synergies with an upscale retail chain but through barneys the company was able to partake in the luxury goods boom the chain has expanded to locations since jones paid &# million for it in june istithmar the investment arm of the dubai government agreed to buy barneys for &# million but the deal gave jones unusual freedom to consider third party bids for either barneys or for the entire company jones later received an unsolicited &# million offer from fast retailing co of japan which owns the mass market uniqlo apparel chain jones has until aug to complete negotiations with fast retailing but a person familiar with the situation expects a deal with either fast retailing or istithmar to be announced before then some barneys executives have expressed a preference for istithmar arguing it would be less to try to influence the chains merchandising decisions according to a person familiar with executives thinking a barneys spokeswoman declined to comment steel u s producers take on imports by robert guy matthews monday a group of american steel associations will release a report that says china steelmakers get tax breaks loans and all manner of government subsidies that make for unfair competition the release is timed as a pre emptive assault aimed to sway import duty hearings to be held next week by the international trade commission the itc on tuesday and wednesday is taking testimony on whether to continue leveling extra charges on hot rolled steel from several foreign countries including china the groups that commissioned the study the american iron and steel institute the steel manufacturers association the committee on pipe and tube imports and the specialty steel industry of north america said the results show that the chinese steel industry won &# billion in financial assistance over the past years a spokesperson from the china steel industry association declined to comment on the report to be sure american steel mills get subsidies also most notably many u s mills went through bankruptcy in the past few years and cast millions of dollars in retiree benefits onto the government only to emerge leaner and more profitable several domestic and foreign producers are expected to testify at the hearings next week to determine whether existing duties on imported steel from china india ukraine and nine other countries should be continued "it is ridiculous to conclude that these duties would be continued for another five years " says dave phelps president of american institute for international steel a group that represents both u s and foreign companies including those from china who import and export steel products the itcs final decision wouldnt likely come until september or october american steelmakers are used to the imports vs domestic steel battle and have recently won cases involving reinforced bar steel but next weeks hearing could be a tough one the u s needs to import to of its steel because domestic mills even running at full tilt cant make enough to meet domestic demand moreover steelmakers will have to prove they are being harmed by imports and the u s steel market isnt a great place for imported steel these days with foreign steelmakers able to fetch higher prices outside of the u s "the u s price is the key reason why steel imports to the u s should decline " according to a july goldman sachs steel analyst research note transportation costs also are high hovering around &# a ton just to get the steel from the foreign maker to the u s s east or west coasts tack on a few more dollars a ton to get it to the midwest and the profit margin is wiped out finally the dollar is weak making it even less profitable for foreign steelmakers to sell in the u s as a result fewer imports are washing ashore steel imports in may the latest period available fell compared with may american steelmakers are expected to argue however that imports increased from aprils numbers especially from china indeed chinese imports grew normally a huge alarm to domestic steelmakers the increase however may be a one month blip chinas ministry of finance began a program this month that cuts the tax rebate on some exported steel so exports likely rose to take advantage of the rebate while it was still in place
