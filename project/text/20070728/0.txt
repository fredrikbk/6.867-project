advise and repent welcome to arlen specter the b side one week after standing up for the nomination of judge leslie southwick a bush appeals court nominee being stonewalled by democrats the mercurial republican from philadelphia has come up with a strange new quest on tuesday the judiciary committees ranking republican announced his plans to "review" the confirmation hearing testimony of supreme court justices john roberts and samuel alito to see how it matches their decisions on the bench "there are things he has said and i want to see how well he has complied with it " senator specter said of the chief justice according to the politico web site they must be falling over at the american bar association its widely agreed that it would be unseemly and improper for a nominee to seek confirmation to the nations highest court by promising senators how he or she would rule on a given issue on the bench yet mr specters statement suggests that he thinks he pocketed such promises from justices alito and roberts and he now wants to check to see if theyve been kept stranger still mr specter says he was inspired by a recent meeting with supreme court justice stephen breyer in aspen the clinton appointee made clear in his dissents last year that he disagrees with the direction of the roberts court but mr specter reported that justice breyer told him in aspen that "there were eight" cases in which the court had either overturned or undermined earlier precedents we hope justice breyer isnt kibbitzing the senate to inquire into why his views havent prevailed with a majority of his colleagues on the court well wait for more explanation from mr specter but hes wading into questionable separation of powers territory here the judiciary committee could certainly find other uses for its time with federal court vacancies piling up around the country but the backlog of nominees waiting to get a hearing may be precisely the point as democratic senator dick durbin put it investigating the confirmation testimony of justices roberts and alito "could lead us to a different approach" to future confirmation hearings how so lie detector tests mr specters bugbear seems to be supreme court precedent which he wants the new justices to follow more rigorously but while both justices promised to take precedent seriously neither one vowed to adhere to it in all cases facts differ from case to case and this is precisely why judicial nominees refuse to predict how they would rule on topics to prevent politicians from usurping the role of the judiciary and turning judges into senators with robes moreover bad precedents are overturned all the time often by majorities joined by justice breyer when a narrow liberal majority was overturning precedents on the juvenile death penalty or gay rights in recent years mr specter showed no similar alarm plessy v ferguson was a year old precedent before it was overturned in brown v board and were grateful it was in any case mr specters concern about the alleged radicalism of the new justices is hard to take seriously the roberts court has so far followed a path of incremental jurisprudence issuing narrow opinions that have gone out of their way not to overturn precedents on abortion school supervision and desegregation the chief justice even ducked a ripe opportunity to overturn the courts tortured ruling on the constitutionality of campaign finance reform laws in mcconnell v fec congress does have jurisdiction over the courts including their funding and the size of judicial jurisdictions it also have the power to impeach only a few years ago former house majority leader tom delay floated the impeachment idea for judges who werent on "good behavior " and the democratic outrage was thunderous former justice sandra day oconnor responded with a speech about the importance of judicial independence somehow the senates plans for a political scrub of justices alito and roberts havent inspired the same indignation but that doesnt mean they are any less of an exercise in political intimidation
