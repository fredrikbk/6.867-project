remembrances john gilman artificial grass crusader campaigned to stomp out astroturf and turf toe john gilman was fond of saying that he wanted his headstone to read "here lies the guy who buried astroturf " with his artificial turf product fieldturf he went a long way toward doing just that mr gilman took a product originally invented for golf tees and challenged the dominant astroturf selling fieldturf to colleges then pro stadiums across the country by with astroturfs parent company in bankruptcy court mr gilman put his companys share at of the north american market what astroturf once had joe digeronimo an athletic facilities consultant who worked with mr gilman on various turf installations recalls an early victory when retired university of nebraska cornhuskers coach tom osborne "walked across a field and asked wheres the turf and gilman said youre walking on it " on monday mr gilman died at his montreal home at the age of fieldturf technology was based on patents filed by freddie haas jr a golfer best remembered for ending byron nelsons game winning streak in mr haas invented a kind of artificial turf to use at golf tees in the s canadian tennis pro jean prevost licensed it to build grass tennis courts a canadian who played and coached football in the early s for the montreal alouettes of the canadian football league mr gilman later spent two decades in the luggage business in he joined mr prevost at what was then syntennico inc taking the chief executive post and began developing fieldturf mr gilman wanted a product that would respond to complaints by some athletes of rug burns "turf toe" and other injuries from playing on astroturf he once called astroturf "a terrible piece of carpet " an astroturf spokeswoman said that astroturf had had a reputation for causing burns and other injuries and said the company is trying to overturn "years of bad publicity " the company had no comment on fieldturfs market share claims fieldturf developers increased turf padding then added a substrate of sand and rubber that gave way when a runner made a cut much like real dirt "thats the third dimension the ability to make a divot " says john n rogers iii a professor in the crop and soil science department at michigan state university of fieldturfs properties propylene grass blades helped cut down on the rug burn too mr gilman liked to demonstrate how different fieldturf was at product expos by taking off his shirt and doing a sliding belly flop mr gilman set out to find a high profile client who would showcase the product in he persuaded mr osborne and a year later fieldturf was installed at nebraskas memorial stadium mr digeronimo says he installed a fieldturf putting green at former president george h w bushs home in kennebunkport maine after the nebraska install sales took off especially at college football stadiums and practice fields in a group of national football league quarterbacks including jim kelly of the buffalo bills boomer easiason john elway and dan marino in association with aig horizon partners llc committed millions of dollars in venture capital to the firm fieldturf is "not a cure all " says mr rogers the michigan state professor citing the high cost a typical football field might run between &# and &# million not much when compared with professional athlete salaries but a bundle at a public high school he adds "it has made people like me come up with even better solutions for high schools to put in natural fields " mr gilman oversaw the installation of artificial grass at thousands of athletic fields and stadiums including eight nfl stadiums and three major league baseball stadiums the company says fifa the international governing body of soccer approved fieldturf for international matches and professional fields across europe have installed it in french company tarkett of nanterre a floor covering concern bought fieldturf and mr gilman continued as a high marketing executive of the combined company fieldturf lays claim to half the north american artificial turf market with annual revenue of &# million john planek athletic director at loyola university chicago says he likes how the fieldturf soccer and softball field the university installed in cuts down on maintenance not just lawn work but also the messy process of painting on boundary lines meanwhile astroturf has come back general sports venue llc of raleigh n c has licensed the iconic brand and is using it to create artificial turf fields it claims are even more like real grass than fieldturfs daniel e koshland jr levis heir chose genes over jeans as pathbreaking scientist and educator in science daniel e koshland jr was a triple threat he experimented he edited americas flagship journal of science and he shook up a major institutions teaching of biology "in a way the magazine im editing now is dans magazine " says donald kennedy editor in chief of science which mr koshland edited from to "its pretty even now between science and nature " the leading british science journal mr kennedy credits mr koshland with broadening sciences coverage "from astronomy to zoology" and giving it new influence in policy circles mr koshland died monday in walnut creek calif at age an heir to part of the levi strauss &amp co fortune mr koshland appeared for many years on lists of the wealthiest americans but he was more interested in genes than jeans and as a young scientist was already making his mark in basic research he challenged a century old consensus on enzymes compounds that act as catalysts in biochemical reactions as a researcher with a joint appointment at the brookhaven national laboratory on long island and the rockefeller university in new york he proposed that enzymes could change shape to start the reactions a process he compared to a hand fitting into a glove the young scientist came under old guard fire one reviewer said the established "fischer key lock theory has lasted years and will not be overturned by speculation from an embryonic scientist " but mr koshlands "induced fit" model became the new orthodoxy by the s hed turned to studying how bacteria orient themselves in relation to their environment and showed that they can have rudimentary memories that can affect their behavior another kind of behavior the professorial sort became mr koshlands next focus after becoming chairman of the biochemistry department of the university of california at berkeley he spearheaded a reorganization of the entire study of biology that saw departments shrunk to three he consolidated into departments of molecular and cell biology integrative biology devoted to whole organisms and plant and microbial biology reflecting advances in genetics and other life science studies "i think no one else could have pulled it off " says robert tjian uc berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology mr tjian said the reorganization made graduate student applications "shoot through the roof" and influenced changes at other institutions mr koshland called the reorganization "one of the high points of my life " named editor of science in mr koshland placed a strong stamp on the journal he strengthened its news and features departments and redesigned the book to make it more colorful mr koshlands whimsy came out in his monthly editorials which often featured a colloquy with a certain dr noitall "inventor of the chain letter and insider trading " who inevitably represented the stodgiest side of science the navy rejected mr koshland during world war ii for nearsightedness but his berkeley chemistry professor recruited him to work on the manhattan project and mr koshland spent most of the war purifying plutonium in oak ridge tenn he received a doctorate in organic chemistry from the university of chicago in mr koshland endowed the marian koshland science museum of the national academy of sciences in washington d c named for his wife an immunologist who died in even while reorganizing berkeley and editing science mr koshland continued to work as a researcher he published more than papers and his awards included a national medal of science in in recent years mr koshland became interested in finding ways to use blue green algae to produce methane as biofuel
