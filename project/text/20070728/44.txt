pursuits food &amp drink in the kitchen battle of the gazpachos two approaches one traditional one with a twist to a summertime soup special to the wall street journal just about the only way you cant have this soup is hot in washington spanish born chef jose andres makes a version of gazpacho with watermelon adds gelatin and serves it on a plate at tia pol in new york city its a puree of tomatoes cucumber and bell pepper poured into a glass calima in marbella spain makes gazpacho with cherries cheese and anchovies and a variety featuring oysters and vanilla in fact just about every restaurant from here to spain has a different take on it for diners the wide variety of interpretations is either exciting or confusing depending on how you feel about anchovies and your reverence for tradition versus acceptance of change when you order it in a restaurant you never quite know what is going to arrive but historically speaking this flexibility is entirely appropriate both because gazpacho has taken on many forms throughout time and because not even food historians agree on what constitutes a truly authentic version some version of the dish was likely introduced to spain by the muslims a k a the moors who invaded the iberian peninsula in according to food writer clifford a wright author of "a mediterranean feast " "the name gazpacho probably comes from the mozarab word caspa which means fragments residue or little pieces " describing the broken up bread that is a foundation of the dish little in gazpacho history however is undisputed some historians posit that the soup might have originated with the romans who had a penchant for pureeing foods in the case of ancient gazpacho bread olive oil garlic vinegar and water with a mortar and pestle there are also linguistic roots for the word gazpacho in hebrew further complicating the picture christopher columbus takes credit for the soups most famous innovation the introduction of tomatoes and peppers to spain around though mr wright says it wasnt until at least that they were incorporated into the dish the soup enjoyed both lowbrow and high class appeal andalusian field workers ate it for lunch on hot summer days and some historians say that eugenia de montijo the andalusian wife of napoleon iii brought it to the french court in the th century today gazpacho is one of the national foods of spain served everywhere during the summer in myriad versions the first documented sighting of gazpacho in the u s is in mary randolphs "the virginia housewife " a cookbook published in its popularity has ebbed and flowed here since then surging with an increase of american tourism to spain in the s and again in the late s when the tapas trend started to take off one thing about gazpacho is indisputable just about everyone who has a version believes his is the only true authentic recipe in the cookbook "the new spanish table " writer anya von bremzen opines that gazpachos "defining ingredient is actually bread " while jose andres points to sherry vinegar and good spanish olive oil as prerequisite the strictest mandate ironically comes from dani garcia the spanish chef who makes the versions with cherry and anchovy additions that he says are acceptable only if the base of the soup is pure "gazpacho is a cold soup featuring bread olive oil and sherry vinegar " plus some quantity of tomato "if it is not this way " says mr garcia "it is not a gazpacho " those are fighting words and im a gazpacho lightweight so when i applied all of my research to making my own gazpacho i made sure to include all the mandatory ingredients spanish extra virgin olive oil sherry vinegar bread and tomatoes plus a bunch of other things i happen to think taste good including basil cumin lemon and jalapeno peppers the journals katy mclaughlin provides her own purist take above inspired by the gypsies of seville but the truth about gazpacho at least as this american has come to understand it is that nobody can say with absolute authority what gazpacho is or isnt it is like a song that was written for the express purpose of being covered gazpacho with basil and lemon this version of gazpacho uses all of the essential historical ingredients bread garlic olive oil sherry vinegar and tomatoes but from there it takes some liberties namely the addition of lemon juice to balance the acidity jalapeno pepper for heat and a generous amount of basil to add a fragrant blast of summer it also uses the tomato water and seeds which are discarded in most gazpacho recipes to soak the bread the recipe calls for both a food processor and a blender the processor makes it easier to combine all the ingredients in one fell swoop while the close confines of a blender yield a finer end result by all means adapt this recipe adding more water for a thinner even more pourable version more basil for a more pronounced herbaceous quality or more jalapeno or a few of its seeds for extra heat this recipe makes about five cups of gazpacho which will fill most processors and or blenders to near capacity if you want to make more just double or triple the recipe make it in batches and combine the batches in a large pitcher or two in theory it will keep for about two days in the refrigerator though its unlikely to be there that long gazpacho especially on hot summer days is addictive and tends to go fast andrew friedman  cup or day old bread crust removed in inch cubes from about ounces of bread with the crust on  pounds vine ripened tomatoes or tomatoes  cup cold water preferably purified or bottled water

stems from the tomatoes and cut off just enough of their tops to expose the seeds one by one hold the tomatoes over the bread and squeeze the seeds into the bowl if the tomato seeds and tomato water do not cover the bread add just enough cold water to cover roughly chop the tomatoes put them in a separate bowl and season them with salt pepper and a pinch of sugar let the tomatoes and bread sit for minutes by hand squeeze as much liquid as possible out of the bread and put the bread in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade add about a tablespoon of the oil the garlic cumin

glass classic gazpacho to my mind dani garcia has a lot of nerve talking like a purist while spiking his gazpacho with vanilla and fish i learned how to make gazpacho while living part time in seville spain where i was producing a dance company made up mostly of gypsy flamenco dancers gypsies tend to be traditionalists to say the least and i took to heart their message about gazpacho its fresh tomatoes cucumbers and bell pepper a little garlic some oil and vinegar bread and salt nothing more nothing less i wont even order gazpacho in a restaurant anymore because im so afraid theyll give me something else heres the sacred recipe katy mclaughlin  to inch squared hunk of stale baguette bread crusts removed  small garlic clove  medium sized cucumber roughly chopped  red bell pepper cored

for minutes peel garlic drop into blender and blend until finely minced squeeze bread until as dry as possible and put in blender along with cucumber blend to smooth adding a bit of the oil if it doesnt liquefy once smooth add peppers and blend to smooth then add tomatoes and blend add the oil vinegar and salt blend then taste adding more vinegar and salt as needed chill then serve in a glass
