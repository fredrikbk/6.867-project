investors surf choppier market global markets have been placid for five years spurring investors to get bullish on stocks and riskier bonds now with markets on edge stock market trading activity is at record levels and volatility is back with a vengeance reaching month highs rising volatility along with heavy trading volume isnt necessarily troubling there have been similar recent periods when volatility or sharp moves in the prices of securities soared to these levels and each time markets rebounded sharply and a surge in volume doesnt indicate which way stocks are headed next it feels worse this time around to some though because it has been so long since they had to deal with these kinds of jumpy markets just as important potential dangers are higher so many traders have been using heavy leverage or borrowed money which can amplify gains and losses as july comes to a close more traders fear that hedge funds will start selling to meet possible margin calls from lenders or redemption requests from their investors and it is getting harder for some large investors to get certain trades done in parts of the bond market because their brokers are wary of buying riskier debt amid worries about fallout from the difficulties of subprime mortgage borrowers the volatility index or vix which tracks investors expectations about future stock market bumpiness has risen to which is considered reasonably high by historical standards it was as low as in may or more than below its average during the past years the vix measures future volatility of the standard &amp poors options that trade on the chicago board options exchange inc calculated daily by the cboe it is widely followed because it captures expectations of how volatility will change an assessment that includes current levels of volatility since the end of the vix hasnt finished a month above and was as low as this january since the fall of when the current bull market began the vix climbed past just eight times still the current level is well below the level the index reached in september after russia defaulted on its debt and credit markets seized up higher volatility is important because if the market stays this bumpy it likely will affect shares "if were looking at sustained uptrend in volatility investors will require a higher rate of return to get involved in the market so that will put pressure on prices " says jack ablin chief investment officer of harris private bank in chicago "if you buy something thats bouncing around a lot more it means theres more risk and you have to be paid for that " still the current bout of jitters isnt especially unusual when the standard &amp poors stock index fell from its highs in march about the amount the stock market has fallen recently the vix nearly hit when the s&amp p declined about in june of last year the vix approached in both instances volatility soon dropped and stocks rebounded another reason not to focus on volatility when it comes to stocks it usually is a coincident indicator when the market goes down abruptly volatility jumps in commodities and other markets it serves more as a leading indicator according data from james bianco who runs bianco research in chicago investors should worry about volatility only if it becomes disproportionate to the move in the stock market mr bianco says "it would be a sign of panic " the past weeks selloff in heavy trading could mean investors are capitulating that is why rising volume and the record levels of recent days have some excited thursday a record billion shares changed hands on the nations three major stock exchanges but analysts say volume is just one of many indicators and others like the number of stocks declining versus those rising are more bearish more worrisome is the lack of trading liquidity or the ease at which investors can get in and out of riskier bond positions trading has slowed drastically for credit default swaps which are insurance policies that profit when bonds drop in price there is virtually no activating in collateralized debt obligations or pools of debt a key market that has helped financing leveraged buyouts that lack of buying is important because as much as &# billion in mergers that have been announced havent yet been financed and most of the money for those deals will be borrowed in the credit markets "thats whats scaring the heck out of people everyone knows the supply of debt is coming and the deals wont get done unless the market gets going again " mr bianco says banks also are demanding that hedge funds produce more collateral to back their borrowings forcing some hedge funds to do some selling to raise cash still eric rosenfeld who helped lead long term capital management llc the connecticut hedge fund that collapsed in roiling the markets along the way says "this is not even close to " mr rosenfeld who now runs his own hedge fund adds "it is a sea change and it will form expectations in the near future but markets are still very orderly "
