pursuits entertainment &amp culture essay generation hex a first time reader of the potter books searches for meaning in the final volume there is conceit often a conceit at the heart of any decision to pick up and read a new book mine in the case of "harry potter and the deathly hallows " is that i had not read a single one of j k rowlings books until earlier this week and so fancied myself indeed reveled in the status of a harry potter virgin why reveled because in matters of reading it is often gratifying to spurn membership of a tribe and a whopping great tribe there is of harry potter readers all imbued with the contentment of having gorged at a communal trough yet the arrival of the latest harry potter is an event so gusty that to stand in its way would be foolhardy besides the book would appear to offer such conclusive evidence of the way we read now that it would be cultural dereliction to ignore it if theres a fuss shouldnt all sentient beings want to know what its all about when an entire society converges on an object in this case a book do we not learn as much about that society as we do about the book a mass relationship with a book is not a new or an always pleasant phenomenon the muslim world once converged menacingly on "the satanic verses " "the da vinci code" stoked global ideas of conspiracy appearing in some minds to subvert the bible in these times of oprah book clubs and one click ordering on amazon it is easier than ever to effect a literary contagion with barnes &amp noble and the like america is now as much a middle brow nation as a middle class one with books valued not just for their textual content but also for their appeal as accessories and harry potter it seems has become the most striking accessory of all so it was with an almost forensic bent that i purchased a copy of "the deathly hallows" at san francisco international airport to the obvious satisfaction of the sales clerk at the bookstore and carried it on board my flight to new york as an additional piece of hand luggage in the plane tribal certitudes revealed themselves a man in the row ahead was reading the book avidly and was hurtling toward the end the woman seated to my left clucked approvingly when she saw my tome the stewardess on her drinks round clearly not a muggle said "oh harry potter " and smiled i think i got a brief look from an old curmudgeon that indicated disapproval or "disapprobation " as ms rowling might prefer to put it but i cannot be sure as i began the book i soon realized that my potter naivete was an illusion naturally as the father of an year old boy ive seen the movies the characters were all old friends and even though i was entering the series at its seventh and last textual installment i rarely felt lost in a narrative maze or flummoxed by strange phrases when the girl hermione utters "wingardium leviosa" a pseudo latin spell designed to make the object of attention levitate i knew exactly what she meant having seen her say so already in a twelveplex a year ago and later when i encountered the incantation "expelliarmus " spoken by harry potter i had to do no more than turn to my son to ask for an explanation "its a way to make the wand of the person youre fighting fly up in the air " he said pointing with a rigid hand at a bookshelf and shouting out the word lazy i know to ask him i should have read on and worked it out myself deciphering its meaning from the narrative developments but i think laziness is a theme that runs increasingly through our reading of the harry potter series from about book four onward the books have run parallel with movie versions of the story and the effect of this coexistence must i think have diminished the texts and a reading of them once depicted on screen the characters harry ron hermione dumbledore hagrid voldemort the lot became concrete images instead of creatures of pure imagination whose contours varied from mind to mind in every childs head now harry looks and sounds the same from the moment "harry potter and the sorcerers stone" arrived at a cinema near us in we switched from being readers to being consumers of harry potter one can see the effects of this on ms rowling "the deathly hallows" reads as much like a blueprint for a movie as it does a novel as a literary exercise or experiment this is all quite unprecedented movies have overtaken texts before one cannot read "lolita" now without thinking of james mason or "tom jones" without albert finney but these were single books written and moved on from here with the ongoing harry potter we have had a literary and imaginative double life each book with its cinematic corollary each genre infecting our appreciation of the other having only read the last book and assuming perhaps rashly that the quality of ms rowlings writing has remained constant through the series i cannot but declare the movies to be superior there can be no doubting ms rowlings narrative skill theres no hanging about in the story something happens on every page but as many have noted the prose is undistinguished with a grating amount of schoolgirl latin thrown in to impress the oiks grating also after a while are her names dickens was the master of polysyllabic mischief with nomenclature chuzzlewit tulkinghorne etc but he knew where to draw the line cratchits first name was bob not casimir or cristoforo ms rowlings names are relentlessly clever clever and theres one unsubtle dedalus diggle too many at least to this jaded palate indeed in all of dickens there is only one character whose name appears to be constructed by a heavy hand and that is honoria dedlock in "bleak house " she would fit right into the rowling universe all that said weve had a generation come of age with harry potter as its literary leitmotif of sorts it could well be that we are formally entering the post potter cultural era five or years from now kids whose dominant childhood literary experience was harry potter will be entering the work force they started as tykes with book one and finished high school with book seven im assuming here that ms rowling means to drop this theme altogether although there are signs in the mawkish epilogue to "the deathly hallows" that she might pick up the thread of her tale again setting it in the next generation at hogwarts some have asked whether we should fear or cheer for a world whose kids have derived some elements of their childhood morality from harry potters manichaean world i think the question is overblown for one thing the movies have ensured as movies often do that the stories have acquired the shape of pure fun detached from the darkness and light that can reside within private readings of text furthermore what cinema has done is to wrench the story from the hands of the young and to place it firmly within the grasp of people of all ages instead of being a saga that knit together a particular generation harry potters yarn became the object of a trans generational focus that drained the story of much of its allegorical fuel as a collective obsession it has of course been hugely more edifying than "american idol " and harry potter is much better value than sanjaya malakar there is a broader aesthetic appeal to the potter books one that lies in their size and span it is a pleasure to see a heft of words in an age when everything bar the human body is slight and in which even the great newspapers are under pressure to run shorter and shorter stories the books and their bulk and their ongoing narrative are a nice counter to the short attention span in kids today im a fussy grown up who prefers his fables to be by proust or anthony powell had i been years younger i dare say id have wallowed in the world of harry potter an untaxing phantasmic place where the boys and girls in the action are all of the sort youd like sitting in school at the desk near yours see
