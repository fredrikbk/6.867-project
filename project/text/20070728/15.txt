feeding billions a grain at a time as development and climate change imperil rice yields scientists seek new green revolution "even the most resourceful housewife cannot create miracles from a pantry that lacks rice " chinese proverb ludhiana india famine was a scourge a generation ago when farmers in this dusty region received the first seed packets of a new strain of rice designed to grow hardier plants and feed more people than ever before the rice known as ir by the scientists who developed it brought the green revolution here to indias punjab region in the s local farmers were on the front lines of a movement that affected billions of people around the world who depend on rice as their staple food the new varieties of rice developed by a small laboratory in the philippines spurred an agricultural boom that transformed lives and nations its a boom that now is at risk of going bust rice yields are flat lining over production has exhausted the soil that once supported the larger crops water shortages abound and the price of the worlds most eaten food is rising steeply up about since according to u s agencies now huge populations that subsist on rice in mostly poor stretches of the globe are suffering the deleterious effects in china where higher food costs have contributed to a troubling rise in inflation over the past year year old grain vendor meng qingyu said he recently hiked the price of rice by to about cents a pound "i cant stop the price from rising " he said "people always complain " its not just an issue for his customers mr meng whos been running his grain shop selling rice and other goods on a bustling street in downtown shanghai for years said that higher grain prices have already wiped out some of his profits the trend could worsen if prices keep climbing in the foothills outside manila scientists at the international rice research institute a laboratory with a staff of are scrambling to overcome these problems by breathing new life into the revolution their predecessors helped create some researchers are experimenting with seed varieties that can withstand droughts or floods others are growing rice in dry soil much like corn rather than flooded paddies strategies also include trying to alter the way rice plants perform photosynthesis and concocting hybrid varieties that can boost yields by as much as "were not naive enough to think well solve everything " says robert zeigler a year old american who is director general of the irri but when it comes to new high tech rice he adds "if we dont take a hard look at that who the hell will " the green revolutions benefits reverberated well beyond food allowing developing nations like india to set aside fears of famine and focus more on building modern economies by investing in other industries but now economists are worrying about the lack of new advances in agriculture stalled progress they say is starting to weigh on growth in india and elsewhere and could force governments to divert more resources back to agriculture or face slower growth in the years ahead dan basse president of agresource co a chicago research firm estimates that as many as million to million acres of additional arable land may need to come on line globally over the next three to four years just to sustain current agricultural stocks already at very low levels many of the pressures facing rice have been building in other agricultural products as well especially in asia after years of healthy gains in production farmers are also now facing constraints in their ability to increase yields on wheat barley palm oil and other crops the construction of factories apartment blocks and highways is paving over usable land in china india and indonesia india has underinvested in agriculture for decades as it fostered its high tech services and manufacturing industries climate change may be playing a role too by increasing the frequency of extreme droughts and floods surrounded by about acres of test paddies the scientists from irri raise plants in climate controlled chambers from more than seed varieties collected by irri since the s the seeds are stored in a refrigerated unit with walls thick enough to withstand a nuclear blast near manila some of the institutes recent advances already are being tested in the punjab including one strain of rice that grows in dry dirt but the scientists readily acknowledge it is an uphill battle to find breakthroughs that will make a big difference many of their innovations like some that turned out to be highly susceptible to insects have fallen far short of expectations at the same time demand for some agricultural commodities is expanding at its fastest pace in decades as new markets open up for grains to make ethanol and other types of alternative energy that has sent grain prices soaring it also has increased the price of foods that arent used for alternative fuel including rice because farmers are dedicating more land to alternative energy crops the amount of land dedicated to rice has fallen to less than million acres from million acres in and many economists believe it will decline further although rice yields are still inching up world wide by slightly less than a year says the u s department of agriculture the rate of increase has slowed considerably since the s and s as gains from high tech seeds developed in the s and afterwards peter out stocks of rice which is responsible for one fifth of the worlds caloric intake are at their lowest levels since the s when food shortages led to temporary famines in asia one answer economists and experts say is to find ways to cultivate rice in less than ideal land and in marginal places similar strategies are now being tested in the mining and oil industries which are trying to eke out new supplies from hostile environments or ever more remote locations the irri was founded during similar concerns about food supply in the s and s at that time world leaders worried that famines would increase as populations rose in developing nations such as india then scientists at a research station in mexico introduced new wheat varieties that could respond better to fertilizer and produce more grain the rockefeller and ford foundations founded irri in with the philippines government to seek similar results in rice u s president lyndon johnson visited the site in to spur the scientists on india was quick to adopt one result of the institutes early research ir a rice variety that produced more grains of rice per plant when properly plied with fertilizer and water government officials chose the punjab a region north of new delhi the capital because it had a reliable water supply and a history of agricultural innovation by the mid s rice yields had risen to six tons a hectare or about acres from two tons in the s other states emulated punjabs success and other countries adopted the new seeds the price of rice dropped to a low of less than &# a ton in from more than &# a ton in the s since the s india has been a major net exporter of rice shipping nearly million tons last year but annual yield increases began to slow over the past decade farmers cranked up fertilizer and water use draining the water table many began planting two crops a year taxing the soil punjabi area officials discouraged farmers from planting two crops and in some places outlawed it but many farmers ignored them "im doing mischief against the government " concedes kanwar singh a year old farmer as he surveyed his second rice crop recently on a stretch of flooded land near the northern india city of karnal he says he now has to pump water from feet below the surface compared with feet years ago "in a year or two maybe it will be finished " he says at irri officials figure the only way to slip this trap is to come up with new technologies a major emphasis since mr zeigler became the director general in a bearded professorial figure he is an ardent proponent of agricultural technology including genetically modified seeds a former peace corps volunteer in the early s mr zeigler says he saw first hand how the failure of a key crop cassava could cause starvation and other problems in zaire now known as the democratic republic of congo "they thought it was witch doctors evil spirits " he says "i thought if we could use science to bring some of the benefits to people wed really be making a difference " he studied at cornell university and worked with peter jennings a scientist who was one of the founding fathers of the green revolution in rice he also worked for agriculture programs in burundi in africa before joining irri in when he took the helm mr zeigler tried to energize and focus the institutions research often by taking advantage of recent improvements in scientific knowledge of the genetic makeup of rice he also pressed researchers to delve into technological solutions to climate change and its effects on rice so that rice could grow on stressed land and be more resistant to floods and droughts "zeigler believes that with a few imaginative scientists you can really make a change " says randy barker an agricultural economist who worked at irri in the s and s and recently returned to serve as acting head of irris social sciences department though he acknowledges some progress so far he says "i dont see any major breakthroughs " some rural development experts have criticized irri sharply over the years for promoting rice varieties like ir that require heavy doses of water fertilizer and other chemicals they believe those methods contributed to the same environmental problems that the irri worries about now they also fear that irris tech heavy slant could leave farmers dependent on expensive new seeds that require special care or costly chemicals to generate good results scientists at irri "see plants as little machines and redesign them" endlessly but thats not always the best approach says norman uphoff a cornell university professor and rice specialist he acknowledges that the irri is doing some good work but he is from the camp that advocates lower tech solutions such as spacing seeds farther apart so the plants can get more sunlight that simple technique he says can boost plant growth officials at irri say that some past approaches might have short changed the environment but that higher rice yields also helped save lives the institute says it is now far more focused on environmentally sustainable technologies such as methods that use less water irris annual budget of about &# million comes chiefly from development agencies in the u s japan and other wealthy countries though it does accept some money from private companies although companies like monsanto co of the u s also do some rice research the industry also relies heavily on irri to lead the way when irri develops new seeds it makes them available for free to anyone who requests them in labs housed in irris cluster of office blocks abdelbagi ismail a sudanese scientist is working on developing flood tolerant rice strains although rice typically grows in water some portion of the plant usually must remain above the water to take in oxygen to produce flood tolerant strains mr ismail takes existing rice varieties often from irris seed bank that tend to do well in floods he then mixes varieties together to breed better strains he raises them in outdoor fields as well as indoor climate controlled growth chambers that allow him to control the amount of light and humidity "then we see which ones make it " he says in a field a short drive from his office the results are clear the entire area was submerged underwater for days on one side where he planted ordinary rice seeds most of the stalks are now dead or gone a few feet away a thick harvest of erect stalks shoots up from the ground the product of flood tolerant seeds similar varieties are currently being distributed in india and other countries to test their success in real world settings researchers also are cultivating "aerobic" rice that can grow in dry soil rather than flooded paddies one of irris most ambitious projects is known as "c" rice the basic idea is to make rice behave more like corn and other plants that perform a particularly efficient form of photosynthesis involving four carbon atoms rice photosynthesis involves only three carbon atoms one approach under consideration though not yet performed involves genetically modifying the plant by transplanting genes from corn or other c plants into rice to see if it produces a c rice crop john sheehy a british physicist heading the research contends that c rice could boost rice production by as much as while potentially reducing its need for water and fertilizer the prospect of genetically modifying rice is opposed by anti gmo advocates who fear it could result in unexpected diseases crop failures or other problems gm watch a united kingdom based group that opposes the use of genetically modified organisms includes irri on its list of "whos who in the fight to force feed us gmos " other critics contend that c simply isnt a good use of research funds because of the risk it wont result in higher yields or produce seeds too expensive for farmers to buy mr zeigler concedes c could be "a total fizzle " but he says its still worth the time and effort given that other approaches cant generate such large yield gains once a promising new seed is developed irri officials work with local governments and universities to help spread the word to farmers through newspapers and agricultural fairs but persuading farmers to use technologies like aerobic seeds is not always easy slowly though some farmers are adopting irris innovations lakhbir singh this year planted aerobic rice for the first time he says his costs have tripled over the past decade his well was about feet deep years ago now its down to feet and he has to use a special submersible engine to help haul the water to surface the health of his soil has deteriorated so hes using more fertilizer "im still a little doubtful " he says "but if it works that will be good well save some natural resources "
