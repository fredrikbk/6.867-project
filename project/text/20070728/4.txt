bancroft wrangling intensifies as bid deadline looms for dow jones splits in the family remain as a monday deadline neared for the bancroft family to decide on rupert murdochs &# billion offer for dow jones &amp co last minute wrangling by family members and their trustees intensified family lawyers were scrambling friday to change the voting structure of the biggest bancroft trust so it would better reflect the views of all the beneficiaries the trusts overseers include christopher bancroft a prominent family member who has been outspoken in his opposition to the deal the restructuring could dilute mr bancrofts influence over the stock now held in the trust on friday another key family trust seen as an important swing vote was planning to oppose the deal according to a person familiar with the situation the trust overseen by a denver law firm holds of dow joness voting stock and is seen as a seller but wants a higher price meanwhile several family members engaged via email in an intense exchange about their legacy their past stewardship of dow jones and the ramifications of voting against the deal the family met last monday in boston to hear presentations about the deal and have been asked to make a final decision by monday the exchange highlighted the deep and emotional divisions within the bancroft family dow joness controlling shareholder over whether to accept mr murdochs offer some family members worry that mr murdochs interventionist style of newspaper management would damage dow jones particularly its flagship publication the wall street journal but others believe that the time has come to sell the news corp offer was "a no brainer " said crawford hill one of the family members in an extraordinary nearly word letter sent thursday night to other family members "with all due respect it is time for a reality check " he wrote "what is missing from this discussion about dow jones and the bancrofts is a sense of historical perspective and evolution there is a lot of family mythology and outright distortion going on that needs to be set straight particularly about our legacy " on friday his cousin elisabeth goth chelberg echoed his sentiments in a letter of her own that raised questions about the future of dow jones if the news corp deal doesnt happen "while the current family ownership structure may have protected the independence of the wall street journal in the past it has done little to foster the performance of dow jones or the distribution of the brand as the landscape of the market has evolved over the past years " she wrote to her relatives in an email "the family ownership trust structure the dividend policy and our lack of requiring managements accountability have put us in the position were now in with dow jones there is no going back pre news corp s bid to the way things were " ms chelberg who a decade ago tried and failed to get her family to take a more active role in running the company asked her family members why they hadnt discussed what would happen to dow jones if the family turned mr murdoch away and questioned whether the family had the "stomach for risk" such a course would entail "where is the vision that is critical to support a no vote " she wrote "consider the stock price for the last decade consider the culture of our family there is part of the answer to my question how should i vote " leslie hill a dow jones director and mr hills sister followed with a letter of her own appealing to her relatives not to "throw in the towel" and let their mistakes of the past become a justification for handing the keys to the journal to mr murdoch "the tragedy here is that the world will lose an incredibly powerful voice that will die " she wrote "i hate to see a rationalization of why we should sell to murdoch as yet one more excuse as to why we should not take responsibility for what we own " ms hill declined to talk to a journal reporter family members are also being lobbied by the journal newsroom after learning of leslie hills presentation to her family members on monday in which she waved a manila envelope full of protest letters from journal staffers to justify her opposition to the deal a group of roughly reporters began another round of letter writing to the family urging them not to sell to mr murdoch in his letter mr hill said the offer is "a tremendous business deal for dj shareholders and will take the business into the next successful phase in a manner not possible if dj remains independent " news corp s chairman mr murdoch "will not have naked bodies in the wsj he is not a moron " mr hill also said he had commented in april after "our annual family dinner" in new york "how underwhelming" presentations were by dow jones chief executive rich zannino and chairman m peter mcpherson ms hill "replied to me that i needed to give them time they had a good plan " then his sister "told me after the murdoch offer was announced that rich should be fired " messrs zannino and mcpherson declined to comment he noted that his sister had been "working really hard to come up with alternatives unfortunately when you look at the facts as epitomized by managements position and the board itself there are no better alternatives " mr hill reached on vacation in spain said "i went into some personal history to give some context to this its unfortunate that it has spilled out into the public domain " he said even as the debate raged however another branch of the family was deciding to hold out for a higher price trusts managed by the denver law firm holme roberts &amp owen decided to vote against the deal unhappy that news corp hasnt raised the offer past its original price of &# a share news of the denver trusts decision sent dow jones shares down earlier friday but they recovered to close up to &# in p m new york stock exchange composite trading the denver trusts have argued that the super voting class b shareholders should receive a premium of to over the &# offer in their view news corp should be willing to pay an extra &# million to &# million the cost of paying more to class b shareholders to clinch the &# billion deal dow joness board though has indicated it wouldnt recommend to shareholders a deal that treated class b shareholders differently than other shareholders yet the denver trustees have argued that if the board was previously willing to recommend &# a share on behalf of the common shareholders it should continue to endorse that bid even if the class b shareholders are getting a higher price a person close to news corp has said that the company wouldnt be willing to offer a two tiered deal news corp has no intention of raising the price of its offer another person close to the company said it was unclear if the denver trusts would maintain their opposition if mr murdoch threatened to walk away it is also unclear whether the denver trusts vote is needed to secure a deal news corp will likely need about half of the familys voting stake in order to clinch the deal michael b elefante the familys lead trustee has previously told associates that he believes enough of the family would support the deal to allow it to go forward that tally didnt include the denver trusts according to one person familiar with the matter the outcome of the familys vote could also be affected by the move by hemenway &amp barnes the boston law firm that manages most of the familys trusts to try to split up the biggest fund the trust known as article has million b shares giving it voting power in dow jones the trust has three trustees two from hemenway &amp barnes and mr bancroft hemenway &amp barnes declined to comment all major decisions require unanimity meaning that mr bancroft effectively controls the vote but two of the four main beneficiaries of the trust ms chelberg and mr bancrofts older brother hugh are in favor of a sale according to people familiar with their thinking if mr bancroft who is also a beneficiary of the trust were to turn down the offer against their wishes he might expose himself to litigation splitting up the trust would allow him to vote his own shares against the deal while allowing his relatives shares to be voted in favor mr elefante also notified family members of the proposed makeup of the editorial oversight board for dow jones in the event of a news corp deal the group includes louis d boccardi retired ceo of the associated press nicholas negroponte co founder of massachusetts institute of technologys media lab jack fuller former president of tribune publishing and thomas bray the former editorial page editor of the detroit news and a writer for opinionjournal com the selection of the fifth member of the committee hasnt been resolved according to a person familiar with the matter the list no longer includes two people who had been under consideration theodore b olson the former solicitor general of the u s and susan hockfield president of massachusetts institute of technology
