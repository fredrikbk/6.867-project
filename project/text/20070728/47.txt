from san francisco held some of the most notorious criminals in american history the infamous roster included al capone robert stroud the so called birdman of alcatraz and george "machine gun" kelly the u s penitentiary alcatraz was the most secure prison in the system housing the worst of the federal lot most came from other institutions one anonymous wag perhaps explained it best "break the rules and you go to prison break the prison rules and you go to alcatraz " the acre island in the middle of san francisco bay was despite its beautiful setting very hard time in its years as a federal prison from fewer than prisoners were housed it was rare when the prison population exceeded convicts all under heavy guard the message was clear no one escapes from alcatraz nevertheless a movie starring clint eastwood "escape from alcatraz " tells the story of one successful escape from the island this in june the three escapees have never been found and are presumed dead by most experts yet the fbi and other law enforcement agencies have not closed the case and continue to pursue leads the escape was one of only in the history of the prison most escapees were captured quickly usually on the island but five inmates actually eluded capture the three in and two in undoubtedly owing to the international mystique of alcatraz and its recurring role in motion pictures tv shows and books the island has remained a strong tourist attraction with nearly million people visiting annually now thanks to a continuing relationship between the national parks service and the golden gate national parks conservancy its nonprofit partner the alcatraz experience has been considerably expanded and upgraded after raising &# million for renovation and associated new projects the conservancy is telling the islands story in greater depth "what we wanted to do was make the alcatraz visit more authentic " says katy olds associate director of visitor programs at alcatraz "we wanted to describe what the inmates and the guards actually experienced how segregation played a role here how families lived on the island and much more " among the new and improved opportunities for visitors is a revamped minute cellblock audio tour that replaces the one used for many years on the island "what we did was keep the most memorable parts of an audio tour that was listened to by millions over the years " ms olds says "and added a significant number of additional stories " the new digitized audio tour contains interviews with former convicts correctional officers plus former residents as well as sound effects recorded on the island it comes in eight languages including mandarin and dutch to accommodate visitors from around the world the audio tour in the cellblock is just one aspect of what occurs after the minute ferry ride from san francisco first in a new tour route visitors have to walk a road that leads up to the cell house just as the inmates did they hear about standard procedures in place at the time including a strip search and the issuance of a prison number a rulebook and prison clothing one can instantly envision the stark circumstances awaiting a new prisoner soon home would be a cell feet wide feet deep and feet high there an inmate would spend up to hours a day unless he earned the opportunity to work in one of the jobs on the island a grim reminder of the islands past recently occurred when workers went in to the old clothing issue area to clean and paint it as part of the new tour "while we were pulling out shelving that had not been touched since the prison closed we discovered still in its secret hiding place after all these years a large handmade knife commonly called a shiv hidden here by an inmate " ms olds recounts "history is still coming alive around here " alcatraz includes a fascinating set of museum exhibits including period photographs prisoner artifacts correctional officer badges shackles handcuffs and other reminders of the islands prison history the displays and exhibits also look at other historical aspects of the island such as the magnificent lighthouse alcatrazs time as a military fort and then its role as a military prison from through before it became part of the federal prison system in addition to the impressive displays are the prison cells furnished as if still occupied along with the newly revamped alcatraz cellhouse museum store which has been greatly upgraded and contains numerous historical exhibits including tools used by inmates in the escape attempt the work on the island also includes greater accessibility for the handicapped thanks to the construction of an elevator within the prison that connects all three levels along with a handicapped accessible tram that runs to and from the cellblock the islands theater is showing a newly produced film about alcatraz and speakers who often include ex convicts and former correctional officers regularly come to the island to mingle with tourists "in the summer " ms olds says of alcatraz "we accommodate better than visitors a day but we could sell tickets " the best advice is to line up early to go to prison mr sobel is a frequent
