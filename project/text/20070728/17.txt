general petraeus needs time this iraq war is lost " senate majority leader harry reid has stated emphatically and without qualification "theres simply no evidence that the escalation is working " he said recently it requires "blind hope blind trust" to believe in progress of any sort sen reid is now in the position of having to deny facts on the ground in order to sustain his bleak judgments and his job is getting more difficult all the time shiite death squad activity and executions in baghdad have significantly decreased since january in anbar province and increasingly in diyala province tribal sheikhs have turned against al qaeda and are now siding with american and iraqi security forces these are examples of "bottom up" political reconciliation for which we had been hoping attack levels in anbar have reached a two year low ramadi once among the most dangerous cities in iraq is now dramatically safer violence in fallujah has declined al qaedas networks and safe havens are being disrupted beyond anything we have seen before since the start of the year baqubah al qaim haditha hit ramadi habbaniya fallujah abu ghraib and arab jabour have all been liberated from al qaeda control arms caches are being found at more than three times the rate of a year ago intelligence tips are sharply up we are also seeing signs of normalcy return to baghdad including soccer leagues amusement parks and vibrant market places more than half of baghdad is now under the control of coalition or iraqi security forces "we have achieved a reasonable degree of tactical momentum on the ground " according to gen david petraeus the commander of u s forces in iraq "gains against the principal near term threat al qaeda iraq and also gains against what is another near term threat and also potentially the long term threat shia militia extremists as well " about al qaeda in iraq the cautious gen petraeus said this "we think that we have them off plan " the surge in operations as opposed to simply the surge in forces is just beginning operation phantom thunder the largest multiphase operation since began on june none of this means success is preordained or the gains we have seen are irreversible it is an exceedingly tough endeavor iraq remains a dangerous and violent nation and al qaeda in iraq will try to make it more so in the coming months in order to influence the american political process sectarian splits remain deep and deeply problematic political progress is slower than anyone wants its possible that the u s offensive will falter that the enemy will adjust to our tactics or that iraqi society is just too fractured to be rebuilt but in terms of security we are in significantly better shape than we were six months ago and the trajectory of events is positive what then explains the fact that some critics of the war are unwilling to hear good news of any sort and get visibly agitated and disdainful when we see and cite signs of progress why wont they acknowledge empirical evidence of progress by the american military and why are some critics of the war frantically attempting to make a final judgment on the war even before gen petraeus and ambassador ryan crocker provide their assessment in september it is as if some critics of the new strategy have decided that the war shouldnt have been fought cannot be won and therefore defeat is now written in the stars and since surrender will eventually happen lets get on with it this is to put it mildly a curious position to adopt particularly given the stakes of this struggle and all that might happen in the aftermath of an american defeat whether we like it or not al qaeda has made iraq a central battlefield in their jihadist campaign in the words of ayman al zawahiri al qaedas ideological leader iraq "is now the place for the greatest battle of islam in this era " just a few weeks ago in a taped message al zawahiri urged muslims to "hurry to iraq " its reasonable to assume he wasnt recommending it because he thinks its a world class tourist attraction the critics of the war know deep in their bones that an american retreat may well lead to ethnic cleansing and genocide massive refugee flows and regional destabilization spreading civil war between shiites and sunnis creating a new safe haven for terrorists and giving an enormous psychological victory for americas enemies from iran to syria to al qaeda in the current issue of commentary gal luft and anne korin of the institute for the analysis of global security put it this way "iraq is the current vortex of both regional and inter denominational strife a decent resolution of that conflict will hasten the reform and modernization of other nations sunni and shiite alike if our project there fails whether from arab indifference and incapacity or a lack of western resolve the resulting civil war could feed the flames of both intra and extra islamic conflict on a global scale " to repeat then why the rush to declare the war irretrievably lost when doing so requires one to be deaf and blind to what is now unfolding on the ground why given the importance of this struggle are so many critics of the war unwilling to support or even wait to hear from gen petraeus and ambassador crocker in september perhaps this attitude is rooted in war weariness the iraq war has been a long and difficult struggle mistakes and misjudgments have been made false summits have dashed early hopes and more than american military lives have been lost causing unspeakable grief for families and friends of the fallen yet tragically more often than not this is the nature of war which involves unexpected costs and awful sacrifices there comes a point in many wars maybe in most wars where the single most important issue is whether a nation can summon the resolve and courage to see a good cause through to the end we are now at that point in the iraq war we have in place the right team pursuing the right strategy the thing gen petraeus needs above all else he says is time the american political class can give him that time if it chooses we are not passive actors in this clash of force and wills and defeat is not fated we can still shape the outcome of the war and with it the future of the middle east in the past this nation in the face of great challenges and hardships worn and weary has ridden out the storm of war in so doing tyrannies have fallen captives have been set free and history has honored americas sacrifice and its role in building a more hopeful world it will do so again if we can one more time summon the will mr wehner is deputy assistant to the president and director of the white houses office of strategic initiatives
