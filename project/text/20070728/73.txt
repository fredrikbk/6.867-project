we were smeared not a good debating device your editorial "trade double cross update " july implies that john walters director of the white houses drug policy office has called my organization the washington office on latin america wola liars such smears are a poor substitute for reasoned debate and reflect poorly on those who repeat them mr walters apparently chooses to attack our integrity rather than in engage in debate it is hard to fathom what mr walters had in mind in leveling his accusations against wola but since your editorial was about trade your readers should be apprised of the following facts then come to their own conclusions as to whether human rights protections are sufficiently strong for labor union members in colombia more trade unionists are murdered each year in colombia than in the rest of the world combined such killings occurred in colombia in slightly more than in during president alvaro uribes tenure more than trade unionists have been murdered in colombia but only convictions have been obtained in these cases a less than conviction rate the evidence suggests many of the slayings of unionists have been perpetrated by members of illegal paramilitary organizations numerous colombian lawmakers including many from president uribes own party are under investigation for their alleged ties to paramilitary groups which also happen to be deeply involved in drug trafficking and other criminal activities so we stick to our view that widespread human rights violations should be taken into account where trade agreements are concerned and we welcome debate with those who think otherwise or who differ with us on how colombias human rights situation might be improved joy olson executive director washington office on latin america washington
