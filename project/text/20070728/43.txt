pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink rising american spirits not too long ago american whiskey suffered a plight not unlike that of the american automobile sales of kentuckys signature commodity declined alarmingly in the s through the s in the home market it once dominated yet unlike detroit the bourbonistas have reversed the slide theyve done it by focusing on the luxury end of the market and delivering spirits worthy of the premium price how bad a stretch did bourbon have between and it lost about half its domestic market share in american distillers sold million cases of straight and blended whiskey by they were selling less than million cases but in the past few years the story has finally turned around with sales of straight bourbon and tennessee whiskey a category that consists of jack daniels and george dickel growing by over a million cases between and it may have taken a couple of decades for bourbon to tick up in the sales charts but the current modest revival got its start in the early s when distillers realized they needed some prestige products to add luster to their american whiskey brands what bourbon needed wasnt just a greater emphasis on quality but also an emphasis on the qualities that distinguish one whiskey from another scotch provided an object lesson the more commoditized blended scotches have long been retreating right along with the other brown spirits yet at the same time individualistic single malts grew from an obscure curiosity to a robust essential much of the appeal of single malt scotch has been that different drams are significantly different in character the soft and floral lowland malts such as edinburghs glenkinchie hardly seem to be in the same genus as the most assertively peaty island whiskies such as lagavulin and laphroaig all sorts of variables contribute to the variety in single malt is the barley malted with or without the smoke from peat fires is it aged in waterfront warehouses where hints of seaweed and brine seep into the barrels or does the whisky rest in highland dunnage what sort of wood does the spirit come in contact with used bourbon barrels recycled sherry hogsheads or casks that had once held port rum or chateau margaux that last set of variables the practice of putting a mature scotch whisky in a barrel redolent of another spirit accounts for a variety among single malts that has been hard for bourbon to match newly in vogue wood finishing has allowed for a staggering proliferation of scotch varieties glenmorangie alone has had whiskies touched up with time in barrels previously devoted to everything from sauternes burgundy madeira golden rum cognac cote de beaune port and cote de nuits to good old sherry such finishes have yet to catch on with sour mash whiskey though jim beam did try out a couple of special bottlings it called distillers masterpiece the first was finished in casks that had been home to cognac the second effort was in port wood but bourbon hasnt lent itself easily to the refinements of finishing school the first problem is definitional by law bourbon must be aged in new charred oak barrels and only new charred oak barrels put a bourbon in some other sort of barrel and it isnt strictly speaking bourbon anymore regulators have since come up with a specialty category to accommodate wood finished bourbons the bigger challenge is that the bold toasted oak flavors that come naturally to bourbon dont leave much room for other flavors to be introduced later because scotch is aged in used barrels to begin with the original casks dont impart nearly as much flavor to the whisky which gives the subtle flavors from a finishing barrel a chance even so kentuckians have been experimenting to see if there is a wood finishing strategy that might be successful for bourbon woodford reserve has just released a whiskey finished in barrels that had previously held chardonnay from californias sonoma cutrer winery but for the past years the main effort to follow the lead of single malt whiskies has been made with "small batch" bourbons such as bookers and knob creek and "single barrel" bourbons the first of those was blantons launched in the dark days of when cadillac was still embarrassing itself with the cimarron the single barrel variety promises the most individuality as barrels vary widely i went shopping for single barrel american whiskey and came home with bottles of bourbon from blantons eagle rare elijah craig evan williams and wild turkey and the single barrel version of jack daniels tennessee whiskey i found that blantons holds a firm grip on the category it created the bottle i bought which was filled from barrel no last september is full of rich flavors beautifully knit into an elegant whole it starts with licorice as did the eagle rare but in far more restrained proportions blantons is much smoother than the wild turkey and far more muscular than the evan williams unlike the jack daniels blantons isnt overly sweet it has just enough dark chocolate bitterness to balance its thick honey the long finish hints at cinnamon spiced applesauce the only bottle that i was truly disappointed in was the elijah craig single barrel named after the baptist minister and distiller who helped pioneer kentucky corn liquor a couple of centuries ago but then i shouldnt have been surprised the elijah craig single barrel is aged for years which may be a sweet spot for scotch but is superannuated for most bourbon what with dunnage in fresh barrels and the hot kentucky summers bourbon ages far more quickly than scotch leave it in the wood too long and the caramelized sugars in the oak give way to tarry ropey tastes that said the occasional wizened bourbon barrel survives the ravages of age if you want to try the elijah craig just look for a bottle that comes from a barrel other than no and thats half the fun of a single barrel bourbon finding out how a given barrel tastes for the most part they taste fine and prove that the makers of bourbon deserve the turnaround they are now beginning to enjoy email me at eric felten wsj com sampling single barrel bourbons very good delicious blantons &# an essay in the proper balance of a fine spirit an aristotelian mean between the extremes of raw firewater and watery whiskey cutting through the thick honeyed sweetness are bitter notes of dark chocolate and licorice the applesauce on the finish is spiced with cinnamon just the way grandma used to make it very good eagle rare single barrel &# a subtle and easy to drink whiskey with plenty of anise to spice away excess sweetness far and away the best value of the tasting wild turkey kentucky spirit &# chewy caramel tempered with some unapologetic alcohol burn good very good jack daniels single barrel tennessee whiskey &# lacking the individuality one hopes to find in a single barrel expression the same satisfying sweetness one expects from j d only more so good elijah craig year old single barrel &# just too darn old there may be year old barrels of bourbon that escape being marred with the tarry taste of liquid smoke but this wasnt one of them saved from oblivion by the underlying quality of the whiskey
