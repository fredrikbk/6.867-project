fannie freddie are said to suffer in subprime mess falling prices on subprime mortgage bonds have cut the value of such securities held by fannie mae and freddie mac by &# billion citigroup inc analysts estimate a freddie mac spokeswoman called the analysts estimate "mistaken " she said the company uses third party sources to value its holdings and hasnt seen "any material markdown of value " a fannie spokesman pointed to disclosures on the companys web site saying that none of the mostly aaa rated bonds in question have been downgraded by rating agencies in any case according to the citigroup report released thursday those paper losses wont necessarily be realized because prices may recover and the two giant companies "can easily ride out" turmoil in the market for subprime mortgages those for people with weak credit records in a later clarification citigroup said there was "no cause for alarm" and that the &# billion figure probably overstates the amount of losses that ultimately will be realized the two government sponsored companies which buy home loans and package them into securities so far have avoided heavy damage from surging defaults on subprime loans thats partly because the vast bulk of the loans they own or guarantee are relatively conservative fixed rate prime mortgages the turmoil has helped them regain market share as chastened lenders increasingly promote less risky loans that can be bought by fannie or freddie rather than the racier types usually financed by wall street firms but fannie and freddie are likely at least to be singed by the growing subprime problems freddie holds about &# billion of bonds packaged by other firms and backed by subprime home loans citigroup said and fannie holds about &# billion fannie and freddie dont guarantee these loans but will be hurt to the extent that subprime mortgage bonds fall in value as they have in recent weeks nearly all of these bonds are rated aaa the companies say lower rated portions of the securities are held by a wide variety of hedge funds and other investors world wide and that paper has suffered much steeper price reductions in recent weeks amid near panic over loan quality citigroup analysts brett rose and scott peng estimated that the value of fannies holdings of these subprime mortgage bonds has dropped &# billion thats equivalent to of the companys stock market value freddies holdings have lost &# billion equivalent to of its market value citigroup estimated but it said the ultimate damage is likely to be "considerably smaller" because the companies arent under any pressure to sell the bonds and continue to collect interest on them holders of the lower rated portions of these securities absorb the first losses from defaults the subprime bonds are a small fraction of the companies overall exposure to the mortgage market they own a combined &# trillion of mortgages and related securities and guarantee payments on more than &# trillion of loans the rate of late payments on those mostly prime fixed rate loans has remained low so far fannie and freddie have been taking more risks in recent years though by purchasing the subprime mortgage bonds and buying more loans that allow borrowers to pay only the interest during an initial period leaving larger payments for later the two companies bought the subprime bonds largely to meet government mandates that they increase funding for loans to people with low or moderate incomes
