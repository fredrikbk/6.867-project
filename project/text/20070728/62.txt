sinking feeling fears intensify on economy despite growth housing woes turmoil in markets may slow second half momentum behind the picture of strong second quarter economic growth are new worries fears that the continuing housing slump higher gasoline prices and tumbling financial markets could damp consumer spending and blunt the u s economys momentum in the second half the economy grew at an annual rate of in the quarter reversing the anemic growth in the first quarter the commerce department said increases in exports and government spending drove much of the improvement a rise in commercial construction spending and building of inventories offset a drag from housing and sluggish consumer spending but the positive drivers arent expected to persist and recent indicators cast a darkening shadow over the rest of the year the latest readings for spending on plant and equipment which grew at a tepid pace in the quarter are disappointing rising inventories of unsold homes falling prices and tighter lending terms on subprime loans for marginal borrowers offer little hope that housing is stabilizing the downturn in stocks crimps americans wealth and turbulence in credit markets is sparking fears that loans will be costlier or harder to get when fears about subprime mortgages infected markets earlier this year economic forecasters saw two ways the trouble could spread if spooked investors started pulling back from all kinds of borrowers or if the difficulties of stretched homeowners started to weigh more heavily on an already weak housing market at the time most economists saw those outcomes as unlikely now theyre beginning to wonder "the last couple of days have not been friendly " said brian sack an economist at forecaster macroeconomic advisers of st louis "these things are ganging up here on the second half the markets have reached a point where a further worsening in credit conditions or further declines in equity prices might affect the economic outlook " such fears helped pushed stocks down again friday the dow jones industrial average closed at futures markets in a reversal now bet that the federal reserve is almost certain to cut its key interest rate now at by a quarter point before the end of the year fed officials havent changed their expectations for moderate growth for the rest of the year but persistence of the housing slump underscores the downside risks particularly to consumer spending the combination of a sour housing market and rising energy prices reduced growth in consumer spending to a very slow pace in the second quarter after the first quarters downwardly revised some business executives expect things to get worse "this idea that theres been no spillover from housing into other segments is just faulty " mike jackson chief executive of auto dealer autonation inc said in a conference call "i think its extreme economic distress out there right now its one of the toughest environments ive ever seen since ive been in the business " office depot said this week said it is scaling back some expansion plans following softer sales of furniture supplies and technology items and indications of a "tough retail environment" this quarter "we believe that the impact of this housing slump has adversely affected a broad range of small businesses and resulted in a reduction in our customers overall spending " said chuck rubin president of the companys north american retail unit some forecasters say the gloom is overdone as long as businesses continue to hire the jobless rate remains near its current low and energy prices dont go higher they say overall consumer incomes should be strong enough to support a healthy level of consumer spending in a favorable sign the university of michigan said friday its consumer confidence index rose to in july from in june corporate earnings outside of financial services remain robust although companies have been worrying for months about higher input costs crimping profit margins "the real risk for consumer spending is if for some reason companies slam on the brakes and stop hiring " said brian bethune an economist at global insight "the employment market is still reasonably solid " the latest wrinkle is the leaking of worries about the credit of u s homeowners into other markets a strong signal that easy financial conditions which fueled abundant corporate borrowing and buyout activity could be evaporating from tyco electronics ltd to chrysler group companies and bankers have held back bond issues and loan sales meaning that lower rated companies may have less money available to expand or will be forced to pay more for that expansion than they had planned as of friday the borrowing cost for the typical investment grade corporation stood almost percentage points above the rate at which banks lend to each other up from a "spread" of about percentage points at the end of june according to the cdx credit derivative index that is however offset by the bond market pushing down long term treasury rates on which other lending rates rest mark kiesel a corporate bond portfolio manager at pacific investment management co in newport beach calif estimates that the backlog of unsold bonds and bank loans exceeds &# billion a situation he sees as similar to that in the housing market where the backlog of unsold homes has also reached new highs at junes rate of existing home sales it would take months to unload all the houses on the market a year high "the big picture is that youve got an inventory problem in both markets youve got too many homes for sale and too many bonds for sale " says mr kiesel "so prices need to adjust you need lower house prices and much bigger credit spreads it means the economy is going to slow " downward revisions to growth from the first quarter of through the first quarter of added to concerns because they offer more evidence that the pace of productivity growth has slowed and with it estimates of the speed at which the economy can grow without higher inflation economists at bear stearns for instance said that estimates of the economys potential growth rate are likely to fall below a year the new commerce department report said inflation rose to in the second quarter from in the first quarter but the price index of personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy the feds preferred gauge dropped to from earlier revisions of earlier numbers however suggest the inflation measure for june to be released tuesday could inch above the high end of the feds to comfort zone
