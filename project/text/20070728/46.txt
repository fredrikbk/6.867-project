pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece dantes self help book the divine comedy charts the path to a new beginning anatomy of a classic there are monuments to dante alighieri everywhere in italy where three years of study in dantes "divine comedy" are required for young people to learn how to lead the best possible life one cannot imagine italys culture without dantes th century work any more than one could imagine britains without shakespeare or americas without the declaration of independence unlike most other world classics "the divine comedy" is a self help book people read shakespeare with no expectation that they will become shakespeare but many read dante expecting to mimic his results and transform themselves from seekers lost in their own questions into poets certain and transcendent "the divine comedy" tracks the journey of dante who wakes up lost in a dark wood in the middle of his life so far so true the pope had issued a warrant for the arrest of men charging them with breach of duty the sentence carried a steep fine and death to those who could not pay it being named in this warrant was the major event in dantes otherwise minor life he was a forgettable poet a small time politician and a husband with a roving eye instead of fighting the charges he fled his home and wandered in exile for nearly years under desperate conditions homeless anonymous he wrote this masterpiece how did dante go from mediocrity to misery to greatness in only half a brief lifetime he stopped seeing himself as a figure of tragedy and saw his life as a comedy in "the divine comedy " beatrice the woman dante truly loved catches sight of him lost and suffering in that dark wood from her seat at the height of paradise she asks the poet virgil to bring dante to her virgil tells dante that beatrice asked him to join her in paradise and that to get to her they must descend into hell and then up the steep purgatorial mountain "the way up is the way down " was dantes discovery now a therapeutic convention in hell the "inferno" section of the work dante sees that all crimes involve loving the wrong things money power oneself or anothers spouse in divine justice the punishment fits the crime adultery doesnt end in divorce it doesnt end at all sinful lovers are locked in eternal and numbing coitus the malicious float in a river of their own excrement narcissistic parents dine nauseatingly on the brains of their suffering children of the "comedy"s lines the most unnerving are the that comprise "inferno " the circle of liars thieves and consultants in this circle dante encounters the hero ulysses his soul no longer hidden by his mortal body is not a pretty sight he had been a deceiver a trickster who won the battle for troy by creating the trojan horse promising gifts of peace and then murdering the trojans he deceived ulysses burned with brilliantly clever ideas in life in hell he simply burns this leader this enflamer of men is now encased in fire ulysses tells virgil he considers dante not worthy of his high rhetoric that he persuaded his old companions lines to risk everything once more this time for a glimpse of the truth "you were not made to live like brutes but to pursue virtue and knowledge " ulysses told them they set sail for mount purgatory but their boat encountered a storm "three times made whirl round with all the waters at the fourth made the stern rise up and prow go down the sea was closed above us " for a terrifying moment dante see himself in ulysses dante too revels in the art of persuasion is his own journey to paradise another mad pursuit his own cleverness a form of deception dante reasons that to ulysses virtue and knowledge were the same thing but dante concludes that they are not to use superior wisdom in deceiving others is spiritual theft leaders must use skill and cleverness not for personal gain but to promote honor to create a just state personal happiness is not possible in a divided state and ambition without virtue is madness this realization makes "inferno " the turning point of "the divine comedy" and conveys how dantes entire masterpiece may be read at a deep level one that osip mandelstam a dissident writer in stalins russia said works as a kind of literary medicine curing those who read it of their self created ills of ego and reckless opportunism mandelstam had such faith in the curative power of "the divine comedy" that he smuggled a copy into his prison cell in "survival in auschwitz " primo levi writes of how "inferno " gives him perspective on the world that produced the camps in jean a junior guard in auschwitz assigns levi the task of helping him carry the days watery soup from kitchen to barracks because jean wants to learn italian both men dream of a life beyond the barbed wire of the camps for levi the job is a great reward though the hundred pound kettle could buckle the knees for a few minutes a day he could walk in the sunshine he chooses "inferno " to teach jean but levis memory falters when he gets to the line in which ulysses tries to crash through a barrier inspiring his men "consider your origin you were not made to live like brutes but to follow virtue and knowledge " for levi as for dante the question is whether his voyage through hell would become a new beginning or an end charles dickens believed dantes journey to be true his scrooge confronts his criminal past inferno fixes his mistakes purgatorio and invents a future so loving it had to be a miracle paradiso the dreams sigmund freud analyzed in his "interpretation of dreams" echo the nightmares the souls endure in "inferno" freud backdated the publication of his own masterpiece to in homage to dante who claimed hell opened its doors to him in the year "inferno" made dante famous though he was never pardoned when he passed a group of women in verona one of them noticed the soiled hem of his coat and remarked "isnt that the man who goes down to hell as he likes and brings back news of them below " the scientist galileo spent years fruitlessly searching for the doorway to hell that dante used readers find it easily in dantes work and through it they discover that they too may find the ascending path to a happy ending ms rubin is the author of "dante in love" simon &amp schuster and most recently "the mona lisa stratagem the art of women age and power" warner
