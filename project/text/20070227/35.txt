fda says bird flu vaccine seems safe efficacy unclear washington the food and drug administration said an hn vaccine developed by a unit of sanofi aventis appeared to be safe but it isnt clear how effective the vaccine would be at protecting people against avian influenza the agency posted its views on the vaccine a day ahead of a panel meeting of outside medical experts the panel is expected to weigh in on whether it believes the vaccine is safe and effective the fda would then take into consideration the panels views when later deciding whether to approve the vaccine currently there are no vaccines approved for human use in the u s for an avian influenza virus such as hn sanofis vaccine is designed to protect humans against a particular hn influenza strain that first started spreading among birds and it isnt clear if the vaccine would offer protection in the event the virus mutates the company is already producing the vaccine for placement in a u s government stockpile for use in the event of a flu pandemic since the hn strain has resulted in deaths mostly in asia and africa most of the human cases have been caused by direct contact with infected poultry but health experts are concerned that if the virus mutates it might be able to spread easily among humans and spark the next pandemic the fda said clinical studies of sanofis vaccine showed "no significant safety signals that would preclude administration of this vaccine to additional persons " the fda said the highest doses tested two microgram doses given one month apart elicited a better immune response than lower doses that were tested the study which initially involved people showed that about of people given the highest dose produced enough antibodies to suggest the vaccine would offer enough protection against avian flu however the fda said sanofis vaccine if approved could be used "in the interim" until other vaccines are developed
