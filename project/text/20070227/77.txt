persian shrug almost everyone in washington agrees that iran is the big winner in the middle east power competition and the u s the big loser instead of the irremediably hostile taliban iran now has a friendly afghan government on its eastern border rather than having to face saddam husseins regime iran has nothing to fear from an iraqi government dominated by friends and obedient clients many of whom lived as protected exiles in iran for years or more having crushed tehrans enemies the u s finds itself under attack by irans rulers who no longer have to worry about defending their own borders and can instead challenge american interests all over the middle east and as far away as venezuela at the same time iran continues to build facilities to process gasify and enrich uranium in spite of the international atomic energy agency and solemn resolutions by the u n security council for some including the baker hamilton commission all this is a compelling argument for negotiations the hope is that irans mighty rulers can be persuaded to stop arming and inciting the insurgents attacking american and british troops in iraq and perhaps help to stabilize the country allowing the u s to withdraw less ignominiously now there is even talk of a detente with iran that being the standard diplomatic method to deal with a hostile country too powerful to be intimidated or defeated and with which one must simply coexist on the best terms that can be had in this case it would mean coexistence with tehrans continued support for hamas hezbollah islamic jihad and three different iraqi militias as well as with irans nuclear program back in the s detente with the soviet union was criticized on the grounds that it actually propped up a regime in irreversible decline and whose power could be confronted successfully in the s the critics of that detente led by ronald reagan had their opportunity to challenge the soviet union which did not outlast the decade there is every reason to believe that history is about to repeat itself iran does not resemble the soviet union in any other way and certainly does not have even a fraction of its military power but it too is a multinational state in an age when nations are everywhere asserting their separate identities in arguing that there is universal support for the nuclear program regime spokesmen and even many persians in exile speak of iran as a unitary state inhabited by "iranians" who are very nationalistic even if they oppose the ayatollahs none of this remotely corresponds to irans ethnic realities persians only account for half the population and the other half includes many different nationalities increasingly resentful of persian cultural imperialism kurds account for some of the population and their nationalism is kurdish and not persian having been much strengthened by the successful example of virtual kurdish independence in iraq their demands for autonomy have become sufficiently forceful to start an insurgency the same is true of two smaller nationalities that are even more violently disaffected with frequent fire fights and bombings the arabs and the baluch which account for another of the population but the largest of irans subject nationalities are the azeris while many have been assimilated at least million still speak an entirely different turkic language and increasingly form the core of a united azeri nation that extends beyond western iran to include the former soviet republic of azerbaijan the religious extremism of irans regime creates its own divisions the bloody persecution of the bahais the new persecution of the sufis and the institutional subjection of christians jews and zoroastrians have attracted greater attention but the ill treatment of the of the population that is sunni is more important politically in tehran where more than a million sunnis live there is no sunni mosque as there is in rome tel aviv and washington d c if irans economy were more successful ethnic divisions and even religious resentments would matter less as it is with at least unemployment and an annual inflation rate of some irans economy is scarcely a unifying force especially because most of its minorities are distinctly poorer than the dominant persians viewed from the inside iran is hardly the formidable power that some see on the outside the natural outcome of increasing popular opposition to extremist rulers of widening ethnic divisions and bitter sunni resentment of shia oppression is a breakup certainly there is no reason why iran should be the only multinational state to resist the nationalist separatism that destroyed the soviet union and yugoslavia divided belgium in all but name and decentralized spain and even the united kingdom along with other states large and small once again there is a better alternative to detente with a repulsive regime and that is to be true to the wilsonian tradition of american foreign policy by encouraging the forces of national liberation within iran mr luttwak a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies is author of "strategy the logic of war and peace" belknap
