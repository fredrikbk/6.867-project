the daily fix ireland trounces england in dignified historic match online edition on saturday englands rugby team faced ireland for the first time at dublins seat croke park in british soldiers opened fire at the stadium killing people and injuring hundreds attending a gaelic football match with english fans expected to make the journey and "god save the queen" set to precede the six nations rugby match the venue unleashed its biggest security force ever what broke out was a good rugby game and nothing more "it was an occasion that had all the furniture of hate but hatred itself went missing " simon barnes writes in the times of london "a million anticipatory words were written about it on both sides of the water if there was an incitement to hatred implicit in all this the people who came along didnt pay attention bugger history this is now this is sport and we dont know what happens next so dont talk to me of the troubles and the past all that matters is ronan ogara versus jonny wilkinson life really should be like that " until life imitates rugby the irish will settle for ireland england "ireland had moved on in its heart and its sport and it happened with so much haunting beauty you were bound to ask a question brutal to english ears " james lawton writes in the independent "who really was playing the foreign game not surely the green horde fuelled by extraordinary passion and individual brilliance who brought the world champions to their lowest point since another rainy night in sydney in the truth was moving on a night when life and sport collided with a rare and precious result " and an aromatically pungent result martin johnson writes in the daily telegraph "if there was any one thing which suggested the past belonged to the past and that things had moved on since some of the empires darker days it was the unmistakeable aroma of chinese takeaway " both england and ireland trail france by two points in the six nations standings but england still must play the leaders france edged ireland by three points earlier this month the dignified dublin sporting event put to shame the brawling soccer players who tarnished englands carling cup as chelsea was closing out a win over a young arsenal side players and coaches piled in to a melee featuring throat grabbing and throwing of punches the daily telegraphs sue mott says such misbehavior by soccer players is inexplicably tolerated "the tragedy of those two matches at the weekend is that one set the standard of civilised behaviour and one sank to a state of petty feud and the one that will be remembered and copied and held up as a role model of behaviour will be infinitely the worse of the two " ms mott writes the harsh reality of nfl economics is intruding on the offseason of two nfc playoff teams the defending conference champion chicago bears have lovie smith signed through next season as the leagues lowest paid head coach but the chicago tribunes don pierson urges team president ted phillips not to dawdle in awarding an extension "if this is allowed to linger smith at some point is bound to demonstrate a personality trait that phillips should recognize stubbornness " mr pierson writes "if smith does impose a deadline and ends up a lame duck coach the bears season will be a disaster as much as smith wouldnt like it phillips should fear it more smith would be sacrificing money the bears would be saving money and sacrificing credibility from within the organization and around the nfl " in philadelphia the eagles let quarterback jeff garcia walk after he filled in ably for the injured donovan mcnabb leading the team to five straight wins and a playoff victory instead philly signed last years third stringer a j feeley to a three year contract on its face the move looked surprising but not to philadelphia inquirer columnist bob ford "by deciding to cast its fate with feeley as backup to the surgically repaired donovan mcnabb the eagles front office wasnt dismissing what garcia accomplished in " mr ford writes "the eagles were just playing the game the way they play it there is no point in paying three good quarterbacks and feeley was already under contract for the only bit of shrewd poker on the part of the team was its determination that feeley should be signed while keeping garcia was still an option in that way if feeley decided to play hardball well he would be taking a chance " mr garcia likely will land on his feet as a starter elsewhere in philly its mcnabbs job to lose "the next quarterback who turns down a starting job somewhere else and starters money to be a backup will be the first " rich hofmann writes in the philadelphia daily news last year the golden state warriors won games and finished games out of the playoff hunt this year the warriors are on pace to win games though in a shallower pool out west theyre just two games back of the final playoff spot another big difference between last years team and this year today the warriors are leaner and hungrier literally san francisco chronicle columnist scott ostler says theyve lost a collective pounds with even the coach who demanded the slimming shedding weight los angeles clippers point guard shaun livingston dislocated his knee in an awkward landing from a layup last night if youd rather skip the gruesome photos these words from los angeles times columnist bill dwyre paint the picture "the first thing you noticed is that he didnt even try to get up athletes tend to be warriors to do everything they can to get back in there this time any adrenaline suggesting that to livingston was quickly erased by the pain if you watch enough sporting events you will see something like this every once in awhile it is always horrible " backup denver broncos running back damien nash died saturday at age he collapsed shortly after playing in a basketball game staged to raise money for the medical care of his older brother who recently had a heart transplant its not yet known what killed nash who died one month after broncos cornerback darrent williams was killed in a drive by shooting "the randomness of lifes tragedies had the broncos wondering why they were picked to grieve twice in a day span " mike klis writes in the denver post two tales from high school basketball in one adults bungle things for the kids in another they help create an inspiring moment first the dunce cap goes to shabazz high officials for scheduling more games than are allowed by new jersey thereby costing the girls basketball team a berth in the tournament they otherwise would have earned "the blunder takes the best team in the state out of the tournament and thats bad for the girls who will graduate and never get a chance to play in it again bad for the competition that doesnt have a chance to measure up against the best and bad for the school community " steve politi writes in the newark star ledger on the flip side theres the story of josh neace a silver grove ky junior who has cerebral palsy and who films games for the varsity hoops team at the end of a recent blowout by the big trains over heritage josh was put into the game to shoot two free throws in place of an injured player he connected on his fifth attempt his time at the line extended by a teammate deliberately committing a lane violation to give him more chances skeptics might question these staged scoring opportunities there was another one mentioned in the fix last week but if this is a crime its a victimless one celebrated by all who witnessed it "the game ended in a lopsided silver grove victory and nobody left unhappy " shannon russell writes in the cincinnati enquirer "silver grove players mobbed josh in the locker room as thrilled as if hed drilled the game winning basket and heritage players congratulated him " adds ms russell "the next day josh was the talk of school students and teachers complimented him and players made sure he was part of their team huddle before practice ended joshs lasting smile spoke volumes i would say he said that was cool " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to
