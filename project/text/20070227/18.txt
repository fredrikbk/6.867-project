big u s airlines face obstacles updating fleets as carriers rebound they find plane makers are largely sold out the nations biggest airlines back on firmer financial ground after a five year slump are eager to start replacing their aging aircraft fleets but they face some major obstacles among their biggest challenges finding enough new airplanes to meet their needs figuring out a way to pay for them and deciding how long they can afford to wait in line for delivery if they dont succeed the consequences could include more delays for air travelers during the slump that began in the major u s carriers sat on the sidelines focusing on cost cutting while their foreign rivals went on a buying spree now production at boeing co and airbus the worlds leading aircraft makers is largely sold out until moreover the nations biggest potential aircraft buyers amr corp s american airlines ual corp s united airlines and delta air lines inc would prefer "new generation" single aisle planes that boeing and airbus havent even designed yet rather than derivatives of s and as that have been available for decades another potential hitch with their balance sheets battered by years of financial crisis the big airlines arent in a position at least for now to commit billions of dollars to buying planes over the next few years but if they dont start buying soon many of their planes will be nearing years old the point where it typically makes more economic sense to replace them than to keep operating them though those older planes can still fly safely they are less reliable developing more mechanical problems that can lead to flight delays and cancellations the older planes also tend to have noisier engines and lack passenger entertainment systems according to a recent analysis by boeing u s airlines will face an avalanche of aging airplanes beginning in if they dont start ordering this year and next for planes that would be delivered between and the analysis of data supplied by airclaims ltd shows that major u s airlines now have a total of airplanes that are to years old without new orders that number is expected to grow to airplanes by and as many as by in order to avoid piling on a mountain of debt all at once u s airlines need to start replacing planes soon and in a steady but growing stream otherwise they risk having both high debt and an elderly fleet as they try to manage the complicated task of integrating vast numbers of new planes american united and delta are pressing boeing and airbus to step up development of newer more fuel efficient aircraft but those new models might not be ready until or beyond "we want to be very thoughtful about what is coming next before we order too many of the current generation" of aircraft tom horton amrs chief financial officer said at an investors conference in december however neither boeing nor airbus see a big leap in fuel efficiency or other new technology on the horizon that would justify the investment needed to produce successors to their current and a models which are still selling well boeing last year won a record orders for the venerable a sign that the model still has several years of life in the market by delaying their orders until new generation aircraft were available the big u s airlines would be taking a big risk in the years they were largely absent from the market airlines in asia the middle east and india have gobbled most available production slots for both single aisle planes favored on domestic routes and twin aisle planes used for long haul flights with all nippon airways and jal international of japan emirates and singapore airlines among the largest customers in terms of value of planes jim mcnerney boeings chief executive officer recently said he expects some of the foreign carriers to come back for more adding to boeings backlog boeing in particular doesnt want to ramp up its production to accommodate latecomers and airbus is preoccupied with problems on its mega jumbo a and developing a new model to compete with boeings hot selling for orders of any size both manufacturers are quoting delivery dates that are years off "some of the carriers just dont realize how tight production has gotten " said john leahy chief commercial officer at airbus a unit of european aeronautic defence &amp space co still despite their battered balance sheets and the busy production lines at boeing and airbus the big airlines are confident the aircraft makers would give them special consideration because of their size jake brace uals chief financial officer said he wishes his company was on the boeing order book because that twin aisle plane has the latest technology "the order book is full to and we are not on that list " he said "but we think if we were ready to place a significant order somehow we could find planes even without a production increase " mel fauscett deltas managing director of fleet planning and aircraft acquisition says delta and some other airlines have options they could exercise to get a place in line for new planes and that the manufacturers might also be willing to rev up production to win big u s orders moreover "a lot of the airplanes ordered by emerging countries will never be delivered or built " he predicted "airlines are buying them for runways that havent been built " american the worlds largest carrier by traffic has the most pressing need its md jetliners in service are years old on average guzzle more fuel than new s and lack audiovisual gear to entertain passengers the planes account for nearly half of americans plane mainline fleet and are the workhorse of its domestic operations late last year americans parent acknowledged that one of its most significant challenges is devising a near term plan to replace the md s the company said in its annual report filed friday that it is considering replacing some of its older planes before but that its recent losses heavy debt and poor credit rating may make it difficult to get financing swapping the md s for boeing s assuming the airline could get that many would cost nearly &# billion americas parent unlike some of its rivals stayed out of bankruptcy court during the latest downturn it is currently struggling to pay down its towering long term debt which stood at &# billion in december united the no airline has somewhat more breathing room having used a stay in bankruptcy court to restructure its fleet its oldest planes vintage s wont start turning years old until though of them will hit that milestone by "if we ordered today wed be putting in orders for old technology " said mr brace the cfo of uniteds parent for now he said uals priority is strengthening its balance sheet aside from funds put aside to upgrade its international cabins the company has no aircraft capital spending in its business plan for the next four years once aircraft makers come up with new generation models united wants "to be right there at the front of the line" to place orders mr brace said delta which aims to emerge from bankruptcy court protection in about two months is shuffling aircraft around as it tries to shift more of its service to international markets where competition isnt as fierce to reduce its capital commitments delta which has mainline jetliners that on average are a little more than years old has been selling boeing delivery positions to aircraft leasing companies deltas mr fauscett says his airline with boeings blessing has sold rights to s it had on order meanwhile it has placed orders for smaller s and is taking over the leases on american s "we have aircraft were going to have to make decisions on in five years " he says continental airlines inc and southwest airlines co continued to take new airplanes in the past few years and now have the youngest fleets about nine years old on average among the nations major carriers northwest airlines corp poised to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings in the next few months kept receiving new planes during its reorganization even so northwest has the oldest fleet in the u s years old on average and needs to tackle replacing the dc s it owns that are years old according to fitch ratings
