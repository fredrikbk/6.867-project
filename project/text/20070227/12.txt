biological and chemical safety nets as congress revisits homeland security now is a good time to assess the governments progress in preventing or mitigating another more catastrophic attack or more deaths from biological chemical or nuclear threats setting aside genetically engineered agents which may take years for terrorists to master most experts agree on the three most dangerous bioterror agents smallpox anthrax and botulinum toxin smallpox is the only agent of the three that results in a contagious disease thankfully a smallpox attack appears to be the least likely due to the difficulty of obtaining the virus here we can point to one of the biggest homeland security achievements the stockpiling of enough smallpox vaccine for every american and the plans that are in place for widespread mass vaccination in the event of an attack it is true that the response is likely to be delayed because there are only first responders vaccinated nationwide in contrast to the original government goal of and an uncontrolled smallpox epidemic would be disastrous nevertheless widespread mass vaccination e g one million people vaccinated per day per afflicted city coupled with the difficulty of initially infecting large numbers of people the virus does not survive long in the air and the slow speed of disease spread each generation of the disease is approximately two weeks precludes a situation in which tens of thousands of u s citizens will die what about anthrax late last year the government cancelled a &# million contract with vaxgen inc for developing and stockpiling a new generation of anthrax vaccine suitable for civilian use consequently the number of deaths in a large scale aerosol anthrax attack would depend largely on the response or lack thereof during the first several days for anthrax the single most important post attack capability is rapid antibiotic distribution unfortunately this has been left to individual cities and states whose capabilities vary widely based on a suggestion i made along with edward kaplan of yale washington d c will in the event of a large attack use postal workers to deliver antibiotics door to door to minimize the mayhem and the time required for distribution the federal government should roll out this program nationwide the third bioterror agent of grave concern is botulinum toxin the deadliest substance known to humans the obvious mode of attack is via the water or food supply but fortunately reservoirs are too large and their treatment systems too harsh to make it workable to their credit after the government and dairy industry intensified the heat pasteurization formula for milk the most obvious food target because the toxin mixes well in liquids and seven billion gallons of milk are consumed annually in the u s the inactivation efficacy of the new pasteurization formula is classified however so it is not clear whether this is sufficient to prevent a large number of casualties in the event but a post pasteurization attack would be inefficient for terrorists because milk is bottled soon after pasteurization thats the good news the bad news is that the government has made no other perceptible move to prevent deliberate food contamination just as the clean air act led to consequence analyses to estimate the number of casualties from an accident at chemical facilities legislation is now required to estimate the number of casualties from a terrorist attack at food and beverage facilities this undertaking would allow for an effective allocation of counterterrorism resources such as security upgrades process changes as in the dairy industry and testing for botulinum toxin during food production targeted at the food facilities and perhaps their upstream supply chains that could generate a huge death toll if attacked chemical security is not much farther along than food security we do know which specific facilities the ones that store or produce heavier than air chemicals that can travel to miles could generate the most casualties if attacked and we know there are plants nationwide that if attacked could result in the death or serious injury of over people but the only progress toward prevention thus far are voluntary security investments made by the private sector fences and background checks on workers might deter or thwart an attack by an unsophisticated or under resourced terrorist group but a determined group can compromise any chemical facility or shipment that it puts its mind to consequently what is needed is a redesign of the processes or products of the most dangerous facilities such as replacing hydrofluoric acid with sulfuric acid or modified hydrofluoric acid neither of which pose nearly as dangerous a risk in the alkylation process at large oil refineries in urban areas where immense amounts of this acid are currently stored although both houses of congress last autumn produced chemical security bills with some teeth there was no vote rather a watered down version was attached as a rider to the department of homeland securitys budget appropriation which does not require high risk facilities such as oil refineries to consider or use safer chemicals or processes both houses of congress are currently considering a chemical plant security bill but it is not yet clear whether it will improve real security by mandating process changes or merely produce a facade in the form of fences and background checks the biggest chemical threat may be the transport of the ton tank cars containing toxic gases such as chlorine or anhydrous ammonia that are shipped each year in the u s attacks on these well marked cars in a densely populated area could also harm people tank cars cannot currently be designed to weather a suicide attack or a bombing we therefore need to ban these hazardous shipments through populated areas and not simply require their continuous tracking as the department of homeland security recently proposed incredibly when washington attempted to block hazardous rail shipments through its municipality the federal government sided with the rail industry in court and had the ban overturned the worst case scenario is a nuclear weapon detonated in a major u s city the most effective way to deal with this threat is to secure all the nuclear weapons and materials in the former soviet union this has not been done hence we must resort to keeping this material from entering the country a second line of defense program has put in place detection systems at some critical roads leading out of the former soviet union but the bush administrations approach to preventing nuclear weapons and materials from coming through our ports has been dismal essentially amounting to radiation testing of shipping containers that are flagged by the deeply flawed targeting system of u s customs radiation testing and two dimensional scanning which detects heavy metal shielding of all u s bound containers and human analysis of enough of these scans to provide a deterrent effect is possible without increasing port congestion it should be undertaken immediately at overseas ports true president bush signed the safe port act last october which requires radiation testing at domestic ports but terrorists can detonate a bomb remotely at a u s port and shield a weapons emissions with heavy material thus the law provides only the illusion of security we are today safer from a smallpox or a botulinum in milk attack but only marginally safer from an anthrax botulinum in food chemical or nuclear attack most of the cost to secure the latter three scenarios can be passed on to consumers but the federal government needs to lead the way let us hope that during the next five years these gaping holes are fixed so that terrorists are forced to use much less dangerous methods mr wein is paul e holden professor of management science at stanfords graduate school of business see related
