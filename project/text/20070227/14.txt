budget strain the u s tax outlook is unraveling fast an increasing number of existing tax rates are temporary and to keep them from rising automatically congress and the president will have to agree on new hard to pass laws unfortunately washingtons inclination is to add additional taxes to pay for the theoretical "cost" of keeping tax rates at their current level as more of the tax system falls into this trap adding permanent new taxes annually in order to keep other tax rates from going up it will soon create a strong enough tax bias to slow growth by the magnitude of the tax increases needed simply to maintain current rates will amount to over &# billion per year a looming economic train wreck the logic is strong for new tax writing procedures to stop the upward tax ratchet the budget is moving rapidly toward balance due to the flood of tax payments from private sector jobs and profits the growth and asset price gains from current tax rates are readily apparent and foreign countries are cutting tax rates to gain competitiveness even so the odds have shifted heavily toward annual tax hikes under the guise of budget neutrality president bush now seems likely to sign two tax increases in and another in each presented by congress deceptively as a tax cut this sets the precedent for similar treatment and much bigger tax hikes in the next administration whether republican or democrat as it confronts the scheduled tax increases on income dividends and capital gains how can a tax increase be called a tax cut washingtons tax scoring magic budget bean counters measure tax hikes from a baseline that assumes tax rates are going up thus merely extending the existing rates is called a tax cut and gets headlines as such even though the extension just maintains the status quo permanent new taxes are then attached to the so called cuts and labeled "offsets " a technical term for a tax hike but these new taxes often get little attention adding to the size of the offsets the growth benefits of maintaining current rates and the harm from letting the rates rise are arbitrarily excluded from the congressional scoring process the net effect of the current system is a strong upward ratchet in tax rates and tax complexity even many anti tax republicans seem to have acquiesced budget baselines build in repeated tax increases as if those are normal and assume that economic growth stock prices and home prices are unaffected by higher tax rates a more pro growth congress could pay for maintaining existing tax rates if it thought that was necessary by restraining the budgets built in spending increases but this choice seldom if ever materializes the first tax increase is attached to the minimum wage bill to garner republican votes congress is likely to continue existing provisions which allow small businesses to expense some purchases rather than depreciate them over time it will be trumpeted as a tax cut but is mostly just the extension of current tax treatment by itself this provision is a good idea fostering small business investments and counteracting some of the job losses from the higher minimum wage however the proposed legislation pairs the small business provision with tax increases in other areas the result will be higher tax rates and payments in than but it will be called a tax cut the congressional joint committee on taxation makes clear the artifice in its scoring of the senate and house bills it labels one section "provisions that raise revenues " amounting to &# billion in the senate bill and &# billion in the house bill but jct is careful not to label the other section a tax cut instead calling it "small business provisions " the second likely tax hike involves the alternative minimum tax amt each year it needs to be patched by increasing the amount of income excluded from the tax so that the number of people charged the amt penalty doesnt escalate congress typically treats the patch as a tax cut even though it doesnt reduce anyones taxes but in the same bill congress will probably add permanent new taxes amounting to as much as &# billion as an "offset " unless the president or congress calls a halt even larger tax increases will be needed in to offset the amts expansion the upward trend is large enough that the amt related tax increases alone may begin to undermine u s competitiveness and growth even before congress and a new administration confront the much bigger tax increases sen grassley has called for repealing the amt for individuals without adding other taxes in the unlikely event this un washington approach wins the day it would be a pro growth coup for u s competitiveness breaking the upward tax ratchet significantly simplifying the tax code leaving more money in the private sector to encourage work and innovation disappointing the lobbyists whose livelihood depends on annual expansions of the tax code and most importantly setting a pro growth precedent for future tax legislation sen grassley is probably asking too much of a system designed to add taxes not repeal them at the root of the problem congresss tax writing procedures are based on the static scoring assumption that higher tax rates dont slow growth or taxable income its as if the taxes come from thin air rather than from peoples paychecks and profits one pro growth step congress could take this year short of repealing the amt would be to acknowledge that economic growth will be faster with the amt patch than without it the added tax receipts from patch dependent economic growth could be used to offset some or most of the revenue loss attributed to the patch reducing the offsets and limiting the upward tax ratchet by washington standards this would be revolutionary the tax hikes making their way through congress in and could well be large enough to reduce the attractiveness of investment in the u s relative to fast growing tax cutting economies abroad more worrisome the procedures being used point to more onerous tax hikes in the next administration enough to stop the expansion if the likely amt process adding new taxes to extend current rates is applied to the expirations it would be the biggest tax increase in history the irony is that the upward tax bias has become more entrenched at a time when the fiscal deficit is nearing balance in substantial part due to current tax rates washingtons decisions on the amt patch are especially important because they will influence the markets thinking on the expiration of the tax cuts if it looks like the tax rates critical to economic growth and asset price appreciation will expire in or will be maintained through offsets this will point to recession tax changes should add to economic growth and employment and simplify the code factors not given much weight in the current tax writing procedures congress and the president should break the upward tax ratchet starting with the amt a pro growth pro jobs approach would permanently index amt for inflation without adding new taxes even better repeal the amt neither political party likes it acknowledging that the economy will do better without it the surprise repeal of an ineffective tax would make clear to global investors that the u s plans to avoid the economic train wreck facing its tax code mr malpass is bear
