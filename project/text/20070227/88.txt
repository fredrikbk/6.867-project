politics &amp economics democrats battle over policy on iraq lawmakers debate whether to exercise power of the purse washington democrats face a crucial question as an iraq war spending bill begins moving through the house can congress continue to fault u s policy from a distance or must lawmakers take hold of it and risk owning the outcome the new democratic majority has followed the politically safer course of nonbinding resolutions and a senate proposal to revisit the war authorization but with action needed on a &# billion iraq spending request harping from the sidelines may no longer be enough to satisfy independent voters who looked to democrats in the elections to effect real change the package includes &# billion to help sustain a planned increase of at least u s troops in iraq a commitment many in congress opposed about &# billion would help replenish worn equipment and recognizing the strain on troops cycled in and out of iraq the pentagon wants &# billion to create two army combat brigades and three marine battalions to ease the load "the rapid cycle is not sustainable " budget officials say in the wake of their election losses in november republicans have their own divisions over the presidents policy but democrats face greater pressure and the debate exposes internal politics and warring personalities especially in the house after proposing restrictions on the funds the bills manager rep john murtha d pa has been pummeled by republicans and fellow democrats eager to bring him down a peg or two his friendship with speaker nancy pelosi d calif and past rivalry with majority leader steny hoyer d md adds spice to the story and fearing the entire bill could collapse house appropriations committee chairman david obey d wis has sanctioned the drafting of waivers to the murtha backed provisions that would restore more flexibility to the administration "they want to end the war but they want to fund the war " said mr murtha frustrated by his partys reluctance to exert its power over spending rep rahm emanuel the democratic caucus chairman is cautious about crossing this line and argues any conditions on funding should focus on the iraq government not u s forces "congress has the job of oversight and holding the administration accountable but the war is owned and managed from pennsylvania avenue " the illinois democrat said "congress will fund our troops as long as theyre in harms way " said ms pelosi yesterday she has asked mr murtha to speak to the full caucus this evening and the year old lawmaker symbolizes how much the politics of the antiwar debate has changed since the vietnam war in which he fought in the s vietnam was a bigger bloodier war than iraq but the burden was spread among many more including draftees who served typically one year tours iraq is the first prolonged test of the all volunteer military with a much smaller universe of soldiers and marines bearing the burden and serving multiple tours that has fundamentally changed the debate ushering in the likes of mr murtha a longtime pentagon supporter who has come to fear that mr bushs policy is wreaking havoc with the military he said he believes the war is sacrificing not just troops but the militarys long term readiness more than a year ago he leapt the chasm between criticizing the war and offering a plan for early withdrawal mr murtha predicts a full fledged iraq spending debate wont come until congress deals with the pentagon budget this summer and the timing of the supplemental spending bill now is a problem both for the military and lawmakers hoping to quell sectarian violence the administration will focus the new troops on a set of mixed shiite and sunni neighborhoods accounting for about a third of baghdads population but the army is so short of combat ready units it will take until may to complete the "surge" of five brigades this makes it dicey for lawmakers to intercede in the midst of deployments on the other hand the continued shortage of personnel will make it harder for the administration to maintain the higher levels after may the white house has been vague about how it will do this the president asked for money only through sept after which none is requested in his budget even though military planners assume more time is required for the added troops to be effective mr murtha recommends providing ample money for the military but attaching restrictions that effectively create a cap allowing deployment of three or four brigades not five the bill would go beyond the presidents request by adding money to build up strategic reserve units at home and require marine and army chiefs to certify in advance that any unit deployed be "fully mission capable" with personnel and equipment most controversial he would add provisions to make it harder for the administration to stretch personnel either by extending combat tours for units already in iraq or sending them back faster to the war zone the ban on extending tours would immediately affect the armys plan to have brigades in iraq by may and the problem would recur in june and july republicans and the white house have attacked the limitations as a "slow bleed" strategy that will endanger units in iraq "its not me that bleeds the troops " mr murtha said "its the president who is bleeding the military by overdeploying them " he remains opposed to allowing the administration to waive the requirement but appears resigned to see amendments that would weaken the bill added in the appropriations committee next week by fellow democrats "they can always offer amendments " he said
