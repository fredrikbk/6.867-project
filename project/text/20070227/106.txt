milestone not only because it brings shiites sunnis and kurds into agreement but also because it offers a glimmer of hope that the countrys vast energy resources could finally be put to use though iraq possesses some of the worlds largest oil deposits decades of war and underinvestment have damaged the countrys oil industry and much of iraq remains unexplored the wall street journal notes the industry has seen little improvement since former president saddam hussein was toppled oil output has fallen to less than two million barrels a day from million before the u s led invasion in the financial times writes the draft law which still must be approved by parliament would allow regional iraqi oil companies or governments to sign contracts with foreign firms for the exploration and development of oil fields the new york times says oil revenue would be distributed to provinces or regions based on populations the times notes adding that this arrangement may ease sunni worries that

ministers told the washington post the law would be "an important breakthrough to establishing the political economy of what we want to see an iraq that is democratic federal and united " but even if

mail " capt clayton combs who led the u s raid that uncovered the makeshift factory tells the wall street journal "you can plot the instructions and start putting it together on site and thats what we have here " u s commanders worry that the weapons could go into wider use now that insurgents dont have to wait for fully assembled devices to be shipped into the country the journal reports while the
