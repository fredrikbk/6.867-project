health mailbox columnist tara parker pope answers readers questions q i have a doctor who just prescribed progesterone without even doing any blood work to see what my levels are do you know about this a s a the issue of measuring the hormone levels in a womans blood is controversial this method is widely used by purveyors of compounded hormones but its not supported by science when most doctors prescribe hormones they adjust the dose based on a womans symptoms if her symptoms dont improve or she is having too many side effects the doctor might raise or lower the dose until its at a level that offers the most symptom relief with the fewest side effects doctors who prescribe compounded hormones hormones mixed by a pharmacist add an extra step to the process performing saliva or blood tests to measure a womans natural hormone levels the idea is that this allows a doctor to determine what hormones are in short supply in a womans body and then prescribe a customized hormone mix the problem is that a womans hormone levels vary dramatically depending on the time of day or month and no data support the idea that the hormone level measured in her blood has anything to do with her symptoms no major medical group supports testing to determine a womans hormone levels during menopause even so women like to have the information and they pay for it doctor visits to check hormones can range from &# to &# with follow up visits costing &# to &# lab work can cost &# to &# and most of these costs wont be covered by insurance theres no real risk to hormone testing if you are willing to put up with the added cost and time it takes the doctor will prescribe some mix of estrogen or estrogen and progestin or possibly even testosterone based on his or her findings compounded hormones are a reasonable option for women who exhibit menopausal symptoms and many women like the close attention that they receive from doctors who prescribe compounded hormones just be aware that in using compounded hormones you are assuming the same risks and benefits of commercially prepared hormones email questions to tara parker pope at healthjournal wsj com
