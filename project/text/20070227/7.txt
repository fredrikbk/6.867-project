allies on oct the north atlantic treaty organization took the unprecedented step of formally invoking article of its charter which says that "an armed attack against one or more of them shall be considered an attack against all of them " lord geoffrey robertson then natos secretary general gave a press conference saying he wanted to "reiterate that the united states of america can rely on the full support of its nato allies in the campaign against terrorism " in recent weeks weve been reminded once again just how cheap those promises were on thursday stephane dion who leads canadas liberal party announced that as prime minister he would bring an end to the countrys strong military commitment to southern afghanistan "neither canada nato nor the americans anticipated how violent and dangerous kandahar would become in " he said adding that the proper role for canadian forces is "to win the hearts and minds of the afghan people " also in recent weeks the italian government of romano prodi briefly collapsed after it was unable to muster the votes to approve the enlargement of a u s army base in vicenza along with the continuance of italys man deployment in afghanistan george w bush has had to plead publicly with nato nations to increase their troop commitments and would it be too much to ask deploy them in areas where they are likely to see combat to make up for the nato shortfall britain is sending in another soldiers while the u s is extending the tour of the tenth mountain infantry brigade and sending in troops from the nd airborne it is a statistical certainty that american and british soldiers will pay a price in blood this spring because their french spanish italian german and if mr dion has his way canadian counterparts mean to keep their moral slates clean a century ago that would have been a mark of martial and national dishonor of "letting the side down " today it is a concession to the political reality that most nato governments cannot muster political support for anything except a "peace mission" in afghanistan "if you are non u s implicitly there is a political calculus " says a senior u s army officer about his nato colleagues "you are looking over your shoulder to ottawa youre asking will getting five killed in action mean a phone call about the wisdom of this particular operation " afghanistan of course was supposed to have been the "good war" the war that unlike iraq everyone was willing to fight now the best that can be said for france germany italy and company is that they will not actively stand in the way of its being fought so long as theyre not fighting but even that is an improvement over the way some european governments are conducting themselves in the war on terror closer to home earlier this month an italian court named and indicted cia officers and five italian officials for the rendition to egypt of a cleric named osama mustafa hassan nasr aka abu omar germany too has issued arrest warrants for cia officers involved in the abduction in macedonia of a german man of lebanese descent named khaled al masri mr masri has since become a cause celebre back home a living indictment of the bush administrations perfidious approach to fighting terrorism in sheikh omars case even the italians dont dispute the egyptian was a dangerous actor he is believed to have recruited terrorists and plotted an attack on the u s embassy in rome mr masri by contrast is usually depicted as an innocent caught up in a web of cia intrigue but as john rosenthal of the invaluable transatlantic intelligencer blog notes it was german not american intelligence that first became intensely concerned about mr masris activities not two weeks after mr masri was already being investigated by authorities in baden wurttemberg as a "follower of bin laden " a classified report from germanys federal bureau of criminal investigations notes that mr masri maintained "numerous contacts to dangerous persons and accused suspects in the domain of islamist terrorism " he had a friendship with a militant islamist named reda seyam suspected of involvement in the bali bombings he frequented an islamic cultural center known for distributing audiocassettes with such charming messages as "whoever fights against the christians the jews and their allies is a martyr " it was shut down by bavarian officials in december and the organization that ran it was banned for all this mr masri may be guilty of nothing more than fellow traveling the same might be said of the german government which at a minimum involved itself in the abduction it now means to prosecute by agreeing to keep the whole matter secret "the german government witness to the entire incident pretended not to know anything " the german newsweekly der spiegel reported in "in a court of law such behavior amounts to the suppression of evidence " the german government also involved itself in another apparent cia kidnapping in december of a german citizen and terrorist suspect named mohammed haydar zammar who was later rendered to his native syria rather than demand his instant repatriation however the government of gerhard schroeder arranged for investigators to interview mr zammer in syria in exchange for which it dropped charges against two syrian agents in germany mr zammar remains in a syrian prison none of this need shame the german government mr zammar is reported to have recruited some of the hijackers and his fate is richly deserved what is shameful is that the same governments that actively colluded with the u s to bring the worst terrorist cases to some kind of justice are now bending to the demands of activist prosecutors and the prevailing anti american mood and again allowing the u s to take the flak for what were often joint operations for the indicted cia officers that flak is less deadly than what the gis in afghanistan can look forward to this spring but the principle is the same asked what he worried about
