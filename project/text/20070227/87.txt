politics &amp economics carbon curbs gain backers energy groups shift stance possibly giving campaign new fuel washington seeking to shape legislation before congress three major energy trade associations have shifted their stances and decided to back mandatory federal curbs on carbon dioxide and other man made emissions that could accelerate climate change joined by the afl cio the groups say they now plan to use their lobbying clout to stake out positions that favor modest economy wide regulations in hopes of minimizing anticipated energy price increases and pre empting state efforts that could result in a patchwork of differing state and regional regulations the shift by the groups which include the edison electric institute and the american gas association underscores their belief that congress is in a mood to pass some form of mandatory emissions controls perhaps before the next election in "we want to be at the table" during the debate said paul wilkinson a vice president of the american gas association which represents utilities that distribute natural gas throughout the u s taken with environmental concessions made in the proposed &# billion purchase of electric utility txu corp by seven buyout firms as well as the oscar related attention over former vice president al gores documentary on global warming on sunday the efforts could provide new momentum to the campaign to reduce the emissions believed by many scientists to cause global warning separately yesterday the governors of california oregon new mexico arizona and washington state jointly announced plans to reduce "greenhouse gases" through a "cap and trade" program that would allocate emissions credits to companies which could use or trade them new england states and new york have adopted a similar regional approach the american gas association had previously opposed federal action to control climate change emissions as "unwarranted " mr wilkinson said the associations board reversed itself last week because of growing signs that congress could pass mandatory controls while debates could go on for years in congress he said the basic structure of the bill could be determined soon the largest trade group and the one likely to be hardest hit by any energy price increases under national regulations is the edison electric institute whose members generate of electricity in the u s the institutes board including chief executive officers of utilities last month approved a set of principles supporting "federal action" to reduce greenhouse gas emissions institute chairman james e rogers described the lengthy closed meeting as "crossing a bridge" for members of the group which previously supported only voluntary reductions he added that his group wants a "safety valve" that would require the government to intervene as needed to keep the price of emissions credits stable and low the electric power supply association which represents companies that sell electricity on a wholesale basis also recently endorsed mandatory federal measures association president john e shelk said members want some certainty over what kinds of power plants they should invest in "this is whats really driving the do it now argument " he said the afl cio yesterday joined the drive by issuing its own plan calling for mandatory controls that would "gradually slow the growth" of greenhouse gas emissions the plan seeks implementation of a cost cap to prevent sudden increases in energy prices that could hit businesses robert baugh who heads a task force developing the labor groups energy strategy said the critical issue is jobs "we dont want to close down businesses here and put them offshore " he said at least five different versions of a federal cap and trade system to reduce emissions have been introduced on capitol hill all would require companies that produce carbon based fuels or emissions to have government allocated permits for each ton of carbon in the fuel they handle regulators would gradually reduce the caps but companies could trade their credits those that modernize their equipment to reduce emissions to below the federal caps could sell their extra quotas companies that need more credits could buy them to get under the declining caps or pay a penalty all five bills target electricity producers because half of the nations electricity is generated by coal fired plants coal has the highest carbon content among all fuels mr rogers of the edison electric institute said that under a mandatory cap system his industry would need more federal assistance to develop new emission controls particularly ways to separate co emissions and inject them into the ground if the technology which remains unproven on a commercial scale fails power producers would have more emissions than they had planned and would need to buy more emissions credits in that case the government should intervene by freezing the market price for carbon credits which would otherwise rise he said eventually most costs would be passed on to consumers while none of these groups backs a particular bill legislation being prepared by sens jeff bingaman d n m and arlen specter r pa features the safety valve to keep emissions credit prices low and a more moderate approach towards emissions reductions "these groups are saying its time to go " said jason grumet staff director for the bipartisan national commission on energy policy which helped draft portions of the bingaman bill another bill sponsored by sens john mccain r ariz and joseph i lieberman i conn which takes a more aggressive approach and doesnt have a safety valve is favored by environmental groups fred krupp president of environmental defense called safety valve proposals a form of government "price controls" that would discourage innovation estimates of the cost the various bills would impose on the nations economy havent been fully worked out one environmental group resources for the future estimates that the bingaman measure would increase electricity prices by while the mccain bill could hike prices by as much as
