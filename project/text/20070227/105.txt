the middle seat a new way to prevent lost luggage radio frequency id tags show promise in las vegas as global airline standards group considers mandating use a high tech baggage tagging system already in use in las vegas and hong kong is showing promise for reducing lost airline baggage and this summer an industry airline group will decide whether to force airlines to deploy the technology world wide in june the board of governors of the international air transport association which sets standards for airlines will vote on whether to mandate a phase in of radio frequency id baggage tags the tags which transmit a bags identifying number much like a toll road pass reduce lost luggage an estimated according to industry estimates they improve accuracy in the grimy world of baggage sorting making sure more bags get on the right airplane they also can be used by airlines to track the location of a delayed bag so airlines dont have to confess they have no idea where a bag is economics are also spurring the potential adoption of rfid for years airlines have been studying the technology but the idea has always been grounded by the cost of the baggage tags once more than &# a piece by comparison the current bar code printed tags cost only about four cents a piece or less but the price of rfid baggage tags has come down considerably to as low as cents per tag several tests of rfid technology are underway in europe and asia but the biggest implementation so far has been in las vegas instead of waiting for airlines to invest las vegas mccarran international airport decided to roll the dice and start using rfid tags on its own in september spending more than &# million a year to buy tags embedded with a radio frequency id chip the airport was hoping to reduce travel hassles the new technology could yield a quick improvement in airline baggage woes last year more than million of the million bags checked for domestic u s travel were mishandled and the rate for lost baggage has been increasing for the past four years rfid has the potential to reverse the trend and ultimately save money for airlines last year u s airlines spent an estimated &# million on lost luggage money that went to reimburse passengers and deliver late bags to hotels and homes iata has already set a world wide technology standard for rfid so every airline in every country can read each others tags and secured a unique uhf radio frequency for baggage tags world wide "its reaching the tipping point " said iata spokesman lorne riley in geneva "the business case itself is relatively strong " the iata has successfully fostered technology upgrades in the industry before the group required airlines to implement electronic ticketing this is how the rfid system works when a bag is checked at an airline ticket counter in las vegas or a remote location at a casino it gets a normal looking baggage tag embedded with an rfid chip as the bag goes along conveyor belts it passes through curtained stations where receivers read the bags identification and route it to security screening then to a drop point for the airline from there bags are loaded onto carts and driven out to airplanes the system is accurate in reading tags a significant improvement over the to accuracy that airports get with bar coded tags read by optical scanners scanners often cant read barcode tags if the tag gets twisted or covered up or it was smudged when printed because the printer hadnt been cleaned recently so to of all bags get dumped into an "unknown" pile and have to be manually sorted some of those often dont make their flights las vegas handles more than outbound bags per day so bags or more had to be manually sorted when bar coded tags were used rfid has reduced that to only about bags a day that las vegas is currently paying cents a tag and iatas rfid project manager andrew price says one manufacturer has recently lowered the price for bulk rfid tags to cents each as technology advances make manufacturing cheaper if the price gets down to cents a piece iata projects that airlines world wide would save &# million annually by reducing lost luggage to get the full benefit of the technology airlines would have to deploy rfid antennas at different parts of their operation such as on belts that move bags up into the belly of airplanes the system could alert baggage handlers to a bag about to be loaded onto the wrong flight another benefit hand held receivers can help find a bag in the cargo hold when a passengers bag has to be removed it works like a geiger counter beeping more loudly as it gets closer to the hunted bag rfid isnt a cure all for lost baggage luggage will still fall off carts get taken off flights too heavy for takeoff get left behind by inattentive baggage handlers or even end up stolen still some travelers think the new technology could lead to big improvements "i think its a great idea this makes me nervous just throwing bags in a big pile " said traveler charles coons of las vegas who didnt notice the circuitry embedded in his baggage tag on a recent trip out of town "its terrible when they have no idea where it is " iata whose board is mostly airline ceos thinks that the ideal way to deploy rfid is for airports to pay for the radio receivers needed which cost less than bar coded systems and need less maintenance and for airlines to buy the bag tags "its almost impossible for airlines to do it on their own " said randall walker director of the las vegas airport airlines however may balk at the added expense as their finances improve some airlines are beginning to upgrade their service but there are lots of competing needs for cash many carriers need to replace beat up old equipment upgrade airplane interiors or invest in new in flight entertainment systems some are under pressure to give employees raises and buy new airplanes but las vegas which has had a steady stream of airline and airport executives flying in to take a look at its system since it launched months ago has been surprised that no airline has stepped up and plunged into rfid as a marketing ploy be the first airline to advertise better luggage service and tracking the technology is so good said samuel ingalls head of information systems for mccarran who led the las vegas project that "it will get to the point where passengers know who has it and who doesnt " better baggage rfid tags have several big benefits for travelers more accurate sorting only about of bags need to be manually sorted compared to the to that need such handling with current barcode technology better tracking airlines can more accurately pinpoint where a delayed bag is located and when it will arrive fewer lost bags the percentage of bags lost has risen in the past four years
