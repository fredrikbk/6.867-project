subprime games reckoning day risky lending fallout threatens to spread uncertain arm strength the worst may be yet to come for mortgage lenders and that could add to investor nervousness shares of companies that specialize in lending to riskier borrowers or offer unconventional loans have tumbled because of concerns over how rapidly these mortgages are going sour if these so called subprime borrowers continue to have problems paying their debts the lenders that target them likely will have to boost how much money they set aside for bad loans cutting into their bottom lines that could mean even lower stock prices there also is a concern that if the real estate market remains cool some borrowers with better credit histories might also begin struggling to make payments on certain popular but unorthodox mortgages these types of loans allow borrowers to skip monthly payments carry low short term teaser rates or dont require detailed financial documentation if that happens companies such as bankunited financial corp and countrywide financial corp could suffer when a company keeps its reserve low it makes its earnings look better because it continues to increase its assets from loans it originates and sells off that holds down expenses but when a company beefs up those reserves and the change hits its earnings that can impair its ability to borrow the short term

place into their investment loan portfolio some poorly performing mortgages that they have bought back under terms of their sale agreement that would required them to boost loan loss reserves subprime lenders already have seen their shares tumble novastar is off and new century is down in the past days and they could fall further if their credit lines dry up because of poor loan loss provisioning novastar shares are trading at about times estimated per share earnings but that valuation is likely to change as analysts adjust their projections to account for the companys steep fourth quarter loss and poor earnings outlook new century shares also are trading at about times estimated earnings for some investors urge caution about lenders that cater to borrowers with better credit but focus
