reply all is xm sirius good for consumers online edition the proposed merger of xm satellite radio holdings inc and sirius satellite radio inc would end years of bitter rivalry by combining the only two companies licensed by the federal communications commission to provide satellite radio services in the u s xm and sirius executives said the deal will lead to more programming for consumers and help the money losing firms better compete with radio broadcasting giants as well as ipods internet radio and others but consumer advocates worry the merger will result in less choice and higher prices regulators have promised to closely examine the combination which comes five years after antitrust enforcers blocked the merger of satellite tv rivals echostar communications corp and directv group inc the scrutiny begins wednesday when the house judiciary committees new antitrust task force will hold a hearing on the xm sirius merger is the deal good for consumers should it be approved the wall street journal online invited longtime consumer advocate mark cooper who will testify at wednesdays hearing on behalf of consumer reports publisher consumers union and the consumer federation of america to discuss the topic with antitrust lawyer donald russell who spent years at the department of justice and later represented echostar and directv in their failed bid to merge their conversation carried out via email is below dr cooper begins the proposed merger of the only two satellite subscription radio companies xm and sirius radio should raise a red flag for both antitrust officials and communications regulators whose job is to promote competition and consumer choice in the marketplace not only were xm and sirius prohibited from merging as a condition of getting their licenses to use public airwaves to deliver their services the enormous growth of satellite subscription radio service at very substantial monthly charges and consumer equipment costs over just a few years demonstrates that this service is in fact a distinct product and could develop into a vibrant competitive market the consumer federation of america and consumers union believe the companies carry an enormous burden to demonstrate why public officials should abandon all normal rules associated with competitive markets and spectrum licensing to allow this merger the cfa and cu have seen no evidence to support such a showing and therefore urge the doj and fcc to reject this merger unless and until xm and sirius present clear cut facts demonstrating how consumers will benefit from less satellite radio competition this merger raises the most fundamental issues in antitrust and poses a substantial threat to consumers and competition in order to exercise their responsibility under the antitrust law the federal agencies must start from the assumption that the xm sirius merger is a merger to monopoly a merger between the only two firms in the market for national subscription radio service the product and geographic market characteristics of satellite radio are easily identifiable and quite distinct from other mobile and stationary listening products it is national mobile programmed radio entertainment the two services deliver and require consumers to purchase huge bundles of well over channels there are two and only two entities providing such a service the alternatives the companies suggest as substitutes do not possess this set of characteristics and therefore cannot be said to compete directly with the service entry into this market is restricted by the need to have a license to broadcast at frequencies that enable the service to be provided nationwide consumer switching costs are substantial the original licenses were issued under strict conditions that the two entities are not allowed to merge there is no circumstance more concerning from the point of view of the antitrust laws and the amendments to the communications act than a merger within a distinct product market that takes the number of competitors from two to one merger to monopoly is antithetical to the antitrust laws perhaps the worst offense against the basic principle that competition is the consumers best friend mr russell responds at the outset i should say that i simply dont know yet whether this merger will be good or bad for consumers in the long run thats a difficult question thats very hard to answer from publicly available information with that important disclaimer in place though ive been completely underwhelmed by the arguments of those who say consumers will be hurt by this merger that argument usually starts from the premise that xm and sirius compete only with each other a premise that seems implausible today and likely to become even more implausible in the future in order to succeed xm and sirius or a merged company will have to continue to convince consumers in large numbers that they should buy equipment and pay monthly subscription fees rather than listen to am and fm radio broadcasts that are for all practical purposes free that seems like pretty tough competition to me and xm and sirius have been unable to find their way to profitability yet antitrust lawyers often use a simple rule of thumb if competitors oppose a merger its usually good for consumers and here the am and fm broadcasters through their trade association the national association of broadcasters are opposing the merger very strongly its hard to see any reason they would do so other than the obvious reason a concern that a merged company will take more listeners away from the broadcasters than xm and sirius would be able to do as separate companies in other words that the merged company would offer a service that would be more attractive to consumers than the services theyre currently getting from xm and sirius so the first question i have for mark and other merger opponents is this if satellite radio doesnt compete with am and fm radio why is the nab fighting so hard to stop this merger dr cooper neither antitrust lawyers nor trade associations represent the public interest over the air radio represents indirect intermodal competition which is ineffective in disciplining market power the claim that national subscription radio service competes indirectly with a variety of partial substitutes is suspect the track record of intermodal competition disciplining anticompetitive abuse is poor at best "bank shot competition" partial or poor substitutes that are fundamentally different than the target product has failed to protect consumers in similar situations the result of relying on such competition in both merger and regulatory reviews has been rising prices and stagnation a perfect example is cable television in the s the fcc claimed that cable tv competed with over the air broadcasting based on that understanding the fcc chose to deregulate cable systems in communities with three or more broadcast signals cable rates subsequently skyrocketed by the late s the failure of this intermodal competition to discipline cable pricing was so obvious that the fcc proposed to increase the number of over the air stations necessary to represent effective competition to six seeing the results of this failed policy congress re regulated cable for a short period in the early s it also set conditions to help dbs satellite compete against cable another form of intermodal competition in the decade after the telecommunications act of which largely deregulated cable rates intermodal competition between cable and satellite failed to discipline cable rate increases average monthly cable bills have doubled since the act in short intermodal competition from neither over the air tv nor from digital distribution disciplined cable rates the former had more limited channel capacity the later had greater channel capacity it did not matter the empirical evidence from the cable space is clear only head to head competition delivers relief from anticonsumer anticompetitive pricing in the satellite radio service product space we face a similar configuration of products traditional broadcast radio digital internet distribution and mobile handheld devices like ipods that allow consumers to store and play music from their own collections or from online music sites are touted as the intermodal competitors that will discipline prices yet there are distinct differences in product quality listener experiences and mode of delivery the touted competitors are either not national not mobile or not programmed experience and careful analysis suggests that the effort to position satellite radio as merely one product option in a broader product market should be rejected mr russell i certainly wouldnt argue that traditional broadcast radio ipods cds and other sources of music serve as perfect substitutes for satellite radio each has distinctive features and capabilities that the others do not have but the real question i think is whether a satellite radio "monopolist" would be able to raise its price or spend less on quality programming without losing existing or potential customers in large numbers to the many alternatives that are available to say that there are differences between satellite radio and those other alternatives really doesnt answer that question a few years ago regulators blocked the proposed merger of echostar and directv for many of the same reasons that mark offers the result was a market with two relatively high cost satellite television competitors rather than one satellite television competitor with much lower costs that would have been able to compete much more effectively against cable companies and tv broadcasters and weve seen cable rates continue to rise as a result of that decision the xm sirius merger would also lead to a dramatic reduction in per subscriber costs and if consumers really want satellite radio service at low or lower prices it would seem that the first prerequisite is to reduce the satellite providers per subscriber costs xm just reported a loss of over &# million in its hard to see how it can continue to serve consumers in the long run unless it finds a way to reduce its costs and the same is apparently true for sirius the long term alternative to this merger is probably not the preservation of the status quo to answer whether the merger is good for consumers or not you have to answer the question what will happen to these companies without a merger the merger opponents really havent grappled with that question in a realistic way dr cooper satellite has been unable to discipline cable rate increases precisely because they are not close substitutes free over the air radio has been unable to discipline satellite radio increases in the past and will be unable to do so in the future for exactly the same reason in fact satellite radio raised its rates by a couple of years ago in spite of the existence of free over the air radio the essential disciplining force is head to head competition eventually even the monopolist drives demand into the elastic portion of the demand curve with price increases but that does not allow antitrust authorities to declare victory as consumers are being abused eliminating the head to head competition in the satellite radio market will enable the monopolist to explore the limits of its pricing power more thoroughly the losses of the satellite radio service providers reflect bad management decisions not bad economic circumstances management has made some pretty obvious mistakes they mortgaged their future in a bidding war for talent that has placed an unnecessarily heavy burden on the enterprise and then tried to recoup that mistake by high and rigid big bundle pricing they have pursued this rigid big bundle high price strategy in an industry where the marginal cost of adding subscribers is low excluding so called customer acquisition and purported equipment subsidy costs having driven costs through the roof on the supply side and restricted demand with anticonsumer pricing on the demand side the companies now plead poverty and seek monopoly power over content providers and monopoly power over consumers in the national mobile radio market mr russell ill resist the temptation to opine on whether consumers would be better off if mark were the ceo of xm or sirius but the complaint that a merged company would be a "monopolist" in buying content is an interesting one when it immediately follows a complaint that the two companies competed too hard in a bidding war to buy talent which is it mark do you want competition that bids up the price of content or a merger that keeps the price lower dr cooper my point about management goes to the proposition that bad management decisions should not be an excuse to break the law in this case a merger to monopoly clearly violates the antitrust laws moreover the fcc licenses were issued subject to the condition that the licensees never merge yet here they are asking to be excused from that condition the licensees promised to offer the public interoperable radios that would work with on both networks yet ten years have passed and there is no such interoperability the parties have violated conditions about non interference and use of terrestrial repeaters in short from day one they have failed to meet the conditions of their licenses and the public has suffered as a result ruinous competition was not the inevitable result especially in a market where there are only two competitors these particular managements chose to go down that path in pursuit of marquee programming to drive their ill considered big bundle high priced strategy the merger will certainly end that game over time as contracts unwind it would shift the bargaining power to the satellite radio monopolist mr russell its remarkable to me how closely the arguments of "consumer" organizations track the positions of the nab to see a small sample of this its worth comparing marks answer with the nabs statement opposing the merger i completely agree with marks earlier comment that trade associations dont represent the public interest which makes it all the more striking when he echoes the nabs talking points but i didnt see an answer to my earlier question if satellite radio doesnt compete against traditional radio broadcasters why is the nab making an all out effort to block the merger isnt that a pretty clear indication that the broadcasters see satellite radio as competition dr cooper trade associations and would be monopolists not to mention antitrust lawyers always cloak their arguments in the public interest the nab would like to eliminate every shred of competition no matter how minor and indirect it is that does not constitute evidence that such competition is effective or sufficient to prevent abuse mr russell i expect the proposed deal will lead to more programming choices in the long run the merged company will have greater bandwidth and so long as cost of additional programming is less that its likely value in terms of attracting subscribers i would expect the company to expand its channel offerings i also suspect though im only speculating that the merged company will move over time toward more program "tiers" and a la carte offerings simply because that will permit programming options to be more closely tailored to the preferences of individual subscribers some consumers would probably benefit from that trend others may not be happy about it but overall i dont see any reason to expect the range of consumer choices to shrink of course the companies would have major hurdles to overcome in the short term in order to move to a single platform that will be a large technical challenge and its hard to predict how successfully theyll be able to deal with it dr cooper adding channels to the existing packages is a malformed approach to consumer choice forcing all consumers to pay for channels that few people listen to while driving up prices in an approach that transforms consumer surplus into producer surplus whether you charge people more for bigger bundles or force them to buy into bundles results in higher prices for consumers unfortunately the two firms have been moving in this consumer unfriendly direction for years they once offered more choice but have become focused on high priced big bundles mr russell concludes as i said at the beginning im not really sure whether this merger will be good for consumers or not and there may not be a simple yes or no answer to that question the answer may be that its good for some consumers and bad for others or that its good for consumers in the long run but not in the short term or vice versa what i am sure of is that many of the arguments of the merger opponents dont really address the important questions instead they rest on an unrealistic view of the market that ignores the extent of competition that satellite radio currently faces especially from traditional broadcast radio the fact that both companies have been losing large amounts of money and probably need to reduce per subscriber costs and to continue to add more subscribers in order to become profitable the two services obviously are very similar to one another and compete head to head for both subscribers and content eliminating that competition could have some effect whether positive or negative on consumers but if the merger produces a large reduction in per subscriber costs that effect will almost certainly benefit consumers to some degree a lot of the arguments pro and con focus on what the market looks like today but the more important and difficult question is how the market is likely to change in the future the merger opponents seemingly assume that without a merger xm and sirius will continue much as they have in the past but with lower prices and more "consumer friendly" policies i dont pretend to be able to predict how this market will evolve whether with or without a merger but the predictions of the merger opponents seem completely unrealistic to me i hope the fcc and the department of justice look at these issues in a more sophisticated way dr cooper concludes merger to monopoly poses the greatest threat to consumers and competition and is rightly frowned upon by the antitrust laws the merging parties should bear a heavy burden in rebutting this conclusion in the time frame that antitrust authorities generally apply to merger reviews there is little reason to believe that this merger will do anything but unleash market power that will harm consumers the reviewing authorities must be rigorous in the analysis and insist on facts that describe the reality not theories that hope for an outcome that is not grounded in reality but this merger goes beyond the obvious implications for the satellite radio market a satellite radio merger to monopoly is about an avalanche of mergers there was a key moment a decade ago when the department of justice decided that a large monopolist is no worse than two smaller monopolists and allowed the bell atlantic nynex merger to go forward that decision opened the door to a wave of mergers that doomed head to head competition in telecommunications the old telephone monopoly was recreated as two huge geographically distinct monopolies that rarely if every compete a satellite radio merger to monopoly will perform a similar bellwether function if the agencies with oversight adopt a loose definition of products and markets and allow a merger to monopoly on the basis of intermodal competition then a tsunami of merger will ripple through the digital space at the worst possible moment the firms that have declared their undying hostility to the open flow of products in the digital economy broadcasters telephone cellular companies cable companies will be empowered to capture and stifle the alternatives under the premise that every media and telecommunications product competes with all others and that new technologies and services will come along to protect the consumer in any case that relief however will be slow and insufficient because the competitive core of the digital economy will have been damaged and the critical terrain of the digital economy will be controlled by entities who have the same anticompetitive anti consumer objectives as the merging parties in this case would xm sirius create an unfair monopoly or foster competition in the radio business is the deal good or bad for consumers share your thoughts and join the discussion write to the online journals editors at
