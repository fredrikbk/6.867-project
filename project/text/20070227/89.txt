politics &amp economics india faces dark side of its boom food prices soar as inflation rises hurting the poorest new delhi on a street crowded with bullock carts b k garg has a front row seat for indias hottest economic policy debate mr gargs shop sells basic foods in the indian capitals old section the prices for red beans green peas and yellow lentil seeds have doubled on average in the past year helping to turn worries about accelerating inflation into a contentious topic for indias politicians and economists the sparring has intensified ahead of tomorrows national budget announcement and ahead of coming state elections some politicians have called for more rural aid through increased agricultural subsidies and expanded make work programs but others see such moves inflating government debt crowding out social programs and squeezing infrastructure projects that longer term could do more to improve living standards at the heart of the debate is indias new paradox amid fast growth the country faces a set of rapidly emerging problems inflation is hurting the poor especially in urban areas crumbling infrastructure is choking the flow of goods at home and from overseas and by some key health measures such as child malnutrition the nation is slipping indias leaders acknowledge the struggle to spread the new wealth generated by fast paced growth "economic growth is not an end in itself " indias president a p j abdul kalam told parliament on friday in a speech marking the opening of the budget session "keeping a check on inflation is an essential element of any strategy for inclusive growth " with indias economy expanding at a annual clip perhaps only china rivals the country for market promise but inflation now running at on an annualized basis has underscored stark differences india lacks chinas new roads and ports and its broad based manufacturing firepower to ramp up production and stabilize consumer prices with so many in india still living on the margins of subsistence the smallest of price blips for onions or lentils can bite "inflation is extremely iniquitous toward the poor " says subir v gokarn chief economist at crisil ltd a domestic ratings agency "they need some relief " in a letter last week to chief ministers of indian states prime minister manmohan singh called the rising price for indian dietary staples such as lentils and beans edible oils wheat and milk "a major cause of worry " to improve supplies he announced an export ban on pulses and milk powder a cut in import duties on palm and sunflower oil and plans for importing more wheat the government also set up a panel to keep tabs on daily prices of essential commodities for pro reform politicians one benefit of inflation is that it offers an opportunity to make policy changes in the name of helping the poor last week indias cabinet approved a cut in a national sales tax finance minister p chidambaram is also expected to fill in a road map announced in last years budget leading to the elimination of overlapping state taxes that impede the flow of goods within india in addition inflation has prompted reductions in indias import duties still among the highest in asia but some familiar subsidies are also expected to feature in this years budget as politicians seek quick relief for poor rural dwellers one likely measure is more low interest loans for farmers a more controversial initiative would be the expansion of the countrys rural employment guarantee system that program which offers farmers days of paid work a year has become a lightning rod for critics of corruption government debt and political sops "the government is used to giving out freebies " says chetan ahya an economist with morgan stanley in mumbai "the whole model has to shift toward one that is anchored by investment " the government has delayed plans for selling stakes in several big companies and utilities which could have generated cash for infrastructure and social spending mr ahya argues the government also needs to create more incentives for manufacturing to spur more investment he says noting that the countrys leading companies are now sitting on about &# billion of cash reserves economists fear india wont be able to sustain its current rate of growth unless new delhi opens up more opportunities for foreigners to invest directly in businesses in the country most foreign investment currently goes into liquid financial markets and could quickly exit if the global mood shifts in potentially big areas for foreign investment such as retailing an imminent opening isnt expected boosters say foreign retailers could help overhaul creaky supply chains and deliver farmers goods to the market faster but others including sonia gandhi the powerful political leader who heads the ruling congress party have raised concerns about the impact of such a move on indias smaller family owned shops despite indias strong economy there are growing concerns that government spending has increased debt to dangerous levels in a november report the international monetary fund warned that government debt stood at of gross domestic product and suggested measures to shrink it including the reduction of subsidies other countries such as argentina have faced crises in repaying much lower levels of debt says suman bery director general for the national council of applied economic research in new delhi "it is precarious " he adds the immediate impact of indias heavy debt load is to squeeze spending health and education experts contend that funding shortages and poor monitoring of how funds are disbursed have sharpened inequalities between urban and rural areas in rural schools poorly paid teachers often fail to appear for class meanwhile progress in reducing child malnutrition has been "uneven " with the situation worsening in states according to the national family health survey the survey also pointed to rising levels of anemia among young children and women but as campaigning heats up this year it is inflation that has the political spotlight in new delhi rivals to the ruling congress party have displayed signs listing the rising price of grains and vegetables and asking what has this government done for you mr garg the salesman presiding over his colorful table of goods believes speculative hoarding not politics is to blame as suppliers delay shipments "when their trucks dont come " he says "prices go up " binny sabharwal contributed to this article
