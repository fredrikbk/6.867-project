a cultural conversation with riccardo chailly the newest custodian of one of europes oldest orchestras the leipzig gewandhaus orchestras u s tour dates jorgensen auditorium storrs conn tonight symphony hall boston tomorrow new jersey performing arts center newark n j march fairfax concert hall fairfax va march kimmel center philadelphia march carnegie hall new york march and blame it on the jet lag several years ago i arrived in leipzig germany after flying from new york the night before that evening i attended a performance of "swan lake" at the leipzig opera house as i sat somewhat travel weary listening to this most familiar tchaikovsky score i thought "how different this music seems from the way it sounds at home the orchestra is so dark the strings the dark woodwinds how strange it all sounds " suddenly my mental light bulb flashed "thats not just any ballet orchestra in the pit thats the leipzig gewandhaus orchestra of course its dark that incredible sound is their calling card " "exactly you got it " exclaims conductor riccardo chailly when i recount this story to him "it is one of the darkest string timbres in the world and this darkness lends itself to the rest of the orchestra the woodwinds and that true german brass " indeed at a time when critics frequently deplore the slick homogenization of international orchestral playing so that technical excellence aside it is often difficult to distinguish a german orchestra from a french or an american one the leipzig gewandhaus orchestra has perpetuated a distinctive overall tone that evokes the brooding gothic revival spirit of german early romanticism to some degree we can thank the cold war for this a former east german city leipzig was relatively isolated from western developments for half a century but even after german reunification the orchestra and its conductors have kept that unique playing style intact mr chailly has been music director of the gewandhaus orchestra since the latest in a regal conducting lineage that includes felix mendelssohn arthur nikisch wilhelm furtwangler bruno walter and kurt masur when we converse by phone hes in chicago about to kick off his first u s tour as gewandhaus chief which will conclude with two concerts at new yorks carnegie hall early next month the programs feature music by composers with direct ties to the historic orchestra on march they include liszts first piano concerto with the newsmaking young chinese pianist yundi li and richard strausss tone poems "don juan" and "ein heldenleben " on march they play schumanns first symphony arranged by gustav mahler and mahlers fifth symphony the orchestra is one of europes oldest continuing musical organizations and developed out of a concert society founded by a group of leipzig merchants in at that time one of the citys leading musicians was johann sebastian bach himself and to this day the orchestras weekend duties include performances of sacred music at bachs own church the thomas kirche the organizations earliest permanent home was a concert hall built in within the cloth makers guildhall and all subsequent concert halls built to house the orchestra have kept gewandhaus cloth hall as their name from until his death in felix mendelssohn was the gewandhaus kapellmeister and it was with this orchestra that he not only led his own works but also produced concerts of bachs music that helped reawaken interest in that repertoire after a long period of neglect for mr chailly a celebrated interpreter of bruckner mahler and other late romantics this music directorship seems an ideal fit the son of luciano chailly a major italian composer he is a champion of contemporary music and performance technique but he has long distinguished himself as an admirable custodian of great traditions before leipzig he enjoyed a year tenure as music director of the amsterdam concertgebouw also venerated for its historic past mr chailly notes how the two orchestras have lent a certain balance to his career "the concertgebouw is particularly identified with late romantic repertoire especially mahler and his circle the gewandhaus today is very strongly focused on the early romantic tradition particularly mendelssohn schubert schumann beethoven and brahms " he points out a little known mahler connection as well "mahler was in leipzig for three years as second kappellmeister under arthur nikisch at the opera from there he moved to budapest " that move eventually led mahler to vienna where he became music director of the court opera and for several seasons conducted the vienna philharmonic concerts likewise as leipzigs generalmusikdirektor mr chaillys duties include music directorship of the leipzig opera as well which could have led to a kind of musical hegemony he was careful to avoid from the start "i dont want to transform leipzig into a chailly festival " he said therefore he accepted the appointment with the proviso that he would conduct only one opera production a year while devoting the bulk of his energies to the symphony season plus orchestra tours and recordings he is now forming an opera triumvirate with two young german conductors with guests to fill out the roster in leipzig mr chailly is also taking his own mahler interests in a provocative direction decca has just released mr chaillys compelling gewandhaus recording of schumanns second and fourth symphonies in the mahler version and will be releasing the companion disc of the schumann mahler first "spring" and third "rhenish" later this year on march at p m the orchestra will play the schumann mahler first at carnegie hall "whenever i mention that we are doing the schumann mahler version " mr chailly says "people ask me how much mahler will we hear and i say you just will hear more schumann " in fact mahler made his versions of schumann in an attempt to ameliorate performance problems caused by the frequent thickness of schumanns instrumentation to play it safe the composer often scored so many instruments in a passage that the texture is too dense mahler didnt rewrite the music he touched up instrumental details to allow schumanns thematic ideas to come through with greater clarity before discovering the mahler versions about years ago they had long been unpublished mr chailly customarily made his own adjustments to the scores when performing them acknowledging now that he was hardly alone in this "the great maestri particularly affiliated with the schumann style george szell leonard bernstein made their own changes toscanini did it too everyone needed to make some changes the difference with mahler is that his authority as a composer makes a statement itself " in the first symphony alone notes mr chailly "mahler made corrections on schumanns original score which gives you an idea of the time and care he took to refine the scoring of this magnificent work " though most of the refinements are exceedingly subtle added dynamic markings or thinning out instrumental doublings more than one instrument playing the same phrase mahlers adjustment of the famous opening fanfare of the spring symphony will come as a tremendous surprise to audiences "the first eight notes of the fanfare which usually start on the note d natural start on b flat a third lower than the way we know it " he says schumann had initially sketched this fanfare a third higher than we know it beginning on the note f natural but in his final manuscript of the full score he transposed it down to b flat unfortunately when mendelssohn conducted the first rehearsal with the gewandhaus in the natural trumpets and horns used at the time couldnt play the fanfare at that pitch therefore mendelssohn suggested that it be transposed up a third to start on d natural so that the notes would be playable on the horns and trumpets schumann acquiesced and that is how the opening was published and played thereafter but when mahler made his edition around while music director of the new york philharmonic modern valve trumpets and horns had superceded the old natural brasses so he revived schumanns original fanfare on b flat on the grounds that while less brilliant sounding than the higher pitch it is more directly related to the first subject of the movement which appears at the allegro molto vivace measures later asked if he will henceforth use the mahler version or adopt some of mahlers touch ups for his future schumann performances mr chailly says "at present i am fascinated by the experience of conducting the complete mahler versions so i dont see why not to perform the mahler versions in the future but if i go back to the original versions certainly i will be influenced by mahler " now let us hear it for ourselves
