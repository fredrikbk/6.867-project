how long can india keep office politics out of outsourcing when underwriter ram negi considers whether to approve a loan from san jacinto calif he crawls through about pages of documents which any applicant dreads compiling and he reads them very very carefully mr negi is trying to sniff out fraud in the applications "about of people are hiding something " he says so if someone doesnt come clean about his assets like the guy who claimed he had three other properties when he really had mr negi denies him a loan he also uses third party web databases to verify answers so when another applicant lies about his income mr negi can hold out for the truth before making his irreversible decision "if i deny the loan then its denied " he says "there is no chance " far from a power wielding crank mr negi who works for the outsourcing firm equinox in gurgaon india is a soft spoken and unassuming year old who like many of his young colleagues still lives with his parents in new delhi in a large room of blue cubicles under some crooked ceiling tiles and fluorescent lights he sits shoulder to shoulder with his managers as well as with his junior colleagues the scene points to one of the little surprises of indias outsourcing boom knowledge outsourcing the offshoring of skilled work is outpacing the simpler call center work rising last year compared with respectively tasks one wouldnt expect to see leave the four walls of american companies are handled overseas by the worlds second largest reserve of ph d s m b a s engineers doctors and lawyers its a professional cubicle class working on heady stuff such as equity research biotech r&amp d and legal services and even though some of these are professions known for their outsized egos office politics havent been a big problem so far the knowledge outsourcing industry is growing so fast that it hasnt yet fostered the level of back stabbing turf wars and stealing credit you see in any mature business in fact in indias older industries such as manufacturing theres plenty of political maneuvering like say publicly agreeing with the boss when you privately dont and plenty of private grumbling executives point out but in the hot knowledge outsourcing industry which is desperate to hold on to its talented people hierarchies arent built into the floor plan executives entertain suggestions from the lowliest of employees and if a boss is playing favorites he will get an earful from a powerful hr department the setup helps to diffuse the poison of office politics deepa trivedi a senior process executive at tata consultancy services when asked for an example of back stabbing cant seem to think of one ms trivedi a ph d in life sciences has bigger things on her mind specifically the documents she drafts for a u s drug company to get fda drug approval "i have the therapeutic knowledge and understanding of the drug " she says "nobody expects more than that " she adds speaking about her colleagues who like her appreciate the work and the benefits and dont mind sitting in a blue and gray cubicle instead of a corner office such job satisfaction is a preoccupation for people like the head of her company sanjay gupta he is quick to reveal his flaws some thought he wasnt spending enough time with junior employees "i went through some introspection " he says seeming troubled he now meets with employees once every two weeks and he has helped arrange for perks from guitar lessons and salsa dance classes to big health care benefits employees are often shown the same kind of deference shown to overseas clients as alok aggarwal chairman of outsourcing firm evalueserve likes to say to his customers "we row you steer " but mr aggarwal sees a time when these highly skilled workers start vying for higher posts and succumb to office politics as a young industry the knowledge outsourcing business may have the egalitarianism of the dot com era but it will eventually become more political "people build their own empires and those empires become silos " says mr aggarwal "i dont see how to stop it from happening " its also hard to keep everyone happy says nitin aggarwal director of pipal research which conducts financial and strategy research "were almost m b a s that has its own challenges theyre more ambitious " still "there is a quite a marked difference" between these young workers and their u k and u s counterparts says matthew banks senior vice president of integreon managed solutions legal process division which does work such as drafting acquisition documents the outsourcing workers dont expect the trappings of status and trinkets that their overseas counterparts do things like company logo beach blankets and mouse pads he says a young lawyer in the industry for example would never say "can you believe they only have three cross training machines in the office gym " but with knowledge outsourcing growing so fast and the talent crunch so acute the perks are coming says mr banks "actually we do have the mouse pads " email me at jared sandberg wsj com to see past columns please go to careerjournal com
