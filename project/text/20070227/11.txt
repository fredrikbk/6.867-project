baby goody bags may be on the way out some hospitals cities bow to breast feeding camp irking formula makers for some newborns theres no more lunch on the corporate dime in an effort to limit drug company marketing to patients and promote breast feeding a growing number of hospitals are banning the traditional free gift bags containing infant formula that are routinely given to new mothers when they go home last month all public hospitals in new york city began implementing a plan to stop offering free formula samples in discharge bags in the next few months among other "breast feeding friendly" measures says deborah kaplan assistant commissioner in the city health departments maternal infant and reproductive health division in massachusetts winchester hospital near boston and berkshire medical center in pittsfield also recently banned the formula giveaways these hospitals join facilities such as brigham and womens hospital in boston which went bag free last year and the northern california kaiser permanente facilities which stopped the practice in behind the moves is a long running debate between breast feeding advocates and formula makers over hospital giveaways for decades u s hospitals have discharged new mothers with a gift bag containing free samples from major formula makers typically the bags contain informational pamphlets on child care coupons parenting magazines and a sample of powdered infant formula or sometimes ready to drink containers brands include the top selling enfamil marketed by bristol myers squibb co abbott laboratories similac and nestle sas good start infant formula the value of the bags varies but a ounce can of formula runs &# to &# in stores critics contend the freebies discourage breast feeding and represent a de facto endorsement of infant formula by health professionals a study by the government accountability office said "a majority of studies we reviewed that examine giving free formula samples to mothers at hospital discharge found lower breast feeding rates " and there have been a number of efforts to enact statewide bans including in california massachusetts and texas no legislation has been passed amid opposition from the formula industry lobby formula makers which operate a &# billion a year industry in the u s say they support breast feeding and are offering an option for women who cannot nurse or prefer not to gail wood a bristol myers representative says the gift bags are about more than formula "when you give the gift bags in the hospital its a great way for moms to get all kinds of information " she says from nutritional tips to advice for new dads the number of hospitals that have joined the antigift bag movement remains small efforts to ban bags at the state level have repeatedly failed most recently in massachusetts where the public health council last year rescinded a planned ban amid criticism by former gov mitt romney now many breast feeding advocates say they are focusing on individual hospitals "we would like every hospital in the country to stop giving out bags but were approaching this in many different states on many different levels " says anne merewood co chair of the ban the bags campaign launched last year in massachusetts and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the boston university school of medicine "were not going to win it on grounds of breast feeding alone were going to win it on the grounds of not using hospitals for marketing " ms wood of bristol myers and others said most of the nations hospitals and birthing centers still give away free formula samples since the s the world health organization and unicef have been trying to promote breast feeding and stop aggressive marketing by formula makers around the world hospitals say the voices of activist groups as well as their own internal concerns about influence by health care product companies are helping spur bans of freebies ms kaplan says the new york hospitals will ultimately start paying for all infant formula previously given to maternity wards for free or deeply discounted and ban bags with formula company logos and advertisements in addition any contact between formula company reps and patients will be prohibited she says eventually she says the hospitals will give out their own discharge bag of goodies including an ice pack for pumped breast milk at kaiser permanente northern california associate executive director sharon levine a pediatrician says kaiser has "been taking a very hard look at our relationship with vendors " to avoid even the perception of conflicts of interest in the hospitals where about babies a year are born stopped distributing free formula samples she says steven ringer chief of newborn medicine at brigham and womens says his hospital decided to ban gift bags last year after the debate heated up in massachusetts "theres no doubt in my mind that the bags have the impact of diminishing breast feeding " dr ringer says a study in pediatrics found that eight weeks after giving birth women who got discharge bags with a breast pump continued breast feeding for a greater number of weeks than those given a bag with free formula a report in the journal of human lactation found that among african american women on government food assistance those who received formula packs in the hospital were almost six times less likely to be breast feeding at seven days compared with women who didnt get formula bags when debra dwyer gave birth in she says she was determined to breast feed but her milk didnt come in immediately and worried her son wasnt getting enough to eat she began using the free infant formula she had gotten from a hospital nurse she says her milk came in a few days later but she found it was too hard to go back to breast feeding studies show breast feeding is linked to lower rates of severe diarrhea respiratory infections ear infections asthma diabetes and other diseases several peer reviewed studies suggest breast feeding even offers protection against childhood obesity and breast feeding mothers are less likely to get certain types of cancer but while more than of u s women start out breast feeding according to the centers for disease control and prevention only are exclusively breast feeding at six months which is the recommendation of the who and other public health groups formula makers dont dispute the benefits of breast feeding they say other obstacles such as full time employment not formula giveaways better explain why some mothers dont breast feed the stakes are high for formula makers heather brilliant an analyst at morningstar in chicago says with a rate of about four million babies born each year in the u s formula sales are essentially flat so market share is key once a mother starts her baby on a specific formula brand loyalty can run deep according to a report by the department of agriculture formula makers note they also provide hospitals with millions of dollars worth of free specialty formula and other products like sterile water and nipples every year in california a bristol myers lobbyist stated in a letter opposing a statewide ban on discharge bags there that the company donated &# million of free formula and newborn products to california hospitals annually
