battle heats up over nicotine therapy anti smoking experts plan push to ease warnings on use is the patch ok in pregnancy as evidence mounts that nicotine laced stop smoking aids are producing only limited gains some critics are calling the products over rated and over promoted but some high profile public health experts say the problem may be over regulation they say that federal law requires nicotine gums patches lozenges and other products to carry so many warnings that smokers are reluctant to use them indeed the warning literature on a package of nicotine gum is about times lengthier than the warning on a package of cigarettes so tobacco researchers and policy makers are starting to argue that the federal food and drug administration should tone down the warnings on pharmaceutical nicotine at a day long summit last week in austin texas entitled "the case for more flexible regulatory policy " public health experts discussed a number of changes they may seek to current regulations among other possibilities they say they may recommend relaxing the health cautions for pregnant women and eliminating the requirement that teenagers refrain from using over the counter nicotine products without the approval of a physician "a year old smoker of cigarettes per day is doing the right thing to use nicotine gum " says jonathan foulds a tobacco researcher at university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey "why give him another hurdle to cross to get help " the effort is part of a continuing campaign by public health experts to increase the accessibility and usage of stop smoking medications from prescription nicotine inhalers and sprays to over the counter products including glaxosmithklines nicorette gum commit lozenges and nicoderm cq patches in public health experts helped persuade regulators to relax the prescription requirement for nicotine gum patches and lozenges making those products available over the counter in public health experts changed the official u s stop smoking guidelines to say that every smoker trying to quit ought to be urged to use medication except for children and people with medical conditions such as pregnancy and heart disease the new effort to ease package warnings is bound to stir opposition recent studies of successful quitters have suggested that the significant benefits of nicotine products seen in randomized clinical trials may not apply in real world conditions critics say the public health experts who favor nicotine medicines are too financially tied to manufacturers to see the products limitations and use of nicotine by teens pregnant women heart disease patients and smokers who havent quit remains controversial "the use of nicotine whose efficacy in treating nicotine addiction is controversial even in adults must be strictly avoided in pregnancy breastfeeding childhood and adolescence " argues an editorial in the current journal of health psychology written by a group of eight researchers and antismoking advocates its unclear whether fda officials would consider weakening warning labels on nicotine replacement therapy or nrt as the nicotine based products are called officials at the fda didnt return calls seeking comment but last year to encourage use of nrt british health authorities relaxed some warnings such as a recommendation against use by smokers who havent yet quit and last weeks summit calling for similar changes here featured many heavy hitters among the nations tobacco researchers and policy makers including scientists from federal agencies such as the national cancer institute these proponents of nrt believe that its true value is reflected in randomized clinical trials in which users of medicine have relapsed at significantly lower rates than nonusers nicotine the most addictive ingredient in tobacco can elevate the heart rate constrict blood vessels and raise blood pressure but it is also less dangerous than the countless carcinogens in cigarettes yet a survey presented at the austin summit showed that of smokers believe that nrt is just as dangerous as cigarettes other evidence shows that users of nrt take smaller than recommended amounts for shorter than recommended periods of time says saul shiffman a glaxosmithkline consultant and university of pittsburgh professor of psychology and pharmaceutical science who presented the survey fear of the product suggested dr foulds may explain why people are "continuing to use their cigarettes rather than the medicine to help them quit " criticism of the current government guidance also focused on warnings not to combine one nrt therapy with another or to use any nrt product while smoking recent research suggests that using the patch and gum simultaneously may increase the odds of quitting and that initiating use of the patch before quitting smoking may also improve outcomes proponents of nrt say that little evidence supports the health warning for people with cardiovascular disease some evidence they say actually suggests that blood flow through the coronary arteries improves in patients using nrt consequently hospitals increasingly are offering nrt to smokers both to keep them from sneaking cigarettes and to treat withdrawal symptoms but proponents concede that the research supporting this use is limited and some of it raises concerns an october article in the journal chest reported a four times higher mortality rate for intensive care unit patients given nrt compared with a control group most controversial is the use of nrt by pregnant women about of women smokers fail to quit when they learn they are pregnant but research finds little evidence that pregnant women using nrt actually stop smoking cigarettes raising the possibility of the fetus receiving nicotine from both the medication and tobacco moreover studies in rats suggest that the fetal brain may accumulate more nicotine from nrt than from smoking says theodore slotkin professor of pharmacology and cancer biology at duke university dr slotkin who has a research grant from tobacco giant philip morris adds that nicotine in the fetal brain is associated with any number of neuro behavorial problems nancy rigotti a massachusetts general hospital tobacco researcher dismissed that concern saying "humans arent rats " dr rigotti is a consultant to pfizer inc a maker of nicotine replacement therapy teen use of nrt could also involve risks a article in the archives of pediatrics and adolescent medicine found that of about high school students surveyed had used or tried nicotine gum or patches about of nrt users in that survey had never smoked suggesting that the medicine could actually induce nicotine use but nrt proponents say inappropriate use by teens doesnt worry them "im in schools all the time and i can tell you kids arent chewing nicotine gum " says michael cummings a tobacco researcher and cessation expert at roswell park cancer institute in new york of course a request for labeling changes could come from the companies that make nrt but katie kemper a long time glaxosmithkline executive who recently joined the campaign for tobacco free kids said at last weeks summit that industry believed such a request would carry more weight coming from public health experts
