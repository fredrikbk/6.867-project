ahead of the tape housing sector may be knocked by mortgages investors looking to see whether trouble in risky mortgages will spill over into the broader housing market could find solace in todays home sales report but such complacency would come at a heavy price economists polled by dow jones newswires estimate that todays report will show that an annualized million existing that is previously owned homes were sold in january up from decembers million pace taken on its own that would suggest that the housing market is holding its ground allowing the glut of unsold homes on the market to get worked off in an orderly way lets put that number in some perspective with lenders tightening standards on the subprime mortgages they offer to high risk borrowers home sales will have to take a hit says goldman sachs economist andrew tilton he estimates that loose lending standards boosted home sales for the past three years by about homes a year if lenders ratchet their standards up to normal levels those sales will go away he says that represents of last years existing home sales the total fallout could be even broader when banks trip up by lending too freely their usual reaction has been to overcompensate and put standards in place that are far more stringent than the banks otherwise would deem necessary having discovered that they took on far more risk than they thought they were lenders need to go through a period of taking on less risk those subprime mortgage lenders that have ceased operations wont be taking on any more risk the good news is that despite the subprime shakeout default and delinquency rates for prime mortgages remain low the worry is that fresh declines in the housing market could spur lenders to be more cautious even with low risk borrowers firms forecasts augur some bumps for investors with fourth quarter earnings season gliding into the rearview mirror investors are turning their eyes to the road ahead a warning sign watch for falling stocks through friday companies in the standard &amp poors stock index have said they expect earnings that will be below analysts consensus expectations while have issued forecasts that top analysts targets according to thomson financial the ratio of companies with lower than expected forecasts versus those expecting to best the streets targets to is the highest since the third quarter of over time the ratio is to on average the increase isnt because more companies are missing forecasts rather fewer companies have forecast better than expected earnings than the average of the previous eight quarters the slump in optimism doesnt necessarily mean more companies expect economic growth to slow markedly that probably would have caused more to issue disappointing expectations more likely it reflects rising uncertainty about the economy and twitchy chief financial officers less willing to commit to a robust outlook in other words investors should fasten their seatbelts and prepare for more twists and turns in the coming months and perhaps some unpleasant surprises scott patterson send comments to justin lahart wsj com or scott patterson wsj com
