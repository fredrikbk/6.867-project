lessons on the fly jetblues new tactics winter storms test airline soon after major meltdown a new willingness to cancel a little more than a week after jetblue airways corp bungled a valentines day storm and announced new policies to improve its response to poor weather the airline seems to have handled the past weekends snow and ice storm with more poise and less passenger pain this time jetblue was quicker to cancel and more creative about how to get planes flying again since it started flying in jetblue has preferred not to pre cancel flights believing customers would rather arrive late at their destinations than hang around at the departure gate or wait at a hotel but after failing to cancel enough flights quickly during the mid february storm a mistake that led to a major breakdown in crew scheduling and airport operations the carrier is acting like its more experienced rivals "we wanted to call the shots instead of letting the weather call the shots " said john ross a jetblue pilot who was named vice president of system operations last week at forest hills n y based jetblue the nations eighth largest airline by traffic this past weekend weather created headaches for just about all domestic carriers ual corp s united airlines scratched mainline and commuter flights over the weekend and didnt expect to get all of its customers to their destinations until late yesterday amr corp s american airlines canceled of its mainline flights on saturday and more on sunday northwest airlines scratched of flights from its minneapolis hub on sunday and had weather related cancellations yesterday due to the hangover from the storm carriers have coped with bad weather since the dawn of flight but the aviation system is more susceptible to stresses than ever because there are more flights more passengers and more connections planes are fuller which means there are fewer seats available for passengers displaced by weather mechanical or other cancellations mr ross also notes a new federal regulation that prohibits planes from taking off if ice pellets are mixed with snow or other precipitation yet planes are allowed to land in those conditions which can lead to crowding at the airport and inadequate gate space "this is the second winter weve been operating with this rule " he says "its a new problem we havent faced before " jetblue put its new policies into effect early on as the storm raced from the midwest to the northeast on saturday the carrier canceled four flights to chicago from new york sunday it canceled flights from washingtons dulles airport and pittsburgh international airport by p m sunday based on weather forecasts mr ross said the airline proactively canceled flights for yesterday mostly from its base at new yorks john f kennedy international airport that was of jetblues flights scheduled for yesterday before jetblue settled on the cancellations mr ross said each of its operational departments from reservations to crew scheduling to airports had to approve the plan and pledge that their employees could handle the disruption thanks to new software that allows the airline to record messages to pilots and flight attendants asking them to call with their availability more than calls were made and within six hours information from crew members was loaded into a new database david neeleman jetblues chief executive officer said in a memo to employees yesterday in retrospect mr ross said jetblue didnt cancel a single flight it could have operated to get back into action more quickly yesterday jetblue on sunday night took planes made available by the cancellations and moved them to an area near its hangar at jfk early yesterday morning the planes were flown empty to florida to accommodate a heavy load of bookings for travel from florida to new york mr ross said mr neeleman who declared himself "humiliated" by the earlier debacle called the past weekend a "victory" in the memo to his employees "we had a lot to prove to the world but more importantly we had a lot to prove to ourselves " he wrote to get the word out on cancellations and rebooking to passengers jetblues home based reservationists in salt lake city put in more than hours of overtime sunday to manage call volume more than a normal sunday while not all passengers received the warning fewer people learned the news only after arriving at the airport and only a few flights lingered on runways for hours before returning to the gate and being canceled said mr ross jetblue also analyzed the itineraries of the passengers on its flights planners noticed that nearly all the passengers on a burlington vt new york flight monday intended to make connections there and fly on to west palm beach or orlando fla so that plane didnt stop in new york at all he said it traveled to orlando dropped those passengers off then continued to west palm beach jetblue also started ponying up in its "customer bill of rights" plan that it unveiled last week and made retroactive to feb under the new policy passengers are paid for certain delays and cancellations most weather related delays are exempt but if a plane lands and cant get to a gate compensation kicks in after minutes for flights that leave the gate and cant take off within three hours compensation kicks in with &# flight vouchers on sunday night the carrier had planes boarded and ready to go when a federal ground delay was put into effect and ice conditions were declared intermittently once the ground delay was lifted jetblue managed to de ice all but three of those planes before the weather worsened again the three flights were canceled the planes returned to gates after more than three hours of waiting and the passengers were given a choice between a refund or rebooking on a later flight they also received &# vouchers good for future travel not everyone was pleased with the airlines performance though the scene at the jetblue terminal at jfk yesterday was calm a few customers whose flights had been canceled wandered the terminal or sprawled in corners using backpacks as pillows while waiting hours for rebooked flights greg starling of jacksonville fla who was trying to return home with his wife after their honeymoon in new york was stuck on the tarmac for nearly three hours early monday morning until a m his flight to jacksonville no was scheduled to depart jfk at p m sunday but it didnt push back from the gate until p m then it went for de icing a process that was stopped and started twice because ice pellets began to fall after the flight was ultimately canceled and returned to the gate at mr starling booked a hotel room at a nearby howard johnson at his own expense as he said he was told that jetblue doesnt pay hotel costs for weather related delays rebooked to fly at p m monday and forced to leave the hotel at checkout time at noon he said he had nothing to do in the interim but wait at the airport he said he would be willing to fly jetblue again but never in the winter "id try them again in the spring when theres no chance of snow " mr starling said "they cant handle it i think theyre just inexperienced with it they can handle smooth sailing but not turbulence " chris larson of milford mass was marooned after flying in from boston at a m to make an a m connection to denver the flight was canceled but mr larson said he wasnt notified had he been he said he would have found a new flight or stayed home in boston "instead ive got to sit here for hours " he said "i got no compensation of any kind " he said he wouldnt buy a ticket on jetblue again jetblue spokesman sebastian white said the airline rebooks travelers on jetblue or provides refunds but that it doesnt offer flights on other carriers nor is it liable for hotel costs for weather related delays
