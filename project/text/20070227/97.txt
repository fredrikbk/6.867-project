soda makers to disclose caffeine content on labels soda drinkers are about to get an added jolt from their sodas the big drinks makers now plan to disclose the caffeine content on the product label the new information will allow consumers to compare the caffeine content of various soft drinks and comes as beverage companies are introducing new supercharged drinks pepsico for instance in june plans to offer diet pepsi max touted as an "invigorating cola" with nearly twice the caffeine of regular diet pepsi coca cola meanwhile is offering full throttle a citrus drink and tab energy both of which contain more than three times the caffeine content of coke classic but the move to add a caffeine disclosure to soda labels raises more questions than answers about the health effects of caffeine how much is too much and does caffeine consumption really boost our brain power or make a meaningful difference to our health while health groups laud the move toward more labeling some worry the caffeine disclosure might be used to encourage more caffeine consumption "its conceivable that some people will choose higher caffeine soft drinks " says michael f jacobson executive director of the center for science in the public interest who has lobbied for caffeine labeling by soda companies over the years there has been a lot of confusion about caffeine because of studies linking coffee consumption with heart disease and high blood pressure among other health worries most of the health risk shown in earlier studies probably was due to the fact that heavy coffee drinkers were often smokers later research has shown coffee is safe and may even have health benefits possibly due to antioxidants and other compounds studies show coffee drinkers are less likely to develop diabetes gallstones parkinsons disease and colon cancer but the health effects of caffeine from sodas are less clear caffeine makes us feel alert by binding to brain receptors that make us sleepy and giving us a boost of adrenaline the impact depends on the individual and how often he or she ingests caffeine too much can make you jittery or cause an upset stomach regular drinkers who miss a dose can experience withdrawal symptoms including headache irritability and fatigue while most caffeine drinkers feel they are getting a mental boost it isnt clear if caffeine really improves alertness according to the harvard mental health letter people who arent regular caffeine consumers say they feel more alert but tests show caffeine doesnt boost performance and studies suggest regular caffeine users develop a tolerance to caffeines stimulating effects so while regular drinkers may feel lifted by a midday caffeine dose its more likely they are avoiding the crash of caffeine withdrawal sodas typically have far less caffeine than coffee eight ounces of pepsi for instance has about milligrams of caffeine caffeine content of coffee varies by variety and brewing technique but an eight ounce cup may have from to milligrams of caffeine the new tab energy drink from coke has milligrams per eight ounces most studies show people can drink about milligrams of caffeine a day without any negative effects however studies at johns hopkins university show that as little as milligrams of daily caffeine about a cup of coffee or three cans of soda over three days could trigger withdrawal symptoms when you stop the caffeine the withdrawal symptoms become more severe after seven to days of regular caffeine exposure while the caffeine content of soft drinks isnt a huge issue for most adults it can have a big impact on kids because of the differences in body weight a child consuming a can of regular caffeinated soda receives a caffeine equivalent of about four cups of coffee a big question about caffeine is its impact on blood pressure a single cup of coffee can lead to a temporary jump in blood pressure but a study in the journal of the american medical association concluded that theres no link between coffee and chronic high blood pressure or hypertension however data from harvards nurses health study show that while coffee drinking nurses werent at higher risk for hypertension those who drank four cans or more of regular or diet cola per day were at increased risk for high blood pressure the culprit might be the caramel coloring used in colas which contain unstable compounds called advanced glycation end products or ages according to the study the study authors noted far more data are needed "i think the balance of health effects is much more positive for coffee than cola beverages "" says rob m van dam assistant professor at the harvard school of public health the bottom line with caffeine is that moderation is the key if youre jittery suffering sleep problems and going to the bathroom more often than usual chances are youre taking in too much caffeine email healthjournal wsj com
