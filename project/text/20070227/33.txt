enterprise turning an online community into a business social sites started as hobbies offer alternative to big players by catering to specific interests quentin english was tired of sifting through countless emails from friends looking for roommates and apartments in new york so in june he decided to set up an online forum for his friends to more efficiently swap tips about living in the city the web site called quentins friends initially consisted of an email list of mr english and about acquaintances but his friends started inviting their friends and so on by quentins friends had swelled to about members today quentins friends is a flourishing electronic marketplace for people who are looking for just about anything in new york apartments jobs kitchen and computer equipment reliable doctors and even frequent flier miles members get emails about topics theyre interested in from people who are seeking selling or recommending things they can either respond directly to those emails or post responses online for all to see people can join quentins friends only if theyre invited by a current member and they can get kicked out for bad behavior like giving out deceptive information mr english started charging membership fees in and the site www quentinsfriends com is now generating a small annual profit he is preparing to launch quentins friends sites in other cities including los angeles later this year quentins friends is part of a growing group of small online communities that started as hobbies but are evolving into viable small businesses while these niche sites dont attract as much attention as social networking standouts like myspace and craigs list they are demonstrating that even small players have the potential to become profitable if they establish a community that others will want to be a part of charlene li an analyst at forrester research inc in foster city calif says niche sites can succeed because theres a pent up demand for sites that cater to specific interests and demographic groups they are "filling the gap left by giant sites like myspace " which are so big that it can be hard for users to find information and like minded people she says by invitation only erik wachtmeister who grew up in washington d c as the son of the swedish ambassador to the u s founded asmallworld www asmallworld net in march to help him stay connected with the diplomats and others he met around the world he says the site started with about acquaintances and their friends today the invitation only site in which people post profiles of themselves and interact with other members boasts about affluent highly educated members world wide mr wachtmeister says members commonly use the site to find people to meet with when theyre traveling overseas and to forge professional connections the site which doesnt charge a membership fee makes money through ads for products like high end cars and liquors and it has nabbed funding from investors some of whom happen to be members of asmallworld in return for minority stakes in the business the company which is based in new york has employees including mr wachtmeister and his wife but is looking to double its work force within the next year "i didnt plan for it to become such a runaway phenomenon " says mr wachtmeister years old he says he maintains exclusivity by reducing the number of members who can recruit people today about of members have "invite rights " he says compared with as many as in the past andra davidson hopes to follow in the footsteps of mr wachtmeister and turn her current interests into a money maker after growing frustrated with the amount of time she spent exchanging emails with other parents and searching the internet for reliable parenting advice ms davidson a first time mother in san francisco decided to create a site where new parents could easily exchange advice and information mothersclick com launched last year allows users to answer each others questions and join or start private groups to discuss topics of their choice from finding trustworthy baby sitters to dealing with rambunctious kids now ms davidson and her husband dietrich von behren want to transform the free site which has about members into a real business while the site already sports some small ads a revamped site thats "more advertiser friendly" with space specifically set aside for large banner ads rather than the handful of text ads that currently are crammed at the bottom of pages will be unveiled in coming weeks according to the year old mr von behren an overhaul was in order he says because the sites popularity is surging and its being contacted by eager advertisers including major ad agencies "we realize theres an opportunity to fund the site and raise capital " he says but ms davidson years old adds that the priority will be to ensure that members dont feel bombarded by ads "i want them to feel comfortable " she says pay to play over at quentins friends mr english decided on a more unusual and risky approach for his business charging a membership fee something few social networking sites do the year old u k native says the decision wasnt easy but as his hobby gobbled up more and more of his spare time he grew increasingly frustrated that he wasnt getting paid for the extra work mr english says he tried selling ads on the site but people rarely clicked on them he charged admission fees to the occasional parties he threw for members but not enough people came to cover his costs so he decided to institute membership dues of &# a month or &# a quarter it was a gamble since internet users often balk at paying even modest fees for a service they can get at no charge elsewhere like on craigs list so mr english braced himself for membership to shrivel "i had people saying i wouldnt get " of members to pay he says but about a quarter of the members stuck around he says "which is pretty huge for the internet " alex twersky an independent film producer in new york who has been a quentins friends member for almost three years says that "initially i had reservations about the fee but i had such positive experiences with the list that i decided to try it if youre a phony youll be outed soon enough and that kind of security is worth a few bucks a month " mr english says he has booted about people off the site for being untrustworthy like not paying rent at apartments they found through quentins friends mr english wont disclose financial details but says quentins friends has about dues paying members and is profitable he also donates of revenues to city harvest a new york charity he says the new income has allowed him to focus on growth last year mr english hired a software firm in india to help develop an improved web site that unlike the current site will allow members to post profiles of themselves with their photos ages and interests the new system which he plans to unveil this spring also will automate time consuming email formatting and payment processing tasks mr english who also has a full time marketing job at citigroup inc says he spends as many as hours a week working on the site he has an assistant who works about hours a month his goal is to set up versions of quentins friends in dozens of cities around the world about of quentins friends members live outside of new york mr english says and "i have people begging for it" in other cities
