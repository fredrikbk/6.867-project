a far from instant replay for larsen berra and fans little falls n j it was perfect the first time " says yogi berra of don larsens perfect game in the world series "and it was even better tonight " a packed house in the theater of the yogi berra museum and learning center on the campus of montclair state university was in full agreement roberta ziemba who was in her early teens when she saw the game at yankee stadium on oct thinks "it was better than perfect it was more fun this time around " in the fifth game of the fall classic mr larsen faced brooklyn dodgers and retired them all including future hall of famers jackie robinson pee wee reese and roy campanella the feat was unprecedented in the previous world series and it hasnt been duplicated in the that have followed or in the immortal words of mr larsens catcher "its never happened in world series history and hasnt happened since " last friday guests paid &# each to watch the game with proceeds benefiting the museum and charities designated by messrs berra and larsen it was the first time either man had seen a replay of more than brief highlights of the game in fact it was the first time that anyone in attendance had seen a replay of more than short clips of any baseball game played before except doak ewing mr ewing a sports film collector says that there may be only complete or near complete baseball games the recording of the larsen perfect game is missing only the first inning prior to that season still in existence all world series games "there are newsreels of highlights from thousands of games " says mr ewing "but nobody thought to keep entire games games were looked on as entertainment nobody knew that wed regard them as history " mr ewing bought this piece of history at a flea market it had been put up for sale by the son of the man who kinescoped it for the armed forces more than half a century ago "the games were recorded in order to be shown to servicemen and then destroyed " mr ewing notes "we have this one by luck and accident " those lucky enough to watch the eight innings of the game looked through a window back to a vanished world "the first thing you notice " says berra museum director dave kaplan "is how much faster the game moved then than now i mean how quickly they got the game going again after each side was out there was only one commercial after each teams at bat today youve got three or four " there was just one sponsor for the perfect game gillette safety razors some of the commercials were done by the games tv announcers the yankees mel allen and the dodgers vin scully audience member don macnair who admitted to faking illness to stay home from school and watch the game on television noticed something else "all you saw on the screen was the game i didnt realize how cluttered up modern telecasts are until i saw this one there was no box score in the corner no ticker tape running across the bottom with scores of other games no logo for the network or major league baseball and no commercials for other shows flashing on the screen between batters it was so enjoyable just to sit and watch the ballgame " jim pascuiti felt the same way about the commentary "mel allen and vin scully were so good everything they said was to the point and when there wasnt anything to say they kept quiet " or as yogi added "if they didnt have anything to say they didnt say it " everyone was quick to notice one thing when the first batter was retired no instant replay "everyone had better pay attention " mr ewing quipped to the crowd "because youre only going to see everything once " once was enough for mr larsen who got chuckles from the audience when he remarked "yup thats pretty much the way i remembered it happening " as the game progressed mr larsen recalls none of his teammates would talk to him "they were superstitious i wasnt i wanted to talk about it i sat down next to mickey mantle" who helped preserve the perfect game with a great running catch off a drive off the bat of gil hodges "and he was shocked he got up and moved away from me " mr larsen wasnt superstitious but the announcers were bob wolff who called the game on radio told the museum crowd "i never actually said he has a perfect game going i kept talking around it saying things like well all the base runners tonight have been yankees " mr berra thought that his pulse raced just as fast watching the replay as it did years ago "i kept worrying before each pitch as if i was playing the game tonight is this the right call am i set up in the right location i dont want to ruin this by calling for the wrong pitch but watching the game again i guess i did ok " larsen concurs "people forget that half the credit should go to yogi it was his perfect game as much as mine he called every pitch of the game and i had total confidence in him i never shook home off once why spoil a good thing " for some the evening was an opportunity not just to relive a great memory but to pass it on to the next generation dr paul lioy who saw the game with his father watched the replay with his son jason who flew in from pittsburgh dr lioy remembers "my father actually suggested leaving around the sixth inning so we could beat the traffic can you imagine " dr lioys father took him out of school early that day so they could go to the game "i sure hope my grammar school principal doesnt read this " in honor of the occasion dr lioy paraphrased a "yogi ism" on the spot "it was like back to the future all over again " mr barra writes about sports for the journal
