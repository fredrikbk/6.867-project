no worries banks keeping less money in reserve every dollar set aside can cut into profits banks might be putting too much faith in their borrowers as more consumers and companies start having difficulty paying their debts the funds that banks set aside to cover soured loans stand at the lowest level since at least the situation is causing consternation among regulators and as credit quality begins to deteriorate from unusually strong levels the issue also is causing jitters on wall street where analysts predict the need to boost loan loss reserves will cut into banking industry profits this year banks establish reserves for a portion of loan portfolios or big individual loans that they estimate could go unpaid the reserves ensure that banks have enough capital to cover any losses from loans that go bad but each increase in those reserves results in a charge that cuts into banks profits typically investors and regulators fret that banks overestimate these charges during good times so they will have a cookie jar to dip into when times are rougher now though the worry is that banks havent put aside enough money to cover bad loans because times have been so good and because they havent wanted to damp profit growth in a december advisory regulators reminded bank executives that they should use the leeway available to them in calculating reserves because "we do believe there is risk building in the system " says kathryn dick deputy comptroller for credit and market risk at the office of the comptroller of the currency which regulates banks that guidance "was a heads up a shot across the bow if you will to the banks " said lynn turner managing director of proxy advisory and accounting research firm glass lewis &amp co and a former chief accountant with the securities and exchange commission the low reserve levels arent triggering any concern about the financial soundness of the nations banking system bank failures are quite rare when regulators closed a small bank near pittsburgh this month it was the first bank failure since june still the current level of loan loss reserves is reigniting a longstanding debate among regulators about how banks calculate the amount of money to put aside for bad loans and the appropriate time to do so the financial accounting standards board has recently started to consider whether banks should be required to disclose more information to investors about the way they calculate reserves banks set aside an average of of the total value of their loans at the end of last year according to data from publicly traded banks compiled by snl financial for the wall street journal that is a dip from in and from in and in the snl figures date to "there is a growing concern about loan quality and it isnt reflected at all in the reserves " says brian shullaw an associate director at snl a charlottesville va research firm that focuses on the financial services industry according to snl the nations three biggest banks had above average reserves at the end of at citigroup inc at bank of america corp and at j p morgan chase &amp co some large regional banks reserves are well below average among them suntrust bank inc s first horizon national corp s and washington mutual inc s snl says "our reserve levels are reflective of our strong credit culture and what we believe to be the lower loss risk profile of our loan portfolio " said a suntrust spokesman marlin mosby chief financial officer of first horizon said the banks reserve level reflects the high percentage of its collateralized loans such as second mortgages which have a lower likelihood of default than other unsecured loans he also noted that the bank increased its reserves in as the economy cooled somewhat said a spokesman for washington mutual "at year end wamus reserve levels were appropriate considering that our loan portfolio primarily consisted of the highest quality loans " investors will feel the pain if banks boost reserve levels over the past few years investors have benefited from the lower reserve levels because they helped boost profits the banks say that they have been draining their reserves because few borrowers have defaulted on their loans from to the nations biggest banks received of their earnings growth from reductions in their loan loss reserves according to a feb morgan stanley report big regional banks got a bigger boost with the freed up reserves accounting for of earnings growth according to betsy graseck a morgan stanley banking analyst a number of banks have drawn down their reserves for bad loans to "apparently unsustainably low levels " according to a recent report from the center for financial research &amp analysis a rockville md accounting research firm indeed banks are expected to soon start reversing course and building reserves amid growing expectations that the boom times are drawing to an end although loan defaults and charge offs remain at historically low levels bank executives predict that credit quality which has weakened will erode further this year ms graseck who is predicting that big bank earnings will rise this year estimates that a increase in reserves could reduce that earnings growth by four percentage points the trend comes at a time when bank profits are also expected to be hurt this year by short term interest rates going higher than long term ones the so called inverted yield curve banks typically profit by borrowing short term and lending long term so when the yield curve inverts profit margins get squeezed "all of these banks are perfectly sound but i do think a number of banks will miss earnings estimates based on rising loan provisioning " says kevin st pierre a banking analyst at sanford c bernstein &amp co historically banks tend to see their provisions for bad loans increase when interest rates start to rise because higher rates cause problems for weaker borrowers and slow the economy but that hasnt yet happened even as the federal reserve has steadily raised rates to a current level of from historic lows whether and when banks should take additional provisions for loans that might not be repaid is a point of contention among bankers regulators and accounting rule makers many bankers would like to set aside funds for possible bad loans in good times forming a cushion for when things get tough but that isnt permitted because such moves can be abused to manipulate earnings as a result accounting rules generally dont allow banks to use provisions as "rainy day funds " instead they require banks to take a provision when it is "probable" that a loan has gone bad so a bank cant establish a provision for say of a loan portfolio just because that is the amount that typically tends to turn bad instead it must assess an array of events that lead it to believe a loss is probable
