test case immigration crackdown targets bosses this time fake papers and a spy foiled ifco managers cesar wore a wire guilderland n y early in april of a man whose friends knew him as cesar went looking for a job at a wholesale distribution hub near this upstate village at a workshop run by ifco systems north america inc the nations biggest recycler of wooden pallets cesar let the boss know that he was in the country illegally but would be trying to buy some fake "papers " "that will work " said robert belvin the year old ifco site manager what mr belvin didnt know was that cesar was an undercover informant working for federal immigration enforcers or that he was wearing a wire the conversation and many others cesar recorded helped build a case that is the biggest test so far of a heavily touted government campaign to control illegal immigration a year after cesar went to work agents from the immigration and customs enforcement bureau pounced on ifco workshops in states arresting foreigners unlike raids on many other companies including decembers arrests of workers at swift &amp co the motivation for the raid on ifco wasnt to catch foreigners it was to catch the americans who hired them seven ifco middle managers were also arrested that day and charged in identically worded complaints under the same felony statute that punishes human smuggling five of them people familiar with the case say are expected to plead guilty today in the u s district court for the northern district of new york neither the company nor its top executives were named in the complaints which allege that the managers "knowingly conspired with others" to transport harbor and support undocumented workers for "commercial advantage or private financial gain " but the investigation isnt closed like any ice operation today one immigration official says the objective is "to move up in the organization " in the department of homeland security announced that instead of imposing small fines for sloppy paperwork its immigration enforcement branch would flush out "egregious" employers and put them in jail that demands proof and police work including undercover informants and secret recordings more common to drug busts than immigration audits since ices creation in employer arrests have leapt from in to in only last week ice arrested three executives of a nevada based janitorial service with national reach but successful prosecutions have so far largely been limited to smaller labor contractors restaurant owners and a company putting up a fence on the mexican border ifcos parent ifco systems nv by contrast has world wide sales of nearly &# million registered in holland and managed out of houston and munich it promotes itself as a smoothly run system listing target corp cargill inc and dell inc among many corporate customers repairing pallets the rough frames that carry goods from factory to warehouse is tough work up until last april most ifco pallet workers were hispanic it was easy for ice to swoop down on those working illegally to accuse their bosses of a conspiracy punishable by prison terms of up to years was a far greater task the clues ice collected as disclosed in the complaints filed in federal court in albany resulted from a combination of lucky tips and accidents the evidence was backed up by local police work aggressive surveillance and the unusual involvement of the social security administration ifco maintains that nothing points to illegal immigration as part of its formal business model "we deeply regret that we had even a single ineligible worker on our payroll " the company said in a written statement the company declined to comment further on the case the government claims that the immigration status of more than half of ifcos workers in the u s was suspect it is unclear whether the u s attorney in albany who is supervising the case will bring charges against higher level ifco executives still the governments intrusive new style has petrified other companies that rely on foreign labor "everybody thinks these are show trials " says amy peck an immigration lawyer in colorado who represents corporate clients "and at the same time were scared to death about whats going on " the ifco evidence she and other lawyers acknowledge appears to pull back the curtain of "plausible deniability" that effectively allows six million foreigners to work illegally in the u s to avoid discriminating employers have argued for years they cant turn away candidates whose papers seem to be genuine but at one upstate work site the ifco complaints allege that was disingenuous the first hint came three months before cesar applied for a job when the phone rang at the ice office in latham miles from here the caller said he worked for ifco and said he saw some spanish speaking co workers tearing up their w tax forms that made the immigration enforcers at ice very curious why would anyone tear up a w the ifco worker who phoned said that one of his bosses told him the men didnt need w s because they didnt file tax returns "thats not something you hear every day " says julie myers the dhs assistant secretary who heads ice her agents decided ifco was worth watching toward the end of the month a few ifco workers were relaxing at the governors inn a motel near the pallet shop "they like to drink " a honduran named reynaldo says now "they went to the store to get more beer " a forklift driver arrested in the raid he has remained in the area and asked that his full name not be used as four men returned to the motel in a chevrolet the guilderland police say they crashed into a subaru two young women were slightly hurt the chevys driver jumped out and ran the police found the other three men in the motel mr belvin the manager of ifcos operation arrived and went with his workers to the police station all three the police told mr belvin had admitted being in the country illegally mr belvin said that was untrue and that he had the documents to prove it mr belvins lawyer didnt respond to phone messages seeking comment then in an unrelated incident in march a woman called the police to say she had been attacked in a garage by a hispanic man an officer sent to the scene found no suspects but he did interview six men at a nearby house in connection with the womans complaint the men all said they worked for ifco the police recalling ifcos connection to the earlier accident notified ice senior inspector john tashjian said "if theres any suspicion theyre undocumented we do that " responding ice agents found five men who didnt belong in the country and arrested them in sworn statements a honduran said he didnt show any documents when ifco hired him and a salvadoran said he was told "that papers would be provided to him later " it wasnt long before ice decided to plant its spy "i have never heard of that being done in an immigration work site enforcement action never " says paul zulkie an attorney who advises corporations on immigration policies and is also president of the american immigration law foundation but ices orientation has changed many of its agents came out of the former customs service which enforced import and export regulations for them getting evidence to prove that managers know full well that documents are fake means peeking behind the paperwork according to the complaints ices informant had himself been arrested by the border patrol for entering the country illegally after he assisted ice in a human smuggling case in texas the agency gave him temporary leave to remain in the u s plus a stipend in exchange for his cooperation to help with the ifco investigation in april the complaints say he introduced himself to some ifco workers at a grocery the informant isnt cited by name in the complaint but piecing together bits of information former ifco workers say they knew him as cesar a portuguese speaking forklift driver the complaints detail how he ultimately got his fake green card and fake social security card directly from ice the name on the social security card wasnt the one he had given ifco nor was the name on the green card the picture say the complaints was of someone else cesar showed the documents to mr belvins boss james rice mr rice then years old was a development manager who had come to open the guilderland operation the previous october but because it was a start up people close to the company say its managers were having a hard time finding workers looking at the photo on the fake green card while cesar recorded him mr rice said "it looks like you to me " mr rices lawyer had no comment once hired cesar did more at ifco than drive a forklift at mr belvins request and with assistance from ice the complaints say he helped recruit more illegal workers he got phony documents for five other new hires and he phoned an ifco manager in houston to ask about jobs here for two mexicans who had crossed the border in july cesar was promoted to foreman already well along in its work ice opened a second line of inquiry into ifco it enlisted the social security administration when numbers on tax returns dont match numbers on its books social security tells employers by letter a "no match" can have many explanations but to ice its a red flag of illegal immigration yet privacy law bans social security from showing ice its data companies do volunteer for audits in return for shelter from raids and they can check social security numbers of new hires themselves ifco didnt volunteer for such programs but the sanctity of its records vanished the moment its recyclers were seen tearing up w s destroying the forms was a violation that let social security in on the case through a subpoena of ifcos payroll processor says one official its inspectors learned that of ifcos workers in had dud social security numbers whats more the complaints say they discovered that in and ifco received letters in houston informing it that "more than social security numbers" at "several" of its sites "did not match the records of the ssa " ifco didnt follow up on the letters people familiar with ifcos position say an employee set the letters aside unopened failed to tell anybody about them and then left the company for good in the fall of cesar traveled to an ifco start up in westborough mass the complaints recount with mike ames ifcos site manager he visited a bakery where brazilian day laborers gathered after speaking in portuguese with a woman there cesar recorded an exchange with mr ames whose lawyer also didnt respond to requests for comment cesar said "they dont have no documents no papers no permission to work in the united states " mr ames replied "but you know how to work the deal i dont want it to end up where they cant be paid because of identity id you know what im saying " at least five brazilians got jobs directed by mr belvin and mr rice the complaints say cesar drove three of them miles to guilderland "for training " a few weeks later mr rice left ifco on jan mr belvin was fired neither departure according to people familiar with the situation had to do with immigration issues soon afterward ifco fired cesar officials wont say where he is now on the day of the ifco raids last april people following the case say ice agents interviewed dozens more managers around the country the court granted ice permission to search computers in guilderland and according to the complaints the federal department of labor also spoke to a former bookkeeper who claimed that piecework pallet repairmen were being systematically underpaid for overtime work showing that ifco broke wage rules could support a charge that it used illegally hired workers for commercial gain say some legal experts and connections among workers and managers at several sites could be used to argue as the government has in some other immigration cases that what ice uncovered was no rogue operation ifco denies the implication "there was certainly no corporate strategy to hire undocumented workers or exploit any of our employees " the company said in a statement since the raids it has added new payroll screeners and joined the social security verification system profits slumped in midyear but having scoured its records ifco says its labor force is up to strength and is as legal as can be of the workers rounded up in april many have left the country or slipped underground reynaldo the honduran who drove a forklift for ifco here has stayed on in a frame house nearby the arrest of his managers at ifco was news to him "that really touches me " the year old said sitting beside a messy bunk bed one evening as other men came and went "these are people who offered us opportunities " "they havent committed a crime " said a nicaraguan named mario who sat next to him he is and fixed pallets at ifco for cents apiece "at least " he added "its not a crime to me "
