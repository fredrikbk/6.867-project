a master storytellers own life story the original knickerbocker by andrew burstein basic books pages &# there is a high school in my manhattan neighborhood named for washington irving a large bust of the author near the entrance looks pensively at the hispanic students and the middle class passers by recently a friend asked me who irving was my friend is the least literary person i know he reads the news of the day in the tabs yet when i told him that irving had written about rip van winkle and the headless horseman he knew the stories that is good market penetration only j k rowling mario puzo and the evangelists have better before you read "the original knickerbocker " andrew bursteins engrossing biography before you even finish this review find a volume of washington irvings best stories and read the best of the best "rip van winkle " "the legend of sleepy hollow " "the mutability of literature " there are bigger stories in the world but none that are better made they begin in the clear warm voice of a capable journalist and a truly nice guy they depict old times or distant places in clean precise detail they evoke some real horror loss of identity implacable pursuit death followed by oblivion before ending in comedy sentiment and wisdom irving tells primal tales with the polish of a good after dinner speaker he is so completely charming that we can forget we have been charmed so quietly moving that like my friend we dont remember who moved us mr burstein tells the story of a bustling career without losing sight of irvings elusive gift irving was born in the last child in the large family of a new york merchant bookish and dreamy he never went to college after several false starts he found himself in a literary life the details of magazines book contracts agents and publishers inevitably fill mr bursteins account the newness of popular fiction in america and the many kinks that had to be worked out there was no international copyright in irvings day recall our adjustments to the internet irving was well paid well regarded lord byron and sir walter scott admired him and generous to younger writers henry wadsworth longfellow testified to his "entire absence of all literary jealousy " irving was also steeped in politics without being absorbed in it he was named for george washington who blessed him when he was a six year old boy as a young journalist he wrote in support of a very different founding father the wily new yorker aaron burr an experience says mr burstein that fortified irvings lifelong sympathy for losers as an adult he hobnobbed with andrew jackson and martin van buren irving could cross partisan lines from federalists to democrats without taking or giving offense finally he was a restless man he traveled constantly never married and did not buy a home of his own until his s "his smile is one of the sweetest i know " wrote a woman friend "but he can look very very sad " was he gay mr burstein examines the question without prurience or presentism and concludes that he doesnt quite know there are no deeply intimate relationships between men and women in irvings fiction what he lost in realism though he made up in myth irving accomplished three things as an author besides writing his greatest tales he was the first celebrant of new yorks dutch heritage van winkle is a dutch name so is van brunt the surname of ichabod cranes tormentor by writing about dutch celebrations of st nicholas day irving helped create the modern american christmas contemporary scholars like russell shorto are just now digging back through irvings stories to discover the real new amsterdam but for decades his stories were the only memorial the dutch had in middle age irving fell in love with spain and spanish he praised the language for its "power magnificence and melody" political friends gave him a diplomatic appointment that allowed him to live in the alhambra palace in granada irving wrote biographies of columbus and mohammed and a history of the moors his storytellers concerns are miles away from todays debates on mexican immigration and islamist terror but he had the tools of preliminary knowledge long before most americans irvings last great work completed in the year he died was a five volume biography of his namesake as a biographer of george washington myself i own a modern condensed edition of irvings work and i can testify that his scenes of action are still vivid his description of the battle of long island is a great read while some of his insights into character are still useful i am not alone in thinking so in "washingtons crossing " historian david hackett fischer gives prominent place to one of irvings details eyewitness testimony that washington wept "with the tenderness of a child" after the british captured of his men in northern manhattan literary biography places a heavy burden on the author whose prose must go head to head with that of his subject mr bursteins prose unfortunately knocks and stalls like a car with a bad transmission but he enters so sympathetically into irvings life that you will forgive him everything the fruit of mr bursteins sympathy is his credo as a biographer which almost reads like irving himself "i am the wandering narrator who would reawaken the uninitiated to a precious past life lest we lose to forgetfulness
