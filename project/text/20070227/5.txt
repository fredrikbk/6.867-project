apparent hoax shakes up world of classical music the outwardly well mannered world of classical music has been rocked by a scandal surrounding the recordings of a british pianist with a cult following a mystery that began with a technological clue and has ended with an apparent surprise confession joyce hatto retired from playing in public in the s after being stricken with cancer but she didnt stop playing she recorded more than cds on a small british label called concert artists directed by her husband william barrington coupe to her champions the music she produced revealed her as an astonishing original sadly neglected when she died last year the guardians jeremy nicholas called her "one of the greatest pianists britain has ever produced " but earlier this month brian ventura a classical music fan and financial analyst in mount vernon n y said he put ms hattos "liszts transcendental studies" into his computer to transfer it to his ipod and was surprised when apple inc s itunes software identified it as a cd by another pianist laszlo simon "at first i thought it was a misunderstanding " mr ventura said the next morning mr ventura said he went to amazon com and found samples of the simon recordings which sounded very similar that left mr ventura wondering had amazon somehow posted the wrong clips "i really didnt know what to do about it " he said "i wanted very much to believe that the joyce hatto story was true because its such an amazing story " he emailed critic jed distler which led to an investigation by gramophone a united kingdom classical music magazine gramophone sent the recordings to a sound engineer andrew rose of pristine audio who said of the hatto tracks were indeed from a recording by mr simon on bis records mr roses web site includes an online demonstration that lets you listen to the hatto track in one ear and the simon track slightly time shrunk in the other gramophones story led classical music experts and fans to put on headphones and join the hunt that led to a deluge of charges that more hatto recordings were swiped from other sources sometimes with audio trickery involved such as shrinking or stretching the length of the recording then yesterday bis records founder robert von bahr told gramophone that mr barrington coupe who initially had insisted the recordings were genuine had written mr von bahr a letter offering his deep regrets and confessing to the hoax which he said was intended to give ms hatto a great end to an unfairly overlooked career according to mr von bahr mr barrington coupe said the deception of which he said his wife wasnt aware began as a technical effort to cover passages marred by ms hattos grunts of pain while playing gramophone said it contacted mr barrington coupe and he stood by the letters contents an email to concert artists wasnt immediately answered mr von bahr said if mr barrington coupes account is true "the whole matter is a tragedy and i am not going to seek action or damages from a sick year old man " he said in an email as the affair has unfolded classical music fans have been slugging it out on online forums and internet newsgroups technically minded fans meanwhile have wondered about itunes role as a techno sleuth like many digital music programs itunes recognizes a cd put in a computer by querying a database maintained by a company called gracenote of emeryville calif gracenote recognizes a cd by the number of tracks it has and the length of each of those tracks when combined the two form a mathematical fingerprint that gracenote says is essentially unique for cds with more than about five songs in comparing the hatto and simon cds mr rose noted that track times had been shrunk or stretched and the fifth hatto track is seconds shorter than the fifth simon track because it is actually a recording by minoru nojima would such discrepancies throw off gracenote the company said a single outlier would tax the systems matching ability but shouldnt throw it off though it is impossible to say without examining the actual cds and even then variables in cd pressings might leave the question unsettled david hurwitz executive editor of web site classics today said that in some ways this is a scandal without victims people who bought ms hattos cds are now speculating about who the real artists are and some of those people will now want to buy those artists cds "these artists who have been victimized will actually benefit " he said as for mr ventura whose itunes discovery began the affair he cant keep a certain sense of betrayal out of his voice "you always expect artists on recordings to be who they say they are " he said
