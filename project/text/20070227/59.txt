in txu deal texas regulator has few levers to pull pucs limited role may ease passage rival suitors scurry texas regulators have little authority to challenge or block the proposed &# billion private equity buyout of utility titan txu corp which could ease the deals completion despite opposition gearing up in the state meanwhile potential rival bidders considered their options a group led by kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co and texas pacific group announced a proposed acquisition of txu yesterday in a deal that includes the assumption of more than &# billion in debt the deal which would be the largest leveraged buyout ever was made after the prospective buyers negotiated with environmental groups to reduce txus debate stirring plans to build a fleet of coal fired power plants yesterday a number of wall street banks and potential investors were scrambling to respond to their competitors headline grabbing move blackstone group was looking at launching a rival bid potentially with an industry player as its partner people familiar with the matter said given the kkr texas pacific groups huge head start any blackstone offer would have to include a higher price and perhaps a different structure a strategic partner would enable blackstone to arrange a more creative deal and hence pay more blackstone declined to comment a slew of other buyout groups were checking with banks about financing according to people familiar with the matter some were signing confidentiality agreements with txu which is leading a day "go shop" period to attract a higher bidder another person familiar with the matter said while wall street observers said they believed other buyers could raise enough money they were generally skeptical that a rival could line up the environmental and political cover that kkr and texas pacific have secured others note though that a rival bid could promise the same concessions and that the ultimate decision rests with shareholders in weighing bids certainty can be almost as important as price kkr also has had longstanding relations with txu chief executive c john wilder and texas pacific which is incorporated in texas is the hometown player mr wilder who has expressed a desire to stay with the company stands to reap a rich payday he negotiated a lucrative compensation package three years ago when txu was in the doldrums under his direction txu stock soared from about &# a share to more than &# by some estimates he may now be eligible for well over &# million in payments reflecting the full vesting of several large stock allotments called for under his complex five year employment contract mark reilly a partner at pay consultant c compensation consulting consortium said ambiguity in the wording of some documents such as txus proxy statement made a detailed estimate difficult but he said the contract could be valued at as much as &# million at the current stock price the company didnt confirm the amount txu said it is considering dividing the company into three separate ones that would make the companys regulated power transmission business distinct from both its unregulated power generation business the biggest in the state and its power sales unit each is the biggest in its field reflecting txus stature as a century old utility that serves most of the northeastern part of the state from its dallas headquarters as merger interest has surged in the long neglected utility sector some states have moved to block major deals last year fpl group and constellation energy group called off their &# billion merger amid maryland regulators concerns about rising power prices also last year exelon corp scrapped its &# billion acquisition of public service enterprise group inc because of opposition in new jersey but texas state regulators have little power to block a sale even if they feel consumers will be harmed according to txu a spokesman for the public utility commission of texas and others involved in the deal the law requires the commission to investigate transactions to determine whether they are "consistent with the public interest " but a finding to that effect isnt required in order for a transaction to proceed under the law the commission can stop a buyer from jacking up rates for regulated enterprises like power delivery but it has little or no control over whether a sale takes place the result is that the largest leveraged buyout in u s history is free to proceed with state power regulators on the sidelines the law allows them to hold hearings but doesnt require full evidentiary hearings which once were the norm with document production and the calling of witnesses the states law deregulating its power market further weakened regulators ability to block deals txu spokeswoman lisa singleton said yesterday that txu regards the commission as "an important stakeholder" but not one with any legal authority over transactions "we dont need them to approve the deal " she said a spokesman for the public utility commission said the commissioners are debating what to do the companys debt was downgraded to less than investment grade yesterday because of expectations of a greater debt load although some analysts said they dont expect the buyers to load the debt on the regulated part of the business the deal won a mixed reaction in texas where txu and mr wilder have been embroiled in debate over the planned coal plants and repeated rate increases as part of the acquisition deal the new private equity owners have agreed to drop plans for eight of the coal plants txu had envisioned as part of the proposed sale txu also has moved to placate customers by confirming it will offer a rate reduction but the reduction will be available only to customers who havent elected to move off txus basic rate sometimes called its "price to beat" or default service that in effect excludes about of its residential customers and all of its commercial and industrial customers the discount would last until september the texas legislature already has been considering several bills that seek to deal with the problem of high power prices in the state and a deregulation law that has left many consumers very unhappy texas sen troy fraser chairman of the business and commerce committee said that the deal only heightens his anxiety about the high cost of electricity and that he felt the proposed rate cut was "too little too late " he said he was dismayed to learn the parties had been talking about the transaction for months "but they never bothered to visit with the leadership in the legislature or the puc " he said they "finally ran me down friday evening and it wasnt to ask my input it was to tell me what they were doing "
