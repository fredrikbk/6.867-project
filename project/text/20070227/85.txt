semi truths its nice the u s government is finally getting around to meeting its obligations under a trade pact with mexico ratified a mere years ago but even that is too fast for some protectionists under the north american free trade agreement the u s was required to lift a ban on mexican trucks traveling more than miles inside the border the deadline for doing so was yet seven years later the ban remains in place hence when mexican trucks reach the mileage limit they must off load and transfer the goods to american trucks which carry them to their ultimate destination you can understand why the teamsters who represent american drivers favor this arrangement however inefficient but u s consumers pick up the tab last week the bush administration announced a plan to lift the mileage restriction and unions and their supporters in congress are predictably crying foul rather than acknowledging their protectionist agenda opponents are raising bogus concerns linked to the supposedly poor "safety" record of mexican rigs teamster president james hoffa told reporters the administration is "playing a game of russian roulette on americas highways " democratic senator patty murray of washington says shell hold hearings if these arguments sound familiar its because mr hoffa also used them in when the bush administration first tried to lift the mileage restriction to comply with nafta oregon representative peter defazio warned that there would be "blood on the highway " and david obey of wisconsin intoned that "nafta is a trade pact its not a suicide pact " that hyperbole is just as phony now its common practice both here and south of the border to use older vehicles to travel short distances and theres no evidence that mexican long haul trucks and drivers are more dangerous than their u s counterparts the latest data show the safety records of the u s and mexico are comparable according to the transportation department of mexican trucks were pulled from the road for safety violations in last year that number fell to meanwhile of u s trucks failed safety inspections in versus last year mexican drivers are less likely than their u s counterparts to be in violation of the law in versus for u s truckers a prohibition on mexican trucks traveling more than a few miles into the u s has resulted in more congestion and pollution at the border it also means that more investment is going toward shipping items from point a to point b than is necessary lifting the ban and giving these vehicles full access to the u s will streamline the process and reduce costs mexican businesses have no incentive to send rickety trucks north of the border only to break down before reaching their destination and behaving as if they do in order to mask an antitrade agenda is no way to treat a neighbor see related letter "letters to the editor cross border trucking poses danger to u s " wsj march
