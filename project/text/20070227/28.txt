chrysler town &amp country and the dodge caravan minivans magnas austrian subsidiary magna steyr also builds vehicles for daimlerchrysler gm and bmw ag on a contract basis including the mercedes benz g class and jeep grand cherokee sport utility vehicles daimlerchrysler has said little as investors and analysts have speculated over possible buyers or partners for the money losing chrysler operation gm has had talks about buying chrysler but is also considering more limited cooperation deals people familiar with the matter have said daimlerchrysler also has received expressions of interest from some private equity firms the speculation is mounting as chryslers two main unions the german ig metall and the united auto workers of the u s are positioning to have a stronger voice in chryslers future but their interests dont necessarily overlap because profits from daimlerchryslers german businesses loom as a potentially divisive issue from a german perspective capital spent saving chrysler is capital that could be spent bolstering the german mercedes benz brand traditionally the parent companys cash cow the uaw holds one of board seats given to labor under german law the uaw has made concessions on health care at gm and ford motor co but has refused to do the same at chrysler while chrysler lost money last year mercedes and the companys other german divisions helped the total corporation report a net profit of billion euros &# billion "the way you get concessions with a union is to prove things are really bad and you have no money " said stephen cheetham an auto industry analyst with sanford c bernstein ltd in london "the problem for daimlerchrysler is that the uaw is perfectly aware that they can afford to meet the current health care benefits because of the cash flows from their german businesses " daimlerchrysler recently said it would award of its german employees bonuses of euros the highest amount since the company introduced profit sharing in in recognition of record sales at mercedes and improved profits at its commercial truck division uaw president ron gettelfinger earlier this month called on daimlerchryslers management to draw on the resources of its mercedes division in helping to restore chryslers sales "we will do everything in our power to hold the company to its commitment to grow the business by developing new products with mercedes benz that are appealing to consumers " mr gettelfinger said mr gettelfingers comments came the day that his german counterpart erich klemm chairman of daimlerchryslers corporate works council told a german news agency "the potential synergies between mercedes and chrysler are limited" and the companys german labor representatives are concerned "the core of daimler can be protected from a possible financial downwards spiral at chrysler " through representatives messrs gettelfinger and klemm declined to be interviewed or answer written questions referring back to their feb joint statement which demanded the companys planned elimination of some chrysler jobs "be carried out with a socially responsible attrition program" that "takes into consideration the needs of workers and their families disputes between auto maker unions arent unusual especially with many companies in europe and the u s cutting production amid weak demand and competition from asian rivals conflicts between the companys labor leaders have been unusually public in recent years highlighting the complexity of corporate governance at a company with dual identities and traditions in may the then uaw representative on daimlerchryslers board nate gooden told the wall street journal that his german colleagues on the supervisory board had made "a grave mistake" by helping scuttle the planned promotion of a former chrysler chief operating officer wolfgang bernhard to lead mercedes mr goodens comments came days after mr klemm in an interview with the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung took credit for opposing mr bernhards promotion saying there was "a high risk that bernhard would begin a rash housecleaning with no concern for the culture and leadership tradition of our company " in december mr gooden roiled his german colleagues again voting in favor of the companys three year operating plan which included the planned elimination of some jobs in germany at the mercedes division mr goodens vote stunned the boards ig metall representatives all of whom voted against the plan and had come away from a meeting with him a day earlier thinking he would vote with them according to a person familiar with the matter mr gooden who died in november declined interview requests from the wall street journal in the weeks after the december vote john d stoll in detroit
