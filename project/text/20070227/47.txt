how high living founder of betonsports fell fled gary kaplan used to throw lavish parties in costa rica and plaster the name of his thriving online gambling company on new york city buses now the year old founder of betonsports plc and the multibillion dollar industry he helped spawn are in reduced circumstances the man on the run the industry in disarray mr kaplan is a fugitive from a racketeering conspiracy and fraud indictment filed last year in a st louis federal court charging him with heading a criminal enterprise that illegally took in over &# billion in wagers since several kaplan colleagues have also been charged including former betonsports chief executive david carruthers who was arrested at the dallas fort worth airport in july during a brief stopover on a flight from london to the companys headquarters in san jose costa rica mr carruthers and several others charged in the case have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial mr kaplans whereabouts are unknown the kaplan indictment is part of a broader federal crackdown in which several executives from other foreign online gambling operations and credit card processing companies have been indicted last october congress passed a law banning almost all forms of online gambling recently the justice department served subpoenas for records on investment banks that had helped betonsports and other online gambling companies raise money through public stock offerings industry observers estimate that online wagering which had hit about &# billion annually is down by as much as betonsports has largely closed down operations federal authorities estimate that of the companys business came from the u s the saga of betonsports and mr kaplan demonstrates how some online gambling sites rose fast and crashed hard by operating at or beyond the edge of the law while mr kaplan has a checkered background that includes run ins with law enforcement he may have gotten as far as he did in part by surrounding himself with executives like mr carruthers who came to betonsports with a mainstream business background before he was an international online gambling impresario mr kaplan a new york native was a bookie and was busted in by that states authorities for running an illegal sports betting operation according to his federal indictment he moved to florida where he allegedly continued his bookmaking operation and then on to aruba and antigua before later finally settling in san jose the costa rican capital with light handed gambling regulation and a ready work force began attracting other online betting operations mr kaplan made a splash he took over a nine story office building in a shopping mall complex and outfitted it with a day care center for workers kids as well as luxurious suites and a rooftop pool for visiting high rollers that betonsports sometimes flew in for huge galas betonsports headquarters also housed a shooting range a reflection of mr kaplans fascination with guns and an obsession with personal security say people who know him he his wife and two children routinely traveled with armed bodyguards the bodyguards were at least in part "an ego thing " says kenneth weitzner founder of eye on gambling a web site that tracks internet gambling mr kaplan created the illusion that he thought went with a successful gambling operation says mr weitzner who visited mr kaplan at his costa rican operation another acquaintance called mr kaplan "tough and intimidating " in one tale he supposedly shot a computer monitor after betonsports lost big on a football game as betonsports grew into one of the biggest online gambling companies it tried to move mainstream mr kaplan hired veteran gambling industry executives such as mr carruthers who had worked for ladbrokes a major british wagering company in betonsports had an initial public offering in london that raised about &# million and its stock was listed on a branch of the london exchange while internet gambling is legal in many countries the u s has long contended that it violated various federal statutes even before the specific ban was enacted last fall federal officials made periodic efforts to attack online gambling but the companies often managed to operate relatively freely in the u s betonsports was able to run u s marketing campaigns including ads on new york city buses in but even as the industry soared federal agents were building criminal cases some of betonsports"customers" in and turned out to be undercover investigators gathering evidence that went into last years indictment betonsportss name has appeared in press reports in connection with a criminal case filed by new york city prosecutors against an allegedly mob connected gambling operation that was sending bets to an entity in betonsportss headquarters building in san jose in those articles betonsports officials said that the entity simply leased office space and was evicted after the indictment betonsports wasnt charged in the new york case some observers find the governments crackdown on internet gambling curious given the national explosion in gambling casinos and lotteries in recent years these people wonder whether the initiative will backfire by pushing gamblers to less reputable operations the recent criminal cases and legislation are "an anti consumer protection movement because theyre eliminating the most reputable publicly traded companies " says nelson rose a california law professor and gambling law expert in recent years betonsports and others including some u s casino operators had lobbied congress to legalize online gambling arguing that it could then be regulated and taxed as for mr kaplan he is being sought by u s and international law enforcement officials including interpol whose web site carries a wanted poster for him though his home was in costa rica some believe he has left that country one rumor has him and his family in israel there on an israeli passport if he is apprehended or returns voluntarily to the u s he will have to answer the pending charges in the st louis federal case if convicted he could face a long prison sentence and large financial penalties corrections &amp amplifications while the federal government largely considers internet gambling to be a violation of a previously enacted statute last years unlawful internet gambling enforcement act made it illegal for banks and credit card processing companies to make payments from the u s to offshore gambling companies an article in tuesdays marketplace section about betonsports plc founder gary kaplan incorrectly said the act banned internet gambling wsj march
