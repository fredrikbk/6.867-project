arbitron nielsen venture shows promise data collection devices help glean more detail about consumer habits after a year long trial a joint venture of media ratings companies arbitron and nielsen says it has proof that a new technology driven approach can help clients fine tune their marketing the venture project apollo gave tracking devices to participants to monitor their media exposure and product purchases one device known as the portable people meter picked up audible advertising messages from radio and television other advertising was measured in online surveys a second device called homescan tracked purchases when participants used it to scan the barcode of every item they bought the trial found that people exposed to several months worth of advertising for mid to large brands spent to more on the brands compared with spending before the ads ran consumers in the brands target demographic boosted their purchases to project apollo also used data collected through the devices to analyze how effective a cable tv ad campaign for an unidentified painkiller was in reaching the painkillers target audience of to year olds after monitoring which media outlets the target audience was exposed to the study concluded that the painkiller would reach more of its target audience by making certain changes to its ad program "this is high definition for market research " says linda dupree arbitrons executive vice president for people meter product development project apollo seeks to answer an age old dilemma on madison avenue how much marketing affects sales marketers have long grumbled about the difficulty of figuring out whether traditional advertising works the advent of internet advertising which offers more measurable techniques has added to pressure on traditional media venues to improve their measurement technologies the project is a venture of arbitron which dominates radio ratings and nielsen the goliath of the tv ratings business a handful of big marketers are involved including procter &amp gamble and wal mart stores ms dupree says project apollo data is meant to complement rather than replace standard nielsen and arbitron ratings information but while those measurement services provide basic information about viewers and listeners such as their ages they dont come close to project apollos level of detail the changes in the painkiller ad program for instance were based on specific findings about the participants shopping and tv viewing habits with the data from project apollo the painkiller maker learned ads on which cable networks and at what times of the day would reach more buyers its easier after all to get existing buyers to purchase more of a brand than to enlist a new buyer for the brand a consumer who already uses the brand for headaches can be reminded that it works for muscle aches too with project apollo "we have a better understanding of the category and the brands consumers use " says don gloeckler manager of north american media research for procter &amp gamble "were able to better deliver messages to people who are interested in the product and the category " the data to be released this week is the second time project apollo has disclosed results of its tests a study released in june looking at consumers of a laundry detergent found it was possible to finely target media consumption patterns of specific consumers proving that project apollo works is important to both arbitron and nielsen which have sunk tens of millions of dollars into the effort if nielsen and arbitron determine there is enough interest to go forward theyll use more sophisticated techniques to gauge media consumption current participants fill in online surveys about what web sites they visit an improved measure could involve installing monitoring software on participants computers the partners would also ramp up the sample group to as many as people thats important because some advertisers arent sure how much weight to put on the results because of the limited number of participants used in testing so far the current tests are set to wind down in july so far no advertiser has signed up to use project apollo beyond then the relationship between arbitron and nielsen hasnt always gone smoothly a year ago for example nielsen ditched efforts to use portable people meters to track television viewing for its main television ratings service replacing current techniques like set top boxes arbitron has been developing the people meters since the early s nielsen and arbitron plan to release more project apollo data over the next few months in a series of papers scheduled for presentation at various conferences
