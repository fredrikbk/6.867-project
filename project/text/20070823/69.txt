mutual funds start to buy beaten down reits bonds while many traders are licking their wounds from a drubbing in the bond market some veteran mutual fund managers are finding buying opportunities some say theyre scaling back on stocks or on u s government securities that have benefited from "safe haven" buying and instead these top performing funds are moving into the corners of the bond market that other investors have abandoned such as junk bonds and loans backing highly leveraged takeovers as well as mortgage backed securities some managers for example snapped up bonds backed by mortgages at fire sale prices after they were unloaded by thornburg mortgage inc "a lot of investors have been wanting safety call it the flight to quality or liquidity but when you can go counter to that you have opportunities " says edward perks manager of the &# billion franklin income fund "for us theres been a tremendous expansion of the opportunity set " while some bond fund managers have been willing to take on more risk recently average investors still remain wary of such moves for their own portfolios investors withdrew about &# billion from junk bond funds in the three months through july instead putting an estimated &# billion into more conservative intermediate term bond funds according to morningstar inc this was almost five times as much as investors put in intermediate term bond funds in the same period last year but the bond markets swoon since late spring has reversed a situation where for months many mutual fund managers were finding few bargains the gaps between the yields on higher risk securities and safe u s government bonds were at historic lows meaning that investors werent being compensated much for taking on the additional risk since june a merrill lynch index of junk bonds has fallen while the gap between yields on these risky corporate bonds and treasury bonds has jumped to percentage points from percentage points that "spread" on high quality mortgage securities has also widened to percentage point from percentage point merrill data show franklins mr perks who invests in both stocks and bonds is hunting in two parts of the bond market that have been ground zero for the markets woes "investment grade mortgages have gotten sucked down with sub prime " he says "we think the market is treating it in too broad a brush " he and his team are also looking at loans financing big leveraged takeovers a category of debt that began to run into trouble in late june "up until the last six weeks they didnt look that compelling " mr perks says the problem was that the gap between the yields on those securities and u s treasurys had shrunk and many loans were being offered at terms unfavorable to lenders now many of those securities are trading at big discounts that can help offset the risks of the looser lending standards he says at third avenue management which has a history of finding values in investments others are abandoning the distressed debt team and fund managers are investing in the debt of "liquidity constrained" companies like mortgage real estate investment trusts says curtis jensen a third avenue co chief investment officer and portfolio manager "were looking at anything distressed or under pressure " he says mr jensen adds that many reits and real estate operating companies have seen their valuations compress now "you see things trade at to discounts" to their value while "only a few months ago they traded at premiums " mr jensen has company in another well known stock picker legg masons bill miller mr miller points to thornburg mortgages recent sale of &# billion of top rated mortgage backed securities as an attractive investment "that was a once in a generation opportunity to buy that paper " mr miller says "the area of mortgage financing is seeing all kinds of dislocations" to take advantage of tracy wright a manager for the &# billion pioneer high yield fund says given the headlines about shelved leveraged buyout deals and troubles with riskier investments "i can understand why investors are concerned " however she adds that many of these securities have been pushed down too far given that the economy remains healthy and corporate profits are expected to remain strong theres a "considerable amount of value in the secondary market of existing issuers and were finding names we like and can buy at a discount rather than buying new issuances" at higher prices she says in recent months the fund has reduced its stock exposure and moved toward high quality parts of the junk bond market in economically resilient industries like health care establishing new bond and loan positions in companies like community health systems inc it has also moved away from more cyclical areas like industrials and basic materials trimming its stake in freeport mcmoran copper &amp gold inc to at the end of july from at the end of june however the company still remains its biggest holding the &# billion pioneer strategic income fund which invests across a variety of bond areas also recently increased its exposure to junk corporate bonds to at the end of july from earlier in the summer dan fuss a manager on the &# billion loomis sayles strategic income fund and another veteran bottom picker has been reducing cash and other reserves to of assets from about three months ago the fund has bought more investment grade bonds increasing its stake to from earlier this summer it has also benefited from stakes in canadian bonds and junk industrial bonds with junk bonds remaining its top sector weighting earlier this summer despite market turmoil mr fuss says a lack of new junk bond issuance is "very frustrating " but the fund is digging through secondary junk bond markets for any buying opportunities serena ng contributed to this article
