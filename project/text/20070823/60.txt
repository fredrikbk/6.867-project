mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q in a recent column you said microsoft had imposed a legal prohibition on running the home versions of windows vista on a macintosh using virtualization programs like parallels and fusion does the same prohibition apply if you are installing vista using apples boot camp software a no because boot camp doesnt create a virtual windows computer it actually carves out part of an intel based macintoshs hard disk and turns it into a full blown physical windows computer to windows a mac configured this way looks just like any dell or hewlett packard or other standard windows computer boot camp is free but such as parallels and fusion it requires you to purchase a full boxed copy of windows to install the upside of the boot camp approach is that when you are running windows on the mac all of the computers hardware is devoted to windows because the macs own operating system os x isnt running at all and a portion of the hard disk is reserved for the exclusive use of windows the downside is that you cannot run the two operating systems simultaneously as you can with virtual solutions such as parallels and fusion to switch between using windows programs and mac programs you must restart the machine while holding down the option key and then choose whether you want it to boot into windows or mac os x both parallels and fusion can however use a boot camp windows installation to create a virtual version of windows that can be used simultaneously with the mac os if you install boot camp on a well equipped mac model it can become a blazing fast vista computer a few days ago i bought a top of the line model of apples new imac line and installed boot camp and vista i then tested the machine using vistas built in windows experience index a rating system that goes from to with scores above generally required for full quick performance my imac scored a the best score of any consumer vista machine i have tested obviously a tricked out high end dell or hp box might do as well or better and a lesser mac might do worse but the score was very impressive for a computer that wasnt designed with vista in mind q we have a sony pc and a inch lcd monitor currently we have a separate old fashioned tv in the room with a cable box connected to it is there any way to buy a larger lcd monitor and be able to watch tv via the cable box and also use the same screen when we use the computer a a good approach would be to buy an lcd television that has both the usual connectors for your cable box and a connector or input for a personal computer there are many such models in various sizes if you bought such a tv you would switch between the pc and the cable box by changing inputs on your remote just make sure the pc input is compatible with your computer or that an adapter is available to make it compatible many pcs and pc friendly tvs use the older common vga connector which is an analog input but others use various newer digital connectors you can also connect some computers to lcd tvs using standard connectors that arent specifically labeled as being for pcs this is especially true for some windows media center pcs that are designed to work with tvs q have you rated any of the web businesses that assemble personal photos into a book format a yes my colleague katherine boehret and i reviewed three contenders in that category in december and in our judgment at that time mypublisher www mypublisher com was the best of that group you can read the column at http solution allthingsd com however the books from apple shutterfly and blurb are also favorites of many readers
