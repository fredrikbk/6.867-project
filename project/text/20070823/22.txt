crowds heed amtraks all aboard improved service air woes lure travelers in northeast long hauls still suffer airplanes are getting stuck in lots of traffic jams this summer but amtrak is on a roll ridership on the passenger rail system is up so far this year the biggest jump since the late s on the acela express trains that run at higher speeds between washington new york and boston the number of riders has surged over the past months thats enough new passengers to fill boeing jets richard rosen who heads a pharmacy fulfillment company in boston is making as many of his trips to new york as possible on the acela flying to new york with traffic to and from la guardia airport flight delays and security lines has become "an absolute horror show " he says a recent one hour flight turned into four hours of exasperation mr rosen says the acela which takes about hours to get from bostons back bay station to pennsylvania station in midtown manhattan is more comfortable and reliable "the train is much better and you can do your work and use your cellphone during the whole trip " he says while airlines are running later and with more delays than ever a third of flights arrived late at la guardia airport between june and aug according to flightstats com acelas performance is improving the train is running on time of the time so far this year up from a year ago it was on time in june with amtrak selling every seat on some acela trains in peak travel periods amtrak recently added another weekday acela round trip between new york and washington to keep up with growing demand the new train dropped all but one stop philadelphia shaving minutes off the normal hour five stop new york washington trip all this represents a big change for amtrak the perennial rodney dangerfield of passenger transportation which has faced scathing criticism in recent years for late trains and poor service the bush administration has in recent years tried to cut or eliminate its federal subsidies which total &# billion in and allies of the white house remain harsh critics "amtrak still needs to change its way of doing business " says joseph boardman the bush administrations top rail official as head of the federal railroad administration and an amtrak board member the bush administration has repeatedly called for a major overhaul of amtrak that would turn over amtraks washington new york boston northeast corridor to the states along the route amtrak would become a pure passenger rail operating company that would then compete for state contracts to provide intercity passenger rail service the administration plan would create a long term partnership where states determine passenger rail needs and the federal government provides matching funds similar to highways and transit but amtraks success lately isnt confined to the northeast while the railroads long distance trains continue to suffer from lengthy delays its ridership is up sharply on some improved state supported corridors including chicago st louis up in the months through july the improved service is being noticed by amtraks supporters in congress and helping tilt the odds in the railroads favor on more funding for future improvements "this means a lot of goodwill in the bank for amtrak among policy makers for increasing its funds and expanding service " says rep james oberstar a democrat from minnesota who heads the house transportation committee "the dynamics have shifted in favor of a strong future for amtrak " the house recently passed a fiscal funding bill with &# billion for amtrak plus &# million to match state funding of capital projects the senate is considering amtrak funding of &# billion plus &# million for the capital program airlines of course have their own ideas of how best to improve travel in the northeast many of them are actively supporting a federal government proposal to replace the current air traffic control system with a more modern one that allows more flights the next generation air traffic control system is estimated to cost nearly &# billion and take until to be fully implemented says the air transport association "if that is taken care of a lot of the problems we have today will be eliminated " says a spokesman for us airways group inc tempe ariz which operates one of the two hourly air shuttle services between washington new york and boston a spokeswoman for jetblue airways corp forest hills n y says its wrong for tax dollars to be used to subsidize amtrak passenger trains "when a modernized air traffic control system is not yet in place or even funded " but some big names in the airline industry are supporting amtrak by calling for the u s to do what governments in europe and asia have long done building high speed train lines for short distance travelers and freeing up runway space for long distance flights "you have to begin to put the infrastructure in place to put in high speed trains " says gordon bethune who retired in as chief executive of continental airlines inc "it should be a national priority if the french can do it why cant we " another airline industry legend robert crandall former ceo of american airlines parent amr corp says improvements to amtraks network in the northeast are one of the best ways to reduce aviation gridlock since amtrak introduced higher speed acela trains in the railroads share of the daily plane or train passengers traveling between washington and new york has grown to from the acela runs as fast as miles per hour between new york and washington it reaches its top mph speed on a small part of the route between new york and boston amtraks share of the boston new york air rail market is also up but by a lower amount chris gremski who manages travel for the new york based open society institute investor george soross charitable foundation says a significant number of the foundations employees have switched to acela from air shuttles between new york and washington airport security lines and flight delays are wiping out the time savings of the plane he says and acela is cheaper the one way nondiscounted fare for the new york washington acela is &# compared with &# for the air shuttle mr gremski says some employees also are using the train because they think it is more fuel efficient and less polluting than the plane but there are definite limits to how much more acela can do alex kummant amtraks president and ceo said in a presentation recently that amtrak is constrained by the size of the acela fleet which numbers trains if he had his druthers mr kummant said amtrak would be able to add cars to acela trains to meet demand rather than being limited to passengers by acelas fixed complement of six cars and two locomotives acela will never clock the steady mph speeds reached by the fastest european and japanese trains as they travel on dedicated tracks from city to city on the northeast corridor acela is stuck with curvy tracks that it must share with freight and commuter trains space for more and faster trains is limited particularly in new york where the northeast corridor squeezes down to just two tracks under the hudson river still for &# million in upgrades to tracks equipment signals and electrical power systems amtrak could shave minutes from the acelas hour schedule between new york and washington mr kummant told congress last month further time savings would come at a higher cost mr kummant says that to save an additional minutes would cost &# billion for new tunnels in new york and baltimore new bridges at other locations and track upgrades at five stations truly high speed rail requires a straighter dedicated line built to highly exacting standards david gunn who was fired as president of amtrak in after a policy dispute put it bluntly "if you really want a super zippy train from washington to new york you have to build another railroad "
