bank of america invests &# billion in countrywide bank of america corp acquired a &# billion equity stake in countrywide financial corp a move aimed at dispelling a crisis of confidence among creditors and investors in the nations largest mortgage company the deal which received quick approval from regulators provides a strong dose of security for countrywide in recent weeks the company had struggled to raise the financing it needed to fund its business stoking concerns among investors about its prospects and pummeling its stock worries about the health of countrywide which originates or funds roughly one out of every six mortgages in the u s have contributed to the recent tumult in financial markets news of the countrywide deal came late yesterday afternoon just hours after wall street investment bank lehman brothers holdings inc announced that it was closing down a subprime lending business and two days after another big lender capital one financial corp closed its greenpoint mortgage arm those operations joined scores of small to midsize lenders that have collapsed over the past six months amid growing anxiety over a surge in home loan defaults and a weakening housing market "countrywide is a survivor " angelo mozilo chief executive officer and co founder of the calabasas calif company said in an interview late yesterday though the deal doesnt give countrywide automatic access to bank of americas capital it is likely to persuade investors that the company has a powerful ally ready to help in any crisis and it removes a major source of uncertainty hanging over the nations credit markets at a time when investor confidence has been shaky mr mozilo said countrywide would have survived without help from bank of america but will be strengthened by this "vote of confidence to the world " in after hours trading yesterday shares of countrywide jumped &# or nearly to &# bank of america invested in countrywide nonvoting convertible preferred stock yielding annually the preferred can be converted into common stock subject to restrictions on trading for months at a conversion price of &# a share a full conversion would give bank of america a to stake in countrywides common shares mr mozilo said mr mozilo dismissed as "frivolous" for now any speculation that the investment could lead to a full merger between bank of america and countrywide but he said the two companies would explore "where we can provide services to them better than they do themselves and vice versa well continue discussions " countrywide had long argued that it would endure the current mortgage meltdown and emerge even stronger as competitors vanished but the company was caught up last week in a storm of speculation as it found it could no longer tap the market for commercial paper or short term corporate ious a major source of its financing and a merrill lynch analyst warned in a report that it could face bankruptcy in a worst case scenario to shore up its finances countrywide borrowed &# billion from a syndicate of banks though the capital injection from bank of america is a big plus investors shouldnt get "too euphoric " said frederick cannon an analyst at keefe bruyette &amp woods in san francisco who expects countrywide to post a sizable loss for the third quarter mortgage defaults and foreclosures are expected to keep rising over the next year or two as borrowers run into trouble on loans that started out with relatively low payments only to "reset" later to much higher ones during the housing boom of the first half of this decade countrywide was a big promoter of pay option adjustable rate mortgages known as option arms these give borrowers several choices each month including paying no principal and less than the full amount of interest normally due if they take that route their loan balance grows setting them up for much higher payments later on countrywides banking arm holds &# billion of option arms on its books payments were days or more overdue on of these loans as of june compared with a year earlier countrywide reduced its subprime lending or lending to borrowers with shaky credit histories to of loans originated in the second quarter from a year earlier but it retains exposure to many past subprime and other risky loans sold to other parties when loans are packaged into securities and sold lenders such as countrywide often keep a portion of the securities known as "residuals " this portion bears the first losses from defaults as of june countrywide had &# billion of those residuals whose value will drop or even vanish if defaults continue to mount rapidly "it shows a sign of faith from bank of america that they are supporting countrywide and thats huge " said richard hofmann an analyst at creditsights a bond market research firm in new york mr mozilo noted that bank of america has provided financing for countrywides lending since shortly after the founding of the home loan company he declined to specify when the two sides began discussing the equity investment but said it came together "over a relatively short period of time " and that regulators were kept informed the investment puts bank of america much more deeply into the turbulent but sometimes highly profitable home mortgage market in the first half of this year bank of america was the fifth largest originator of home

those exceeding the &# ceiling on loans that can be sold to government sponsored mortgage investors fannie mae and freddie mac over the past two weeks investors have been so spooked by doubts over possible losses on mortgages that they have shunned even relatively high quality loans simply because they dont carry a fannie mae or freddie mac guarantee on payments of interest and principal indymacs move is a sign that the market for jumbo loans might be settling down after a spike that has sent rates on year fixed rate jumbos to an average of around from just under in early july

markets "this investment reflects our confidence in their business and recognizes the importance of the company in providing home financing across the country " he said
