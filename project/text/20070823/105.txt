sign up for the e mail here the looming fight over whether and how to keep the u s in iraq is complicated by a critical ambiguity just whos in charge in baghdad in a speech to a veterans of foreign wars convention in kansas city mo president bush yesterday stepped up an end of summer promotional campaign aimed at reversing the prevailing antiwar sentiment declaring himself a reluctant "wartime president " mr bush again placed iraq at the vanguard of a post defense of the u s and the front lines in the "struggle for civilization " but his comparisons of al qaeda and iraqi insurgents stretched farther back to include the "war machine of imperial japan" and the communists of wartime vietnam equating todays middle east with the far east of decades ago he argued the antiwar majority of americans was wrong to back a withdrawal from vietnam and that a departure from iraq would lead to the kind of mass atrocities committed by the khmer rouge in cambodia "then as now people argued the real problem was americas presence and that if we would just withdraw the killing would end " he said some historians the wall street journal reports were quick to take issue with the historical accuracy of mr bushs speech "the president emphasized the violence in the wake of american withdrawal from vietnam but this happened because the united states left too late not too early " says steven simon a mideast expert at the council on foreign relations "it was the expansion of the war that opened the door to pol pot and the genocide of the khmer rouge " ret army brig gen john johns tells the journal that what he "learned in vietnam is that u s forces could not conduct a counterinsurgency operation the longer we stay there the worse its going to get " historical arguments are bound to proliferate as the debate over the effects of mr bushs troop surge again takes center stage in washington next month and as the war arguments dominate the presidential debates with many probably echoing the title of an article in the september october issue of foreign affairs "who lost iraq " in the piece james dobbins an assistant secretary of state under president bush and president clinton argues americans should accept their country failed in iraq and move on to learning from the failure meanwhile the current search for policy resolution is confounded by the persistent conundrum of iraqs nominal sovereignty as embodied by nouri al maliki mr bush yesterday defended the embattled iraqi prime minister as "a good guy a good man with a difficult job and i support him " that defense akin to the personal confidence mr bush expressed in mr malikis two post predecessors comes amid the growing chorus of angry doubts from american military officers and politicians that the current government can make essential changes and as mr maliki is ruling without a parliamentary majority "its not up to politicians in washington d c to say whether he will remain in his position that is up to the iraqi people who now live in a democracy and not a dictatorship " mr bush said to applause mr maliki during a trip to syria yesterday defended himself saying he could "find friends elsewhere" if the u s abandons him as the washington post reports but that gets to the heart of iraqs political problems mr maliki nominally runs iraq even as the u s military is the countrys dominant force and while the unpopular presence of american soldiers undermines support for the government that washington is counting on to improve the situation the surge of activity at banks there is again much to

leading construction executives in the city say they have never even heard of it " the times adds john galt the name of a central character in ayn rands "atlas shrugged" doesnt seem "much more than a corporate entity meant to accommodate the people and companies actually doing the demolition job at the emotionally charged and environmentally hazardous site at the edge of ground zero " these include regional scaffolding and hoisting which isnt in the business of taking apart skyscrapers the times reports and executives who used to work for safeway environmental a company removed from one contract at the building over integrity concerns yesterday the times reports "bovis announced that it had declared galt in default on the bank building contract saying the outfit bovis had selected
