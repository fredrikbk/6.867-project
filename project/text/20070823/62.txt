new dell vostro line misses mark in aim for tiny businesses dell has been having a tough time lately once the widely admired leader among pc makers it has lost its sales crown to hewlett packard and has seen its once legendary customer satisfaction plunge in an attempt to jazz up its image the stodgy behemoth recently introduced a line of thin sleek colorful consumer notebooks the xps m series but has been unable to build the machines on schedule now dell is making another interesting move to better address the market it has introduced a new sub brand of computers intended for perhaps the most poorly served segment of computer buyers really small businesses with employees or less that have no full time it departments the new dell line for these very small businesses is called vostro it fits into a new dell brand lineup all dells consumer models both laptop and desktop are called inspirons a name formerly reserved only for laptops big business models are still called latitude optiplex or precison high performance consumer models are called xps ive been testing a midrange vostro model a laptop with a inch screen called the vostro its a bulky plain machine with nothing built in that dell doesnt already offer on consumer models and some omissions that could make for extra setup work for small businesses but it is fairly affordable and to dells credit it comes without the useless trial software dell and others cram onto consumer pcs judged by its hardware and software the vostro is mostly a branding and marketing ploy at the moment dell concedes the new line is "just a first step" in what it swears will be a major initiative to serve very small businesses the only real small business innovation lies outside the product itself a dedicated phone support staff that dell says has been trained specifically to serve these small companies but unless you pay extra youll still be dealing with support people based outside the u s in canada and in the philippines far from dells texas headquarters only time will tell if these folks can really provide better than usual service the vostro starts at just &# but that base model has very little memory and a small hard disk the configuration dell lent me for testing with a decent two gigabytes of memory and a gigabyte hard disk plus an extra large battery and a built in sprint cellular modem costs &# dell says its available today at a promotional price of &# the optional sprint service requires a monthly fee usually &# there are three other vostro laptop models including a very basic design called the vostro that starts at just &# dell also offers vostro desktops the vostro i tested came with windows xp instead of windows vista most vostro models can be ordered with xp which may be a welcome choice for small businesses that dont want to wrestle with the continuing lack of compatible software and hardware for vista dell touts several features that it builds into the vostro machines one is a network setup program called network assistant another is pc tuneup which is maintenance software a third is an online backup service that stores up to gigabytes of data these are all useful but none is new or tailored to small businesses all were already available for dells consumer models albeit for small fees even the choice of windows xp and the option to order a computer without any trial software have been available on some dell consumer models still there were some surprising omissions on the vostro that i tested there was no security software not even the usual day subscription dell notes that you can opt to get the day subscription free of charge and buy a month security package for &# it figures that many small businesses might already have access to security software but because this is a necessity installing it after the fact could be a hassle the vostros with xp like my test unit also lack a modern secure web browser they come with the old insecure internet explorer instead of mozillas firefox or microsofts much safer internet explorer a small business buying a vostro with xp would have to immediately replace the browser and the vostro doesnt come bundled with any small business software in my tests the vostro performed just fine running quickly and easily connecting to my wi fi network but its a heavy thick box that would be a burden for travelers my configuration tipped the scales at seven pounds yet the battery life was only fair for such a bulky laptop even with the extra large battery in my harsh battery test where i turn off all power saving software and play a loop of music the vostro lasted three hours and minutes meaning youd likely get five hours at most in normal use the standard battery would get you about a third less power overall the vostro is just an ok laptop which isnt different enough from consumer models to really earn the small business designation it claims email me at mossberg wsj com find all my columns and videos online free at
