china mobile push pinches rivals carrier wields pricing power against wireless web providers beijing a david vs goliath battle is afoot in china over the future of the fast growing business of supplying internet content over cellphones so far the giant is winning china mobile ltd market leader in the worlds biggest cellphone market is making an aggressive push into the wireless internet sector squeezing out small content providers the struggle pits one of chinas biggest government owned enterprises against a host of start ups and underscores the dominant role the state continues to play in one of the countrys most dynamic industries while fights between carriers and content providers arent uncommon chinas cellphone market is distinguished by its sheer size and rapid growth china mobile is the worlds biggest cellular carrier by number of customers boasting approximately million wireless subscribers in a market with a total of about million subscribers two thirds more than the population of the entire u s like many wireless companies china mobile increasingly sees its growth prospects in the development of online data services for many of chinas tech savvy citizens the cellphone is becoming the preferred means of using the internet the number of people who access the internet through their cellphone surged to million in the first half from million at the end of last year according to the china internet network information center thats more than a quarter of chinas million internet users in the past two years china mobile has been developing its own new wireless portal a gateway for mobile internet users and instant messaging service at the same time it has made a series of moves that have caused independent operators to lose large chunks of their traffic and subscribers just this week for example kongzhong corp a beijing wireless content provider listed on the nasdaq stock market said its second quarter net profit dropped from a year earlier "carriers currently derive most of their money from call fees in the future data will be the vast majority of their revenue " says william bao bean a partner at softbank china &amp india holdings china mobile and its sole competitor china unicom ltd "want as much control as possible over data and give as little as possible to their partners " china mobile recently changed the way users are charged for sending and receiving data on their phones by no longer allowing unlimited access to the mobile web and data downloads while promoting content on its own wireless web portal called monternet china mobile has been sending users a message as they try to connect to sites outside the portal telling them they will be charged for data use outside monternet the result is dramatically lower traffic for those sites these changes "have hurt business significantly" for independent service providers mr bean says some industry insiders say china mobile is bullying smaller companies out of business and therefore limiting user growth all around others say that consolidating services under china mobiles flag will be better for mobile users in the long run they also say recent regulations will make the industry healthier by ridding mobile users of marketers who send spam advertisements through text messaging or who sign up people for services without permission by asking people to approve charges to their accounts and making it easier to cancel services china mobile will "clean up the industry " says wendy wang a spokeswoman for mobile marketing firm madhouse inc a spokesman for china mobile declined repeated requests for comment downloading ring tones and communicating by text message long have been common in china as a result while lagging behind japan chinas use of the mobile internet has taken off more quickly than in the u s and operators havent imposed as much control over their subscribers as u s carriers typically do enabling them to download items through third party web sites and pay the fees through the carriers free mobile web sites rely on traffic to get advertising revenue a recent slowdown in revenue growth for service providers from free mobile web sites and mobile downloads illustrates the impact of china mobiles new charges service provider revenue jumped to two billion yuan &# million in from million yuan in according to beijing based technology consulting firm analysys international but between and last year growth slowed to just that lagged behind growth at china mobile which also reported that value added services helped drive a stronger than expected rise in profit in the first half of this year analysts say china mobiles moves to control more of the mobile web market have cut deeply into revenue for service providers including kongzhong and tom online inc of beijing tom posted a &# million net loss for the second quarter compared with an &# million net profit a year earlier partially due to china mobiles moves many smaller service providers have shut completely the number of wireless internet service providers has decreased to about last year from almost in insiders expect the consolidation to continue at least until the government issues licenses for third generation or g technology at that point it is possible that as more mobile carriers enter the scene they will have to use strategic partnerships with service providers to compete to survive until then and to sustain their businesses in the long term however experts say service providers will have to develop more creative and original content marcus xiang founder of personal dimension x a mobile site for blogging and social networking says the changes have stifled growth in the mobile internet industry as a whole "they have the wrong strategy of depressing free mobile services " mr xiang says "if you talk to people who are marketing mobile phones they like to have more sites for people to visit so people will be more willing to pay for mobile phones especially the ones that connect to the internet " as for his own business he says the regulations have directly caused a drop in traffic growth and revenue for the company edward yu chief executive of analysys says the effect on service providers can be seen across the board china mobiles new fee structure "scares people away from using services " he says "its a lose lose situation on one hand the other service providers are not only losing traffic but potentially revenue from lost user subscriptions and also advertisers because mobile marketing has recently started to get some momentum on the other hand china mobile wont get good traffic or much more revenue either because they are driving users away from using mobile internet" entirely mr yu says shanghai based mobile advertising firm minfo inc says that so far the effects have been positive because the shakeout helps people put more trust in the remaining service providers still the companys ceo alvin wang graylin fears that in the long term china mobile is "missing the bigger picture " "at the end of the day carriers will make more money selling data subscriptions versus trying to get people to just buy ring tones and buy subscriptions off of monternet " mr graylin says
