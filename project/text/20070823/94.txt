style ask teri fashion reporter teri agins answers readers questions q i love to wear curly wavy wigs or hair attachments i am over and i think i look better with this hair as it seems to take a few years off my face is this a fashion no no for women of a certain age h r leawood kan a performers such as diana ross and tina turner made wigs their trademark sporting them with verve and sass but for many years wigs got a bad rap because they looked so obviously wiggy too shiny and too thick wigs that are too noticeable also can carry a stigma suggesting that the wearer is grappling with thinning hair or illness however todays wigs hairpieces and other hair weaves are truly believable and just like false eyelashes and nail extensions often undetectable there are many options in all lengths and hair textures that feature improved synthetic and human hair wigs are also more affordable than ever costing as little as &# more wig wearers now understand the art of subtlety using hair pieces clipped or sewn into their hair to add fullness and height instead of wearing rapunzel long tresses the best full head wigs are featherweight and hand tied meaning that tiny hair clumps are embedded in a scalp like cap as opposed to standard wigs which have bulky rows of hair sewn onto elastic tracks hand tied wigs lie flatter on the head another innovation "lace front" edges that are glued to your face and mimic a natural hairline celebrities of course are big users of all kinds of hairpieces and wigs and not just for red carpet events "tv anchors and actresses cant afford to have bad hair days " says nathan busch a new york based hair designer who works in films "we use wigs on actresses black and white all the time instead of applying all that heat and wear and tear and damage to their own hair we can prep the wigs and hairpieces ahead of time " so ordinary women young and old may want to think like the stars your objective is a great looking hairdo and thats what people will notice any hairstyle that shaves years off your appearance will give you confidence youll feel the most secure when the wig closely resembles your own hairstyle there are scores of online hair catalogs to choose from but first time buyers should get some pointers from a hairstylist on which are the best wig merchants in town and if youre planning to spend big bucks hire the stylist to accompany you when you go shopping if youre seeking a full wig that you plan to wear often consider splurging on a custom made wig which will set you back &# or more says mr busch "a custom made wig is well ventilated and can duplicate your natural hair with gray or highlights and thin spots " designed from a mold of your head and made with a natural part "it is totally undetectable and comfortable " he says q i have noticed in recent years that nail polishes in colors arent popular like they used to be the going thing seems to be natural shades or french manicures but i think my hands look better with tasteful red or pink polish are bright nail colors just not chic anymore h r a many women now prefer neutral blush or beige nails as well as french manicures in which nail tips are polished in white with the rest of the nail in clear pink or blush pale shades are attractive on long or short nails and they are far more practical where your nails are taking a beating on the computer keyboard the light shades dont show chipping which is important when you want your manicure to last for at least a week but when it comes to nail colors its really about individual preferences feel free to wear the shades you love i too gravitate toward bright reds my favorite is a golden red nail polish that i always wear on my toenails and for special occasions on my fingernails too i take extra care to wear rubber gloves while in the kitchen and shower to guard against chips now that there are plenty of cheap nail salons in business in most cities theres no reason why you shouldnt enjoy changing your nail colors to fit your mood email questions to askteri wsj com
