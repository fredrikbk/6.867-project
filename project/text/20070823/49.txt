is wachovia still golden california acquisition hurt stock but loans may shine in the storm herb and marion sandler successfully ran golden west financial for years weathering all kinds of real estate downturns even as the california thrift grew to be one of the biggest issuers of adjustable rate mortgages in the country so when they sold their company to wachovia corp for &# billion last year it looked like a classic top of the market deal it turns out it was and the mortgage industry has been slammed ever since wachovia has been punished for bulking up on exotic adjustable rate home loans at the height of the market its stock is down since the purchase was announced compared with a decline in a major bank index and wachovias nonperforming loans jumped in the second quarter with about of that increase coming from "legacy golden west" loans so why is herb sandler still a big shareholder in wachovia smiling because he sees opportunity in others distress investors should be smiling too because wachovia could take advantage of the downturn to build its lending business and at the current valuation the banks shares now trade at a month trailing price to earnings ratio of a year low and a discount to its peers means investors are expecting serious losses from its mortgages which based on golden wests long term track record are unlikely to happen "its cheap " says banking analyst john mcdonald of banc of america securities who calls wachovia a "buy " wachovia shares were up cents to &# yesterday on the new york stock exchange investors reacted positively to wachovias move to raise its quarterly dividend tuesday by to cents a share giving it a yield of first the negatives golden wests loans were concentrated in california where home prices had soared in recent years and are already taking a beating the vast majority of those loans were option arm loans which let customers choose how much to pay each month with unpaid interest added onto the mortgage and increasing the loans balance negative amortization or the additional amount owed by borrowers whose payments dont cover the interest on their loan ballooned to &# billion at the end of june more than double the amount a year earlier wachovias decision to disclose much less information than golden west previously did about the performance of its options arms hasnt helped reassure investors and analysts wachovia said it stopped breaking out monthly option arm statistics once it incorporated golden west so as not to overemphasize one product in its broader mortgage business atlanta capital management co cut its wachovia stake to shares at the end of june from million a year earlier "with the benefit of hindsight they bought golden west at a time that was the peak of the housing cycle and theyre suffering as a result " said william hackney iii managing partner of the atlanta investment firm all of these negatives are well known in the market the positives have been lost in the stampede away from anything related to mortgages what investors dont understand mr sandler says is that wachovia is a portfolio lender which holds its option arms on its own books that gives it an incentive to underwrite carefully and help borrowers who are struggling to make payments "when youre a portfolio lender you have skin in the game " he said already wachovia says mortgage loan applications are rising as competitors fall off fewer customers are paying off their loans early another boon and a signal that they arent refinancing with others "we think its a much healthier market for us to realize the benefit of the golden west model " wachovia finance chief tom wurtz says "the secondary market may return but i doubt if the irrationality will return " then there is golden wests golden track record mr sandler has proved skeptics wrong for decades and he was frequently critical of the lax lending practices that pervaded the industry for the past few years even writing a letter to federal regulators last year in support of tighter standards he admits a "perverse sense of satisfaction" at watching competitors go under and the investors holding their securities fail "everything we forecast to happen has happened " says mr sandler a frequent critic of competitors who required no down payment set interest rates that reset quickly at high rates and sold bundled loans to far off investors "new century financial bye bye ameriquest bye bye " golden west historically had very low levels of bad loans which mr sandler has attributed to his banks careful vetting of borrowers and their credit at the end of the last full year for which golden west reported results separately before being acquired by wachovia golden wests ratio of nonperforming loans to its total assets was a mere a figure so low that the company acknowledged it would likely rise golden west also averaged loan losses that were statistically zero lower than any major financial institution mr sandler says "yet they question golden wests portfolio " he said "its insanity " wachovia has the lowest rate of total problem loans of the top u s banks according to an analysis of first quarter call reports by fig partners llc in atlanta the company employs its own appraisers who have no incentive to pump up property values wachovias mortgage loans have a loan to value ratio meaning that borrowers have significant equity in their homes and an incentive to keep paying their bills even if their circumstances change most of the banks option arms have terms preventing monthly mortgage payments from increasing by more than in any one year so the risk of severe payment shock to borrowers as rates on the loans reset is limited the bank says meanwhile g kennedy thompson wachovias chief executive has bet his professional reputation on making the golden west acquisition work while the charlotte n c banks nonperforming mortgage loans are on the rise the fifth largest u s bank in stock market value brags that its &# billion commercial and consumer loan portfolio is rock solid overall and that its mortgage performance while sliding is still better than peers and in line with its expectations mr sandler years old no longer has any direct interaction with wachovia and golden west "if we hadnt sold the company and i were years younger this would be one of the greatest markets for a portfolio lender in history " he said
