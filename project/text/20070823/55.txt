memo to schumer dont blame the brokers in response to sen charles schumers aug letter to the editor "new laws needed to curb unscrupulous brokers " the new york association of mortgage brokers nyamb and the national association of mortgage brokers namb would like to take this opportunity to highlight our points of agreement with the senator and mention some additional information that sen schumer left out first and foremost the nyamb and namb appreciated the opportunity to sit down with sen schumer in a meeting this month and discuss the current situation in the housing market we were encouraged by much of what the senator conveyed to us during the meeting and the common ground that we thought we had reached with him needless to say we were disappointed to see the senator proceed to blame the broker in the letters column of the wall street journal a few days later as we told sen schumer in our meeting the nyamb and namb agree with him that there are some major issues that need to be addressed within the housing market and that new rules and regulations are necessary to restore confidence in our industry the nyamb has taken the lead in this regard by spearheading a registration system for the majority of loan originators in the senators home state of new york especially mortgage brokers the nyamb and namb have been in talks with the new york state banking department for the past years attempting to get this legislation passed well before the current market conditions we reported to sen schumer annually at the namb legislative conference that we were fighting for this legislation but that the nys banking department lacked the resources to implement the system until now the registration system which is currently awaiting the governors signature creates reference numbers for loan originators in new york and thereby a method of tracking "bad actors " if a consumer feels that they have been victimized by a loan originator they can place a formal complaint with the state that will stay on the loan originators record and can be used by the consumer for formal redress if a loan originator has official complaints on file it will be very difficult for that individual to defend their business practices and continue with their dishonest ways the nyamb and namb would like this system to be instituted on a federal level so that a bad actor in new york will not be allowed to pack up shop fly by night to new jersey and continue to rip people off regulations like these make sense because they punish bad actors without cutting off credit options to people who need them the most what does not hold water is sen schumers idea that the current problems in the housing market are all the fault of the mortgage broker we must remember that mortgage brokers are not the only people who originate loans but that mortgage bankers and credit unions do as well the truth is that regulations must apply evenly to all loan originators in order to create the level playing field that is necessary for proper american capitalism sen schumer commended us in years past for increasing homeownership and creating opportunities for people who previously could not qualify for a loan and own a home he told the nyamb that our efforts allowed people to participate in a market that yielded great appreciating home values and helped lift them from the bondage of renting when we told him of our efforts to get the nys banking department to register all loan originators we were told that we were doing the right thing that is obviously a different tune than we are currently hearing in short while blaming the broker might make good headlines for the senator today it marginalizes the very people with the experience knowledge and ability to help consumers in the future mortgage brokers without offering any real protections to consumers and causing further damage to the housing market at a time when it is hobbling this is not a genuine attempt to solve these very complex problems but rather an exercise in the politics of finger pointing gregory a krauza president new york association of mortgage brokers george hanzimanolis president national association of mortgage brokers
