style fashion journal case study dressing for a naked ceo what to wear to the office is complex issue for consultants from pinstripes to jeans few of us will ever face a meeting with an executive who is attired in nothing but a bath towel as communications coach john millen once did but consultants like him deal each day with all sorts of sartorial complexities that come from constantly entering new office cultures with unfamiliar personalities increasingly in different parts of the world after all the products that consultants sell are themselves any consumer product marketer will tell you that like it or not the packaging is often as important as whats inside with consultants operating far flung practices today and with acceptable office attire ranging from jeans to pinstriped suits many operate in a steady state of indecision what should i wear today "its a constant dilemma on every engagement " says robert salwen an executive compensation consultant in new york in many offices the rules on clothing are so ill defined that even people working in the same place dont really understand whats appropriate wrinkled khakis sports coats capris joel garfinkle an executive coach in oakland calif has been confronted with clients who work in shorts when mr salwen prepares to meet a new client he makes all sorts of assumptions about the type of person that client is he divides his wardrobe of suits into two categories when meeting venture capitalists and investment banker types who tend to have more aggressive personalities he says he wears his "in your face" pinstriped suit which he pairs with a pinstriped shirt and bold patterned ties more staid corporate types or start ups will see mr salwen in a "sincere" solid navy or gray brooks brothers suit "more often than not i find myself overdressed on the first meeting " mr salwen says but "theres not a stigma attached to being overdressed in the environments i work in " the same cant be said for consultants who work in silicon valley where even the wall street investment bankers must closet their suits or face ridicule and lack of trust something most people do rarely dressing for the first day on a new job consultants must do all the time being successful means figuring out how to fit into an environment they dont fully understand knowing that first impressions are hard to change "you always want to establish a bond with people " says karen kaplowitz founder and president of the new ellis group a strategic planning and development firm in princeton n j "well how do you establish a bond people want to do business with people who are in their tribe " a former trial lawyer ms kaplowitz chooses clothes that mirror the environment of the attorneys and digital entertainment clients she caters to in one case with a client who is an exquisitely dressed and outspoken entertainment lawyer that meant going shopping for more fashionable clothes "she told me i needed to update id gotten too boring " ms kaplowitz says the consultants dilemma is how to impress without making clients feel inferior for a consultant in particular clothes communicate not only expertise but also social rank says mr millen who is a specialist in "reputation management" and president of mainstream public relations in dublin ohio "in comparison to the person im coaching if im underdressed am i worth her listening to " he asks "if im better dressed am i being condescending to him " mr millen calls ahead to clients offices to inquire about dress codes and habits nevertheless hes been foiled he once received an assignment to meet a ceo at his los angeles country club for a confidential afternoon session it turned out that the executive who was in his mid s had played golf and taken a steam bath he "was sitting there in a towel watching sportscenter " says mr millen who had worn what he thought was country club business casual a jacket polo shirt and khakis "i took off the jacket but my polo and khakis still felt overdressed " larry marion chief executive of triangle publishing services inc a contract publisher based in newton mass sees things from the other side he hires consultants and if theyre likely to work with his clients he looks for signals such as clothing that suggest theyll be a good fit "i want my team to fit in so appropriate attire makes sense " he says but sometimes even the best guess proves wrong dorothy crenshaw president of stanton crenshaw communications in new york recalls dressing for a tech company clients weekend videoconference on the west coast given the client the more casual coast and the saturday timing she thought a strappy yellow dress not quite a sundress but almost would be appropriate "they were wearing business suits " ms crenshaw says her voice rising with emotion "it was so humiliating the client just looked me up and down i kept saying to myself no one cares but you " overdressing has its drawbacks though as the owner of an agency that sends english teachers to teach corporate executives in paris ann talpey says she is reluctant to wear very expensive clothes or shoes to client meetings "i dont want them to think the prices they are paying are going into my wardrobe " ms talpey says email christina binkley wsj com
