lower the fed funds rate since the ben bernanke led federal reserve has chosen price level stability as its objective the monetary policy needed to achieve it requires an inflation measure chairman bernanke apparently emphasizes the personal consumption expenditure deflator much like his predecessor alan greenspan and so when the core pce deflator increased to a annual growth rate in august from a average annual rate of mr bernanke noted that inflation was uncomfortably high but when the month rate of increase of the core pce deflator fell back to in both the june and july price reports of the labor department there was no recognition of improvement even though the feds assumed comfort zone was for pce measured inflation between and instead mr bernanke continued to worry that inflation would not continue to come down here reflecting the forecast of the federal open market committee itself based on the staffs economic model but the real reason he should worry is that the staff model is wrong and the model is leading policy makers to maintain a fed funds rate that is simply too high to allow for an orderly resolution of the disorder in the financial markets this fomc staff model assumes that inflation is the likely result of the economy operating at or even too close to capacity constraints thus economic policy including federal budget and monetary policy should limit the growth rate of demand so that the demand for labor does not grow faster than the growth rate of the labor force the fed staff story line excess demand for labor puts upward pressure on wage increases increasing the cost of goods and services and leading to price increases this keynesian demand side model compares the actual unemployment rate to an unemployment rate that it is assumed would not result in an acceleration of inflation accordingly monetary policy should restrain the growth of demand sufficiently to push the unemployment rate higher than the non accelerating unemployment rate since the july unemployment rate of up slightly from a rate of in may is not thought to be sufficiently high to promote a fall in the inflation rate mr bernanke and company are concerned that inflation may not fall as much as they have forecast they seem to be ignoring the fact that inflation has already fallen as far in july as they had forecast for the end of the year and so while price stability is the objective the fed has essentially reverted to managing the growth of demand accordingly monetary policy is maintaining at least a targeted target fed funds rate until the unemployment rate rises price level stability however would be better achieved if the fed were to focus on forward looking price level indicators instead of backward looking employment and unemployment rates consider that the price of gold increased to &# an ounce in june from &# per ounce in june a warning that the target fed funds rate was too low apparently not the greenspan led fomc with governor ben bernanke as a member persisted in worrying about the risk of deflation even though house prices were rising how can an economy encounter deflation if house prices are rising if lowering the target fed funds rate to keeping it there and then raising it too slowly precipitated an unwanted increase in overall consumer inflation to and a core inflation rate to then what explains the subsequent month decline in the overall consumer inflation rate to a month rate and the decline in the core pce rate from to over the last months surely the answer is that the target fed funds rate of restrained commodity prices house prices and the overall consumer price level when the fomc lowered the target fed funds rate to in and left it too low too long it set off a long and extensive rise in the price of houses a bubble the way to wealth was sure and simple buy houses the monetary policy mistake of holding the target fed funds rate too low too long was compounded by a regulatory policy determined to enable lower income households to qualify for home ownership lending standards virtually disappeared in too many cases all this added to the housing boom and held the potential to worsen the correction on the other side of the bubble ultimately monetary restraint began to bite just as the fomc ended is string of consecutive target rate increases to reach its present just as increases in the price of gold and other commodities warned of rising prices the declining price of houses should have constituted a warning signal in late the price of houses became a leading indicator of the rate of change of the price level and the decline in house prices subtracted a huge chunk of wealth from the economy the fomc has instead misread monetary policy as erring on the side of ease while being over confident that employment growth would produce an orderly end to the house price correction the fomc did not want to be deterred from its hawkish stance on inflation by an end to the housing boom somehow the fomc failed to recognize that its forecast of a smooth correction of house prices did not match up with reality the problem is far more than a subprime loan freeze up the fomc must lower the target fed funds rate sufficiently to reduce the yield on treasuries injecting central bank reserves by purchasing securities and by encouraging banks to borrow at the discount window has lowered yields on day treasury bills yesterday to equivalent to a fed funds rate averaging around fomc reserve injection during the day is reversed at the overnight closing time to achieve an artificial this target fed funds chicanery leaves the financial market with considerable uncertainty and adequate funding is not available for the real economy it is time for the fomc to take the first step by lowering the target fed funds rate to consistent with a day t bill yield moving up to the fomc cannot issue enough reserves to buy up all the subprime and other credit extensions that the market does not want but the fomc can reduce the rush into scarce treasury securities it can do so by permitting treasury yields to fall enough to encourage banks and other lenders to reach for higher returns through assuming some risk by buying mortgages and other needed credit to finance the real economy as long as the fomc insists on maintaining a target rate then the market will assume that treasury yields will rise and the risk of a rush to get into treasuries will resume at the expense of real financing needs of the economy the fomc should not want monetary policy to have an adverse impact on the real economy adding to the downward momentum from falling house prices the fomc has a responsibility to enable credit to be rationed by market prices different rates of return on assets are necessary for an orderly credit market when a stampede to get out of subprime mortgages became a stampede to get out of conventional mortgages the fomc should have been alerted to the evidence that the yield on treasury bills treasury notes and treasury bonds were too high relative to financial assets with more risk monetary policy will continue to fall behind if the fed waits to see the whites of the eyes of a further slowdown in the growth of employment and output mr angell a federal reserve board member from is president of angell economics
