winning championships in internet games like quake and alien vs predator his screen name is fatalty during the televised world series of poker last year one player remarking on a deft move told an opponent that he had been "poned " in an episode of the animated tv show "south park " one of the characters shouted during an online game "looks like youre about to get poned yeah " another character later marveled "that was such an uber ponage " one problem with speaking in such code there is little agreement on pronunciation jarett cale the year old star of an internet video series called "pure pwnage " enunciates the title "pure own age " this is correct since "pwn" was originally a typo he argues and sounds "a lot cooler " but many of the shows fans which he estimates at around three

parents and others who denounce them as part of a broader debasement of the english language "there used to be a time when people cared about how they spoke and wrote " laments robert hartwell fiske who has written or edited several books on proper english usage including one on overused words titled "the dimwits dictionary " when a reader of his online journal called the vocabula review proposed "leet " as in leetspeak for his list of best words mr fiske rejected it "leet slang for good or great apparently and idiotic certainly " he wrote on the vocabula web site "leet" is in dictionaries

misused overly used and just plain useless others on the list included "awesome" and "gitmo" shorthand for guantanamo bay some suggest such verbal creations are nothing new and are integral to how language evolves gail kern paster director of the folger shakespeare library in washington d c has reason to believe that a certain english poet and playwright would cheer the latest linguistic leap just as the rise of the printed word and the theater spurred many new expressions during shakespeares time the computer revolution she notes has necessitated its own vocabulary like "logging in" and "web site " "the issue of correctness didnt bother him " says ms paster "he loved to play with language " as for leet "he would say bring it on absolutely " the word "ok " one of the most widely used words in many languages first appeared in a boston newspaper in as an abbreviation for "oll korrect " according to allan metcalf a professor of english at macmurray college in jacksonville ill other abbreviations such as o f m for our first men referring sometimes sarcastically to a communitys leading citizens also became briefly popular in boston newspapers at the time says mr metcalf the internet is not the first technological advancement to change the way language is used the telegraph required people to communicate "with lots of dots and dashes and abbreviations " says mr metcalf "since it charged by the word you compressed your message as much as possible grammar be damned " some of those words like sos the popular call for help have survived from their telegraph era origins leetspeak first became popular in the s among hackers and those adept enough to gain access to an early form of online chat forums called bulletin boards these "elite" users developed leetspeak occasionally to conceal their hacking plans or elude text filters it still has that use for some "prn" is leetspeak for pornography but leetspeaks growing appeal and use among the un cool could undermine it "now moms are saying lol so that takes away from it " says mr cale of the internet show "pure pwnage " a couple of years ago katherine blashki a professor of new media studies didnt understand some of the words used by her students at deakin university in melbourne australia her subsequent semester long research on the subject found their use of leetspeak stemmed partly from wanting to find faster ways to express themselves online as with other forms of jargon it also enhanced a sense of belonging to a community she says "its ultimately about creating a secret language that can differentiate them from others like parents " says ms blashki "thats part of being a teenager " she presented her work at a conference in spain and has since written nearly a dozen research papers on the topic she admits she hasnt received much grant funding for her work "my peers were aghast " she says despite their facility with the new language some leet fans insist that good grammar is still important mr wendel the online gamer says he makes a point of using proper capitalization and punctuation in his online missives during competition "its always a last resort " says mr wendel "if you lose you can say at least i can spell "
