checking the kids homework over the internet growing web based software helps parents and schools peek at lessons share records after his divorce gregg la montagne found it hard to help his year old daughter with her schoolwork since she lives in another state so for her spanish class recently mr la montagne told her to write her assignment in an online word processing application made by google inc mr la montagne a sales manager in austin texas then accessed his daughters homework online using the same software through his web browser at home a native spanish speaker mr la montagne was then able to suggest grammar changes which he typed in at the bottom of the paper his daughter who was online at the same time was able to see her fathers notes almost instantaneously as her screen refreshed and then in turn correct the document for him to see "it makes it easier to participate " says mr la montagne years old "its not the same as being with her but its at least a step in that direction " mr la montagne is one of a growing number of parents now using web based applications to review and aid their childrens educational work google docs &amp spreadsheets which mr la montagne used provides word processing and spreadsheets that a consumer can access using just a web browser such applications are part of a broad move toward so called hosted web applications where software and documents are accessed over the internet rather than stored on your hard drive in the case of google docs for instance the files are stored with google many of these applications are free and allow multiple users to access and edit documents simultaneously businesses are already shifting some key operations such as sales and accounting systems to web based applications citing lower costs and fewer hassles now some families are seeing the benefits of hosted applications in their own way free web based calendar programs from yahoo inc and microsoft corp allow busy family members to share schedules online and notify each other of future events parents and teachers are using blogs and collaborative web sites called wikis with kids and schools are sharing academic data with parents via password protected online programs some families are even using web based applications targeted mainly at small and home office users such as adventnet inc s zoho com a majority free system that offers things like word processing and online presentations raju vegesna spokesperson for zoho com says zoho is seeing an increasing number of students use its word processor today roughly or of its users are students he says all of this is part of a larger trend of using the internet as school aid indeed homework has become the top reason that teenagers are using the internet on a monthly basis according to a november jupiterresearch llc study of teens in the u s ages to social networking sites such as myspace and facebook ranked fifth in the survey one concern with this type of close online collaboration is the temptation to help kids too much with their homework parents say they must guard against that because it would be so easy to simply go in and make changes themselves during a visit to utah earlier this year kate hargadon a sacramento calif student didnt have her computer with her but had an essay due for a history competition in her home state having already written a draft on paper the year old used her uncles computer to type out the draft in a google document she then worked on it with her father back in sacramento who was logged into google docs at the same time steve hargadon an educational consultant and kates father says he was cautious not to help his daughter too much "it wasnt my job to do it for her but to help make sure it was getting done " he says he pointed out places in the essay where his daughter could rework the grammar and she fixed them herself "its really convenient to use when you arent right next to him and in a different state " says ms hargadon who says she now regularly uses google docs for schoolwork such programs require little technical expertise though users must create online accounts with google docs the programs are accessed via a secure user name and password users can invite others to edit or only to view documents both the docs and the spreadsheets programs alert users that others are making changes which reduces risk of collaborators working on top of each other says a google spokeswoman changes appear onscreen almost instantaneously as the screen is automatically refreshed google accounts are limited to documents no larger than kilobytes and spreadsheets no larger than roughly one megabyte in size google says accounts are not removed due to inactivity "teachers have started to see the benefits of bringing online tools into their classrooms to engage their students " says jonathan rochelle product manager for docs &amp spreadsheets at google "weve seen examples of teachers using docs &amp spreadsheets to manage their own information like grades and assignments as well as new ways to provide feedback to student essays and tests " he says some schools are using web based programs from engrade and teacherease a unit of common goal systems inc to keep grades lesson plans and attendance records in one central database parents are given access to the information as it pertains to their own kids engrade is free teacherease comes with a subscription fee for the school of as high as &# annually parents who home school are also turning to web applications lynn aleshire of anchorage alaska who home schools her year old daughter recently used google docs and some browser based office software from zoho com to help her daughter manage a high school civics and government course using zoho com ms aleshire created an online to do list of assignments and a timeline to help keep track of her daughters progress in the class which was a requirement for graduation "she likes things in order so having this timeline in zoho was perfect for her " says ms aleshire of her daughter parents are also using web based applications to simplify other school related tasks apart from homework since june bernie thompson a free lance software developer and board member of a parent teacher student association in bellevue wash has used google spreadsheets with other parents to organize volunteers for events such as book fairs and carnivals before that the pta used a regular excel spreadsheet which parents couldnt access to see when they should sign up for an unfilled slot with googles application which other parents can log into and update the process is much easier says mr thompson some teachers say web applications can help increase collaboration in the classroom vicki davis who teaches accounting and computer science in camilla ga has assigned group projects to her high school students using online word processor writely and google docs since late google acquired writely in march since then ms davis says she has seen class participation increase and her students do more innovative work in one project she had her students individually create a business plan letter or flier in microsoft word and then do it again in teams of three using google docs then they had to write a blog post about the differences between the two ms davis says the assignments object was to teach kids how to use new software she says her students squealed when they found out multiple people could edit a single document at the same time
