lower weight from surgery shows benefit two studies and an editorial in todays new england journal of medicine support gastric bypass surgery as a way to significantly improve mortality rates in obese people but the author of the editorial stopped short of endorsing more surgery because of economic concerns about expanding use of the &# operation gastric bypass surgery has become an increasingly popular response to the obesity epidemic the surgery which shrinks the stomach and sometimes reroutes the intestines has been widely shown to provide long term weight loss last year surgeons performed gastric bypass operations in the u s according to the american society for metabolic and bariatric surgery until now evidence that the lower weight resulting from the surgery actually saves lives has been scant the first of the studies from utah involving gastric bypass patients and a control group found the surgery patients mortality rate improved by the other study from sweden followed overweight people who had different kinds of weight loss operations it found they had improved mortality during the study against comparably overweight people who didnt have surgery the journals editorialist george bray chief of the division of clinical obesity at pennington biomedical research center at louisiana state university said in an interview that the studies are the equivalent of "the statin trials that showed the drugs reduced death rates and not just cholesterol " following those studies cholesterol fighting statins became a huge business for the pharmaceutical industry dr bray said the studies which included people who had surgery at relatively low levels of obesity make it clear that the national institutes of health should reconsider guidelines that suggest the surgery as an option for patients whose body mass indexes surpass normal bmis range up to and people with bmis above are considered obese however dr bray said he isnt willing to come out in favor of a lower standard because "youll break the bank " the swedish obese subjects study followed patients from when they had the operation for as long as years and compared them with a group of comparable subjects based on bmi gender and other factors the study found that the surgical patients after years had kept off between and of their original weight depending on whether they had older surgery types or the more modern gastric bypass in the swedish study of those who had the surgery died in the study period of those who didnt have the surgery died deaths from heart disease and cancer were both sharply lower in the group that received surgery the utah study led by ted adams of the university of utah compared people who had gastric bypass surgery after with a similar number of severely obese people culled from drivers license rolls those who received surgery had deaths compared with for the control group surgery patients had fewer deaths from cardiovascular events fewer from cancer and fewer deaths from diabetes however people who had the surgery had deaths from suicide compared with five suicides among the control group the study didnt theorize about reasons for the higher suicide rate
