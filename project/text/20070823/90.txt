signs and wonders talking hands by margalit fox simon &amp schuster pages &# in the southern israeli desert of negev lies a community called al sayyid inhabited by approximately bedouin an arab nomadic tribe that settled the area about years ago the village may seem rather humdrum at first glance that is until you see the villagers interacting by making signs with their hands in al sayyid at least residents are deaf a rate times greater than that of israels general population as it happens a recessive gene for profound deafness traced back to sons of the "founding" couple has made its way through large families and genetic probabilities into an ever widening gene pool thus over three generations an extraordinarily high number of deaf children have been born to al sayyids villagers of necessity a special means of communication has sprung up nearly all the villages residents hearing and deaf alike are fluent in a sign language unique to al sayyid margalit foxs "talking hands " in part describes this language and chronicles the work of a group of linguists who were allowed by townspeople to study it though rare such "signing villages" are not unheard of certain conditions are conducive to their forming "first " ms fox writes "you need a gene for a form of inherited deafness second you need huge families to pass the gene along " the practice of polygamy together with the habit of marriage among cousins speeds the rate of genetic spread al sayyid has met all these conditions as it happens marthas vineyard off the coast of massachusetts once met at least the first two from the middle of the th century to roughly the turn of the th nearly everyone on the island used a distinctive sign language that was mostly born there nora ellen groce detailed its history in "everyone here spoke sign language" by the time ms groce began her research signing on the island had ceased since the last deaf person had died more than two decades before her book is a kind of oral history with colorful interviews of older islanders who remembered the signing days by contrast ms fox a science reporter for the new york times visits al sayyid when it is still in a signing mode she offers a few humorous anecdotes but prefers to concentrate on the subject of how languages evolve she devotes relatively brief space to her account of village residents interacting with the four linguists charged with documenting al sayyids sign language she devotes much more to a history of linguistics and of sign language in america and the world for example she discusses an international conference for deaf educators in milan that in declared "oralism" as the best way to integrate deaf people into general society it was a bad idea that enjoyed high status among western elites for many years to show its wrong headedness ms fox relates a rhetorical question posed to her by a linguist suppose an american were placed alone in a glass soundproof booth in the middle of japan how on earth would he learn to speak japanese the rhetorical answer with the greatest difficulty learning a spoken language requires hearing it or learning it through instruction in a language one does understand for the deaf sign language may serve that intermediary function but it must come first after that milan conference it would take nearly years before teaching primarily american sign language asl to the deaf was accepted practice again in the u s and years for linguists to come to a consensus that asl is indeed a full fledged language linguists now believe that sign languages are processed in our minds in much the way that spoken languages are and follow a similar evolutionary pattern this similarity is one reason why the study of sign languages is a growing subfield in linguistics the third generation of signers in al sayyid uses its language with much greater speed than the first and with much greater structural complexity spoken language shows a kindred evolution we are well past the point in history where it is possible for a new spoken language to develop without the influence of other languages what is so fascinating about al sayyid bedouin sign language absl as the villages sign language is officially called is that it was born with no apparent influence from any language at all a case in point the spoken languages of the region hebrew and the local arabic dialect favor sentences with a subject verb object sequence english does too absl favors subject object verb a close look at a young language tracing its structure and developmental arc is rarely possible in the modern age hence the appeal of studying absl the language may well give scholars special insight into the workings of the mind and the intricacies of its linguistic faculties there are other signing villages in the world today but none with languages so fully developed as al sayyids unfortunately there isnt much time israeli sign language isl an entirely different language threatens to encroach on absl and inevitably to "corrupt" its distinctiveness but al sayyids residents know as ms fox explains that learning isl will give their children a better chance to thrive in the modern world not least in the world just outside the village over time it is unclear whether older residents nurtured on a purer form of absl will understand the younger ones for now at least a unique sign language integrates everyone into a single community whether they can hear or not mr philips is the journals assistant leisure &amp arts features editor
