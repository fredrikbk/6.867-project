the desk of" stuff that katharine hepburn might have used is gaining momentum after a period of stagnant sales crane &amp co the stationery giant says sales have risen more than in the past year kates paperie a popular retailer in new york and connecticut says its sales in that category have risen as much as a year for the past three years in its stores "personalization is enormous " says patti stracher manager of the national stationery show a major industry trade show "its sort of a rebellion to the impersonal nature of communicating electronically " it also helps that the specialist printers who make it have gotten easier to find several online shops have sprung up in the past few years taking the process off the dusty bottom shelf of stationery shops where most sample books for embossed or engraved cards lurked in recent decades we decided to try to elevate our social status a notch by ordering some personalized stationery from five providers ranging from a celebrity stationer to a local print shop the goal in each case help us find a look that would be formal enough for a thank you after say a job interview yet casual enough for a dinner invitation our most high end business mrs john l strong counted mrs dwight d eisenhower and the duke and duchess of windsor among its customers and more recently oprah winfrey we arrived sweaty and late for our appointment at the madison avenue shop in manhattan due to subway delays but our personal consultant was unfazed she offered us a soft drink patiently walked us through a mind boggling array of "bespoke papers" and recommended an elongated correspondence card a flat one panel card when asked if adding our personal web site address or a motif would junk up the card she said there is no such thing as a junky card at mrs john l strong we kept it simple name only the cost &# for engraved cards in which raised letters are created with the use of metal dies and plain envelopes you can buy fewer cards than that but youll pay for stampings regardless on re orders the company subtracts &# for the cost of the die at &# a card it was expensive but if the consultant is to be believed "writing little notes leads to a healthier lifestyle " at cranes which has been making paper since the sales rep at the rockefeller center store recommended a standard correspondence card with blue or black ink no frills no web sites email addresses or flourishes cranes has a pc based system that lets customers see their designs onscreen we wanted to add a picture of a fountain pen to our card but the rep advised against it noting "katie couric and brian williams just print their names " we took her advice on the pen but ignored her counsel on the web site however the next day we decided she had been right and asked her to delete our personal web site she did it but it cost us &# extra fifty engraved cards and plain envelopes set us back &# including the fee and an &# charge for shipping the cards from the printer to the store on reorders the price goes down &# for the die at bowne &amp co stationers which is part of the south street seaport museum in manhattan and has several th century presses in its back shop the printer himself recommended a classic correspondence card and blue or green ink "black is too severe " he said "red too passionate " we picked a traditional font for our name and a cute picture of a frog on a bike he deemed the frog a little "frivolous " but said "people will enjoy receiving cards like this and youll enjoy sending them so all around life will be better " the cost for letterpress cards in which the type is pressed deeply into the card and plain envelopes &# the printer threw in five extras free for reorders he said the price goes down a sales rep at online retailer finestationery com recommended a william arthur correspondence card and we created our own design onscreen fifty letterpress cards and plain envelopes came to &# including &# for a proof and &# for shipping the company sent along five freebies our lowest cost option was american stationery a catalog and web retailer a set of no nonsense thermography printed correspondence cards in which the letters are raised using a heat process and plain envelopes cost &# including &# for shipping so how did the cards look for four of the five the paper felt thick and rich and the printing was what you would expect on such a card but there were a few differences the envelopes from mrs john l strong came with a subtle embossing of the company name so those in the know can see we shelled out the american stationery paper and print didnt seem as fancy as the others but then neither did the price some of the finestationery com cards fit a little too snugly in their envelopes who cares after spending &# on a box of cards we did and we did in fact email president bush to ask what kind of stationery the white house uses although so far all weve received in reply is an automated thank you
