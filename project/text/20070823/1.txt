a dance stars new troupe vail colo morphoses the wheeldon company" got launched this month with what might be deemed a "go tell it on the mountain" spirit for two nights during the last week of this years vail international dance festival ended on aug the new ballet venture spearheaded by year old christopher wheeldon performed in the high altitude area in and around vail to be precise "go show and tell it on the mountain" would be an even more accurate description of the nights put together under the supervision of mr wheeldon billed as an "up close" event and called "painting with music " the first morphoses evening took shape at beaver creeks vilar center for the art as a special presentation led by mr wheeldon as host teacher and choreographer besides formal and work session like performances by morphoses dancers the two part program included the much acclaimed choreographer chatting with the audience about his art and his work damian woetzel the dance festivals year old artistic director who invited mr wheeldons group to vail talked with mr wheeldon onstage about the concepts and inner workings of the new venture both men proved to be appealing and personable speakers though mr wheeldons spontaneous remarks during the very truncated warm up class for his dancers sometimes sounded slight his expressed distinction between the way in which he was schooled at britains royal ballet and the ways of balanchine which he learned once he began working with new york city ballet in struck me as an oversimplification in some ways mistaking balanchines methods as arbitrarily personal rather than "classical" in ballet terms both mr wheeldon and mr woetzel who became colleagues and friends as dancers at city ballet during the s have lately spoken of their abiding belief in ballet and their determination to see it promoted as a living and vital art to that end its too bad that the new groups name doesnt trip more easily from the tongue "morphoses" is the plural of "morphosis" and has various pronunciations furthermore given that mr wheeldon wants to fly the flag proudly for ballets art it seems a missed bet that he excluded "ballet" from the companys name the uncredited video segments that also played a part in the evening aimed to be amusing and i suppose media savvy the effect however was largely cutesy and amateur two nights after the show and tell presentation morphoses had its official "worldwide company debut" within the open air surroundings of vails gerald r ford amphitheater with its naturally landscaped background of flora and greenery fading to darkness the six part program began in the delicate half light of falling evening and ended more than two hours later while mr wheeldon intends to include the works of other choreographers on the programs his company will present this one was all wheeldon with one exception the non wheeldon offering unfortunately was hardly exceptional edwaard liangs "vicissitude " a morphoses commission is an undistinguished duet to an excerpt from schuberts "death and the maiden " at best mr liangs arbitrarily twisty choreography for the serpentine maria kowroski with the confident and clear tyler angle as her deft partner looks like a watered down half remembered outtake from a wheeldon ballet with its overwhelming focus on pointlessly ropey moves for the arms its unbecoming costume on the barelegged ms kowroski and its meandering momentum "vicissitude" is a doodle desperately trying to say something significant fortunately the rest of the program overrode the insignificance of mr liangs effort with unmistakable artistic authority two new works each commissioned by sadlers wells theatre in london where morphoses has been named guest resident company were shown as works in progress eventually the duet performed here as "prokofiev pas de deux" set to the searing central movement of prokofievs "violin concerto no " will have costumes by award winning fashion designer narciso rodriguez with its mission of "emphasizing innovation and fostering creativity through collaboration " morphoses plans to work not only with select dancers but also with contemporary composers and designers even as clothed here in makeshift rehearsal like wear the "prokofiev" duet showed mr wheeldons ability to twine one dancer with another in this case the willowy helene bouchet and thiago bordin all the while creating a dramatically geometric affair that rises above its mechanics and soars theatrically the other unfinished work due to be unveiled fully in london was called "new wheeldon " arranged for two men and two women who pair up and pair off to variously mysterious effects the work was danced here to a piano quartet reduction of joby talbots sometimes contemplative music eventually the unnamed music will be presented in full orchestration three of mr wheeldons past successful ballets completed the bill the astringent yet playful "polyphonia" to gyoergy ligeti piano pieces started the evening off with marvelous theatrics mark stanleys subtly glowing lighting gave the dancers articulate and radiant limbs a remarkable sensuality matched and surpassed by the sly accents and arrangements of mr wheeldons fluent dance making besides "after the rain" a pair of contrasting haunting dance pictures to music by arvo part that is slowly becoming a wheeldon classic the program also included the choreographers charming rendering of ponchiellis "dance of the hours " for all the musics over familiarity from disneys "fantasia " with its hippos alligators and ostriches or from allen shermans s novelty single "hello muddah hello fadduh " mr wheeldons filigreed ballet sweeps away the expected and finds new luster in ballet moves honoring the contrasts between sunshine and moonlight in a program note to his "polyphonia " mr wheeldon recalls realizing that he was not being "adventurous with my choice of music " lately it just might seem and this program could be said to confirm it that in an attempt to remedy that situation he may have gone too far leaving in the lurch the "romantic composers" the choreographer had previously said he was "settling into " "dance of the hours" was the only ballet in vail not to inspire a standing ovation but it presents key ballet values and it would be unfortunate if mr wheeldons view of "innovation" leaves out the strengths revealed in the more basic elements at ballets heart mr greskovic writes about dance for the journal
