politics &amp economics discarded troop plan gets a second look strategy advocated by general ousted from iraq post is back in vogue baghdad the bush administration removed gen george casey from his job as the top u s commander in iraq earlier this year and effectively made him a scapegoat for the troubled war but with the u s now searching for a post surge strategy for iraq gen caseys core ideas withdrawing sizable numbers of american troops while ramping up efforts to train iraqs security forces are back at the center of iraq policy making after his reassignment senior bush administration officials such as national security adviser stephen hadley pointedly criticized gen caseys handling of iraq in interviews and other public comments mr bush meanwhile began to regularly hail gen david petraeus as the right man for the job with the right strategy for iraq comments widely seen as digs at gen casey the fall and subsequent rebound of gen casey who now serves as the armys chief of staff reflect the shifting politics of the iraq war and the continuing evolution of the administrations iraq policy as a september deadline nears for the bush administration to report on the progress of its current "surge" policy of sending more troops to quell unrest in and around baghdad the administration is growing more confident it can show enough signs of progress to prevent the u s congress from forcing any immediate troop pullback even if there is no immediate retreat from the surge that began earlier this year all sides agree that manpower strains and the armys troop rotation schedule will force commanders to begin withdrawing some personnel early next year that is raising the question of what to do next and is bringing gen caseys ideas back into vogue pentagon officials say gen casey from his new perch back in washington has forged a close relationship with defense secretary robert gates who is working to craft a plan that is very similar to gen caseys to withdraw some u s troops next year while stepping up the training and equipping of iraqi forces white house officials acknowledge that with troop reductions of some kind virtually inevitable next year the emerging thinking is drawing heavily from gen caseys ideas "one of the ironies is that this is where gen casey had wanted to head two years ago " a senior national security official said in an interview gen casey himself continues to make the case that his original plan stands the best chance for long term success in iraq in a series of interviews during a recent fact finding trip to iraq he warned that the u s presence here cant be maintained much longer without damaging the military and further eroding public support for the war "theres an opportunity to build consensus at home around a policy that gradually brings the level of american forces down while handing security responsibility to the iraqis " he said he said the u s could withdraw at least six of the brigades now in the country over the course of the next year that would reduce the u s presence to about troops from which would allow the army to avoid extending deployments to months from the current months without significantly reducing the force level mr bush and gen petraeus want to keep people familiar with gen caseys thinking say he believes the u s presence could within the next few years shrink to seven brigades or about troops a fraction of their current levels gen casey served as the top u s commander in iraq when the administration was pressing to withdraw some u s forces before the midterm elections mr bush mentioned gen caseys name dozens of times in and and regularly said he was leaving key decisions about iraq policy to the general but as security in iraq deteriorated the white house shifted gears and decided instead to send tens of thousands of additional u s troops to iraq to try to tamp down the violence and give the politicians "breathing space" to make headway toward resolving some divisive issues gen casey disagreed publicly arguing that such a move would deepen iraqi dependency on the u s and hinder the development of baghdads own security forces under pressure from the white house gen casey softened his opposition and said he could accept a temporary troop increase but at that point administration officials had lost faith in him in january the white house announced it would make gen petraeus the prime architect of the surge strategy the top u s commander in iraq and move gen casey to the pentagon as a result gen petraeus has emerged as the primary military face of american military strategy his planned testimony before lawmakers next month in which he is to assess the surges successes and failures will likely determine whether the administration can maintain the support of enough republicans and moderate to conservative democrats to stave off calls for a broader change of direction in the war but as gen caseys case suggests the bush administrations preference to make top military commanders its main public advocates for the unpopular war carries some political risks for the officers themselves at the senate confirmation hearings for his army post republican senators derided gen caseys handling of iraq and accused him of offering overly optimistic assessments of conditions in the country "while i do not in any way question your honor your patriotism or your service to our country i do question some of the decisions and judgments youve made over the past years " arizona republican sen john mccain said during the february session ten republicans ultimately voted against gen casey the general still won approval but the margin was the worst for any such nominee since the height of the vietnam war half a year later gen casey is starting to re emerge as the debate moves to fashioning a long term strategy the turnaround began in december with the release of the bipartisan iraq study groups report which incorporated many of gen caseys ideas and has accelerated in recent months as political support for the war has continued to wane today lawmakers of both parties are coalescing around legislation that would implement gen caseys original plan of getting u s forces out of front line combat and refocusing the broader american mission on training iraqis the men in charge of iraq policy mr bush and gen petraeus remain opposed to this approach white house aides said the president believes the surge is having a significant impact in iraq and wants to give the strategy and gen petraeus more time before contemplating any significant troop withdrawals administration officials said the white house will soon unveil a plan to gradually withdraw a modest number of troops but will stop short at least for now of making a wholesale change to the broader u s mission here in his new job gen casey gets frequent reminders of the manpower strains facing the army as a result of the war during a recent lunch here with the top american commander in baghdad maj gen joseph fil several senior commanders warned gen casey that many talented young officers were planning to leave the military because they were worn out by repeated deployments to iraq gen casey said he was finalizing a new incentive program for young officers that would award them either &# time off for graduate school or the assignment of their choice in exchange for remaining in the army but he acknowledged that the exodus was likely to continue unless the army ends its practice of multiple iraq deployments "money grad school its all good " gen casey told the officers "but three or four deployments in eight years outweighs those issues the surge sucked all of the flexibility out of the system "
