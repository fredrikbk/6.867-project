touching the toad off the beaten trek in peru west yerupaja glacier peru we slogged up the relentlessly steep dusty path stepping over mule droppings and averting our eyes from candy wrappers lining the way like autumn leaves our packs were light enough the heavy stuff bending the backs of two mules ahead of us but so far the hike was more something to be endured than enjoyed the landscape was all scrub and dirt not terribly pretty or even very interesting "how " my friend silvio asked "can anyone say they like trekking " then we saw it the view jagged snow covered mountains cut the sky like a sawblade peak after peak rising more than feet into the thin andean air we were looking at the cordillera huayhuash a compact but staggeringly beautiful range of mountains in northern peru just miles or so from one end to the other peru is not a pretty place mostly its dusty piles of dirt decorate every town many of which are built up from little more than mud bricks themselves and most of the countrys scenery is parched and meager the eight hour bus ride from lima to huaraz the main town in the northern andes seems like nothing so much as a drive through the worlds biggest quarry but perus high mountains are something else great towers of ice and snow visions of purity otherworldly the huayhuash is compact enough to walk around in days in recent years trekking usually with guides support staff and mules through the area has become increasingly popular and famous as the setting for joe simpsons epic survival story "touching the void " silvio and i discovered we were unlikely to have the range to ourselves when we boarded a bus from huaraz to the trailhead at the village of llamac and found three other parties headed the same way but silvio and i didnt want to walk around the mountains we wanted to walk through them leaving the crowds and guides below and experiencing the essential isolation of high places so we hired an arriero mule driver and burros to help us bring two weeks worth of supplies to a high camp the first day we walked more than five hours hiking into the valley of laguna jauacocha at feet we didnt see anyone else on the trail that day but at the lake we hit a village of trekkers maybe tents in all that resembled a grateful dead concert "lonely planet scum " silvio called them quechuan shepherds approached us offering to sell us beer or coke we kept walking passing to the far end of the lake beyond a few shepherd huts where we camped in splendid isolation the next day we set off with our arriero alfonso expecting to trek half a day to our next camp at feet after about minutes the alfonso stopped and started unloading the mules "this is as far as the mules can go " he explained silvio and alfonso then heatedly argued in spanish for the next half hour finally alfonso shouldered a load and the three of us spent the next few hours slogging up an absurdly faint track edging along precipitous cliffs up boulders that rolled under foot and through prickly bushes that bit our flesh like ravenous insects we reached the crest of a moraine perched spectacularly across from two of the most amazing peaks in the huayhuash the flinty double headed jirishanca and the massive pyramid of yerupaja the second tallest peak in peru we offered to pay alfonso another days wages to help us carry more loads "im an arriero not a porter " he huffed "my health is worth more than money " that left silvio and me to make another backbreaking carry up to our camp before nightfall the effort was worth it we set up our tent in one of several cleared campsites with rock walls built up to block the wind but the area resembled a ruin more than any sort of active caravansary rusted tin cans from expeditions years ago blended in with the rocks except for their rounded contours most trekkers give this area a wide berth one arriero told us that only two or three teams of climbers even venture onto either side of the range each year we didnt see another person for six days and then it was only a british solo trekker who camped near us for two days and then departed we spent the next three days trying to get close to jirishanca only to realize that the glacier was too hopelessly broken up to make that possible a maze of crevasses big enough to swallow buses the ridges and ramps in between smashed up like ice cubes under a boot up the valley to the south however the glacier was smooth and flat an ocean of frozen water at almost feet above sea level gleaming white in the bright sunshine and surrounded by soaring icy peaks it was impossible not to camp there sunset was a rainbow of warm colors washing over the mountains the distant cordillera blanca glowing softly in the haze at night a full moon bathed the icy basin in silvery light we saw no other tracks there were no birds or insects no sound but wind and the occasional roar of seracs cracking off the peaks and falling in the distance now and then the lights of a plane would slide across the horizon the only evidence we had that there was anyone else left in the world moving camp up to feet we dug into the flank of yerupaja towering above us to a height of feet the next day before dawn we made a half hearted attempt to climb the mountains icy face retreating before sunrise two days later we scaled a wildly corniced ridge across the glacier to climb rasac which is quechua for "toad" and almost feet tall reveling in the fantastic views of the entire range dropping away at our feet we felt like birds we rappelled rasacs crumbly rocky east face but not fast enough getting trapped on a ledge at feet still well above the glacier as night was falling the rock was too loose to afford anchors so we sat shivering on our backpacks without bivouac gear afraid to doze until the cold compelled us to stand and do exercises to stay warm this happened about every half hour for the hours of the long equatorial night at four in the morning we watched as the moon illuminated a massive avalanche tumbling off the face of yerupaja precisely where we had been hours earlier "maybe " i said "trekkings not so bad after all " a few days later we stumbled back into huaraz and made a beeline to a bar where we ordered pisco sours the national cocktail sorry said the bartender were out of ice mr ybarra is a writer in san francisco
