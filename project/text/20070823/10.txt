blowing the whistle on sarbox in the five years since the passage of sarbanes oxley most of the controversy has focused on its costly accounting and auditing burden but its protections to employees who call attention to violations of securities law or accounting fraud have also been the subject of congressional hearings this spring particularly on the question of whether these protections are strong enough sarboxs whistleblower provisions were intended "to prevent recurrences of the enron debacle and similar threats to the nations financial markets" by protecting those who report fraudulent activity that could damage innocent investors that was the intent at least the reality is something else about whistleblowing claims have been filed under sarbox only were determined after federal investigation to have merit and only six of this group have kept their wins after full evidentiary hearings before administrative law judges nevertheless the plaintiffs bar and others have ready answers for this extremely poor batting average critics assert that the day statute of limitation for filing whistleblower claims is too short the burden of proof placed on complaining employees is too high that judges are reading the law too narrowly or even that as one law professor testified the whistleblower provisions have "has failed to protect the vast majority of employees who file a sarbanes oxley claim" because they rarely win none of these criticisms measure up sarbox whistleblowers rarely win because most claimants are using or some might say misusing the law as a club in garden variety workplace disputes the examples are legion minkina v affiliated physicians group for example involved a physician with a health care group who complained that she was terminated after making reports to osha that there was a ventilation problem in her workplace which she believed created a dangerous condition the administrative law judge dismissed ms minkinas case finding that the complaint "had nothing to do with fraud or protection of investors " many other cases dismissed after hearings involved employees who engaged in serious misconduct or poor job performance and then claimed that the "real" reason for termination was their alleged whistleblower activities for example in heinrich v ecolab an administrative law judge found that mr heinrich had been fired for falsifying inspection records not for as he claimed reporting accounting irregularities in townsend v big dog holdings a judge found it was the grievances from employees the company had received about ms townsends behavior and her insubordination to management not her contacts with the sec and other government agencies that justified her discharge on occasion the whistleblower provisions have provided necessary employee protections in kalkunte v dvi financial servs inc an administrative law judge held that a complaint by an in house lawyer that senior management had altered reports that were part of public disclosure statements and improperly commingled funds was found to be covered by sarbox and in collins v beazer homes usa a federal district court judge found that complaints about violations of internal accounting controls were protected under sarbox because they stated a violation of securities laws which require companies to "devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls " in short when a meritorious complaint relates to matters that definitively and specifically implicate accounting or securities fraud or fraud against shareholders a sarbox whistleblower will be protected the last thing that congress should do is make it easier for employees with an axe to grind to use sarbox whistleblower provisions the time and expense associated with defense of even a frivolous claim is huge legal fees in a single case typically run into six figures worse is the reputational damage suffered from a false sarbox allegation that it is "cooking the books " the one two financial punch of legal defense costs and drop in share value precipitated by wholly inappropriate whistleblower cases totally devoid of merit has cost u s companies millions of dollars critics also overlook the simple fact that the statutes whistleblower provisions just may have accomplished its intended purpose since sarbox most public companies have created procedures for the receipt and review of even anonymous complaints of accounting or securities fraud these companies confer great seriousness and gravity to these complaints and more importantly senior management and boards of directors task independent audit committees and or outside investigators to investigate whistleblower claims promptly objectively and thoroughly and they go a long way towards protecting whistleblowers from any retaliation mr delikat is an attorney with orrick herrington &amp sutcliffe and author of "corporate whistleblowing in the sarbanes oxley era" practising law institute
