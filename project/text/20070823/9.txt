nations largest banks as measured by total assets said they each borrowed &# million from the so called discount window it was unclear how much the move would calm tense credit markets which have already shown some signs of settling the move is widely viewed as symbolic since all of the banks borrowing from the central bank can obtain less expensive funds elsewhere but one fed goal is to remove the traditional stigma attached to borrowing from the discount window so that more banks may feel comfortable borrowing historically the discount window has been where banks borrow when theyre

duration of the loans to as long as days from the previous one day limit fed officials then held an unusual conference call with bank executives in which they encouraged banks to tap the window deutsche bank ag borrowed from the discount window the same day it was part of a concerted effort by the fed to restore confidence to credit markets where losses on subprime mortgages have rippled across numerous markets and have made investors reluctant to lend to any but the most creditworthy borrowers fed officials acknowledge banks dont need the money but hope some will lend the money to creditworthy borrowers facing difficulty financing themselves in the current environment while bank executives widely praised the feds actions last week some banks privately expressed reluctance to borrow from the discount window pointing out they can borrow elsewhere at lower rates in recent days new york fed president timothy geithner and other fed representatives took steps to reassure and encourage the banks to borrow from the window although they didnt put direct pressure on them to do so according to people familiar with the situation one factor that provided a powerful incentive for the banks to tap the window the fed granted them a narrowly crafted exemption from a cumbersome rule that constrained the banks ability to use discount window borrowings to finance certain securities purchases by their investment banking units said people familiar with the situation the banks had sought this exemption which was granted by the fed on a temporary basis these people said as a result the domestic banks reversed course yesterday to help with the federal reserves effort to calm markets according to people familiar with the matter bank of america wachovia and j p morgan chase issued a joint statement while citibank issued a separate announcement that alone was unusual banks typically dont disclose that they have gone to the discount window all five banks issued statements saying

plans to do so "were open for business and we have ample funds available from a variety of sources to satisfy all our customers and prospects needs for credit " the bank said in a statement some economists and bankers believe the fed ought to cut the discount rate further perhaps to that would make it equal to the federal funds rate which banks charge on overnight loans to each other they say some banks that want to respond to the feds invitation to borrow are having trouble justifying the move to their shareholders because they can borrow fed funds more cheaply laurence meyer a former fed governor and now vice chairman of macroeconomic advisers llc said a further cut in the discount window rate is a "tool in reserve " if markets deteriorate further before the fed next meets on sept
