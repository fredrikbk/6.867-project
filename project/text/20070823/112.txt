wonder land we have met the enemy again even in these times an august dimmed with miners trapped in utah and china mexicos hurricane and the final body pulled from below the minnesota bridge the story of two new york firemen dying in a dead building was just too much since september when so many died across the street from the deutsche bank building in lower manhattan a great deal of effort has been made to ensure that no more people die in the u s from anything remotely connected to that day nearly six years after we in new york have become used on any given morning to finding additional police on subway platforms as yesterday or seeing fleets of police cars in front of large commercial buildings the purpose is to show presence and deter terror so when it emerged that all the sirens one was hearing last saturday afternoon in manhattan were because the empty building known as liberty street had caught fire and that two firemen had died on the th floor when their bottled air ran out one was dumbstruck then angry this building stands just outside the journals downtown office many of us walk past it and ground zero twice a day if you looked to one side you were staring into vast slabs of concrete and construction in the famous pit look to the other side and you saw the dead utterly useless db building hung seemingly forever in black mesh after awhile what you did on this little stretch of street is never look to the sides just straight ahead because if you looked at the db building youd have to think what it meant that after six years this grim thing was still up now that two men have died trying to put out a crummy fire maybe the time has arrived to squarely face just what the appalling six year presence of the deutsche bank building represents its about new york surely but the inability to get this building down stands as a broader rebuke to a country that has become so comfortable with indulging its countless legal personal political and administrative obsessions that it cannot protect its own people by doing the obvious you surely recall what the commission said about the problems that led to that day and before that the bremer commissions report on terrorism predicting that the u s was at risk for precisely the same reasons an american system engulfed in proceduralism and legalism and loving it thats right loving it our public officials and the attendant factions and community groups are so far gone into their never never lands of crossing "ts" and dotting "is" that they barely know how to bring an issue to resolution in their world its never over process is life the road map to saturdays tragedy may be found on the web site of the lower manhattan development corporation the page titled "the deutsche bank building at liberty street " in a chronological listing of "public documents" from september to november are dates inside of which are uncountable numbers of fact sheets on air monitoring "supplemental investigations" of fireproofing vertical shaft sampling cell system sampling and requests for variance to the horizon there is an advisory committee of four lmdc members four politicians "community representatives" and nine federal state and city agencies they met a lot at the center of this story high tangle of fishing line one finds the hook on which the whole mess has been hanging for six years "contaminants of potential concern" or copcs the most politically paralyzing copc of all needless to say is asbestos lest a fiber of asbestos float from the building and spread cancer panic across lower manhattans streets the one floor at a time demolition required an "abatement and removal" plan whose mind boggling technical and physical details would fill half the first section of this newspaper "all interior non structural building materials will be removed under negative pressure " basically men in space suits were scrubbing virtually every interior surface by hand and dismantling it by hand who could doubt that the human error rate would rise over time under such conditions such as the steel beam that fell and penetrated the roof of the firehouse nearby or indeed this fire abandoned buildings full of the same materials are demolished faster all the time but not this one instead of a demolition plan that struck a balance between controlling the toxicity and getting the job done the process created what is virtually a hermetically sealed environment to demolish floors of junk theyve made the building so "safe" you cant get it down so after six years a fire erupted and two firemen caught in the "matrix" world of liberty st died the details of this public policy morass are no exception in the post world they are the norm the hyper complex requirements and mindset reflected in the public record over liberty st mirror the endless debate and litigation weve also layered into efforts to surveil and prosecute terrorists yes partisanship plays its part but intellectual hubris and self regard plays a larger part weve got a society thats smarter than ever but maybe too smart for its own good whether the problem before us is national security the environment or protecting baby we compulsively drive the system now to develop the most exquisite complex procedures which allow us to think ourselves both perfectly safe and ethically perfect procedural perfectionism has been raised to religious status normal people now think like lawyers bureaucrats and administrators rather than as in the techworld where the culture values fast mid course corrections and can do one may ask the political and commercial forces that produced stasis for liberty st may outwardly mourn the deaths but would any of them pull back from their obsessions now to get the building down fast i doubt it we have met the enemy and he is still us see related letter "letters to the editor safety rules not at fault in fire near ground zero" wsj aug
