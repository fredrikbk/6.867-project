the daily fix after trembley gets new deal his orioles get annihilated online edition congratulations on your new contract dave trembley since mr trembley became the baltimore orioles interim manager in june the club had posted a record good enough for mr trembley to be given the job for keeps through the season so the club celebrated by making history in the first game of a doubleheader yesterday against the texas rangers they took a lead then gave up unanswered runs out of town scoreboards in some ballparks around the countries couldnt register the final score because their run totals stop at the last time a team in major u s pro sports lost was nov when the nfls ravens who play their home games across the parking lot from the orioles were shellacked by the jacksonville jaguars by that score as were the new york jets by the carolina panthers on that same day the last time a baseball team scored or more came years ago when the chicago cubs were known as the colts and louisville had a major league team more wacky stats the rangers scored at least five runs in each of four different innings four orioles pitchers sustained all the damage each one giving up at least six runs all of them earned as baltimore committed just one error brian burress era increased by nearly a run rob bells by nearly two and paul shueys by nearly three the rangers no and hitters jarrod saltalamacchia and ramon vazquez had nearly identical line scores each had four hits in six at bats seven rbis one walk and one strikeout before the game the orioles were the anti diamondbacks as noted in yesterdays fix arizona leads its division despite being outscored on the season the orioles had a run differential of + before yesterday yet were seven games under "that will mess up a teams run differential " arizona manager bob melvin remarked upon hearing the orioles score before the game according to sportslines scott miller the dallas morning news compiles other fun numbers about the game including the number "save for wes littleton who earned the quirky save for pitching the final three innings after coming in with a lead it wasnt the oddest save by a ranger against baltimore joaquin benoit had a seven inning save the longest in major league history by pitching seven innings on sept " orioles fans were amused eventually "camden yards was about two thirds empty when the first game started and pretty quiet even when the home team jumped out to a lead by the bottom of the third inning " childs walker and jeff zrebiec write in the baltimore sun "but more and more fans arrived just as the game was slipping out of the orioles control fans started to get restless and boo the home team during the rangers nine run sixth inning when the inning finally ended the orioles received a standing ovation the sarcastic applause continued when the rangers scored runs in the last two innings fans behind the orioles dugout and on the flag court where the final home run landed were giving each other high fives " oh and the rangers went on to win the second game of the doubleheader too this time the score was just slackers baltimore sun columnist david steele says the fans good humor is a good sign that the duo of mr trembley and chief operating officer andy macphail has made inroads "trembley is no marquee name " mr steele writes "hes just a manager who has changed the culture and fortunes of a franchise whose fans were on the verge of full scale revolt nine weeks ago imagine if this team had lost during the end of the sam perlozzo regime the national guard would have to be called instead the crowd last night got in on the joke and gave ramon vazquez who hit the final home run a standing ovation then a half hour later cheerfully welcomed the orioles back out for the nightcap credit some of that to the goodwill trembley macphail and the players have banked the past two months " after his tough road to a big league managing gig might not seem like much to mr trembley "managing navajoa in the mexican pacific league trembley received from his owner a tiny volkswagen with writing that looked like advertising on the side " thomas boswell writes in the washington post " just going down the road people would throw vegetables and apples at me i got hit in the head with a tomato always after we lost it seemed like said trembley who went to his boss after his tires were slashed he told me "those arent ads on the side of your car it says this car is driven by the manager of navajoa " " brandon webbs scoreless innings streak is over at the longest in years since orel hershiser set the record with but the reigning nl cy young winners domination of hitters continues as does his deadly sinker "during the streak webbs sinker already regarded with johan santanas changeup as a contender for baseballs best pitch took on a lifelike quality " jeff passan writes on yahoo sports "it might as well pay social security taxes the way hitters from florida san diego the los angeles dodgers washington and atlanta referred to it as if it were the culprit of their maladies and not the man who threw it " with england struggling to secure a place in the euro cup next year an exhibition loss yesterday to germany took on added significance the english presss sorrowful conclusion is that england looks too old and too slow to compete against the continents best soccer teams the guardians rob smyth uses an anatomical analogy to declare unfit the teams goalkeeping and forward corps "english football is suffering from a major spinal disorder " mr smyth writes "the vertebral column is healthy in the middle with the likes of rio ferdinand owen hargreaves and steven gerrard reinforcing the thoracic and lumber spines but unless every part of the spine is in full working order it is impossible to function properly the top and bottom the cervical and the pelvic spine are damaged almost beyond repair " the independents james lawton questions coach steve mcclarens decision to stick with david beckham the new los angeles galaxy midfielder for all minutes of the match "even beckhams fabled facility with a dead ball seemed to have deserted him on his flight from california for his th cap " mr lawton writes "a more brutal audience than adoring wembley might have speculated that the man from hollywood boulevard was possibly more of a contender for the long goodbye than the big hello but then it wasnt as though beckham was especially lonely in his struggle to make the headlines to help his pursuit of a century of caps and make some sense of mcclarens decision to re establish the beckham circus " venezuelas mens basketball team ranks st in the world behind such stalwarts as turkey angola and nigeria so team usas rout of venezuela yesterday was less noteworthy than a scrimmage by the americans against their younger nba counterparts on saturday the youngsters won and espn coms chris sheridan was there taking notes "it was a comedy of errors really with the seniors getting beat on the boards leaving their feet with no idea whether they planned to pass or shoot " mr sheridan writes "they showed no alacrity in attacking a tight zone defense in which an extra defender stationed right in the middle of the paint clogged up everything and denied all the usual drive and kick opportunities that the american players take for granted that scene played out last saturday afternoon at team usas training camp illustrating just how different things can be when basketball is played under international rules " tip of the fix cap
