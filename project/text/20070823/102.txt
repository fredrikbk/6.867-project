the evening wrap a fracturing iraq online edition a u s intelligence report on iraq recounted the sectarian rifts and terrorist activities destabilizing the country but also highlighted schisms among shiite groups an unwelcome development as washington looks for signs of political progress in no great surprise the latest national intelligence estimate released thursday afternoon said iraqs government will likely become more precarious over the next six months to a year the report which represents the collaborative assessment of all u s intelligence agencies including the cia the defense intelligence agency and the intelligence organization of each branch of the military also concludes that the sharp rise in violence that preceded the influx of more troops into baghdad "has been checked for now and overall attack levels across iraq have fallen during seven of the last nine weeks " the report goes on to say violence remains high and sectarian rifts deep and while a relatively new alliance between sunni tribes some insurgent elements iraqi military forces and the u s has tamped down violence from al qaeda in iraq the jihadist group "retains the ability to conduct high profile attacks " most of these problems are well known but one newer wrinkle that the report highlighted was the threat to prime minister nouri al malikis rickety coalition from other shiite political actors such as the unified iraqi alliance grand ayatollah sistani and those linked to radical cleric moqtada al sadr the specter of shiite on shiite violence has already surfaced in southern iraq where a british pullback has been followed by fighting among shiite groups over valuable oil resources "divisions between maliki and the sadrists have increased and shia factions have explored alternative coalitions aimed at constraining mr maliki " the report comes after president bush yesterday re affirmed his support for mr maliki and his government in a speech to a veterans of foreign wars convention in kansas city mo the reassurances followed a candid expression of impatience with mr maliki earlier in the week when u s ambassador to iraq ryan crocker said progress on national issues had been "extremely disappointing and frustrating to all concerned " the next in a parade of reports that are supposed to help washington develop a clear consensus on iraq is due next month when gen david petraeus the top u s commander in iraq and mr crocker will testify in congress on the progress of the current troop buildup known as the surge the bush administration has sought to play down the importance of a white house report on the surge that will be released alongside the testimony but some lawmakers say its conclusions will help congress determine whether to allow the troop surge to continue into some members of congress arent waiting for the testimony following the release of the national intelligence estimate today influential republican sen john warner of virginia said the president should start pulling troops out by christmas to impress upon mr maliki that the u s commitment there isnt open ended "we simply cannot as a nation stand and continue to put our troops at continuous risk of loss of life and limb without beginning to take some decisive action " said mr warner who visited iraq this month meanwhile the relentless bloodshed continued in iraq with gunmen storming a sunni village east of baqouba and killing a community leader who had led residents in an uprising against al qaeda the attack wounded people including four other members of the family separately in a shiite town people died and were wounded when insurgents attacked the village the villagers killed attackers also the u s military reported that a soldier was killed and four
