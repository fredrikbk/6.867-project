fda approves antipsychotic drug for teens risperdals clearance likely to fan debate over safety which symptoms merit use the food and drug administration approved expanding use of johnson &amp johnsons antipsychotic drug risperdal to include adolescents suffering from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder a move likely to heighten the already fierce debate over pediatric prescriptions of such powerful drugs some doctors are concerned about the safety of treating children whose bodies are still growing with risperdal and similar medications they point out that the fdas decision is based on short term studies risperdal and competing drugs have previously been tied to serious side effects including increased blood sugar a potential precursor to diabetes "we definitely need to have longer term followup data to learn the full extent of the side effect liabilities " said jeffrey lieberman chairman of the psychiatry department at columbia university in new york his department gets research funding from drug companies for at least some patients the side effects arent worth it after year old amber riskey was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed risperdal about two years ago she gained pounds in three months and felt nauseated and tired she says repeatedly she asked her doctor to take her off the drug but the doctor said the side effects would diminish eventually a different doctor switched her diagnosis and stopped prescribing risperdal she says she had trouble losing the weight "no one should have to be put through that kind of misery no matter how bad the disorder they have is affecting them " says miss riskey a high school student from west allis wis the fda approval which is limited to schizophrenic youngsters to years old and short term treatment of bipolar patients who are to also comes as experts continue to disagree over what symptoms justify prescribing antipsychotics to teens and children risperdal is the first of the newer generation antipsychotic drugs known as "atypical" to win fda approval for those conditions in young people it was already sanctioned for irritability in pediatric patients with autism the agencys decision allows the company to market its product for the newly accepted uses it is also likely to encourage physicians and insurance companies to opt for risperdal over competing treatments that havent yet won the fdas nod other companies including eli lilly &amp co maker of zyprexa and bristol myers squibb co which sells abilify have applied for the agencys endorsement in some similar conditions doctors are allowed to prescribe marketed drugs for any use they wish even if it isnt specifically approved by the fda and the use of the antipsychotics in young people is already growing rapidly overall the drugs have roughly &# billion in yearly sales with risperdal ringing up &# billion last year the number of doctor visits by patients years and younger that included an antipsychotic prescription grew to an estimated million in from about in according to an analysis published last year in the archives of general psychiatry most of the antipsychotics prescribed were the atypicals some experts believe that prescribing risperdal for severe psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents is less risky than letting the disorders go untreated "the hope is that you catch this disease early enough and give them medication so that the brain alters itself in a beneficial way " says roy boorady clinical coordinator of the psychopharmacology service at the new york university child study center to reduce the risk of side effects dr boorady says patients on risperdal should have their diet and weight gain closely monitored and have their dosage or medication adjusted if needed in adults risperdal is approved for schizophrenia and bipolar mania it is believed to be used for other things including in older patients suffering from dementia though there is a warning on the label that elderly patients with dementia related psychosis who are treated with atypical antipsychotics are at an increased risk of death the fdas new risperdal approval was based on three studies done by j&amp j in schizophrenia the two clinical trials involved a total of patients and lasted six and eight weeks the study in patients with bipolar disorder included young people and went for three weeks some patients were tracked for longer periods the fda and the company said the side effects were similar to those in adults j&amp j officials said about of the young patients gained more weight than would have been expected from normal growth alone the amount leveled off at around four kilograms after about three to four months the company said participants in the studies didnt newly develop high blood sugar the company said a different side effect an elevation of the hormone known as prolactin was detected in more than of the study participants j&amp j said prolactin is tied to lactation and a small share of all the patients less than developed breast milk j&amp j said vivek kusumakar head of j&amp js world wide risperdal development said risperdal was for treating "very serious and debilitating conditions physicians should carefully assess the benefit risk on a child by child basis " the company is doing longer term pediatric research the already completed studies also wont resolve a broader debate over what symptoms merit use of the antipsychotic drugs and whether they are being prescribed to patients for whom their benefits are unclear even in adults a major study released in raised questions about whether the newer generation treatments are better than older cheaper drugs in young people various problems including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder depression and more serious psychiatric conditions can be difficult to separate out and properly diagnose specialists have disagreed in particular over what defines bipolar disorder in a child bipolar adults cycle between manic euphoric highs and crushing depressive lows but the condition isnt always clear cut in children elizabeth bernstein contributed to this article
