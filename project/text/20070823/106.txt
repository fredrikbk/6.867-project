the war of words heats up over taiwans bid for u n membership i am writing to protest your editorial "king of the u n " review &amp outlook aug which lodged an unjustified accusation against u n secretary general ban ki moons rejection of taiwan president chen shui bians letter regarding "application for u n membership " your editorial questioned the position that taiwan is a part of china a position that is universally held by the international community and made irresponsible comments on the u n members decision to reject taiwans participation in an international organization of sovereign states the contents of this editorial contravene the one china policy of the u s government and the principles enshrined in the three sino u s joint communiques and interfere in chinas internal affairs the chinese people are gravely concerned and firmly opposed to this the u n general assembly adopted resolution in expelling the representative of the taiwan authorities who claimed to represent the whole china and all its associated institutions and restoring the legal seat of the representative of the peoples republic of china in the u n this resolution confirmed that the government of the peoples republic of china is the sole legal government representing the whole china and embodied the common will of the international community the u n secretariats rejection and return of the letter from the taiwan authorities on "application for u n membership" was totally right and unimpeachable as an inalienable part of the chinese territory taiwan does not qualify for the u n an international organization composed of sovereign countries this is the universally held position by the vast majority of the countries in the world seeking "u n membership under the name taiwan" is a secessionist attempt of the chen shui bian authorities it has been and will continue to be resolutely rejected and firmly condemned by the international community and will never have a chance to succeed it is unwise and irresponsible for the wall street journal to turn a blind eye to the relevant international consensus and openly boost the arrogance of the chen shui bian authorities in carrying out secessionist activities the chinese side urges the wall street journal to honor the repeated commitment of the u s government to adhere to the one china policy abide by the three joint communiques and oppose "taiwan independence " wang baodong press counselor and spokesperson embassy of china to the u s three cheers for the bold action taken in criticizing secretary general ban ki moons arbitrary mistreatment of taiwans recent u n application attempt i was shocked to learn that mr ban unilaterally returned the letter of membership application written by taiwan president chen shui bian as the head of the u n secretariat mr ban does not have the authority to unilaterally maintain that taiwan is part of china taiwans application should be forwarded to the general assembly and put on the agenda for free deliberation taiwan is entitled in every respect to have the opportunity to join the world body that is the u n charles lee director press division taipei economic and cultural office chicago your editorial makes an excellent point secretary general ban ki moons invoking resolution as the reason for his decision doesnt excuse him from following the rules of the organization he heads the larger issue is how long will the folly of excluding taiwan go on taiwans prominence in the global economy and its contributions to world wide health care make its continued exclusion from the u n and the world health organization seem more unjustified every day chinas insistence that taiwan is under its jurisdiction is at odds with the facts and tantamount to an ostrich sticking its head in the sand taiwan is an important player on the world stage and should have a say in global organizations no amount of obfuscation or denial can change that fact pam perry atlanta in chiang kai sheks rejection of a proposal for dual representation of the republic of china and the peoples republic of china at the u n led to resolution which expelled "the representatives of chiang kai shek" from the general assembly not those of the republic of china nor of taiwan such careful wording was intended to keep open the possibility of taiwans incorporation into the u n consequentially resolution does not support secretary general bans outright rejection of taiwans application for membership mr ban has ignored his responsibility to uphold the u n s core values of peace and equality between nations by failing to take advantage of an opportunity to pursue the peaceful resolution of a dispute that has lasted for over half a century shiun yong lee middlesex united kingdom unfortunately being appointed secretary general of the u n convinces even the most inept that the world is hanging on their every word despite the flawed reputation of that "august body " it is shameful how recent appointees have played politics favoring their native country while blocking any actions that might endanger their position at the u n certainly the secretariat has not been honored by such leaders as kurt waldheim boutros boutros ghali and kofi annan all with their own agenda as they have plundered the assets of the u n and tarnished its dubious reputation nelson marans silver spring md it is time for the international community to wake up and figure out some way whereby taiwan can participate in the u n the who and other institutions if only as a "non state" actor or an "observer " to do otherwise makes a mockery of international cooperation and undermines the efficacy of the u n the who and all related organizations dennis v hickey
