car trouble german regulator roils auto emissions debate friedrich touts low tech over alternative fuels a tiff over vws golf last year axel friedrich one of europes top environmental regulators hired a group of university engineers to hunt for ways to cut carbon dioxide emissions from volkswagen ags best selling model the golf without undermining safety or performance at a hearing of european union regulators last month mr friedrich head of the transport department at germanys federal environmental agency reported that the team had cut emissions by while keeping the golfs horsepower intact their trick was to reduce the cars weight by substituting a variety of commonly available parts including some from volkswagens own parts bin "we all know what to do " he says "its nothing magic " but volkswagen europes biggest car maker was far from pleased the companys top representative to the eu interrupted the hearing to complain that mr friedrich hadnt adequately consulted the company which had cooperated with the researchers "there is a big difference between laboratory cars and mass produced cars " volkswagen said in a written statement the company complains that some of the changes championed by mr friedrich such as installing lightweight front seats similar to those used in race cars would make it harder to get into the car and thus less appealing to consumers other alterations could make the car too expensive for some buyers vw groused mr friedrich a longtime gadfly of the auto industry has staked out a controversial position on a question that has risen in importance for nations around the world whats the best way to boost vehicle fuel efficiency to the consternation of auto makers and some environmentalists mr friedrich argues that industry and government leaders are plowing too much time and money into potentially blockbuster alternative technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells what they should be doing he argues is working harder to make vehicles with internal combustion engines more efficient "we need solutions for the next years not just dreams " mr friedrich says in many nations concerns about climate change and energy security are driving the debate spurred along by the kyoto protocol a global treaty intended to cap emissions eu regulators are drafting new rules aimed at slashing automobile emissions of co the gas widely blamed for global warming in the u s a similar debate is raging over how much time auto makers need to boost fuel economy and whether setting stringent targets will compromise safety by encouraging the car makers to use lighter materials in the u s which hasnt ratified the kyoto protocol auto makers arent under as much pressure to reduce co emissions as they are in europe the question of how best to boost fuel economy is a particularly emotional one in germany home to both a powerful environmental movement and to an auto industry that makes some of the worlds sportiest cars one out of seven german jobs depends on the auto industry the countrys long love affair with horsepower is apparent in its autobahn highway system which has no upper speed limit along many stretches some german auto executives worry that carbon dioxide regulations being drafted by eu officials could put their companies at a disadvantage to french and italian car makers whose product lines are skewed toward small vehicles "this is a business war in europe " says porsche ag chief executive wendelin wiedeking recently the auto industry has talked up the potential of battery powered cars such as the chevrolet volt a prototype from general motors corp to reduce fossil fuel consumption the industry is also working on vehicles that run on hydrogen fuel cells and on crop based fuels such as ethanol but battery powered cars are years away from mass production and fuel cell cars must surmount enormous practical hurdles such as the establishment of a network of hydrogen filling stations producing more crop based fuels often involves using farmland that might otherwise be used to grow food many measures that mr friedrich advocates to boost fuel economy arent exactly radical one is to outfit cars with tires that offer less resistance when rolling a study last year by the national academy of sciences in the u s estimated that up to two billion gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel could be saved each year in the u s equivalent to taking four million cars and light trucks off the road by reducing the rolling resistance of automobile tires by some have expressed concern that reducing a tires rolling resistance can weaken its traction compromising safety the national academy of sciences study however reported that the safety consequences of such changes "are probably undetectable " other fuel saving measures embraced by mr friedrich have already proved to be a tough sell to consumers "stop start" systems shut down a cars motor when the vehicle stops and revive it when a driver pushes on the accelerator volkswagen and toyota motor corp dropped that feature from earlier european models some customers complained about the extra cost while others found the feature disconcerting industry officials say "dr friedrich is right that there are many measures to reduce co emissions and they arent really new " says markus espig who led the team hired by mr friedrichs agency to work on the golf "but vw has to build cars they can sell and they have to consider what the consumer wants a high degree of safety and comfort " mr friedrich years old is a veteran of clashes between germanys environmentalists and car makers a year after joining the federal environmental agency in he so irritated car makers by championing lead free gasoline that they lobbied the government to shift him to a job dealing with asylum seekers his employment contract protected him from such a move in when current german chancellor angela merkel was the environment minister one of her deputies drew up a list of environmental officials considered too outspoken who were to be prohibited from speaking in public mr friedrich who had irritated both car makers and politicians was the first name on the list "i would have felt insulted if my name had been left out " he says after the list leaked to the media ms merkel abolished the plan a spokesman for the chancellor declined to comment germanys environmental agency is the biggest in europe and its extensive research capability has extended its influence beyond the continent when california regulators wanted guidance years ago on how to slash soot particles from commercial diesel engines they consulted mr friedrich "hes been a constant source of advice and knowledge " says alan lloyd former chairman of californias air resources board last year mr friedrichs agency completed a study of an idea that has long fascinated car makers using hydrogen to propel vehicles either by turning it into liquid engine fuel or by combining it with oxygen in tiny electromechanical devices known as fuel cells the fuel cells generate electricity causing vehicles to emit only water vapor because hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and using it to power cars would be so clean proponents often describe it as the holy grail of alternative fuels in germany its backers have lobbied the government to boost funding for fuel cell technology they argue that public support is needed to help german car makers compete with japanese rivals such as toyota motor corp and honda motor co which are further along in developing and marketing hybrid vehicles that run on both gasoline and electricity "it would be a shame if germany were to sleep through a trend in hydrogen technology the way we slept through hybrids " says wolfgang reitzle a former bmw executive who is now ceo of linde ag the worlds largest producer of industrial gases mr friedrich used to be a fan of fuel cells he wrote a paper about the principle when he was a university student but a research project by his agency two decades ago made him a skeptic and turned him in the direction of tweaking the design of cars powered by traditional engines the problem he says is that pure hydrogen is rare the gas has to be isolated compressed transported and stored which requires lots of energy from other sources such as fossil fuels the result mr friedrich contends is that shifting to hydrogen fuel cells would wind up reducing net co emissions by less than if auto makers simply redesigned cars so that they use gasoline and diesel more efficiently in a study completed last year mr friedrichs agency found that hydrogen fuel cells would be an effective way for germany to cut fossil fuel use only if the country had an enormous amount of solar power on tap to make the hydrogen building such solar power capacity he argues would take decades "fuel cells are just a gimmick to avoid regulation " mr friedrich says arguing that the auto industry is promising high tech answers over the long term to reduce pressure to improve fuel efficiency now hydrogen supporters acknowledge it will take years to build a renewable electricity supply sufficient to produce the hydrogen needed to power germanys vehicle fleet but they note that efforts are under way on that front and car makers they say are making progress on fuel cell cars honda says it expects to market a new model in limited numbers next year auto companies are not developing fuel cells "as a gimmick " says mr lloyd the former california regulator "were not going to change things overnight but we have to go to electric drive including cars powered by batteries or fuel cells or a combination thereof to foreclose on these options when our needs are so dire would be a mistake " mr friedrich advocates using some of the money currently allocated to revolutionary ideas like fuel cells on improving conventional vehicles to bolster his case he hired engineers at the institute for automotive engineering at rwth university in aachen germany the alma mater of porsches mr wiedeking and other german auto executives he directed them to experiment on a gasoline fueled vw golf the engineers goal was to reduce weight and wind drag without compromising safety or performance they replaced the side mirrors an aerodynamic hindrance with tiny cameras that show on a dashboard screen whats happening behind the car they changed to more efficient gear ratios and added a weight saving carbon engine hood a stop start engine mechanism and speedometer lights that tell the driver the most efficient time to shift gear so far the team has cut the test vehicles co emissions from grams per kilometer the average for german cars sold in to grams the engineers aim to eventually reduce the golfs emissions to grams the eus tentative target for new cars sold in the region by at a hearing in brussels in july the eus policy making arm the european commission sought advice on reaching its emission target european car makers argued for extending the eu timetable saying it would be too costly to meet they urged the commission to put more emphasis on better traffic management testifying in response mr friedrich showed slides of his modified golf "there is no need to develop new vehicles " he insisted "the adjustment can be made on existing cars " hermann meyer head of volkswagens brussels office and its chief representative at the eu stood up to respond "this was not a presentation which has the backing of volkswagen " he said mr friedrich hadnt consulted vw enough he complained adding that prototypes needed prolonged testing before firm conclusions could be drawn the lightweight seats and hood of the modified golf might not be as neutral to the cars safety as mr friedrich claimed mr meyer said "has he done a crash test to verify this if he has not made a crash test he cannot say this " mr friedrich wasnt allowed to respond the commission official running the hearing told the two men to resolve their "tiff" outside engineers who have worked on mr friedrichs golf contend that most of the changes wouldnt compromise safety vw officials point to other problems with the prototype the lightweight front passenger seat doesnt fold forward forcing rear passengers to enter on the drivers side its carbon hood normally seen in high end sports cars is expensive replacing side mirrors with cameras would require amending eu safety regulations a potentially time consuming process the university engineers have offered no estimate for the cost of mass producing such a vehicle since the hearing volkswagen has announced it will introduce a diesel version of the golf that emits less carbon dioxide than mr friedrichs car like mr friedrichs prototype the new diesel version has low rolling resistance tires and more efficient gear ratios it uses a lower chassis which improves its aerodynamics but could make for a bumpier ride with a base price of euros or &# it will be only euros more than a standard diesel golf mr friedrich says that with better marketing and reasonable prices car makers could persuade more customers to choose "green" cars his critics say he tends to overlook the fact that many europeans want horsepower as well as comfort and safety features that add weight but with emissions regulations looming german car makers have begun employing some of the same measures advocated by mr friedrich a new diesel version of bmws series launched earlier this year with lower resistance tires and a gearshift indicator emits less co than its predecessor and costs nearly the same at the frankfurt auto show next month the mercedes benz unit of daimlerchrysler ag is expected to announce it will outfit more of its cars with stop start systems similar to the one in mr friedrichs golf
