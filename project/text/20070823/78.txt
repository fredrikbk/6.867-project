decided to reopen a tender for the countrys largest copper mine rtb bor following lobbying from russian metals tycoon oleg deripaska and president vladimir putin according to people familiar with the matter that would mark a change for russian investors who complain they havent been welcome in serbia since the downfall of former president slobodan milosevic in russia ranks th among foreign investors in serbia according to government figures serbian officials deny any link between russian support for belgrades position on kosovo and the coming privatizations expected to be completed over the next year and a half "thats just nonsense there is no trade off " said deputy prime minister bozidar djelic in an interview adding that cash rich russian companies are investing aggressively around the globe but mr djelic who heads a recently formed working group to attract russian investment to serbia also acknowledged a change in atmosphere "somehow the juiciest assets end up in russian hands " said jonathan eyal a balkan specialist and director of international security studies at the royal united services institute in london "it is a strategy to bind serbia again to russia " he warned that such a trend could damage serbias efforts to join the european union eu officials havent echoed that but they have said a failure to settle kosovos status would damage serbias membership prospects russia last month blocked u s led efforts at the united nations security council to secure global backing for a plan to grant kosovo "managed independence " the province which serbs consider their historical and religious homeland has been under u n administration since a north atlantic treaty organization air campaign forced serbian troops out to end the ethnic cleansing of kosovos roughly ethnic albanian population the u n agreed to extend until dec talks aimed at persuading serbia and the kosovar albanians to agree on a status for the province serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica discussed plans for kosovo with mr putin in june at an investment forum in st petersburg "i am staying here to discuss and to see how to increase russian economic presence in the serb economy " mr kostunica said at a joint appearance with mr putin while also expressing appreciation for russias stance on kosovo in july mr kostunicas serbian democratic party signed a cooperation agreement with united russia the main pro kremlin party in the russian parliament last month mr deripaska owner of russian metals group basic element met with messrs kostunica and djelic in belgrade to discuss investment including the sale of copper mine rtb bor mr deripaska was disqualified from a march tender for the copper company after failing to meet the minimum bid when the winner cuprom romania failed to meet its &# million commitment citing labor union protests in april the government initially indicated it would sell to the second place bidder a consortium led by serbian businessman zoran drakulic deputy prime minister djelic confirmed that the government now plans a fresh tender "we will be bidding weve re evaluated the assets and we can now put a much better offer on the table " said geoffrey cowley chief executive of smr the mining division of basic element adding that he expects the tender process to be wrapped up by the end of the year mr drakulic declined to comment mr deripaska has more than a russian passport to offer in the meeting with serbias leaders he also discussed the possibility of serbian companies getting work to build facilities for the winter olympics in sochi russia according to mr cowley who was at the meeting mr deripaska has a contract to rebuild sochis airport and to build the olympic village at an estimated cost of &# billion to &# billion "the big russian groups have just come of age they want fair access to deals " said mr djelic adding that they wont get any special consideration "we know there have been some countries discriminating against them but that will not happen in serbia " fears that serbia will make a strategic choice of russia over the eu or hand over key industries based on ties to kosovo or ethnic slav identity are misguided says balkan historian misha glenny a long history of half hearted russian commitments in the balkans has left serbs too skeptical for that few serbs believe their long term future is with russia several borders away rather than with the eu privately russian businessmen say the same and remain cautious about their prospects in the country russian support for serbias position on kosovo meantime isnt that risky for moscow politically even though it runs counter to the position of the u s mr glenny says russias true interest in the region concerns energy "they have effectively been building up their interest in the energy infrastructure of southeastern europe where they now control of all the pipelines much of the oil and now are even getting into nuclear energy " mr glenny says russias goal analysts say is to build a new southern energy corridor to bring russian oil and natural gas to market in europe bypassing troublesome transit neighbors ukraine and belarus which lie to the north of serbia at the same time large new russian pipelines help undermine the financial viability of the eus nabucco gas pipeline project which would bring gas from the caspian sea region and iran bypassing russia lukoil owns two oil refineries and more than gasoline stations in europe the majority in eastern europe and the balkans including serbia a spokesman for lukoil declined to comment on the tender for nis but he described the region as strategically vital for the russian oil major as it seeks the refinery and transport capacity to sell high value refined gasoline direct to consumers in europe "we started with the former soviet countries like ukraine and moldova now we are moving to the former socialist countries " where old ties remain and asset prices are affordable the spokesman said
