guilt by contact you know somethings fishy when senator chris dodd is casting himself as the champion of a republican run securities and exchange commission the senate banking committee chairman wrote to the bush administration last week warning it not to take a position different from its own sec in the stoneridge dispute thats the looming supreme court case which will test whether bystanders can be sued for secondary liability in securities class actions taking a position contrary to the sec mr dodd said would "compound the damage already caused to the investing public by the failure to advocate the views of the commission " cue the violins mr dodds argument is pretty rich considering that the usual congressional line is that the sec is an "independent" agency and in any case the commissions views have already made it to the court an amicus brief filed by democrats john conyers and barney frank made ample use of the secs arguments as well as citing the testimony of chairman chris cox whats going on in stoneridge is an attempt to allow the tort equivalent of guilt by association the case involves whether the liability for an accounting fraud at charter communications a cable company can be extended to implicate some of charters deep pocketed suppliers including motorola and scientific atlanta if the stoneridge claim is validated by the supreme court any entity that did business with an alleged culprit could also be subject to a damages lawsuit in a complex marketplace its hard to say where this legal contagion would end the trial bar is keen on winning this new jackpot and a cynic might suspect this has something to do with the intervention of these high powered congressional democrats on behalf of their campaign donors happily the bush administration has reserved the right to make policy for itself and sent u s solicitor general paul clement to argue a justice department position that contradicts the sec justice argues in its brief that a judgment for the plaintiffs would expose many new corners of the economy to potentially crippling lawsuits and that "such a radical expansion of liability is a task for congress not the courts " also supporting the defendants is a brief by former sec officials of both parties including three former chairmen and former sec commissioners along with a dozen leading academics they argue the precedent would create confusion and reduce transparency thereby raising costs for companies doing business in the u s the cost of litigation to u s capital markets is already supposedly a serious concern to new york democrats chuck schumer and eliot spitzer in an unusual step the new york stock exchange and the nasdaq also filed an amicus brief last week cautioning that the increased liability might "have the perverse effect of decreasing the volume of securities business subject to u s laws as companies seek to raise capital through public listings abroad " these high powered friend of the court briefs show the broad concern that a bad outcome in stoneridge represents a clear and present danger to american business and investors the secs intervention was misguided and we hope the supreme court appreciates the legal and economic stakes
