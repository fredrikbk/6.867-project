capital crisis tests fed chairmans toolbox think for a moment of bearded bookish ben bernanke as the chief mechanic looking under the hood of the u s economy his problem hes got tools designed for an early th century model t ford to fix a st century computer controlled hybrid the federal reserve was created in and equipped to prevent and respond to banking panics when banks need cash and cant sell their assets or borrow against them because markets are panicked the fed lends freely to banks with good collateral but the fed chairmans challenge is that bank finances arent todays primary problem banks are flush but are reluctant to lend at a time when everyone else with money is also uneasy about lending nonetheless mr bernanke and his monetary mechanics are stuck using era tools designed for a bank centric financial system to repair a era market centric financial system think of the nations economy as an automobile that requires gasoline for power loans to businesses and consumers and oil for lubrication short term credit among financial players the immediate problem isnt gasoline banks are strong and corporate coffers are full of cash to invest the problem is lubrication countrywide financial makes mortgages and then sells most of them to investors within weeks but it needs short term financing for that interval it relied on short term ious known as commercial paper but is having trouble selling that paper now the traditional role for banks is judging how likely a borrower is to pay back a loan banks take deposits from the rest of us and lend the money at a profit to borrowers they deem worthy government deposit insurance protects the depositors money government supervision makes sure the banks are prudent government insists they have a set amount of capital that isnt the way the economic engine works today banks still make lots of loans and mortgages but they dont hold them on their books instead they turn them into securities sold all over the world to funds conduits off balance sheet units of third tier german banks and others who in essence take the risks that banks used to take why tougher capital requirements encouraged banks to keep fewer risks on their books and financial engineers invented new ways to spread those risks around instead of making mortgages these st century outfits buy complex packages of mortgages or portions of mortgages or financial instruments based on mortgages instead of taking deposits they borrow money from their friends in financial markets with no government capital requirements to limit their leverage they borrow a lot so even small movements in prices can force distress sales and make things worse suddenly financial markets are unfriendly markets and lenders are unsure of the value of the complex opaque securities these outfits hold and need to sell or use as collateral of course hardly anyone was ever certain what those securities were worth buyers relied foolishly its now clear on the ratings of standard &amp poors and moodys investors service the situation is in some ways similar to the u s savings and loan crisis of the s without the deposit insurance that made it so easy for s&amp ls to make no lose stupid bets and without the obvious government response of paying off depositors selling assets at a loss and sticking taxpayers with the difference "this system has never been stress tested until now " says economist richard clarida of columbia university and pacific investment management co the west coast money manager mr bernankes first gambit was to pump money into very short term money markets in response to an unwelcome tendency of banks to hoard reserves and push up interest rates when the engine started to stall he tried other targeted tools at the feds disposal to encourage banks to lend more readily to financial customers the fed sweetened the terms for lending directly to banks at its discount window the message to banks "be open to lending against all this suddenly unappealing mortgage tainted collateral in a pinch you can always give the paper to the fed " then mr bernanke and his point man on wall street new york federal reserve bank president timothy geithner turned to their powers of persuasion which paid off yesterday when four big banks said they had taken discount window loans "what the central bank has done is call banks together and say if everyone lends a little bit more everybody will be a little bit better off its the classic collective action problem when theres a whiff of panic in the markets " says economist barry eichengreen of the university of california berkeley sometimes the mighty fed is impotent when interest rates fall so low that it doesnt pay to lend as in japan in the s a central bank is said to be "pushing on string " this case could be a different kind of impotence interest rates are far above zero "now the fear is that the default rates are going to be so high it doesnt pay to lend " mr eichengreen says it isnt clear that cutting its key interest rate by one quarter or one half percentage point will change that one reason mr bernanke hasnt yet done so so are the feds tools working too soon to tell of course if the problem is primarily one of confidence and after the feds maneuvers confidence rises gears unfreeze investors stop preferring treasury bills to everything else and rates continue to come down on jumbo mortgages those exceeding &# then the answer is yes but the problem could be deeper housing prices may fall further and that could reduce the value of already hard to value mortgage linked securities so much that shrewd buyers stay away if as perennially gloomy new york university economist nouriel roubini argues there are lots of as yet unreported losses in portfolios of complex mortgage linked instruments then uncertainty could make money lenders reluctant to trust counterparties for a long time no matter what the fed does the st century financial system didnt come with an owners manual mr bernanke is writing one now
