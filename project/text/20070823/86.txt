shell game just about everyone claims the u s must urgently become "energy independent " yet at the same time just about every policy that may actually serve that goal is met with environmentalist opposition that contradiction has impeded the bush administrations attempts to increase domestic energy production and even the modest progress so far may be blocked because litigation is driving the conflict out of politics and into the courts to see this trend at work look north to alaska where lawsuits are blocking an offshore drilling program last week the ninth circuit court of appeals granted an emergency stay that will suspend all operations until at least september when the court will hear full arguments the decision noted that the litigants environmental pressure groups like the natural resources defense council had shown "a probability of success on the merits " uh oh this is bad news for shell whose three year exploration program in the beaufort sea was green lighted by the department of the interior in february the company planned to sink up to four temporary wells this summer to determine the available resources but theres a limited open water window before the winter ice moves back in so the ninth circuit could delay work for a year even if it decides in shells favor the worst ramifications however could hit environmental and regulatory law the greens argue that the environmental review process of the interior agency responsible for domestic energy leasing the minerals management service was incomplete allegedly there are not enough protections for bowhead whales as they migrate to their winter grounds they also say that the program could affect other wildlife and that there could be oil spills in fact mms conducts a comprehensive environmental review ultimately it found that the project would have "no significant impact" on the ecosystem the agency has also spent more than &# million studying the feeding and migratory behavior of the bowhead whales in the beaufort sea based on that research it attached additional approval conditions on shell beyond the statutory law designed to mitigate any possible effects part of the environmental complaint was that shell would disrupt the inupiat eskimos annual subsistence whale hunt but the company brokered a "conflict avoidance agreement" that will stop all work for part of the migration season as for oil spills the two drill ships shell would deploy were specially engineered to operate safely in the conditions of the beaufort sea plus theyd be attended by an armada of barges to respond in case of an accident even this painstaking and very expensive process wasnt enough in short its hard to imagine any further precautions that would satisfy the environmentalists short of a total ban on offshore drilling which of course is their real objective the environmentalists are pursuing a litigation strategy against every government agency involved they have appealed decisions of the environmental protection agency threatened to sue the national marine fisheries service among others and even sued to retroactively roll back all lease sales with the ninth circuit they finally found a court partner amenable to their demands precisely because of the stringency of the review process the environmentalists are developing some creative legal theories the national environmental policy act requires an environmental impact statement this orders the government to consider a "range of alternatives" when issuing any permits and then to choose the one that offers "maximum protection" to the environment the greens say that the option that provides "maximum protection" is not drilling ergo the courts should stretch the statute to ban any exploration whatsoever but congress and the executive are charged with determining what areas should be opened to development balancing the public interest with environmental concerns the law then provides for "maximum protection" within that context which mms has clearly done here the public interest in this case is domestic energy the u s is one of the only countries in the world that chooses to lock up its natural resources since the administration and congress have lifted the federal moratoria on a few select areas of the outer continental shelf the beaufort basin which is estimated to hold trillion cubic feet of natural gas and billion barrels of recoverable oil was one of those a successful exploratory program could open a new frontier of energy that public purpose is what drives the greens bonkers so theyre trying to create a legal backstop to prevent any administration from doing what president bush has done the shell case shows that even a long and expensive effort to address every conceivable concern can still be undone by lawsuits if anyone wants to know why were still "dependent on foreign oil " this is it
