take a close look at retirement plan fees is your retirement plan giving you a fair deal since they were created years ago k plans have gone from being a nice workplace perk to a crucial source of retirement income in which every penny can make a difference against that backdrop lawsuits and regulators are raising some tough questions about the magnitude of fees charged k investors and how decisions are made about which investments the plans offer one concern the mutual fund fees charged to plan participants may be inflated to cover payments to consultants who recommended those funds be included in the plans since september more than a dozen lawsuits involving k fees and investments have been filed on behalf of investors against some of the nations biggest employers such as boeing and international paper as well as against big investment companies that oversee k s and similar retirement plans such as fidelity investments principal financial group and ing groep the companies all say they have done nothing wrong meanwhile late last year congresss investigative arm the government accountability office raised questions about whether retirement plans should be required to provide workers with more information about fees and investments "the thinking has caught up with the reality that people are increasingly dependent on k plans " says mark iwry a former treasury department official now affiliated with the nonprofit retirement security project and people "are waking up to the fact that expenses are a major issue affecting investment returns " for example a report by the gao on k fees illustrated how for a year old worker an additional annual charge equal to of assets could reduce savings at age by most k investors may not realize it but their employers have a legal responsibility to ensure the fees deducted from retirement plan accounts are reasonable thats part of their obligations as a so called fiduciary which means employers are required to operate the plans in the best interest of the investors while some of the issues under scrutiny are legalistic and obscure here are some key questions and answers for k investors what fees are being deducted from my account the biggest chunk of most plan fees goes to pay the money managers making the investment decisions another set of fees covers the costs of maintaining accounts such as enrolling new participants mailing account statements and processing transactions in some cases the employer will pick up the tab for some or all of these recordkeeping expenses other costs of running a plan such as having it audited or hiring a consultant to help with creating the lineup of investments are usually but not always paid by the employer if the retirement plan is in the form of an insurance product called a group annuity still more fees can be layered on top in some cases more than doubling the costs to investors why are k plans and the companies that run the plans being sued theres a laundry list of complex allegations but one core complaint is that companies running k plans are overcharging investors the firms targeted by the lawsuits say they have done nothing wrong in particular the suits contend that retirement plan fees have been inflated by business arrangements known in wall street jargon as "revenue sharing " in a typical revenue sharing deal a fund manager collects an overall fee from investors and then passes on a portion of that money to another company for instance some fund companies use a portion of the money they collect to pay consultants who recommend which funds are included in a retirement plan because some consultants only recommend funds where the manager gives them revenue sharing payments this practice has been criticized as "pay to play " the gao worried that as a result of these arrangements employers may be steered toward investments "that may not be in the best interest of participants and may cause them to pay higher fees " where can i get information on my plans fees thats a big part of the problem the gao report called k fee disclosure "piecemeal " saying investors "may not receive a clear picture of the total fees that they pay " plans arent required to provide that information in a way that makes it easy to compare fees performance and risk among the various investment options within the plan the gao said fee information can be scattered among fund prospectuses and summary reports but if you dont own a particular fund offered by your plan that fee information wont necessarily be sent to you for group annuities participants often have to refer to a separate packet of information that outlines the fees charged by the insurance company on top of the fees charged by the underlying investments what questions should i ask my employer a good starting point is simply "what are the fees im paying " but that shouldnt be the end of the questions says dan maul an adviser with retirement planning associates in kirkland wash which assists companies in setting up k plans he suggests following up by asking your employer for the amount of fees in dollars taken from your account "when its in percentages the impact can get lost but when its translated into dollars it hits home " mr maul says a crucial question mr maul adds is how the fees being charged compare with those of other similar investments if the fees are above average ask your employer for an explanation of why it feels those fees are reasonable how can i find out if my funds have revenue sharing agreements though it is being challenged by lawsuits revenue sharing is a common practice in the retirement plan industry disclosure of revenue sharing deals albeit usually a vague description will be buried in a fund companys government filings some light is being directed on this area however as part of an agreement to settle civil fraud charges with former new york attorney general eliot spitzer ing will begin making plain english disclosures to investors in certain retirement plans explaining that fund managers often pay ing to have their funds appear in retirement plans email encore wsj com
