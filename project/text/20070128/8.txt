on investing buy on the week high and ride higher a stock trading near its week high may not seem like much of a bargain but research suggests it may still add plenty of value to your portfolio thats because stocks near their highs tend to climb still higher over the next six to months the reverse is also true stocks near their week lows tend to slide lower the main reason for this phenomenon the market usually underreacts to good news when a stock is near its week high thats because investors who are taught to "buy low and sell high" get skittish as stocks near their recent peaks and in the short run they hesitate to bid up prices further but the reluctance doesnt last forever "eventually the impact of the news wins out and the stocks price trends up " says thomas george a finance professor at the university of houstons bauer college of business dr george and colleague chuan yang hwang pioneered research about the week high as a predictor of future performance greg forsythe senior vice president of equity ratings at charles schwab says his clients are just as reluctant as many professional traders to buy stocks near their recent peaks his response in some cases the stock price may be higher than it was a few months ago "but its low relative to where it should be " mr forsythe urged clients to consider selected stocks near their highs in a november newsletter he picked eight stocks that had schwabs highest rating for potential outperformance based on factors including earnings quality and valuation and that were close to their recent peaks over the following twelve months the group of stocks gained compared with the dow jones industrial averages advance for the same period the accompanying table lists five stocks that last week held schwabs top rating and were near their week highs the case for buying stocks near their highs may seem counterintuitive especially since investors are usually counseled not to chase performance that adage often holds true when it comes to individual mutual funds and asset categories high yield bonds for example or technology stocks but the research shows individual stocks that are near their highs can sustain that momentum through the next months there are some "momentum" investors on the lookout for companies with recent outsized stock returns who do use week highs to spot possible targets and to be sure some stocks near their week highs may be unattractive and overpriced relative to the companies earnings and prospects for instance stocks near their week highs that have schwabs lowest ratings include las vegas based station casinos stn and auto parts company amerigon argn proximity to the high is perhaps best used as a tiebreaker that helps investors choose among a handful of stocks with good potential if you have three equally attractive stocks the one closest to its high is likely to be a "better performer and to perform more quickly" than the others says schwabs mr forsythe
