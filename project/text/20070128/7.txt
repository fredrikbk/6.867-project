marketwatch ready to care for parents and kids the good news is baby boomers arent as selfish as the "me generation" label sometimes assigned to them might suggest the bad news is their generosity might force them to work well into their retirement years according to a new survey of working americans about one in five workers years of age and older provide financial support to a parent according to the survey of about adults conducted by brightwork partners for putnam investments and a fair portion of boomers are supporting their adult children almost one third of working americans and older with a grown child over age pay rent or provide housing for that child the survey found meanwhile of middle aged workers with grown children provide financial support of about &# a year on average "baby boomers are not selfish" says beth segers managing director of market planning at putnam investments in boston "boomers will take care of their elderly parents and theyll take their kid back too " she says "the implication is that they will make up the difference by working later themselves to pay for retirement " for instance of those supporting their parents say theyll work for pay in retirement as a result while say theyll delay their retirement already the portion of retirees who returned to the job market rose to in this survey from in a similar survey a year earlier returning to work is "a very healthy attitude to stay vibrant and focused and active " ms segers says but relying on that option to shore up lost retirement savings assumes boomers will be healthy enough to continue working and will find jobs thats not always the case she warns inheritances wont be there to rescue many of those who find themselves sacrificing retirement savings to support family "theyre not going to inherit a lot from their families the parents need the money for themselves because theyre living longer " ms segers says noting that of those surveyed say they had received an inheritance and expect to in the future the median inheritance was &# only of those surveyed said they received an inheritance greater than &# million and inherited between &# and &# million ms segers says for most people "inheritance is a false hope " ms segers says for those who find themselves with a parent or adult child in need of help the first step is to assess the situation says michael eisenberg a personal financial specialist and founder of eisenberg financial advisors in los angeles revise your budget accounting for the new expenses and include your loved one in that conversation he suggests next before sacrificing your retirement savings look for extra cash consider all possible options "think outside the box dont just be pigeonholed with this is what everybody has told me i should do " mr eisenberg says options might include seeking help from other relatives including your other adult children or borrowing against a whole life insurance policy perhaps your parents can take out a reverse mortgage on their home with adult kids assess whether this is a one time situation or a constant mr eisenberg says "if the children are working but cant make ends meet maybe the mom and dad should sit down with the kids and say youre spending too much move out of this &# apartment youre in to something that costs &# a month " that situation might signal its time your adult child met with a financial planner the parents "should communicate with their kids and work with their kids for a common goal " says michael bischoff a financial planner with webb financial group in bloomington minn the goal is "to get them to come in and meet with us to talk about these issues " assess what you realistically can offer mr eisenberg says "you dont want to see your adult children suffering but what can you actually do youre years old and you spent your whole life working do you want to continue working are you physically able to do that " he adds that assessment might lead you to say no "i have counseled clients to not make any gifts to their adult kids because they dont have the financial ability to do that " mr eisenberg says "im a parent i understand what a parent wants to say but what happens if the parents get sick and need to cover their health expense " talk with your parents about their financial affairs as early as possible so if and when they need help you have a good handle on the situation mr bischoff says one client was shocked at how much time she spent sorting through her parents affairs as they moved into an assisted living facility "shes overwhelmed her parents have a lot of accounts all over the place the parents havent prepared properly for this which is fairly common " he adds research the prospect of buying long term care insurance for your parents to offset potential future nursing home costs mr bischoff says suggest your parents meet with an elder law attorney now to organize their financial affairs he says "most people go to the attorney too late " mr bischoff says "too late is usually once the health care scenario has started " andrea coombes is a personal finance writer at marketwatch www
