real time thoughts on writings future readers see digital age changing books but many hope the novel will endure last weeks column fretted about the possibility that the novel and long form nonfiction could be subject to the same digital age slicing and dicing thats transformed the music industry readers had plenty to say about that from defenses of the album and a reminder that i was really only talking about rock albums to appreciations of the novel to wishing the whole digitalization process would just hurry up already many thanks to everybody who wrote in as always letters have been edited what kind of books can be digitally sliced and diced readers found plenty of examples bill hennigan writes cookbooks it seems to me are the most analogous to the music album i would love to be able to choose just the recipes in the area i am most interested there are too many cookbooks that have a couple of good recipes with the balance being pedestrian at best as with albums cookbooks are often just promotional vehicles for the star chef and his her restaurant or tv show the novel as you point out isnt analogous to the album as most are "wholes " even condensations of the entire book are unsatisfactory and seem targeted at those who have temporarily lost the use of their television this is true though a little less so of biographies or works of history all others are susceptible to internet chopping and dicing i mean think of the books written by political candidates no one has ever picked one of those up without thinking "will i have to read the whole thing " don goodwin writes i can see buying parts of nonfiction books this is especially true with my hobbies for example i like to build furniture and frequently borrow ideas from library books if i want to build a craftsman style desk i could see buying an individual chapter on desks from several different books written on the craftsman style gary wilmot writes there are books id like to buy only a part of technical manuals for example instead of an page tome on windows vista i might just want a chapter on how it handles networking or some other topic interestingly theres a commercial web service that lets me do just that although at a steep price oreillys safari safari oreilly com it offers complete online access to hundreds of technical books from oreilly microsoft press and several other publishers for a monthly fee &# per month jace included in the fee are several "tokens" per month which allow downloading pdf versions of specific chapters with watermarks to protect against mass duplication lynn kohner writes my first reaction was that novels cant be broken down then i remembered all those pages of stuff i typed to keep portions of books doris lessings memoirs of a survivor comes to mind before returning the book to the library although being able to download parts wont have the same ability to impress the material in the mind the way copy typing does matt hutchison writes i really dont see the novel being broken up for its parts like an album however i can see that happening for other kinds of books an example for myself would be a biography honestly with most biographies im not very interested in the subjects childhood and often even less interested in their parents grandparents etc also there will inevitably be parts of their life that are less interesting than others recently i have become quite interested in the lives of the founding fathers chose to read a very enjoyable mind you book about alexander hamilton after reading another about washington that described hamiltons role in the creation of the treasury system being a finance guy i wanted to learn more of the details and how he got in the position to do as much good as he did i was not as interested in how his parents met or how they came to be in the west indies but i was inspired by the chapters about the nights while on washingtons staff during the revolutionary war when he stayed up late studying economics and history as well as by those that discuss his negotiations with jefferson about the funding scheme he devised i would love to be able to buy a chopped up version of the biography where i could pick and choose the parts of hamiltons life i would want to own and read again michael estes writes as part of ipod nation i find myself listening to more playlists than albums although occasionally i do like to hear the whole album there is definitely some art to putting together the songs you can also sometimes pick up repeating patterns or themes in the music i also think the album allows you to hear some songs by the artist that wouldnt make the radio but are actually better than the current pop favorite you mentioned green day i think "st jimmy" is a much better song than "american idiot " and wouldnt have known that from the radio or a single as for books i tend to agree its more difficult to separate however i think the nonfiction and self help have a great opportunity imagine only buying covey habits gbp and which everyone knows are the good ones or skipping all the south beach psychobabble and getting the meal plan and recipes who does stage anyway fiction would be more difficult although charles dickens and others originally were published as serials in the newspaper one chapter at a time i think the bigger hurdle is the media itself i dont think people are ready for e books several readers mentioned dickens but i think theres a difference between serials and other works that are chopped up serials are still pieces of a larger whole that is ultimately appreciated that way rock albums usually arent not many people are happy with just parts and of "the green mile " but there are undoubtedly people who are perfectly happy with just tracks and off a green day album a couple of readers looked at the digital age from a publishing standpoint and one just wanted the whole fragmentation process to hurry up charlie brenner writes would people really pay for a text "song " today when someone comes up with a pithy idea say the octopus principle which is that all of the worlds issues have exactly eight attributes he can only earn dollars and reputation by publishing it as a book even if the whole idea could have been expressed in a few sentences so we get one interesting chapter and then a whole lot of repetition and non sequitur in fact the following year the author will put out living the octopus principle and then maybe the octopus principle diet in an ideal world authors would be compensated in proportion to the number of times a reader said "wow i never thought of it that way before " monetize that and youve got your text revolution pia chatterjee writes i think the digital age will change the way books are written not the end result per se but the process i predict that many novelists will begin their marketing efforts before they begin the craft of writing by blogging about the adventure and experience of writing much like ceos of start ups do they will share with the audience the trials and tribulations of their craft the goal to communicate their experiences but to also draw in readers agents and maybe even publishers writing is a lonely craft blogging is a social medium soon i think the two will marry and well have to see how well they get along its very true that the cut and paste nature of the digital age seems opposed to how self help business books work many of those books seem at least to me like a single idea or program that could fit onto a napkin bloated to book length and then expanded into an industry which leads us to blogging many writers are already doing exactly what pia suggests theyll do which is essentially creating digital brands for themselves maybe its just being a new yorker but im often baffled by the obsession with whether or not bloggers can make money from ads on their blogs beer money aside most of the bloggers i know couldnt care less the dream is that their blogs will snag them book contracts and that leads me full circle to seth godin whom i saw speak at a recent conference sponsored by google when i sat down there was already a copy of his latest book on my chair it was a collection of eight years of his best blog posts and in the introduction he explicitly states that the book shouldnt be read all at once "itll give you a headache" and doesnt have a narrative the title small is the new big camilo montenegro writes all information should be digital you mentioned the case of students who only access bits and pieces of books selected by the professor it is precisely with students in mind that books should be digitized and offered on a per page or at least a per chapter basis it is not at all uncommon for me to find myself cursing a publisher for not doing this when i come across a book by a respected author who has a chapter i desperately need for a paper and its not just students of all levels who would benefit research is carried out on a massive scale by academic nonprofit and international organizations every day economists at the world bank cabinet members of an asian government drug rehabilitation ngos in guatemala all could benefit from accessing the information they need not only on demand but in the exact shape and amounts they desire in the end its about digitization all audio video and writing should be digital there is no reason why i or anyone should have to wait a couple of weeks for a bulky cardboard package containing books to arrive at my house in the digital era all books are written edited and designed digitally anyway it would cost publishers next to nothing to simply sell the finalized digital version and if something is being made available digitally theres no reason not to offer it in the bits and pieces some or many may want it in im anxiously waiting for the day in which the way books are sold catches up with commonplace technology but what about my own way of making a living several readers asked wasnt i ignoring whats happened in my own backyard sean oshaughnessy writes what about your genre news its been months since i read a newspaper or a magazine front to back i have been a subscriber to wsj com for many years and dropped my wall street journal subscription years ago i no longer subscribe to any newspapers and i only subscribe to my favorite woodworking magazines the concept of a newspaper and magazine is soon to go the way of the album if it hasnt already cedric long writes the digital age has already changed writing in the same way as music but the change has come in journalism many people click share and publish links to specific articles or columnists such that consumers can read what topics or authors interest them rather than purchase an entire newspaper or magazine web sites such as the drudge report offer a selection of links to articles and writers much like a consumers burned cd or itunes library containing the most preferred selections from a variety of sources do you count the clicks on real time constance johnson writes please consider the choices made by those of us whose wsj com home page is media and marketing are we not also separating what we focus on in the newspaper out of the "entire album " so to speak this is an excellent point i probably didnt explore it because by now im barely conscious of it talk about ones own blinders sure i count the clicks on real time but increasingly there are lots of ways people get to the column whether its through their personalization blogs rss feeds folks emailing it or simply cutting and pasting it onto the web somewhere fragmentation absolutely on the other hand while newspapers and magazines can be argued to have philosophies though in my experience not nearly to the extent many readers think i think few papers and magazines work as coherent wholes to be approached like novels with the exception of those rare readers who really do read the paper from front to back weve always fragmented how we read news by picking up sections in the order we like best good luck sharing a novel with your spouse on sunday morning and skipping some articles to read others speaking of good points that eluded me bob braddock writes we didnt have to wait for the digital era for people to start trimming novels readers digest has been condensing written works for years what is readers digest if not a playlist and on to the bigger picture lisa foote writes print media do seem to have lagged as so many other media have been atomized by digitization many years ago i was intrigued by which literature translates best to film or television serialization i concluded that the determining factor was what the germans call "sitzfleisch" how long can you sit at a time short stories seem to make the best leap to the "in one sitting" film format novels rarely make the transition well in my opinion there is simply too much to compact into a film a sidenote one can cite many well made films "based" on novels david leans "great expectations" leaps to mind however comparing the two generally shows that the films plot characters and arc have been boiled down to a novella length at longest one of my favorite very long great films "apocalypse now " is based on a novella novels seem to best transfer to television serialization in victorian times readers had to wait weeks or even months between installments in a novel the writer invites you to digest various characters themes and arcs again difficult to translate to a one sitting film experience i am interested in whether new literary analogs to electronic formats or devices will appear will there be micro short stories that film well as ultra small screen ultra short videos how will comic novels continue to evolve and where the heck does poetry fit in to this discussion jeff atwood writes the digital world has already changed writing and viewing youtube has picked off just those segments of "saturday night live" you want to see minus the commercials online i can read just those magazine articles i want without a surrounding blizzard of advertising instead of having to buy a full photo album i can selectively save those one or two shots i really want some books like some movies are so superb you must have the whole work some albums are just thrown together to fill up a cd and justify the price do you listen to the whole opera every time or just that aria you love so much some of us are purists others are dilettantes some insist on the unexpurgated edition others can only intellectually handle the abridged condensed redacted simplified lowbrow version we are already in a world changed by digitalization we just havent figured out how to fully capitalize on it yet well said and reminds me of the william gibson quote that "the futures already here its just not evenly distributed yet " you can always drop me a line at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
