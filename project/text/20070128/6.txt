love &amp money a parent ages and a promise is kept at some point age does not come gently for the past year my wife amy has watched as her year old maternal grandfather has grown increasingly feeble after relatively healthy years his mobility and ability to care for himself has taken a drastic turn for the worse he is understandably angry and frustrated at his deterioration but his family is also feeling the pain amys grandfather has made clear to his sons and daughters and grandchildren that he never wants to be put in a nursing home or assisted living center and they have respected his wishes providing him with round the clock care either directly or through hired helpers in the home he has lived in for half a century as a granddaughter who has long been close to her grandfather amy sees the need to honor his wishes and shes often at his house helping in whatever way she can but as a registered nurse looking at the situation dispassionately she is increasingly worried that his needs have moved beyond the familys ability to provide the necessary care and she is concerned as she watches her mom and aunts and uncles sacrifice more and more of their time and energy at the expense of their own families as well as their own plans for retirement so she finds herself torn these days by a situation no ones want to be in worried about both her grandfather and her mother but feeling helpless in her efforts to come up with a better way for years ive read about the breakdown of the american family and how we as a society no longer care for our elderly like we once did maybe thats true in the aggregate but it seems to disregard the tens of millions of us deeply involved in managing the daily lives of aging parents amys grandfather has reached a stage where he requires total care "and thats a heavy toll for any family " amy says "when someone needs total care you cant leave them alone you have to assist them with all the activities of daily living " as such his five children split time caring for their father most nights and most weekends aides come in to cover the shifts that they cant "i really empathize with my mom and my aunts and uncles " amy says "they all have their own kids and grandkids who have needs too some still work that makes the choices so difficult because it comes down to asking yourself at times do i help my kids or grandkids or my father and thats a terrible decision to have to be in the middle of because he has done everything for them but they still have their own obligations to take care of " over the past year amy has watched her mom and her moms siblings perform what is essentially a juggling act running two households their own and their fathers amys mom and a sister take care of scheduling sitters and doctor visits others run his errands and handle household issues that arise "she never complains and her brothers and sisters dont complain " amy says "but i sit back and observe and wonder when my mom will run herself down shes she has her own retirement to deal with i worry that shes going to hurt herself trying to help him sometimes i wonder if this is what my grandfather would have really wanted had he known it would be like this i wonder if everyones quality of time together would be better in a different situation " by "different situation " amy means an assisted living center where the family could visit him just as often yet where his care would come from professionals trained to deal with issues that now stir frustration on all sides and where the five siblings would not have to worry so much about running their fathers household she would never suggest that nor would amys mom or the brothers and sisters and i can understand why this is a close knit family and a promise is a promise i can also understand why amys grandfather wanted them to make that promise why he was so adamant as he grew older that he didnt want to leave home this house is the wellspring of all his memories his links to the life he shared with his spouse and children it is where he finds his sense of security leaving behind those memories is to cast off into a void its at this stage in the column that i often seek some potential resolution to the issue at hand that isnt so this time there is no potential resolution some things families wont change because they simply cannot amy realizes the nurse in her cannot sway the granddaughter who wants to see her grandfather live out his days in his home the home she played in as a little girl where she learned to cook and bake alongside her grandmother and where she has spent nearly every thanksgiving christmas and easter with her family still the episode has her contemplating how our lives could affect our kids when were older and theyre faced with a similar situation both of us hope our son and daughter want to care for us but amy wants to leave them the option of deciding otherwise if its best for them "im seeing just how much that impacts families " amy says "i know i dont want to do that to our kids we would be taking time away from their families and i know they would feel guilty having to make that choice "i also see how personalities change the sweet kind natured person you are throughout life becomes frustrated angry and resentful at losing your independence and you lash out at your family because theyre the only people you can lash out at i dont want to be like that with our kids because theyre the ones forced to care for us "i know why were saving so much because i want to have the financial option my grandfather has of having the money to afford in home care when my mom and her siblings cant be there " in the end amy says the experience of watching all of this unfold over the past year "has given me perspective on knowing what i want to talk to our kids about when theyre adults i dont want them to feel burdened by us i dont want their spouses becoming resentful of them having to take care of me and you it is such a big commitment both emotionally and physically "i dont want them to struggle with managing two families " jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal write him at lovemoney wsj com
