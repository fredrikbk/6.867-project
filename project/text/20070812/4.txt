eyes on the road for buick good names go bad brands vehicle quality gains are offset by decision to dump sagging nameplates online edition what do the buick regal buick lesabre buick park avenue and buick ranier have in common besides being buicks they all scored among the top three in their class in j d power and associates survey of vehicle dependability for and all are out of production this is another one of those good news bad news stories for detroits struggling auto makers first the good news for the first time general motors corp s buick brand tied toyota motor corp s lexus brand for the top spot in the "vehicle dependability study " which surveys owners of three year old vehicles and compiles their reported problems into scores and rankings lexus has been alone at number one spot in this survey for years gms cadillac brand and ford motor co s mercury brand scooted in at three and four respectively ahead of no honda and no toyota the spread between lexus and buick and no toyota was problems per vehicles toyota and lexus didnt suffer a meltdown by any means lexus models placed first in five segments more than any other brand toyota brand models placed first in four segments including large pickup trucks the last stronghold of the detroit auto giants but for gm buick catching lexus in long term reliability is an important achievement the auto maker can use to further its case that it has left its quality sins of the past behind now the bad news buick will face a challenge to get the most out of this coup in part because of detroits tendency to dump nameplates in response to poor sales or a weak brand image consider the buick century and buick regal they placed no and among mid sized cars beating the segments highly regarded best sellers the toyota camry and honda accord as j d power points out a reputation for good long term reliability usually translates into a concrete benefit for consumers in the form of higher resale value on average three year old vehicles retain about of their initial transaction price power says but cars with good reliability reputations can hang on to as much as percentage points more of their value after three years according to power data which is something customers remember brands such as lexus toyota and honda that manage their marketing strategies with resale value in mind have tended to gain share even as overall sales have declined what j d powers new survey suggests is that anyone looking for a reliable three year old used vehicle now might consider adding the buick century and regal to their lists too bad for century owners that powers data suggests the discontinued century currently doesnt get many lookers its holding just of its new price well below the industry average beyond that how will the century and regals good scores help the new buick that has taken their place in the mid size segment can you even name it answer below george hoffer an economist at virginia commonwealth university who studies automotive sales and marketing trends in detail says in a draft paper that detroits impulse to conjure up new names for a car could be one reason why detroit brands keep losing share despite the evidence that the best of detroits new models have achieved parity with toyota and honda the quality image leaders for the industry "for domestic lines a renaming results in a decline in market share growth for that year nor does market share growth rebound in the model year after the renaming " mr hoffer writes in a draft paper the century and the regal names died in large part because they were associated with buicks image as either an old persons car or a rental car as buick sales have declined gm has pared back the number of buick models to fit the brands shrinking share and tried to reposition buick as a less pretentious version of lexus with cars that are dignified ultra quiet and highly reliable vehicles such as the stylish buick enclave crossover wagon built to attract would be buyers of the lexus rx models reflect this strategy out lexusing lexus was never going to be easy since the real lexus does what it does quite well one thing buick has that lexus doesnt is a real heritage in the u s market the problem is how to remind people of the heritage without also reminding them of the sour taste left behind by some buicks of the recent past fords new chief executive alan mulally earlier this year decided that detroits formula for atoning for past sins consign the offending vehicle name to the memory hole and spend millions to launch a new name is nuts thats why ford will this fall revive the ford taurus and mercury sable names the sable by the way placed third in the latest power dependability study among mid size cars not that "were no " is the strongest advertising pitch buick plans to do its best to promote the j d power tie with lexus as it has with similar positive quality rankings in the past says spokesman dave darovitz "perception lags reality now that perception has caught up with reality we are just now starting to get credit " he says it would be easier if gm hadnt let cars like the regal and century slide so far that killing off the names seemed like a good idea chalk it up as another legacy cost for detroit to overcome answer the new midsized buick is the lacrosse send comments about eyes on the road to joseph
