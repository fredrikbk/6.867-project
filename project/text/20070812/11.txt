five year track records throw in some plus exchange traded funds most of which are considered passive investing vehicles and how do you sort through the maze of offerings start by being cheap veteran investing pros advise "in real estate the mantra is location location location with index funds its expenses expenses expenses " says william bernstein a financial author and co founder of efficient frontier advisors in eastford conn "generally its always going to pay off in the long run to go with a fund charging a lower expense ratio " investors can take advantage of a mini price war going on these days between index funds much of thats due to the popularity of etfs which trade anytime in the day like a stock most track a specific index giving them lower costs than actively managed funds another factor helping to drive down index fund expenses is growing competition mutual fund giant fidelity investments for example has lowered charges on many of its spartan series of index funds to

eight times greater some index funds charge as much as times fidelitys level cost isnt your only consideration with large cap stock funds for instance long term performance differences shouldnt be an issue until costs rise past a year says bill schultheis chief investment officer at pacific asset management in kirkland wash and author of "the coffeehouse investor " "if a large cap index funds expense ratio goes much over a quarter of a percentage point beyond its closest competition thats a definite red flag " he says "in all likelihood theres going to be something comparable thats more affordable " even though they trade less than most actively managed funds the best indexers seem to find ways to cut even the minutest of transaction costs for their shareholders "the reason why you go with index funds is that theres no real evidence of persistent skill among active stock pickers " mr bernstein says "but the irony is that there is real skill in operating an index fund " he adds that "the good index shops are quite skilled at executing trades efficiently but most importantly they do it on a very consistent basis " capture market segments some in the industry have been trumpeting alternative benchmarks to use with funds growing in popularity is an index that ranks stocks by valuation metrics these are touted as fundamental indexes and a big improvement over weighting portfolios by market cap size for his part mr schultheis says such debates are largely cosmetic he points out that the way an index weights its names is less important than how effectively it captures different segments of the market "in different market cycles one style might do a little better than another " says mr schultheis "but whats most important in determining long term success is sticking with whatever choice you make pick a fund and an index that you can live with for a long time " distinguishing between segments of the market is one thing but also keep in mind that stocks of smaller companies tend to be much more volatile so do indexes which can vary by how many so called microcaps are tracked some small cap indexes also include a lot more midcap stocks than others reducing short term price gyrations but a bigger small cap index fund can also dampen long term returns "microcap funds over long periods can produce very high returns " says herb morgan president of efficient market advisors of del mar calif "but youre likely to experience extreme swings of underperformance that can often last several years " mr morgan advises investors to steer clear of funds with average market caps of &# million or less which is a typical range for a microcap indexed portfolio mr morgan says he suggests ishares russell index etf iwm its average market cap is about &# billion other index funds mr morgan follows produce similar returns with slightly higher average market caps one of those is vanguard small cap etf vb "if youre within the same general market cap size most small cap etfs and index mutual funds from well known shops are going to serve you well over the long haul " he adds "the main thing to keep in mind is how much microcap exposure you want in your portfolio " mr morgan says "youre going to have to decide how much of a trade off youre willing to make between higher returns and increased volatility " murray coleman writes for marketwatch www
