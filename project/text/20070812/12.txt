real time in defense of gadgetry forget critiques of our love of tech toys the truth is that technologys a lot of fun online edition not long ago i spent a few days in maine with my folks in their house in the woods its an annual trip that gives my son a chance to see hummingbirds chipmunks and other forest critters and gives me a period of withdrawal from connection addiction cellphone reception is poor at the house and dial ups the rule for the net i wrote about the annual maine trip in more detail last summer i often find myself talking about the maine trip as an enforced vacation from all things digital a mildly disorienting but not unwelcome time out from the care and feeding of gadgets the summons of little envelope icons and the ceaseless checking and rechecking of web sites to see if anythings changed its an easy thing to say and saying it almost invariably gets nods and clucks of empathy from friends who feel similarly over connected theres just one problem im not sure its true its not that i dont appreciate hummingbirds and quiet woods and long books i do but at least this year my wannabe thoreauism was nonsense i wanted to spend time futzing with my favorite web sites and gadgets and it wasnt just the pull of habit after all i happily abandoned plenty of other routines up in maine but i genuinely missed being connected which got me wondering about the rest of our technological poor mouthing its almost automatic to survey the endless march of gadgetry and conclude that were slaves to our stuff that having more makes us want more and as a result were never happy but for many of us this is a pose its a defense mechanism we can easily do without because in fact its the defense mechanism that makes us unhappy ready to escape this digital dissatisfaction its easy just repeat after me playing with this stuff is fun staying connected is fun its another hallmark of our times that adults are increasingly happy acting nowhere near their age whether theyre nodding along with their nanos dressing like just fell outta bed college kids or playing xbox heres the definitive essay on so called grups by new yorks adam sternbergh for many of these peter pans and i admit to being one of them the digital world and its associated gadgets are the stuff of grown up play and why shouldnt they be the slow creep of technology can obscure the fact that our world would have been unimaginable not so long ago life is fundamentally different than it was before google before widespread email and im before cellphones before tivo before digital music increasingly we get most any question we can put into words answered communicate with friends and family across the globe any time and from anywhere watch tv and movies on our schedules and carry gigantic libraries of every conceivable genre of music in our pockets if youre still sore about the fact that moonbases and flying cars havent materialized look closer to home at the wonders that have arrived i cant imagine going back to the way life was before those inventions found their way into my life id be miserable if i had to this isnt to say any of these life changing technologies are perfect or to deny their unwelcome and unforeseen side effects not every answer found through google is correct much of the worlds email is spam our cellphones drop calls getting the cable company to send out cablecards for your new tivo can be infuriating and we digital music fans miss our album covers more generally new technologies are too hard to use its no fun paying companies to beta test their products and even when gadgets do work as advertised we worry about being tracked and stalked about identity theft about how to keep our kids safe about social bonds and decorum in the digital age but few people i know would turn their backs on new technologies because of such misgivings by now we understand that some or many of the new things we see and want wont be perfect and that well wind up maintaining them and we know that in finding new ways of doing things well inevitably regret some of the ways things used to be but by and large we accept this because technology is worth it we want to be connected and we want to have new things sure we sometimes get starry eyed about gadgets as status symbols or hunger to keep up with whomever we think were competing with but writing off gadgetry and connection addiction as mere consumerism or product churn misses much of its appeal we have seen again and again that todays science fiction is tomorrows normal life and weve come to enjoy playing with technology as its transformed from one to the other were part of that transformation and we want to see what will happen we see something new or new to us whether its an iphone the revamped imovie satellite radio a location based "friend finder" service text messaging google for a sports score or someone finding their voice on a blog and we think "i want to do that " does that go hand in hand with consumerism or conspicuous consumption or whatever derisive label you want to give it of course it does but does it tell the whole story of course not we really are embarked on a grand technological adventure why on earth would we want to miss it what is technologys lure is it consumerism gone mad or do we love playing with this stuff and seeing how it develops join me and
