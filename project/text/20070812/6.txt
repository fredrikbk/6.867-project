getting going in defense of my contrarian advice oh the howls of outrage in my july column i took aim at four pieces of conventional wisdom often doled out to folks in their s including the suggestion that their top financial priority should be amassing an emergency reserve equal to six months of living expenses i argued that those in their s should forget the emergency reserve and instead focus on things like stashing enough in their k to get the full company match if they had a financial emergency they could always borrow against their k the column elicited hundreds of dissenting emails many of which belittled my intelligence and used language that cant be repeated in a family newspaper the chief beef what if our twentysomethings borrow against their k and then get laid off the answer they ought to marvel at their financial savvy before i justify that contention you will need a little background according to the chicago based profit sharing k council of america some of k plans allow loans you can generally borrow of your account balance up to &# david wray the profit sharing k councils president says the chance to take loans encourages employees to participate "for most it isnt a decision to save in the plan or save outside the plan " he says "its a decision to save period if people werent in the plan theyd have zero " nonetheless taking a loan isnt a great idea when you borrow from your k the sum involved is removed from your account so you have less money earning investment gains those missed investment gains are the real cost of a k loan as hundreds of angry readers noted there is another problem with k loans if you get laid off these loans have to be repaid immediately if you cant come up with the cash you would owe both income taxes and a tax penalty on the money borrowed despite all that i still favor funding the k over building up the traditional emergency reserve where you stash six months of living expenses in say a savings account or a money market fund there are two reasons first it is a matter of priorities most of us cant afford to buy the big house send the kids to yale retire in comfort and have a huge emergency reserve so we need to set priorities and it strikes me that our biggest concerns should be those things we know will occur for instance we know we will retire well probably buy a house and one day we may be footing the kids college bills by contrast there is no certainty we will have a financial emergency most of us dont regularly get laid off wrap the car around a telephone pole or need an emergency appendectomy in fact many of us will make it through our entire lives without a major financial crisis that brings me to the second and more important reason for favoring the k over the emergency reserve you are still going to be better off even in a worst case scenario in a typical k arrangement a company kicks in cents for every &# an employee contributes up to of pay imagine you earn &# youre in the federal income tax bracket and you invest the full every year for four years that would mean contributing &# a year or &# over the four years your company would kick in another &# for a total of &# lets assume you dont earn any investment gains so the &# total investment is worth &# after four years and then you get laid off because you dont have an emergency reserve you need to cash out the entire &# that triggers not only income taxes at the rate but also a tax penalty for a total of &# after that brutal tax hit you are left with just &# at this point you are no doubt kicking yourself "if only i had listened to the conventional wisdom forgotten the k and instead socked away some emergency money " you lament suppose you had indeed built up that emergency reserve instead of sticking &# a year into the k you would pay tax at on that &# of earnings leaving you with &# a year to contribute to your emergency reserve result after four years you would have &# salted away less than the &# you would have amassed if you had funded your k to be sure if you had earlier borrowed say &# for an emergency from your k you would have &# less when you got laid off and cashed out your k but that doesnt make the k less attractive after all if you had opted for the emergency reserve instead the &# would have been withdrawn from your reserve so the k would still come out ahead moreover if anything the above example understates the k s advantage we are assuming no investment growth but if you had some gains in your k you would have enjoyed tax deferred investment growth until you cashed out the account in addition we are assuming you were in the tax bracket when you emptied the account but if you lose your job early in the year you may have precious little earnings for that year and thus the tax bill to cash out the account would be modest what if you got laid off late in the year you could roll over your k balance to an individual retirement account wait until january and then empty your ira because you are likely looking at a low income year you might pay almost nothing in taxes on your ira withdrawal allan roth a financial planner in colorado springs colo understands peoples aversion to cashing out their k and paying the tax penalty "its psychological " he says "people want the cash in the bank " but he argues that the employer contribution is so valuable that it swamps the hit from the tax penalty "my advice would be not to touch your k unless you absolutely need to " mr roth says "but even if you have to take the money out youre still better off under just about any imaginable circumstance " jonathan clements also writes the "getting going" column that appears wednesdays in the wall street journal write to him at jonathan clements wsj com
