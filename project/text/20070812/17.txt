whats your workout low gravity but high effort astronaut runs marathon in space online edition the astronaut when sunita williams "crossed" the finish line of the boston marathon this past april there were no rowdy crowds awaiting her at the end of boylston street instead five astronauts cheered her on as they floated in microgravity ms williams an international space station engineer ran the entire race on a treadmill becoming the first person to run a marathon while in orbit she started at the same time as the runners in boston and though ms williams didnt have the rainy boston weather or the challenge of heartbreak hill she did have to deal with an uncomfortable harness holding down her hips and shoulders it took her four hours and minutes to finish she circled the earth nearly three times while running the boston athletic association considered ms williams an official registrant and participant she qualified for the race by running a marathon in houston in but because she was not directly competing in the race ms williams wasnt counted among the finishers in the marathons results book ms williams has her own dedicated page this was the first time the year old astronaut had been in space and she broke a few records while up there ms williams was in orbit for consecutive days from dec to june breaking the day record for a woman in space set by shannon lucid in she also set a new record for the most spacewalk time by a woman logging hours and minutes in four walks ms williams lives in houston with her husband and works at the johnson space center there the workout in space ms williams and her colleagues were required to exercise two and a half hours a day with at least four days a week on the treadmill to counteract the detrimental affects of a nearly zero gravity environment on the body in microgravity heart rates and respiration rates are reduced and there is a progressive loss of body weight and bone calcium weight lifting is essential in order to help maintain bone and muscle mass read more on microgravitys affect on the body a commander with the u s navy ms williams has always kept physically fit her weekly routine on earth included six days of running three days of swimming and three to four days of strength training she competed in triathlons in her spare time and had completed seven marathons before a few times without training first still she knew that running miles on a treadmill while in microgravity would take more serious preparation "you have to be in great shape to go up in space " she says "its a big adjustment for the body and everything is more difficult and requires more energy up there whether its a space walk or performing equipment maintenance " stabilized by wires the treadmill looked more like a torture device than a piece of cardio equipment ms williams used the harness to adjust the amount of force exerted on her body ms williams would run for two hours and then ride a stationary bike and use a bowflex type machine both required being strapped in for weight training which let her perform dead lifts squats and heel lifts on earth she says her pace was usually about eight minutes a mile in space it was about minutes she never ran more than miles during any of her training runs and said she listened to hip hop music and watched movies to help her make it through the marathon upon landing ms williams was required to spend days working out under the supervision of a trainer she wasnt allowed to run for nearly two weeks because cartilage in the spine stretches in space and takes time to solidify she spent her first few days riding a stationary bike and using an elliptical machine at the johnson space center training facility researchers there are studying ms williams to see what happens to the human body during extended time periods in space "i actually came back in pretty good shape and had very little bone loss " she says ms williams is now running on mondays wednesdays and fridays and is up to five miles she does agility and plyometric work with a medicine ball on tuesdays and thursdays she hopes to compete in a seven mile road race this weekend in falmouth mass where the boston athletic association will award her a finishers medal for the marathon as well as a special certificate ms williams also hopes to compete in a mini triathlon at the end of september the diet eating in space can turn into a workout if the astronauts dont pay attention "if anything is too flaky it will get crumbs everywhere and they float around at least if the food is sticky and floats off your spoon its easier to grab " says ms williams noting that most "space food" tends to look like a gooey casserole the russian space food consists of beef pork or fish mixed with vegetables potatoes and rice served in a can which is heated up in the oven "it looks a little like cat or dog food but its very tasty " she says the american food offers more variety including dishes like sweet and sour pork tofu with hoisin sauce or beef lasagna ms williams says tubes of garlic hot pepper and pesto helped add flavor ms williams says she is a healthy eater and the thing she missed most in space was fresh fruits and vegetables still now that shes back on earth she says she gets excited knowing she can have sushi or pizza for dinner the cost ms williamss costs are minimal she has free access to the gym and pool facilities at the space center the effort ms williams says she was able to get used to running in the uncomfortable harness but rehydrating during the actual marathon was tricky she had to sip water filled packets resembling juice boxes that were suspended near the treadmill colleagues would squeeze the water and as the droplets floated by ms williams would gulp them down adjusting to life back on earth took some time "it was overwhelming to come home to houston and be with so many people " she says the benefit says ms williams "i didnt know if i would even finish the race but i wanted to raise awareness of making exercise a part of daily life even when youre an astronaut " write to jen murphy at workout wsj com
