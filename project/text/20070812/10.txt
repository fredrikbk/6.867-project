love &amp money when kids are appreciative not sometimes a little appreciation is all you want sometimes a little aggravation is all you get several weeks ago just before taking our son to a pricey soccer camp my wife amy and i took him shopping to buy the gear he needed for the camp and for his coming season on one of the local premier teams he showed his gratitude by throwing a bunch of attitude in our face when certain things didnt go his way in a moment of frustration back in the car amy beat me to the punch turning to our year old son and saying "do you realize how much money this family is spending on your soccer it would be nice if you showed some appreciation for what were doing for you " our parental guilt trip did the trick he stopped sassing us but looking back on the event im not so sure our approach was the best one sure we made him feel ashamed enough to be quiet but did he really get the point i doubt it he knew enough to feel bad about what he said but not enough to be truly appreciative for the money we had spent so how do you get kids to appreciate the financial efforts you put forth on their behalf and what are the risks we parents assume when we use tactics like guilt when trying to drive home our message i imagine many parents have dealt with this on some level kids are notorious for taking for granted what we do for them often seemingly oblivious to the fact that as our own parents once reminded us money doesnt grow on trees spend &# or &# or even &# and within five minutes its "what have you done for me lately " you try the rational route explaining how long it takes mom and dad to earn the money necessary to pay for items a tactic amy and i have used but the concept is too vague and too complicated for them to understand they dont work so for them the difference between a &# item and a &# item is pretty much meaningless you try making them spend their own money thinking a good lesson in personal finance will have them rethinking their insolence only with younger kids theyre not really earning that money theyre spending an allowance that while it might require some relatively menial work effectively comes from mom and dad plus unlike parents they dont have major expenses to plan for or household needs to fund so if they run out of cash its not like theyre going to starve or face eviction basically they have no authentic financial pressures to shape their spending decisions and so you ultimately fall back on guilt hoping comments like those that amy made will shame your child into appreciating your efforts today and into the future but as a longtime friend in new jersey knows its just another example of parents fooling themselves he says his preteen daughter routinely demonstrates a lack of appreciation about his financial efforts and his attempts to change that always seem to fall flat "well be on vacation " he says "and i will have spent a lot of money doing things during the day with her too much money really then ill say no to some additional want she has and all i get is disappointment it can even erase everything else we did that day " he typically responds to her unhappiness with "ive already spent a lot money today and it was all for you " but he says that clearly rings false the main problem he says is that "a lot of money" doesnt mean much to her "its just a number " he says "a &# beanie baby is sort of equivalent to a &# theater ticket or a &# weekend trip to an amusement park she doesnt truly appreciate them any differently because she doesnt make money so how could she really understand why i want a lot more appreciation for one over the other " still he says "when i do the guilt trip thing shell thank me and say she appreciates it and shell usually stop complaining at least out loud but its frustrating because i can tell they are just words it isnt coming from her heart " its a common tool guilt but is it effective if not what is effective and how do you get kids to show appreciation which isnt a natural sense built into them as i did last week i sought advice on this from denise a friend in san francisco who is trained to help people manage financial conflicts that arise in relationships amys intention with her remark denise says "was right on you want your child to show appreciation and understand what his family is doing but guilt does not create appreciation it creates feelings that a child is a burden to the family and they end up internalizing these feelings and blame themselves for everything in the family " the problem denise says "is with the parents not the kids the focus of many families today is on more and when that more is continually given it dilutes a persons experiences of giving thanks and being appreciative of what they have "kids generally have nothing to contrast their life against all that most have experienced is abundance they havent experienced the lack so they have no way to intuitively come to a place of appreciation and parents arent helping them get there when their own focus is on the more and not the thanks " denises suggested remedy help your kids build that contrast into their life and infuse a sense of gratitude into your family routines "volunteer work like at a soup kitchen will help them experience directly the real differences that exist in life " she says "and every day make it part of your ritual maybe at the dinner table to show gratitude for something that day that is not material " this will take some time she says "research with adults shows the brain takes several months to shift the way it thinks " as for the guilt trips "avoid them " denise says "instead try to step back and speak from your own experiences with appreciation and how it relates to this incident guilt isnt going to work and at some point its going to affect the way your child thinks " jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal write him at lovemoney wsj com
