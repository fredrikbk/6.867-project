oriented portfolio can smooth the rough patches spreading your money across different types of assets is the best way to reduce investment risk if market volatility makes you nervous it probably means youre not diversified enough or that your investments are mismatched with your tolerance for risk understand that time in the market is more important to your returns than timing the market keep in
