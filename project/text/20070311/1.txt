email bulletin to its american customers the subject how to reset the clock in their mercedes to adjust for daylight savings time see the email its not that mercedes customers are less technically savvy than they used to be the cars are just very complicated especially for americans who by and large dont bother reading owners manuals now worried that too many customers dont fully appreciate what they have luxury car makers are stepping up efforts to educate owners on the fine points of operating their increasingly high tech rides audi of america for example last november launched a series of video podcasts designed to explain various features of new audis in two to three minute bites the idea says scott keogh vice president for marketing for audi of america was to build a "bridge" between the owners manual and the experience of just driving the car initially the videos were available only through audis web site then audi started posting them on apples itunes and downloads jumped from per day to a day says bethany verrill audis manager for online marketing "this is a staggering number " she says "we are the number one auto brand on itunes for vodcasts " audi marketers are delighted of course that what began as a training aide has become an adjunct to their marketing strategy which is to convince luxury car shoppers that audis are technically superior vehicles mr keogh and ms verrill say audi sales people are downloading the videos to use as prompts when they are guiding buyers around their new cars at dealerships audis experience points to a challenge luxury brands face most luxury car brands train dealer sales and service personnel extensively in the art of delivering a new car but the reality is that neither sales people nor most customers are keen to spend an hour or two at the dealership marching through a tutorial on all the controls and systems in a new vehicle having just agreed to spend for a new chariot the equivalent of tuition for a year or two or three at a top ranked liberal arts college most people just want to get in the thing and drive but then the problems crop up mercedes took hits in a recent j d power and associates new car quality survey for problems with the side rear view mirrors on certain vehicles the "problem" was that the mirrors automatically tilted down when the vehicle was put into reverse the better to see obstacles lurking in blind spots behind the car but some customers got rattled by the unfamiliar new feature and expressed their frustration on the j d power questionnaires

three years ago and began investing more in programs designed to make sure dealership employees understood the complex cars they were selling and servicing harry hynekamp mercedes benz usas manager for training says his department created a simulator a year before the s class came to america to give dealer and mercedes employees the chance to experience how its s comand vehicle controller works the better to explain it to customers see a demo mercedes has also begun designing training programs so they are more fun a new course to familiarize dealer employees with the technology of the new cl for example is presented in a format similar to "jeopardy " while much of this material is directly available only to dealers mr hynekamp says they can and do offer access to customers meanwhile mercedes is expanding efforts to reach out directly to owners through a dedicated owners only web site and through email bulletins like the how to about resetting the clocks german luxury cars tend to set the standard for user unfriendliness and complexity in their controls but as rival brands have tried to keep pace with german engineering they too are discovering that handing the customer the keys and waving goodbye isnt good enough at toyota motor corp s lexus brand for example theres concern that buyers of the new ls sedan wont automatically get the hang of using the cars innovative self parking system the wow feature that lexus highlights in its ads see a video lexus slips instructional dvds into its cars that allow owners to absorb information about the cars at their own pace lexus is intensifying training of dealer personnel and encouraging dealers to hold owner appreciation nights inviting new ls buyers to come to the showroom for some socializing and tutorials on using the cars technology in about a month lexus plans to add a podcast on it web site that will explain features of its most high tech car to date the lsh gasoline electric hybrid charles hubbard lexuss dealer education administrator says "i could spend a day" explaining every feature of a new ls a sales person could spend two hours or so talking through the features he adds but "after i just spent &# &# im not going to sit there for two or three hours to see how it all works " mr hubbard says thats why lexus is urging dealers to train all their employees and then encourage owners to come back to the dealerships after theyve had the car two or three weeks the secret of the parking feature i didnt figure it out just driving the car but mr hubbard or someone who has absorbed his instruction course can explain it in about five minutes perhaps with the help of a full color pdf presentation its best for instance to position your lexus so that it is about three to five feet away from the side of the forward car with you the driver parallel to the other cars front bumper under those conditions the system has a much better shot of working as advertised of course all this is in the ls s owners manual but who reads that send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
