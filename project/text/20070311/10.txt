real time anxious times for net radio music industry wants higher royalties but are labels undermining themselves online edition is internet radio in trouble last week the copyright royalty board released a ruling proposing new performance royalty rates for online radio stations an online radio station would pay cent per song per listener for the rates are retroactive cent in in cents in and cents in seems like little enough but it adds up and this small change is a big change for small webcasters under a deal brokered in small webcasters had met their royalty obligations by paying artists and record labels of revenue but the new rules would do away with that exemption net radio operators have sounded the alarm kurt hanson founder of online radio company accuradio told my print colleague sarah mcbride that he estimated the new rules would raise accuradios royalty payments to about &# more than accuradios revenue from about &# and he warns others face similarly tough math arguing that even well run net radio stations would see performance royalties eat up all their annual revenue and thats before the need to pay royalties to composers performance royalties and composer royalties are separate the former are paid to artists and record labels while the latter are paid to songwriters and music publishers "terrestrial" broadcasters who stream radio would also pay more and public radio stations would no longer be able to pay a flat fee as agreed to in a previous deal "left unchanged these rates will end internet radio " pandora com co founder tim westergren warned on pandoras blog pandora a combination streaming audio service and recommendation engine could be particularly hard hit by the new rules as a multichannel operator the service would have to pay &# per channel that has a certain number of listener hours pandora has million users each of whom can have up to channels you can see why the company is worried to be sure theres a lot left to this story it makes more sense to view whats happening now as hardball negotiating than as an endgame besides the possibility of striking a deal webcasters can appeal and internet radio fans are signing petitions and writing letters to their representatives it isnt clear if congress will step in before the appeals process runs its course but lawmakers have taken notice rep edward markey d mass said in a hearing last week that "this represents a body blow to many nascent internet radio broadcasters and further exacerbates the marketplace imbalance between what different industries pay " then theres the possibility that the furor could spill over to the proposed merger between sirius satellite radio and xm satellite radio those companies have argued they should be allowed to team up in part because satellite radio competes with internet radio net radio fans are angry but they shouldnt be too hasty in blasting the copyright royalty board the real problem is a pair of misguided decisions made by congress in the s tim hanrahan and i wrote about this issue nearly five years ago and its depressing to see how little has changed a brief recap the digital millennium copyright act of building on s digital performance rights in sounds recordings act said net radio firms had to pay performance royalties on songs played in addition to composer royalties on those songs terrestrial radio stations pay composer royalties but they dont pay performance royalties under the long established rationale that record labels benefit from the promotional value of songs played on the radio so if a clear channel radio station plays that new fergie song over the air it doesnt pay a performance royalty but if it streams fergie over the net or satellite radio it does make sense to you of course not because that makes no sense whatsoever treating the two as different is missing the radio forest for the internet trees in a sane world lawmakers would treat radio as radio regardless of how its delivered for the recording industrys disingenuous analysis of the law governing radio and royalties read our real time which preserves part of a recording industry association of america faq thats been taken down the recording industry maintains that net radio operators arent in danger of going under this time either thanks to steadily increasing advertising revenues all this aside ive become a fan of pandora since writing about it here and perhaps my recent experience with the service will serve as a warning to the recording industry of what it could be losing pandora has become one of the most important ways i find new music its a very simple service you visit its web site and tell it a handful of songs and or artists you like and it generates a streaming audio channel for you which you then refine by telling it you like a song dislike it or are tired of it if i like a song i give it a thumbs up which simultaneously prompts pandora to change my music channel to take that into account and bookmarks the song for later last week i went through my pandora profile to see all the songs id given a thumbs up to since last summer i played little snippets of the songs id indicated i liked then i went over to emusic and itunes and bought songs by bands none of which id heard of before finding them on pandora i added my new purchases to my latest itunes playlist put on my ipod and have been playing them nonstop since then thirteen songs isnt a lot but its only been a week i know ill wind up buying more songs by those bands and some full albums by the bands i decide i really like im excited to find out that there are four albums by the dagons whose gleefully noisy "heaven wasnt in the sky" is my new favorite song ill recommend the songs that have staying power to my friends perhaps leading some of them to buy them and ill keep listening to pandora leading to more songs getting a thumbs up and more music bought to me that virtuous circle sure sounds like the old "radio is free promotion" bargain underlying traditional radio for which performance royalties have never been paid in the u s yes there are technological differences between terrestrial radio and net radio notably the ability to guide whats played skip songs and keep track of what i like but those differences seem to work to the advantage of artists and record labels with net radio im more likely to hear songs i like bookmark them and buy them one listeners experiences arent necessarily grounds for extrapolation but this bargain seems like a pretty good deal for the recording industry one it ought to be careful about altering should net radio be treated differently from terrestrial radio why or why not any experiences with net radio write to me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
