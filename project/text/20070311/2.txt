getting going how good people make bad investments investing isnt hard work and thats just one of the problems for many folks managing money is an exercise in frustration we summon the skills that work so well in the rest of our lives apply them to the financial markets and end up with lackluster results here are just some of the qualities that help us at home and at the office but leave us flailing around in the stock and bond markets we stay busy if we want to get ahead at work or we want to whip the garden into shape we get busy activity doesnt just seem virtuous it also gives us a comforting sense of control especially if were dealing with a crisis but in the financial markets staying busy is a bad idea to be sure if our portfolios are messed up we will need to straighten things out initially but once weve finished revamping our investments often the wisest course is to keep activity to a minimum "the less investors do the better their results " says meir statman a finance professor at santa clara university in california "if you trade in all likelihood you have a portfolio thats not diversified you are hit with both unnecessary risk and trading costs " that said even investors with rock solid portfolios will likely make a few trades each year every months or so you should rebalance so you maintain your target portfolio percentages for sectors like large stocks smaller companies foreign shares and bonds you might also do some occasional selling in your taxable account to realize tax losses athletes who train hard are more likely to win students who study conscientiously are more likely to get good grades what about investors who diligently research their stocks theyll probably earn mediocre returns the fact is the markets are full of savvy investors all hunting for cheap stocks result if there are any bargains to be had they dont stay that way for long indeed much of the time share prices are a pretty good reflection of currently available information "if you put in more effort youll end up with worse results " reckons terry burnham co author of "mean genes" and director of economics at bostons acadian asset management "its not the work its the action that comes out of the work thats the problem " every time we buy a supposedly bargain priced stock we incur commissions and other trading costs in addition if we trade in our taxable account we may trigger big tax bills further denting our returns our hard work and our preference for activity lead us to trade too much and to make undiversified investment bets but the damage to our portfolios is also driven by one of our more endearing traits our optimism "there is good evidence that optimists are more likely to remarry they recover faster from surgery and they adjust more easily to life transitions like leaving home for college " prof statman says "but unrealistic optimism is something you want to check at the door when you enter the financial markets being optimistic about your investment abilities will lose you money " need to buy a refrigerator find a new doctor or book a trip to paris for advice well often turn to folks who have recently grappled with these issues and thats usually a smart strategy but with investments relying on whats recently worked well can be a disaster "in the financial markets your backward looking brain decides it likes a particular stock or a particular asset class " mr burnham says "the problem is others with similar backward looking brains reach the same conclusion now youve got an investment thats popular and that makes it a bad investment by definition popular investments are overpriced " when we shop for a new computer or a new stereo we typically assume that greater sophistication is better that reputation is worth something and that a products price bears some relationship to its quality but wall street is different if a mutual fund charges high fees it is more likely to lag behind the market if a company is widely admired its shares may be overvalued if an investment product is deemed sophisticated its often difficult to figure out how it will really perform "i never buy or recommend an investment product i couldnt explain to my year old son " says allan roth a financial planner with wealth logic in colorado springs colo we want to get that promotion have a greener lawn than our neighbors and see our favorite "american idol" win "its un american to try to be average " mr roth notes "a tie is like kissing your sister " yet in the financial markets aiming for average is the surest way to come out ahead we cant all outperform the market because together we are the market in fact once investment costs are figured in we will collectively trail the market averages what to do we could tap into our optimism and commit to working harder and trading more but all that will likely do is generate a fistful of investment costs and leave us lagging further behind the market averages thats why i favor building a globally diversified mix of index funds you might put say of your portfolio in an index fund that tracks the broad u s stock market in a foreign stock index fund and in a bond index fund you could build this sort of portfolio with mutual funds from fidelity investments t rowe price charles schwab and vanguard alternatively you could use exchange traded index funds your index funds will simply replicate the performance of the underlying markets minus a small sum for fund expenses sound dull you may be more excited when you look at your results and you realize theyre so much better than those earned by optimistic hard working active investors jonathan clements also writes the "getting going" column that appears wednesdays in the wall street
