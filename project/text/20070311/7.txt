love &amp money why fund raising isnt childs play a couple of times a year my son comes home with an assignment that is supposed to warm our hearts fund raising but to be honest it always leaves me cold its always the same old painful drill my son carries a clutch of papers that for all he cares could be written in sanskrit the only thing he sees is the catalog filled with pictures of the prizes he can win if he raises a ton of money for some cause he cant even identify and it gets worse my son has no interest in peddling products door to door i have no interest in letting him in part because we dont know every neighbor and in part because im opposed to letting my son donate free labor to for profit companies that run many of these nonprofit fund raising efforts and keep a percentage of the money raised ultimately the only thing my son cares about is winning some overpriced award since he hasnt the time to sell this stuff to begin with he wants me and his mom to find buyers or to pony up our own cash and when we wont he wants to spend all of his money to buy ever more boxes of whatever the fund raiser of the day is pitching this isnt the way its supposed to work fund raisers should be about giving to instill in kids the joy of working hard for a worthy cause or those in need whether its getting sponsors for a run a thon to support cancer research or selling wrapping paper to help the school afford some particular project but the reality is so different for kids fund raising becomes either a game removed from the cause itself or more often something they slough off onto their parents who end up buying candles and cookie dough they dont want and dont need i dont blame my son though i blame the fund raisers if you ever seek confirmation that for kids fund raisers have little to do with the cause listen to a bunch of preteens chatter about their fund raising plans ive had that experience recently and all i heard was jabbering about sleeping bags and telescopes and metal detectors the kids saw in the catalog not a word about the product popcorn or the cause cub scouts not everybody is as down on this as i am when i told my friend alex in new york about the episode and about my son wanting to pony up all of his own cash to win a metal detector she essentially said "so what " "he has identified something he wants " alex says "and there is some work involved in getting it whether its old fashioned manipulation of mom and dad in getting them to buy more or its knocking on doors or if hes using his own money then hes self funding in the business world thats creative "the spirit of altruism is not as strong as you might like " she adds "but theres still value in the process " for the record alex says she was a "very competitive girl scout cookie seller i wanted the badges and the recognition and i wanted to be the no cookie seller " she concedes that she signed her mother up for more boxes than she actually wanted "and i dont think she knows she bought those extra boxes im not really proud of that " but most parents i talked to were in my camp to my friend erik in atlanta the current fund raising model is "dated " largely because it relies on kids selling goods door to door in an age when many parents arent about to let their kids knock on a strangers door in fact many organizations and schools forbid such soliciting but that means its up to the kids translation parents to sell over the phone worse all the parents youre calling are at that same moment trying to hawk for their kids the same batch of goodies its a vicious circle of you buy from me ill buy from you and in the middle are kids who have no real skin in the game "i have little tolerance for my kids fund raising efforts " erik says "because it invariably becomes dads fund raising effort " deanna my friend in milwaukee is even more adamant "i have decided to boycott fund raisers altogether i cannot stand them " she has three kids so she has had "three different fund raisers thrown at us at the same time " she says "and its inevitable we end up buying the stuff ourselves or we bother relatives who live out of state and then we have to mail the items to them " to avoid the hassles many parents i know simply cheat a close friend on the east coast serves as a perfect example when the sign up sheet arrives she writes down mom dad aunt uncle grandma and sometimes even the dog "and i end up footing the entire bill myself " she says "its just easier and i dont bug anyone " but do kids get anything out of that aside from the prize just a few weeks ago my son finished his popcorn selling adventure he cared about just one thing selling more than &# worth of popcorn largely to his parents and grandparents earning him a &# sleeping bag he was disappointed that he didnt get enough to win the metal detector and slightly miffed that mom and i hadnt let him spend more of his own money on more tins of fairly stale popcorn amy my wife is definitely a more willing participant in the fund raising game than i am she gladly buys from other parents and happily calls around to friends and family yet even she is troubled at times by the impact on kids and the obligations ultimately imposed on parents we do however feel trapped wed love to skip the whole thing and tell our son to do the same but then we look like jerks to our kids to other parents to the school or whatever organization is raising the money so we soldier on making the calls writing the checks hoping that the true meaning of the exercise sinks in somehow but heres my recommendation if schools or organizations need money just ask its far more palatable to pay &# directly and to encourage my son to contribute a small amount too than it is spending &# on stuff i dont want knowing that only a portion of my money actually makes it to the organization in the end why do i need popcorn to make fund raising taste better jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the
