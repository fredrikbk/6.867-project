no breathing easy on global stage emerging markets lose a bit of their resilience now face stress test the wave of volatility that is sweeping across emerging markets underscores how these countries often the source of economic problems are now on the receiving end troubles that began with u s mortgages were felt in markets such as brazil turkey and indonesia yesterday sending stocks bonds and currencies lower the msci emerging markets index fell the dramatic turnaround in u s stocks in the last hour of trading helped some financial stocks in asia rebound early friday but markets across the region were generally lower the volatility radiating from the u s is a test for emerging markets yesterdays emerging market selloff came at a time when the economic fundamentals in many of these countries looked stronger than they had in many years that should make them better positioned to weather the upheaval now but many investors are wondering about weak points in regions that have been through decades of financial stress until recently the bonds and currencies in these countries were surprisingly resilient even after yesterdays selloff bonds issued by emerging market governments continued to hold up better than similarly rated credit instruments in developed markets the debt of general motors corp carries a lower credit rating than do the governments of brazil pakistan and indonesia financial crises swept through asia latin america and russia in the s and s but a boom in commodity prices and a years long squeeze on budget deficits has put many of these economies on sounder financial footing another important element has been expunging what harvard university economist ricardo hausmann famously called the "original sin" for latin american governments borrowing abroad in dollars the same problem crushed asia in the s as debts became harder to repay when their local currencies declined fast forward almost years countries like china brazil and russia seem to be bulletproof from outside financial shocks thanks to mounting foreign currency reserves for instance latin american reserves on average have quadrupled since with brazil leading the pack its foreign reserves are forecast to reach &# billion by years end according to credit suisse up from &# billion in the economies of developing countries grew at a blistering pace of last year according to the world bank compared with growth in developed countries but there are other ways emerging markets could suffer if the u s economy slows their exports could be hurt moreover slowing growth in developed economies could knock down commodity prices which have helped to drive many of these economies in recent years dr hausmann cautions against crediting latin american governments too much with the regions improving balance sheets mostly he chalks up rising foreign reserves and fast economic growth to an unusually robust commodities boom and other factors outside the control of governments he faults countries including mexico brazil and chile for allowing spending to rise and not putting away enough for a downturn in the commodities cycle "in the good times everyone looks like a genius " dr hausmann said "i would attribute of the improvement to good international commodity prices and high global growth " chinas domestic stock market which is up almost this year is a bit of a wild card in the global picture some investors fear that its speculation driven market could crash and dampen consumer sentiment another worry that the chinese government will be obliged to raise interest rates to slow the countrys breakneck growth which could in turn affect other emerging markets other developing countries are vulnerable for different reasons turkey hungary and south africa for instance still depend on financing from abroad to make up the difference between what they save and what they spend the cost of that financing is rising "if you have no money in the bank and your credit card rate goes up its a problem " says curtis mewbourne co head of emerging markets at bond giant pacific investment management co "but if you have big savings in the bank its not such a big problem " the bonds of countries where investors have concerns about the direction of government economic policy such as venezuela ecuador and argentina are also taking large hits venezuela scrapped a planned bond sale yesterday overall though "there is still quite a lot of resilience" in bonds issued by developing countries says joyce chang head of emerging markets at j p morgan one sign russian gas giant gazprom was able to sell a year &# billion bond issue last week that was nearly three times oversubscribed even with global credit markets in a virtual lockdown at the level of individual companies
