weekend journal food &amp drink when beer takes on vintners airs small brewers have long boasted that their beer can stand up to the finest wine their new strategy make beer that tastes like wine deploying everything from wine yeasts to aging in wine barrels and caves brewers from maine to california are turning out golden beers that smell like chardonnay and dark ales with the essence of port delawares dogfish head craft brewery recently released red &amp white a white beer brewed with orange peel and the juice of pinot noir grapes allagash brewing co in portland maine makes its victor ale with a dash of chancellor grapes and ferments the beer with a red wine yeast and in santa rosa calif russian river brewing co makes a handful of beers that are aged in wine barrels for as long as years before bottling the concept with all of these brews add extra layers of complexity to a beverage that many people think of as plain and even watery winey beers are a hybrid of sorts they are carbonated like beer and brewed with the same malted barley and hops yet they usually have a stronger aroma fruitier tastes and alcohol levels that at to are two to three times that of a typical beer theyre also supposed to be drunk warmer port brewing co in san marcos calif recommends its angels share ale be stored and served at to degrees the "cellar temperature" of wine even the packaging and pricing mimic wine these beers cost &# or more for a milliliter about ounce bottle the same quantity as a standard wine bottle that often is secured with a cork instead of a cap winey beers are something of a detour for craft brewers over the past decade many of these small outfits have focused on beers loaded with the bitter taste of hops according to the brewers association a trade group for small brewers the most popular style of craft beer is the hoppy pale ale which together with its hoppier cousin the india pale ale account for of craft beer by sales paul gatza director of the brewers association says winey beers are quite new "theres really not a terminology" for them he says whats happening is an american take on a belgian tradition brewers there have pushed boundaries by incorporating ingredients ranging from fruit to wild yeasts a popular belgian style lambic beers comes in flavors such as raspberry and peach and the final product is usually blended from two or more different beers blending also is a critical feature of many of the winey beers because it gives brewers better control over the taste of the product in the u s winey beers started popping up only a few years ago part of the motivation is novelty in an increasingly crowded field a distinctive beer can be a big marketing boost for a young brewery most craft brewers remain too small to run campaigns in glossy magazines or buy television spots so they rely on word of mouth to increase sales but selling fancy beer in single bottles is also good business "everybody along the distribution chain loves the margins on those big bottles " says randy mosher a brewery consultant and instructor at the siebel institute of technology and world brewing academy in chicago the &# billion u s craft beer segment roughly defined as breweries that make small batches of beer and arent owned by a big beer or spirits company accounts for just of total beer sales in the country by volume but the segment is growing much faster than the broader industry total volume rose to about million gallons in up over the prior three years that compares with volume growth for the overall beer industry in the same period according to trade publication beer marketers insights for more than a decade vinnie cilurzo owner of russian river brewing has been known for making bitter high alcohol beers with names such as "pliny the elder " in he went in a new direction releasing temptation ale a blonde beer aged in barrels that previously held chardonnay and thus impart some of the wine flavor to the brew mr cilurzo who grew up at a winery in southern california said his idea was to take some elements of lambic beers including brettanomyces a wild yeast that adds an earthy flavor to the beer and combine them with wine flavors vintners by contast go to great lengths to keep brettanomyces out of their wine today russian river has a handful of winey beers including supplication a brown ale aged in pinot noir barrels with sour cherries and depuration made with white wine grapes and two types of bacteria after starting with aging barrels russian river now has about and is building a brewery that will have room for equal to about milliliter bottles "its helped with our brand recognition absolutely " he says the comparisons to wine go beyond taste in the marketing material given to distributors dogfish head suggests food cheese pairings and a wine counterpart for its brews and because of their high alcohol content many of these beers can be aged for a decade or longer on a recent afternoon we gathered a panel of reporters and editors made up of both beer and wine fans to sample winey beers from around the country our first discovery these beers arent for everyone comments ranged from "interesting" to "terrible " a number of our testers said most of the brews tasted like neither beer nor wine but made them pine for one or the other "is it possible that there is beer and wine and the two should never meet " asked one befuddled sampler still enterprising beer drinkers will definitely want to try a few our favorite was port brewings angels share which weighs in at a hefty alcohol and is aged in brandy barrels for six to eight months it tastes and smells like port prompting one of our testers to say he could imagine sipping a glass of it on a winter evening by the fire dorothy j gaiter and john brecher are on vacation
