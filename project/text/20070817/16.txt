contagion effect markets fear u s woes will hit global growth overseas stocks dive commodities down metals ventures at risk the dramatic selloff yesterday in overseas stock markets and commodities signals increasing worry among investors that the credit market mess in the u s could trigger a slowdown in global economic growth the market developments tempered only by a late day comeback in u s stocks offered an example of how intertwined the worlds financial system has become what started as a meltdown in one sector of the u s bond market has led to fears of a wider credit crunch that could affect economies from south korea to mexico "today is the first day that markets are asking questions as to whether global growth is going to be significantly affected " said jim oneill head of global economic research at goldman sachs "today feels quite scary frankly " it was only three weeks ago that the international monetary fund raised its outlook for global economic growth this year and next while the imf acknowledged that u s growth would fall short of its earlier forecasts it predicted that fast rising china and india helped by a cyclical upswing in japan and europe would more than pick up the slack the scenario that worries investors around the world starts with a u s slowdown set off by lower housing prices and tougher lending standards that would lead the u s to import fewer computers cars and sneakers hurting big exporters such as china and south korea those countries have been big buyers of commodities driving up the prices of oil and metals if they eased back that would hurt big commodity producers such as brazil and put some large risky commodity ventures around the world at risk mohamed el erian head of the company that invests harvard universitys &# billion endowment believes the more optimistic picture of global growth still has merit as long as the u s economic slowdown is gradual and doesnt result in a recession "the next few weeks will be a test of this thesis " he said goldman sachss mr oneill and some other economists remain confident that consumers in large emerging markets such as china will go on buying earlier this week china reported retail sales growth of in july the highest such figure in three years that means chinese consumers made roughly the same contribution to world economic growth that month as u s consumers notes mr oneill meanwhile domestic demand and trade with the developing world may help europes economic powers continue their recent healthy performance the global selloff began late wednesday in the u s as credit market worries hit countrywide financial corp one of the biggest mortgage lenders and a fund affiliated with buyout firm kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co it picked up steam in asia where the japanese market fell hong kong dropped and south korea fell european stocks followed with u k stocks down and germany down the selling continued in the u s with the dow jones industrial average falling more than points before a powerful rebound brought the u s market back to near where it started the day the dow finished down points or at some of the late day recovery stemmed from anticipation that central banks in the u s europe and japan will respond to the market weakness the bank of japans policy making board meets next week and may hold off on an interest rate increase that had been anticipated earlier the european central bank meets sept the u s federal reserve meets sept the market expects a u s interest rate cut then or even earlier although the fed hasnt given any clear signals to encourage that expectation commodities prices were sharply down as were companies tied to commodities and global growth crude oil futures fell &# to &# a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange nickel a key ingredient in stainless steel fell on the london metal exchange and is below its recent peak price reached in may freeport mcmoran copper &amp gold inc finished down

expected the u s to be the globes laggard in its july update on global economic growth the imf said it expects the american economy to grow only this year down from its april projection of it predicted the world will grow this year up from the prediction in april art steinmetz who manages &# billion in emerging market securities at oppenheimerfunds inc said consumers in china and other fast growing countries will help pick up some of the slack "in the global economy the u s is still the dog and the rest of the world is still the tail " he said "but whats happening now is that the dog is getting a little smaller and the tail a little bigger " a decade ago it was emerging markets in southeast asia and elsewhere that sparked crisis fears around the world today these countries are on more solid footing having reduced their foreign debt and imposed greater financial discipline still countries such as russia brazil and indonesia remain vulnerable because their growth has been driven by the boom in commodities in latin america strong commodity prices have helped fill government coffers allowing politicians to pile up new spending commitments says harvard economist ricardo hausmann still he believes latin american economies are generally strong enough to withstand the u s slowdown until earlier this week stocks in emerging markets had fallen roughly in line with u s and european stocks now a fresh wave of selling is pummeling these shares over the course of wednesday and thursday the msci emerging markets index fell in dollar terms such volatility is not unheard of in these markets over the course of roughly a month last year they tumbled the msci index remains up so far this year perhaps the most vulnerable emerging market economy is mexico because of its reliance on exports to the u s and remittances from mexican immigrants in the u s thousands of mexican workers who helped build american houses during the boom have lost their jobs economists earlier expected remittances to rise this year but now expect them to be flat the markets movements this week have raised fresh questions about how long the multiyear commodities boom can continue among the worst performing commodities yesterday on the comex division of the new york mercantile exchange was copper which fell and silver down some metals traders said hedge funds were under pressure to reduce their metals holdings to meet quarterly redemption requests from investors until now commodities have been relatively well insulated from the problems in the stock and credit markets wayne atwell founder of a greenwich conn fund that invests in the natural resources sector called yesterdays sharp falls a "forced liquidation " commodities and stocks of commodity producers have been on such a good run that they are easy targets for profit taking when investors run into trouble unloading now risky debt he said "what were going through now is inevitable its just a question of how bad i think a lot of commodities are being forced down below levels where they really should be " said mr atwell a former morgan stanley mining analyst he added "unfortunately its probably not over yet " any sustained downturn in commodity prices would hit the earnings of mining companies including anglo australian powerhouses bhp billiton and rio tinto which were already struggling to adjust to higher costs at mining sites world wide rio tinto said earlier this month that profit for the first half of the year fell compared with a year earlier to &# billion due partly to rising labor and materials costs in a note to clients earlier this month analysts at citigroup noted that trouble in u s credit markets could "significantly increase" the cost of funding for rio tintos &# billion bid for canadian aluminum company alcan inc announced in july the bank noted that an increase of one percentage point in the cost of borrowing would equate to an additional &# million in interest annually mining companies played their hands cautiously for much of the recent rise in commodity prices aware that previous booms had turned to bust but as evidence mounted that demand in china and elsewhere would stay strong many companies began taking on riskier projects among them the &# billion goro nickel project by brazils companhia vale do rio doces on the south pacific island of new caledonia company officials reconsidered the project during the last year amid cost overruns and other problems but it decided to press ahead amid intense demand for nickel now the project is supposed to come on line as early as next year at a time when many analysts believe nickel prices will be well below their recent peaks other expensive projects that could be vulnerable include rio tintos planned oyu
