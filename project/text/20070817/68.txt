politics &amp economics chinas politics remains secretive big decisions loom at congress but few know when it will occur beijing thousands of top communist party members soon will gather to lay out chinas development plans and decide the careers of many political hopefuls among them an eventual successor to the party chief beijings most powerful figure this highly anticipated th national congress of the communist party of china is scheduled to take place in september or possibly october or maybe november actually no one outside the partys innermost circle knows for sure when it will get under way it is an uncertainty that underscores the secrecy with which china is still run even as its increasingly open economy is on track this year to become the worlds third largest behind those of the u s and japan some political observers predict the congress which is held every five years will take place soon after chinas national day on oct others say that isnt certain because the decision could change with the whims of president hu jintao and the tiny group who lead the party with him an announcement could come in the next several days or weeks on wednesday chinas government launched a campaign to crack down on false media reporting ahead of the congress on grounds that such reporting could destabilize society the campaign will run until oct chinas peoples daily newspaper announced leading to more speculation that the big event will take place right after that date but for now senior party officials say they too are in the dark "im just like you i have no idea " said gan yisheng the secretary general of the central commission for discipline inspection the party arm responsible for fighting corruption at a news conference here this month the secrecy deeply rooted in the partys history as a revolutionary group in the first half of the last century survives today in part for practical reasons in this case not announcing a date far in advance makes it difficult for potential protesters to plan ahead but as much as anything analysts say the secrecy may flow from the difficulty of reaching decisions in chinas consensus driven system for months now senior officials throughout the bureaucracy from mr hu down have been engaged in behind the scenes maneuvering to ensure that they or their supporters win important positions in the new hierarchy to be announced at the congress the most pressing question who will be on the roster of the ultrapowerful standing committee of the partys political bureau or politburo the complicated jockeying is important because in china the party sets the governments main policies and assigns its top personnel so decisions made at the congress will determine changes to chinas bureaucracy from vice premiers to the central bank governor to assorted provincial posts interest is especially high now because this congress represents the first in recent decades when there is no clear successor to the partys top official mr hu will remain in his post as general secretary but is expected to retire at the next session in five years party protocol dictates that any possible successor needs to have been named to the standing committee this time to ensure at least five years of experience in the body in the past party leaders had settled on a single successor by this point now however analysts say as many as four possible successors are among those vying to join the standing committee on which mr hu will retain his spot this years promotions are expected to be part of a major generational shift elevating a group of party operatives in their s who have largely come of age professionally during chinas overhaul era which started in many in this group known as the "fifth generation" of leaders have been trained in the law economics or politics a shift from the current leaders who mainly studied engineering or other hard sciences their credentials could make them better prepared to run chinas increasingly sophisticated economy "they are not technocrats " says cheng li a chinese politics expert at the brookings institution think tank in washington "they are more exposed to western ideas" than chinas current leaders no one outside the partys inner circle knows for sure who will be promoted least of all ordinary chinese who tend to see the congress as remote from their daily lives some observers think a woman might even be appointed to the top ranks this year following years of lobbying by female cadres in years past the congress has often been held in september or october the most recent one in began on nov a date first publicly announced on aug that year many citizens may not really take notice until its opening day when the state media are certain to report heavily on events "that is already an improvement" from the s and s "when you heard that the country just held its party congress after it has ended and the delegates have gone home " says liang yingming a party member and retired political scientist at peking university zhu guoping a party member since june will be one of participants coming from shanghai and one of a very few who also attended the th party congress five years ago ms zhu has heard through the grapevine that the congress will take place in november but "nothing is for sure " she says she doesnt even know how long she will have to spend in beijing explaining that delegates will find out "when they get into the capital and attend the opening ceremony " at the military run beijing jingxi hotel where some delegates will stay workers have been told that they will be informed of the meeting days before it happens and that they are to treat the news as top secret "we cannot disclose it to anybody including family members " a hotel staffer says chambermaids and security officers are now going about their routines serving the usual chinese guests including some long term tenants foreigners arent allowed to check into state run hotels just to be sure the reservations desk has been telling its guests that "we cant guarantee availability from september through november " an employee says ellen zhu contributed to
