the padilla verdict it took a miami jury merely a day and a half to convict jose padilla alias abdullah al muhajir and two co defendants of terrorism charges that carry a sentence of life imprisonment the quick verdict yesterday suggests that the prosecutions evidence in the three month trial was overwhelming and unambiguous it ought to quiet opponents of the war on terror who claimed that the reason padilla was originally held as an enemy combatant because he was believed to have been involved in a plot to set off a radioactive "dirty bomb" in a u s city was a figment of president bushs or john ashcrofts imagination of course it wont watch instead as they cite padillas conviction as evidence for another favorite claim that the civilian criminal justice system is adequate to the task of preventing terrorism and thus the military shouldnt be holding enemy combatants at all in fact padillas case demonstrates the opposite before yesterdays verdict war foes were sneering that prosecutors werent even charging him in the dirty bomb plot that is true but the reason he wasnt charged for that crime is that the case was procedurally deficient the military didnt read padilla his miranda rights or provide him a lawyer when it interrogated him padilla was convicted instead of conspiracy to murder kidnap and maim people overseas that means that if war opponents had their way and if padilla had been guilty only of planning to kill americans on u s soil he would walk free today this problem may be remediable in a similar future case no doubt the next time a terrorist is picked up at ohare international airport fbi agents will read him his rights and make sure to honor them but it is unreasonable to expect soldiers marines and intelligence officers on foreign battlefields to follow police procedures at the same time theyre dodging bullets and trying to extract information to prevent attacks on americans back home the padilla decision is reassuring in many respects but it is not a model for the future handling of enemy combatants
