weekend journal review television melancholy babes in the wood the newest movie version of "as you like it" thursday p m edt on hbo is a lovely thing those who like their shakespeare straight up may balk a bit kenneth branaghs production is set among english traders in th century japan the timeline of the action is altered and some beloved examples of word play are no longer in the script these are small matters though compared to the fresh gorgeousness on display and the elements of the story that come into focus here in new and moving ways the play opens untraditionally for instance with the palace coup in which one duke brian blessed overthrows his brother also played by mr blessed sending him into exile the painted faces of the kabuki performers whom the court is watching and the ninja like invaders establish a spooky ominous mood which is soon echoed in the murderous rivalry the lordly oliver adrian lester feels toward his brother orlando david oyelowo there is romance and laughter aplenty elsewhere in what is after all meant to be a comedy yet by bringing out the darkness this version somehow makes more sense to the modern mind it lets us experience the same range of emotions that elizabethan audiences would have despite our more jaded hearts and minds much of the story is set in the forest of arden among a band that begins with the exiled duke and his entourage but swells to include the dukes daughter rosalind bryce dallas howard and her cousin celia romola garai as well as assorted forest dwellers many of the younger people are either in love or looking for it even court jester touchstone alfred molina who wants only a roll in the hay at first eventually succumbs to more tender feelings this dance between the sexes stuff is fun yet familiar what is newly enchanting here is the theme of yearning of another kind who would have guessed that even in shakespeares time people were already tiring of the hurly burly of a contemporary world and dreaming of an older more pastoral time one such character is jacques kevin kline who finds a salve for his melancholy in the contemplation of nature and a new life in the wild there are hints of nostalgia everywhere however the most poignant is the reference to the exiled dukes robin hood like forest existence where were told "many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly as they did in the golden world " its oddly comforting to be reminded that we are not the first to sense loss and rue change describing the faithful servant adam for example orlando notes "thou are not for the fashion of these times where none sweat but for promotion " strip away ye olde language and that still rings true the same might be said of rosalinds admonition to a shepherdess who is reluctant to accept a suitor "sell when you can you are not for all markets " thats sage advice for any age like it or not also looking back to a better time is "cities of light the rise and fall of islamic spain" wednesday p m on pbs but check local listings the official theme of this fascinating documentary is how "greed fear and intolerance" along with "puritanical judgments and absolutism" destroyed a multicultural paradise of the middle ages the subtheme is that muslims jews and christians can all live together happily if they try actually they already do in many of the worlds democracies but "cities of light" is concerned chiefly with the years between roughly when the visigoths reached the iberian peninsula and the early s after first the jews and then the muslims had been expelled from spain in between there were many years of conflict and suffering first the result of various muslim factions jostling for power and later due to crusading christians great events and seismic shifts aside the documentary is at its best as a history of the great flowering that took place beginning with the caliphate of abdul rahman in the early th century the cities of light cordoba seville grenada toledo prospered under muslim rule in a variety of ways we have all seen the beautiful architecture of the era what this program does is reconstruct the cultural and intellectual accomplishments of the time marked by religious tolerance and by a gathering of books and ancient wisdom nourished and preserved until they could become "the seeds of the renaissance " when the rest of europe was cold and truly dark christian european dignitaries who traveled to muslim spain found sophisticated irrigation systems gushing fountains fruit laden gardens and glowing street lamps they even were told were served sherbet made with ice imported from the pyrenees these delights aside the greatest glory may have been a relatively harmonious society in a time before religious prejudice had grown deep roots in any group that innocence is lost forever "american princess" sundays p m on we tv begins its second season with a fresh crop of "ordinary" american twentysomethings who will be transported to england for training in etiquette deportment and other arts of ladylike behavior they include a boxer a nude model a former stripper a lesbian and a woman who makes dog tutus since their instructors and the judges are british criticism is not sugarcoated in that punch pulling american way to a pudgy contestant one female judge says "are you on a diet " of another girl the judge comments "the first time i met her i thought she was a hooker " theres something deliciously ridiculous about etiquette tips being imparted by princess dianas disgraced former butler paul burrell his own speech is anything but genteel and a gentleman would never stoop to appear on tv remarking of anyone as mr burrell does about the contestants that "they nearly wet their pants " far better to be insulting with a nice accent and in a droller english way as one young man does at oxford after listening to the american aspiring "princesses" deliver a series of awful speeches he is most irritated by the twangy floridian who speaks in rhyme about her cats so are we but only a brit would say "i generally wanted to take off my shoe and launch it in her direction "
