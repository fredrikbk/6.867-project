toy makers face dilemma over supplier tough decisions arise when a major vendor is tied to lead trouble the identification of a major hong kong toy maker as the source of some lead tainted toys sold by mattel inc shows that when a big supplier is responsible for a production problem its u s partners can face tough choices about what to do next early light industrial co is so low profile that it doesnt have a corporate web site let alone a public relations department yet it is one of the largest toy manufacturers in asia with more than workers according to an employee on tuesday mattel said it would recall a toy based on the walt disney co movie "cars" a car called "sarge" made by early light that is believed to contain dangerous levels of lead paint early lights toys made largely in factories in china are exported to more than overseas companies including some of the biggest toy companies in the world such as hasbro inc and mga entertainment inc according to people familiar with the matter early lights billionaire chairman francis choi is one of asias richest men he didnt return several telephone and email messages there is no evidence that other toys made by early light are in any way tainted but the factorys reported role in the mattel recall has left toy makers facing a difficult choice break with one of the largest manufacturers or continue with the factory and hope another damaging incident wont occur with smaller companies in the industry foreign buyers can sever relations more easily and turn to other factories the chinese government already has suspended the export licenses of two factories in china involved in a previous mattel recall as well as the company that made thomas the tank engine trains for u s toy company rc corp in early lights case toy makers appear to be supporting the manufacturer betting their reputations on adjustments in quality control systems that they feel will catch any future harmful products "were in good shape" with this manufacturer said isaac larian the mga chief executive who confirmed this week that many of his highly popular bratz dolls had been made by the company previous recalls announced this summer by toy maker rc and mattel had prompted him to order retesting of all of mgas product lines hasbro the worlds second largest toy maker by sales continues to do business with early light said a company spokesman who didnt comment on specifics "we have used them for years " he said hasbro says it thoroughly tests every batch of paint produced by the factory at various stages of production including before and after application since the mattel incident it has ramped up random spot checks as well no recalls are being considered the spokesman said mattel continues to use the early light factory involved in the recall because it believes the problem came from early lights subcontractor hong li da also in china the painting subcontractor was supposed to use mattel approved paint from early light instead it used paint from an unapproved supplier circumventing mattels safety checks according to mattel "early light was just as much of a victim as we were " said a mattel spokeswoman hong li da wasnt available to comment the u s toy maker says this wasnt the case with lee der industrial co producer of about million toys believed to contain lead paint that spurred mattel to recall products more than two weeks prior lee der used an unauthorized paint supplier mattel says the owner of the factory was found dead in a guangdong warehouse shortly after the chinese government banned his factory from exporting abroad leaving some questions unanswered about the toys production early light by contrast has proved more resilient mr choi "is a vendor for most of the big guys " said lawrence chan the chairman of the hong kong toys council an industry group sidney to an executive at playmates holdings ltd a hong kong listed toy maker that owns the distribution rights for the teenage mutant ninja turtles franchise said mr choi is a "well known person within the industry" and that he has heard people refer to him by the nickname the toy king some toy industry executives argue it is better to stick with trusted vendors even if there are some lapses mr to says his company deals with problems as they come up and is reluctant to abandon suppliers saying it is better to try to solve the problems and build long term relationships with factories "its always better to work with the devil you know than the devil you dont " said mr to adding that he has formed long term relationships with around five hong kong based toy factories "you would like to work with them to solve any issues that come up rather than just cut and run " playmates doesnt source from early light according to mr to in an article published yesterday by ming pao one of hong kongs largest chinese language newspapers mr choi was quoted as saying that he had revealed the problem himself he said his company had outsourced the painting process to another company but eventually found that the paint was below the standard and "we informed mattel immediately " early light has grown steadily since its founding in the early s in early light had employees spread over three factory sites in china producing products for hasbro action performance cos and mattel according to a statement issued at the time in january of this year forbes magazine ranked mr choi as the th richest person in greater china with &# billion it isnt clear what will happen to early light mr chan said that he hasnt seen a lot of fallout for the hong kong toy industry yet but that "people are just worried about how the chinese bureau of inspection will react this is our biggest concern given that they might impose more export bans " mr chan added that he hasnt yet seen any sign that the industry is suffering any fallout from the recalls kersten zhang and zhou yang in beijing and juliet ye in hong kong contributed to
