new villain in market drama commercial paper banks pressed to sell short term investments commercial paper the usually humdrum market for short term debt held by money market funds and used by companies to finance their operations has suddenly taken center stage in the credit crunch yesterday two big bank groups had to step up with rescue and support operations propping up faltering issuers of billion canadian dollars us&# billion in commercial paper in canada and lending &# billion to giant u s mortgage lender countrywide financial corp some of it to backstop countrywides commercial paper the operations highlighted the problems in the &# trillion commercial paper market contributing to pullbacks in global stock markets and adding to concern of a financial "contagion" that could raise financing costs for or perhaps knock out even healthy companies "this is one more level of the credit markets freezing up and thats what the general concern is the breakdown of the system " said mike mayo who follows banks and securities firms at deutsche bank ag many of the industrial giants that once used commercial paper as a cheaper substitute for bank loans have retreated from the market in recent years they have been replaced by specialty finance companies and other investment vehicles in the process commercial paper has come to finance ever larger swaths of the economy hedge funds private equity firms and investment banks have played a major role in this expansion by setting up companies that borrow by issuing commercial paper and then invest the money sometimes in the types of mortgage related securities that have proliferated in recent years as the value of those securities has become unclear and the companies holding them come under pressure the commercial paper they have issued has come into question as well yesterday in the biggest wave of subprime mortgage bond downgrades to date moodys investors service slashed ratings on securities from that were originally worth &# billion some of the bonds previously bore moodys top aaa rating the securities were backed by second lien mortgages that included many "piggyback" loans which borrowers took out for part or all of their down payment on homes the ratings company cited "the dramatically poor overall performance" of such loans and their high default rates as the reason for the downgrades such short term credit "is the lifeblood of the credit markets " said edward marrinan credit strategist at j p morgan securities "the good news is that such contingency funding is available to borrowers " mr marrinan said "the bad news is at least some borrowers have had to resort to using such contingency funding " the immediate focus of concern has been a variety known as asset backed commercial paper a form of financing that has been hit by a downturn in the value of collateral such as subprime mortgages which have been damaged by rising default rates the amount of asset backed paper has grown in recent years soaring to &# trillion today from &# billion two years ago according to data from the federal reserve three asset backed commercial paper issuers in the u s had to extend repayment last week as did more than a dozen in canada this week wednesday a real estate affiliate of wall street buyout titan kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co asked investors to delay repayment on &# billion in commercial paper by six

trillion as of wednesday from &# trillion a week earlier demand also shrank this week in the smaller &# billion euro commercial paper market yesterday only about half of the &# billion that was slated to be renewed was actually purchased by investors according to two dealers asset backed paper was particularly hard hit as investors sought out safer issues "the concern today is that youre trying to stay ahead of the unknown which is avoiding the next problem credit " said sean simko head of fixed income asset management at sei investments in oaks pa "one way to do that is to stick to more of the plain vanilla names " that caution can lead to two problems though it could push up the cost of borrowing forcing companies that are unable to issue debt to turn to more expensive backup lines of credit from banks or others to find the cash they need to run their businesses but damage to the financial system was the immediate concern this week as the federal reserve and canadian and european central banks pumped money in to keep it moving many short term debt investors sought cover in three month treasury bills their heavy buying sent the yields on these ultrasafe government securities diving percentage point to around midday yesterday they finished the day at sharply lower than their yield of at the beginning of the week long dated treasury prices are also rising as investors seek "safe haven" holdings the year treasury note rose to driving the yield on these bonds down to "its been a pretty remarkable move over the last two days " said bill hornbarger a strategist at a g edwards &amp sons in st louis "its clearly a sign that there are a lot of distressed and nervous people who are moving out of commercial paper and money funds and into treasury bills " in commercial paper meanwhile rates have risen over the past few weeks by a half percentage point to about even on commercial paper issued by the top dealers says howard simons a strategist at bianco research llc in chicago "this is a market that never moved before " the commercial paper market used to be dominated by short term debt issued by banks financial companies and industrial corporations such as general electric co and general motors corp in recent years low long term interest rates enabled many corporations to obtain cheap longer term funding by issuing bonds that matured in five or more years that reduced their reliance on the short term market "we preferred to hold commercial paper of industrial companies because those are the guys that dont need you every day over the last few years those have become much harder to find " says thomas atteberry a fixed income manager at first pacific advisors in los angeles as companies sold less commercial paper other institutions jumped in to fill the gap they included hedge funds and financial companies that set up commercial paper programs that bundled together interest bearing securities many of them with long maturities treasury is
