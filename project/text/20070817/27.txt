subprime lenders that filed the foreclosures he said in a telephone interview "i will not have my familys money invested in these firms " mr edwards didnt give details on how or when he was going to proceed either to alter his holdings or to aid borrowers he said he plans to begin making amends to new orleans homeowners first by contacting them and "seeing where they are in the process " he said his help may come from his own cash or in collaboration with a charity that specializes in repairing homes the foreclosures mr edwards said "run counter to what im about " on the campaign trail mr edwards has particularly attacked lenders behind foreclosures in storm slammed louisiana in april he visited the devastated lower ninth ward neighborhood to voice one of his main antipoverty planks a proposal to rein in subprime mortgage companies whose "shameful lending practices " he said threaten millions of working class homeowners "while washington turns a blind eye irresponsible lenders are pulling a fast one on hard working homeowners " mr edwards said a few days later at the time in late when mr edwards went to work for fortress it already had a stake in one subprime lender that subsequently foreclosed on some katrina victims green tree servicing llc while he was there fortress acquired a second nationstar mortgage llc fortress paid mr edwards &# in for part time work a federal election commission report in may showed after leaving the firm he kept about half of his net worth in fortress funds and fortress employees have collectively made up the largest class of political contributors to mr edwards workers there put up more than &# toward his presidential run in the first six months of the year this isnt the first time mr edwards has been confronted with the possibility that fortress directed companies might be foreclosing on new orleans homeowners in may the washington post said that shortly after katrina hit green tree sent a letter to a year old storm victim admonishing her to get current on her mortgage or face losing her house at the time most mortgage companies doing business in the city had agreed to a house payment holiday for storm victims "this is not okay that this is happening " the post quoted mr edwards as saying he added that he planned to speak to the lender about its practices yesterday mr edwards said he did later speak to fortress about green tree and was told the matter had been taken care of at the time mr edwards said yesterday he didnt know how many foreclosures green tree might have filed in new orleans the post didnt ask him about nationstars activities in new orleans and he said yesterday that he was unaware that that lender was also pursuing foreclosures there the candidate has said he had no involvement in fortress units subprime lending when he worked for the private equity firm and wasnt aware of it at the time he has said his job at fortress was to provide information about what he saw happening economically in the u s and overseas he has also said he was there "primarily to learn" about finance in the interview yesterday mr edwards said that when he first joined fortress "i made clear that i didnt want to have anything i was investing in to be antilabor or involved in predatory lending practices " but he added that he didnt fully understand the firms complex operations saying "theyre diverse theyre very diverse " one green tree new orleans foreclosure involved the wood frame house of eva and bailey comadore not far from where mr edwards visited in april a home katrina struck two years ago mrs comadore a year old former barkeep now shares a trailer outside the city with her daughter and two children her year old husband a former tire repairman lives nearby their ninth ward house was sold at a foreclosure auction in may to green tree for &# to settle a &# mortgage that carried a rate of interest "the mortgage company wouldnt give us a chance to catch up " says mrs comadore after a call was placed to green trees minnesota headquarters a person who identified himself as an official of the company but wouldnt give a name or call back number said he planned to confer with colleagues before making a comment as of last evening he hadnt called back fortress itself declined to comment nationstar as of last evening hadnt returned calls edwards aides while apologetic for the foreclosures defended subprime lending in general they pointed out the distinctions between subprime loans which are extended to people with less than stellar credit and "predatory" loans which often target the same consumers but employ pressure sales tactics and punitive covenants that can strip equity from home buyers and tie them to onerous payments subprime loans defenders note can benefit many lower income people previously locked out of home ownership mortgage experts say theres no clear line dividing standard subprime loans from "predatory" ones generally speaking said thomas lawler a former official at mortgage buyer fannie mae predatory loans carry high interest rates that are allowed to rise but not drop they may be loaded with prepaid fees lenders may make monthly payments look smaller than they really are by not requiring borrowers to put taxes and insurance in escrow and the loans generally dont allow early payoff without a steep penalty that bars refinancing if interest rates drop a review of some courthouse records in louisiana shows that green tree and nationstar mortgages carry many of those attributes several carry accelerators that allow the already above market initial interest rate to nearly double they also carry penalties for early payoff mr edwards is hardly the only presidential candidate to field criticism over his business republican mitt romney has come under attack for his time at bain capital a private equity firm that has purchased companies and forced layoffs he and mr edwards along with illinois democratic sen barack obama have taken hits for investing in companies that did business in sudan republican rudy giuliani has fielded criticism for his consulting companys or his law firms associations with troubled businesses and with venezuela whose socialist leader harshly criticizes the u s mr edwards has based his campaign heavily on helping poor and working class people and attacking companies he says hurt them in july he went on a three day poverty tour of desperate neighborhoods it began in the front yard of a renovated home in the lower ninth ward of new orleans near the comadore residence the populist candidate who runs third in most democratic polls has drawn cheers from labor leaders and reaped the support of his partys more liberal wing near the close of the poverty tour mr edwards traveled to a cleveland neighborhood that has a high foreclosure rate "this is wrong this is not complicated it is wrong " he said as he walked along "these people have been taken advantage of " records show the county sheriffs office has scheduled three foreclosure auctions at the behest of nationstar in august and one for green tree in louisiana ernest grant a painter and his wife ollie a nurse have tried for months to repair their katrina hit ranch home while taking refuge in texas the grants are unemployed and facing foreclosure from nationstar on a &# adjustable rate loan "they just called us one day and said we needed to pay &# or they were going to take the house " mr grant said he said he got an insurance settlement of "about grand " but "it wasnt enough our house was totaled " the grants await help from a federal rebuilding program called road home that gives owners up to &# to repair houses homeowners become ineligible for grants if they lose their houses in a foreclosure traveling occasionally to new orleans mr grant has gutted the house and laid a new tile floor he has put the home on the market but with an asking price of &# about what it takes to pay
