rivals ibm sun team up to pair solaris system with big blue servers international business machines corp and sun microsystems inc longtime rivals said ibm will become the first major hardware vendor to resell suns solaris operating system the deal will allow ibm customers to buy solaris on selected big blue server systems starting with those that use the x chip design offered by intel corp and advanced micro devices inc ibm and sun executives added that the software may later be offered on ibms popular mainframe systems such cooperation is becoming increasingly common as customers pressure competing vendors to offer more convenient technology combinations it was already possible for customers for example to buy ibm x systems and then get solaris from sun said jonathan schwartz suns chief executive now they can simply go to ibm to get both he said the two companies have cooperated before particularly in promoting ibm software for sun machines and suns java software as an alternative to microsoft corp offerings but they compete fiercely in computer sales scott mcnealy who gave up the job as suns ceo last year to mr schwartz was once particularly disparaging about ibms strategies and technology mr schwartz however has taken more pragmatic positions and has aggressively pushed the use of solaris on machines other than those sold by sun teaming up with sun is "a sea change for the hardware business" at ibm said bill zeitler general manager of ibms systems and technology group he said that the rapprochement started shortly after mr schwartz became ceo and invited him and ibm ceo sam palmisano to visit him at suns offices in silicon valley since then they have worked on various issues and mr zeitler said yesterdays announcement heralds further cooperation ibm has three operating systems of its own and also sells two distributions of linux and microsofts windows adding solaris to the mix gives its hardware sales representatives one more option to offer customers ibm once catered to "true blue" customers who bought only from ibm but mr zeitler said it has been years since "we tried to force our customers into one operating system " bob djurdjevic president of market researcher annex research in phoenix said he thinks ibm will move quickly to put solaris on non x computers because the operating system has a much wider audience than aix ibms variant of the unix operating system he added that mr zeitler has successfully promoted linux on ibm computers allowing "alien objects to enter the big blue web " mr zeitler said developers have already successfully run solaris on ibm mainframes which he said is appealing to many customers ibms mainframe business has been robust in recent years in part because of its growing sales of linux running as a virtual server on the big machines despite an aging product line in its latest quarter ibm mainframe revenue rose largely due to growth in the amount of computer power assigned for running linux
