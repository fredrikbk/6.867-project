news of the day with heavy doses of soccer and sex it covers the comings and goings of local witches known as sangomas and troll like spirits called tokoloshe which other newspapers shun as silly superstitions "youre not going to be received in this market if you view ancestor worship as an oddity " mr du plessis says unapologetically "beeld " a major paper read by white afrikaaners "would hardly denounce the existence of the holy trinity " at a moment when the future of newspapers is in doubt the daily sun unrelated to the similarly named british tabloid owned by news corp has gone from birth in to an audited paid circulation today of over three times its nearest daily competitor including copies that are passed along or resold the south african advertising research foundation estimates that one in every eight south african adults reads the sun the paper boasts daily of being "africas biggest newspaper south of the pyramids " the daily sun is more than a business success its a window into south africas economy particularly the emergence of a black middle class since the advent of democracy in "its the beginning stirrings of what the u s was in the s " says mr du

middle class back in the total income of the of south africans who are white exceeded the incomes of the who are black the remainder are deemed colored or indian since however the collective income of blacks has exceeded the income of the white minority the daily sun itself is a mirror of the new south africa publisher mr du plessis is white the general manager is mixed race or colored in south african jargon the editor and most of the news staff is black at first glance the daily sun offers classic tabloid fare it takes soap operas seriously it takes soccer very seriously it doesnt shy away from lurid sex stories and then theres its coverage of the supernatural "an evil tortoise came flying over the sangomas house calling out her name loudly " began one recent story headlined "flying tortoise terror " the year old sangoma lucy manganyi said she tossed a spear at the flying tortoise but didnt try to kill it "my ancestors instructed me not to " she told the daily sun the black establishment isnt always impressed "the snobs and i would include myself sneer at the content sometimes " says joel netshitenzhe head of the policy planning unit in president thabo mbekis office "but " he adds referring to the steady dose of personal finance advice and definitions of english idioms "they are also providing utilitarian value to their readership an effort to improve the quality of life " while the daily sun had no trouble drawing readers advertising came more slowly "when you spoke of black people their immediate image was a gardener or a housekeeper or the marauding masses of youths they saw on tv " says fergus sampson the papers general manager "black people were either hungry yearning masses that just want to take stuff or they were noble savages we must uplift god forbid they should need toothpaste and be able to afford it " but annual ad revenue now exceeds million rand or about &# million daily sun readers are prime targets for companies offering cellphones furniture brand name groceries cars bank loans and funeral insurance a big deal in a culture where funerals can be very expensive "its the first time that we have something that fits the market " says

through the journalistic ranks earning a reputation as "rough tough foul mouthed and brilliant at what he does " says anton harber a former newspaper editor and now director of the journalism program at johannesburgs university of the witwatersrand as managing director of the south african unit of independent newspapers an irish media chain mr du plessis saw earlier than many others that the arrival of democracy in was creating an untapped market in the nations black working class after two frustrating years of searching for investors he got a bite from naspers ltd a south african media company whose original name de nasionale pers or "the national press " reflects its roots as the voice of afrikaanerdom naspers convinced it needed to find new markets if it was to grow was impressed by research showing a rising number of literate black people who werent being targeted by any daily newspaper says jan malherbe chief executive of naspers media newspaper unit at the time mr du plessis who will only say he has a minority equity stake in the paper "of some significance" says one key to the papers success is a price of about rand or about cents half the price of the competition that low price attracts so many readers that circulation revenue covers the cost of the small person news staff marketing is an obsession the daily sun offers about rand or roughly &# to the best letter to the editor each day it offers cash to the person who recognizes him or herself in a newspaper photo adding about rand a day if the money goes unclaimed it sponsors "mr fixit " whose
