weekend journal review film funeral begins with big laugh ends in a snore superbad is superfun kidmans invasion is clamorous cluttered daniel matthew macfadyen is very much off his feed in "death at a funeral " frank ozs feydeau style farce of bodies minds manners and bowel control gone missing at an english country house the cause of daniels immediate distress is obvious its the day of his fathers funeral and here is the undertaker with the wrong corpse "wrong" is the operative word with "death at a funeral " which in the first very funny minutes shows its hand and then unfortunately continues to wave that hand frantically for the next hour in one of the movies few successful running jokes the wrong fellow would be writer daniel is slated to deliver the eulogy really shouldnt it be his brother robert rupert graves a self centered best selling novelist a niece of the deceased gives her fiance what she thinks is a valium to blunt his panic at meeting the clan in fact the pill is a powerful hallucinogenic worst of all a mysterious guest peter dinklage threatens to besmirch the reputation and memory of the deceased and couldnt the screenwriter have come up with a better fresher scandal unless his terms are met ah if only blackmail were the worst of this interlopers offenses "i tried writing once " he observes after checking out a few pages of daniels novel in progress "it didnt work for me either " there is throughout much locking and slamming of doors broad physical humor ever escalating skirmishes between family members and this being england plenty of bathroom humor but whatever head of steam "death at a funeral" gathers is dissipated by the repetitive predictable jokes and by the cowardice of its sugary ending superbad gross out jokes the rat a tat spewing of obscenities and the ever so colorful expressions that describe certain secondary sexual characteristics and certain intimate acts theyre the high octane fueling contemporary comedies aimed at adolescent boys but sweetness not so much which brings us to the subject of the wonderful "superbad " a movie that shares its bawdy big hearted dna with " year old virgin" and "knocked up " seth jonah hill and evan michael cera the characters are named for "superbad" screenwriters seth rogen and evan goldberg are lifelong boon companions and state of the art nerds who are about to graduate from high school and go their separate ways the skinny gentle and socially inept evan who has worn a deep groove in the straight and narrow is headed for dartmouth the economy sized potty mouthed seth is headed for oblivion an unexpected invitation to a party at the house of cool girl jules emma stone gets seth and evan fantasizing maybe theyll get drunk maybe theyll get lucky and sets off a chain of events that tests their alcohol tolerance and their relationship a hilarious if slightly protracted intersecting plot involves the boys super twerp friend fogell christopher mintz plasse in a terrific debut and a couple of policemen mr rogen and bill hader with a very elastic interpretation of civic responsibility the business about the fake i d funny the liquor store holdup very very funny the tutorial on fooling the breathalyzer funnier still but whats most memorable most striking about "superbad" is the canny evocation of male friendship in all its richness and complexity the invasion look at them the residents of washington d c moving down the street like sleepwalkers civil servants beaten down by the bureaucracy elected officials worn down by senate probes and the hour news cycle if only at the beginning of "the invasion " the uninspired fourth version of the sci fi classic "invasion of the body snatchers " a space shuttle explodes sprinkling wreckage almost the length of the u s that detritus carries a peculiar payload a clear malleable substance able to survive the extreme chill of space and the flaring heat of re entry those who come into contact with it suddenly dont seem like themselves beltway psychiatrist and divorcee carol bennell nicole kidman whos been given the same last name as the doctor in "body snatchers" simply reaches for a prescription pad when a longtime patient hysterically insists that her husband is an impostor he looks like the man she married but hes so well calm so free of emotion then carol takes a hard look at the affectless citizenry waiting at the bus stops walking alongside her takes note of the odd substance hanging off a piece of the candy her son oliver the very good jackson bond brings home on halloween officials attribute the symptoms to a new strain of flu but carol is unconvinced sharing her concerns with fellow doctor and sometime date ben daniel craig under the circumstances maybe it wasnt such a smart idea for her to let oliver spend the weekend with his dad whos got a lofty position at the centers for disease control and was one of the first responders when the shuttle crashed what helped give the original "invasion of the body snatchers" its nightmare creepiness the movie has lost no power to haunt was the low key low tech feel the small town setting made the story all the more personal and immediate it unfolded coolly and inexorably except for one terrifically adroit sequence in a subway there is nothing understated about "the invasion " with all the shoot outs the screaming the chases collisions and fireballs there isnt much time for storytelling unless you count the piffle spouted during a dinner party scene thats meant to illuminate the movies theme very little time devoted to the search for an antidote to the bizarre ailment its found with comic speed and next to no time for the resolution in any case the sound and fury will keep audiences wide awake and thats a good thing when aliens invade nodding off can be a risky business joe morgenstern is on vacation
