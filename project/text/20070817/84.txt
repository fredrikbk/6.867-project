sign up for the e mail here the guilty verdict for jose padilla was the best result the bush administration could have desired for a prosecution whose twists and turns helped define its post legal strategy though the outcome leaves unresolved many questions about the case after just hours of deliberation a federal jury in miami found mr padilla and two codefendants guilty on charges of conspiracy to murder kidnap and maim people overseas and on charges of providing material support to terrorists the government had accused mr padilla of serving as an al qaeda recruit defendant adham amin hassoun of recruiting for overseas jihadists and kifah wael jayyousi of raising money for their cause as the miami herald reports as serious as the crimes may be they are far less notorious than the dirty bomb plot also alleged against mr padilla by the government but deemed unfit for legal and intelligence reasons for the civilian judicial system and mr padillas extrajudicial three and a half years incommunicado in a navy brig stand in contrast to a case in which mr jayyousi was allowed free on bond until yesterday a juror who requested anonymity tells the herald that mr padilla was viewed as "just a small pawn in this thing he was guilty believe me but there were much bigger people involved " it wasnt clear how much that reflected other jurors judgment but to the bush administration the verdict was "a significant victory in our efforts to fight the threat posed by terrorists and their supporters " as attorney general alberto gonzales put it mr padillas defense lawyers will almost certainly file an appeal and cite the treatment he received as a presidentially declared enemy combatant newsweek says while nothing from mr padillas military interrogations was used in the miami trial he "was cut off from all contact with the outside world including his own defense lawyers and subjected to unusually harsh treatment that would never have been permitted if he had been a normal defendant including allegedly bombarding him with loud noises keeping his cell at extreme temperatures and other techniques designed to break down his defenses and force him to talk " the magazine notes and that his lawyers have argued utterly affected mr padillas ability to defend himself the role in the case of government wiretaps begun in the s is also likely to play a part in the debate currently raging over the bush administrations expansion of government powers to use electronic surveillance the wall street journal says proponents of warrantless wiretaps will argue how crucial they are to fighting terrorism while opponents now have another example of how the pre judicial supervision of such surveillance didnt impede the governments ability to use it but more heatedly debated following what university of maryland law professor michael greenberger calls "a face saving day for the bush administration " is what the verdict means for the administrations decision to keep as much of its terrorism detention and prosecution as possible away from american courts "this evidence could have been presented immediately without the distraction and waste of valuable time" of the enemy combatant claims mr greenberger tells newsweek to the journals editorial page generally a supporter of white house detention policy "padillas case demonstrates the opposite" of arguments that the civilian criminal justice system is adequate to the task of preventing terrorism "if war opponents had their way and if padilla had been guilty only of planning to kill americans on u s soil instead of the charges of supporting terrorists overseas he would walk free today " it says "the padilla decision is reassuring in many respects but it is not a model for the future handling of enemy combatants " the new york times editorial page often a critic of the administrations policies says the verdict is good news because a would be terrorist is headed to jail but it argues the case doesnt at all vindicate the administrations attempt to circumvent the american legal system the bush administration it says "was forced grudgingly and only at the very end to provide him with the rights guaranteed by the constitution " more trouble in asian markets asian stock markets today were hammered by the strengthening yen and persistent fears about subprime mortgage
