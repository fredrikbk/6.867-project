weekend journal revenge by gadget zapping subway gropers shaming bad drivers speeding up slow golfers jennifer saranow on the growing ranks of electronic vigilantes attention loud cellphone talkers overzealous horn honkers inconsiderate cab drivers and other everyday pests your days may be numbered thanks to the falling cost of microcontroller chips and the lure of easy online sales inventors are turning out record numbers of gadgets one growing subset of these inventions products that help people neutralize antisocial behavior at the push of a button the brains behind these devices range from entrepreneurs in suburban los angeles to graduate students at the massachusetts institute of technology a tennessee company has created a &# device that shuts up other peoples dogs by answering their barks with an ultrasonic squeal that humans cant hear the unit is disguised as a birdhouse british inventors are exporting a new product for people who hate lousy drivers its a luminescent screen that fits in a cars rear window and at the drivers command flashes any one of five messages to other mortorists these include a smiley face a sad face and phrases like "back off" and "idiot " since the products u s debut the company says it also has received several requests for images of offensive hand gestures while many of these gadgets are built by small companies or basement tinkerers the field has caught the attention of graduate students at mits media lab where it is known as "annoyancetech " among their recent creations a "no contact jacket" that when activated with a controller delivers a blast of electricity to anyone who touches the person wearing it during a demonstration in japan co creator adam whiton says it drew interest from women who were eager to retaliate against gropers on the subway "its becoming easier for people to imagine that technology is a conduit through which they will solve all their social problems " says christopher csikszentmihalyi director of the media labs computing culture group edward tenner a historian and author of books on the consequences of technology says he isnt surprised that people are turning to gadgets the idea of solving problems with a gadget rather than a direct confrontation makes more sense he says at a time when people are concerned about the growth of social explosions like road rage a study published last year in the archives of general psychiatry found that intermittent explosive disorder characterized by recurrent violent out of proportion reactions is more common than previously thought in the u s and may be on the rise these devices are also a way for people to bridge the gap between the birth of a new form of annoyance people driving while sending text messages for instance and the point at which lawmakers finally organize a response "in those petty cracks of life is where you can see the desire for revenge is alive and well " says michael mccullough a professor of psychology at the university of miami for inventor michael donine of temecula calif the problem was simple enough his wife laurie didnt approve of his habit of going to a local casino to play poker on weekday mornings and would regularly call his cellphone to check up on him while sitting at the poker table one day the year old entrepreneur lit upon a possible solution a device that would play background sounds that could fool her into thinking he was actually somewhere else mr donine first imagined building an "excuse booth" for patrons at casinos nightclubs and racetracks but dropped the idea when he realized he would have to rent a warehouse and hire employees to collect change in october after consulting with a chinese manufacturer he came out with a quicker solution a device the size of a keychain that plays one minute "excuse" tracks including police sirens a thunderstorm airport public address announcements an auto repair shop and a secretary who says "excuse me you have an urgent call on line two " after selling nearly units of the "xcuse box " mr donine says hes working on an updated version with new sounds including a carpool of screaming and fighting children "its a little bit more edgy " he says calum dunans idea came to him during a golf tournament in scotland as he stood waiting at the tee while the group in front of him spent minutes scouring the course for a lost ball as he became increasingly frustrated mr dunan realized his problems might be solved with a gadget hes currently working on the final prototype of "timeball " a device with five led lights that turn on one by one until a golfer has exceeded the regulation five minute limit on looking for a lost ball he hopes to convince golf courses to promote the device "i do believe this is going to be a household name " he says some products like the "outdoor bark control birdhouse " which aims to quiet loud dogs came about by accident though the technology has been around for five years the manufacturer radio systems of knoxville tenn initially sold it as an indoor training tool for pet owners but the company says it began getting requests from customers for an outdoor version that could be used on annoying neighborhood dogs when a market analysis showed of consumers would welcome a covert way to shut up somebody elses canine the company decided to proceed mike taylor a radio systems executive says the company doubled the bark controllers range to feet then asked a focus group to help figure out a way to camouflage the unit so neighbors wouldnt know what it was after flirting with fake rocks and footballs the company settled on a somewhat unlikely design a brightly painted bavarian style birdhouse "i was the first user " says mr taylor who says he tested the prototype on an obnoxious neighborhood german shepherd "im sleeping pleasantly now " not everyone building devices like these is interested in making a buck phil torrone an editor for make a do it yourself technology magazine was fed up with taxi drivers who blast grating music or irritating talk shows on their radios and are nearly impossible to reason with to address the problem he bought a product from griffin technology that allows people to broadcast music from their ipods over fm stations he pulled out the antenna to increase the devices range and then downloaded a noiseless track to his ipod now whenever a cab driver switches on an annoying fm station mr torrone uses his creation to zap it with silence "i travel a lot and when you are trapped and a hostage you start thinking of an escape plan " he says "this is my escape plan " the spread of these behavior regulating devices is part of a larger invention boom there were new patent applications filed in the u s last year nearly double the number from a decade ago in general any device that sells more than units qualifies as a smashing success and few of them do one of the more successful products of this kind is the tv b gone a &# handset that allows people to shut off loud televisions in public places like doctors offices and bars the manufacturer says it has posted sales of &# million in nearly three years many of these products are little more than practical jokes a new jersey company called outrageous international has sold golf balls loaded with magnetic gyroscopes that can be made to zig and zag on the putting green with a remote handset while some marketing materials suggest using it "if youre being thrashed by your opponent " company spokesman alan sutton says its chief target is pranksters "its supposed to be a joke " he says likewise a british invention called the beer burglar alarm a &# device that attaches to a glass or bottle and uses a motion sensor to sound an alarm when anything comes within one foot was designed as much for laughs as for social utility one alarm consists of a threatening voice that says "keepa da hands off ma beer " james obrien the devices inventor says he thought up the idea in a pub "after coming back from the toilet i found my friend drinking my beer " he explains according to dr tenner the technology historian the first widely marketed "countergadget" may have been the zenith remote control of since it was invented in part to help people skip commercials the trend continued in the s he says with the proliferation of radar detectors though illegal in the u s cellphone jammers have been floating around for nearly as long as cellphones but inventors say the current gadget boom is far more widespread the chief difference is the falling cost of programmable microcontrollers the integrated circuit chips that were once too expensive for small scale production doug freedman a semiconductor industry analyst says these chips are smaller and more complex than just five years ago and cost about &# on average down from about &# to &# in at high volumes he says these chips can be found for as little as cents each inventors say inexpensive chinese manufacturers have also helped reduce production costs american airlines says it has barred a nearly four year old product called the knee defender that lets airline passengers keep the seats in front of them from reclining to guard against products like the tv b gone some business owners have removed the infrared receivers from televisions in public spaces in some cases however businesses are embracing the technology regal entertainment announced this may that customers in of its movie theaters can ask for wireless paging devices that allow them to summon ushers or managers if someone misbehaves by pressing a "disturbance" button more of these products are on the way theres an updated version of the tv b gone in the works that will be powerful enough to shut off televisions from behind sheets of glass a well publicized british invention called "the mosquito" that emits high frequency sounds particularly irritating to congregations of teenagers is now being marketed in the u s by a company called kids be gone several years ago as an engineering graduate student at the university of california berkeley eric paulos built a device called the "i bomb" that emits an electromagnetic pulse that disables all electronics in its range a similar device was depicted in the movie "oceans eleven" while mr paulos says he has operated the i bomb only about half a dozen times in front of audiences he considers it a work of performance art he says he continues to get emails from would be manufacturers and marketers and more oddly people who live nearby and just want to borrow it one such message "my neighbor is playing loud music i just want it to stop " if joseph mauriello has his way the entire island of manhattan will soon be a quieter place thanks to a gadget for years in new york city the year old says hes been disgusted by all the honking as a tour company operator whos on the street constantly he says he often finds it hard to hear over the clamor mr mauriello has spent three years and tens of thousands of dollars developing the "automobile horn audit system " a device that records honk stats like time date and duration and has a gps component to determine where the honking occurred he envisions it being installed in all cars in new york so that when owners bring them in for a state inspection the data will be sent to a central office that will be empowered to assess levies on anyone who has demonstrated a pattern of excessive honking after drawing up blueprints and hiring a lawyer mr mauriello is waiting for a final decision from the u s patent office hes already looking for a corporate partner and lobbying legislators "its not a matter of if this is going to be a reality " mr mauriello says "its a matter of when "
