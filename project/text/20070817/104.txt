weekend journal taste de gustibus the wall between art world realms is going going the art world was briefly awakened from its summer slumbers two weeks ago by the news that at the end of this month lisa dennison director of the solomon r guggenheim museum will be leaving to become executive vice president of sothebys america ms dennison became the guggenheims director in october succeeding the controversial thomas krens she has spent almost all her professional life at the guggenheim until recently museums and auction houses were and were perceived to be opposite sorts of institutions their values so different as to preclude cross fertilization museum curators and directors concerned themselves mostly with aesthetic values scholarship and the life of the mind when the value of a work of art was discussed it was usually in terms of its historical importance museum people regarded the commercial art world as a museum director once put it to me only half in jest as "the dark side " a realm inimical to their values auctioneers by contrast were all about money "value" to them was dollars and cents historical importance was of interest only to the extent that it could increase an objects sale price given this oil and water relationship there was no question of someone from an auction house going to work at a museum just as it was equally unheard of for traffic to go in the other direction but in the past decade or so the wall between museums and auction houses has become porous museums for example are now more commercial greatly expanding their retail operations renting out parts of their collections and staging exhibitions such as the guggenheims own giorgio armani show that seemed more promotional than scholarly and far from being loath to put a price tag on their treasures museums nowadays can hardly wait to do so last year the director and trustees of the albright knox gallery in buffalo n y one of the nations premier museums picked through their collection and sent more than of the most valuable items and in some cases the most historically important off to sothebys where this spring they realized a tidy &# million the auction houses for their part have been reaching out to the rarefied world of museums in richard oldenburg relinquished the directorship of moma to become chairman of sothebys america around the same time charles s moffett an authority on french impressionist art moved from the directorship of washingtons phillips collection to a senior post at the same auction house and why shouldnt they have done so such auction house jobs offer bigger paychecks and just as attractive they free these new arrivals from the relentless drudgery of raising money which is pretty much all that museum directors do these days what do the auction houses get a little class for one thing auctioneers tend to be insecure about their line of work a fact illustrated by an old saw about the difference between sothebys and christies one consists of auctioneers trying to be gentlemen the other of gentlemen trying to be auctioneers so for example auctioneers dress up in black tie to conduct the big ticket auctions to make sure you dont confuse them with other folks around the country who knock down hogs and repossessed cars for a living and to gloss over the fact that theyll well sell anything remember andy warhols cookie jars keep a few former museum directors on the premises and not only do you get their expertise but you can hold your head up a little higher museum people are also helpful with potential clients it unsettles collectors who want to sell their art to think that theyre merely "cashing in " too vulgar far more comforting to view yourself as an enlightened patron reluctantly but generously parting after years of careful stewardship with a cultural milestone so that others might enjoy it and who better to help with this existential makeover and thereby ease the painting off the wall and into the saleroom than an ex director equipped as he is with the proper intellectual pedigree and able to drop all the right scholarly references just when theyre needed which brings us to the main reason that auction houses find museum people so attractive they know where the bodies are buried in the course of their work they learn who has what important works of art because thats how they organize their exhibitions they spend hundreds of hours tracking down objects some famous some obscure and visiting their owners in hopes of borrowing them in the course of such visits they might well come upon other works of art that the collector owns auction houses rely on a steady stream of loot to stay in business so they badly need this insider information its especially valuable given the surprisingly large number of a list works of art still in private hands a collector is far more likely to be persuaded to part with his treasures by an ex museum director with whom he probably already has a relationship than by a cold calling "expert" from sothebys or christies this trend although a rainmaking boon for the auction houses might in the long run wind up making life more difficult for museums the loan exhibition the big draw for most art museums is already hard to bring off given increasing red tape high insurance costs and fears of terrorism and it may become a near impossible task if collectors start to think that the museum director pleading with them to lend a masterpiece today will be an auctioneer badgering them to sell it tomorrow mr gibson is the journals leisure
