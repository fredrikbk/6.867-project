rivals collapsed but the lender this week has found itself caught up in a financial squeeze as sources of short term borrowings long relied upon to fund mortgage lending dry up amid investor anxiety

billion some of the bonds previously bore moodys top aaa rating the securities were backed by second lien mortgages that included many "piggyback" loans home buyers used to avoid making substantial down payments the rating company attributed its move to "the dramatically poor overall performance" of such loans and their high default rates given the severe constraints on selling loans to investors the dollar value of countrywides loan production is likely to fall to in coming months at least until markets calm down said frederick cannon an analyst at keefe bruyette &amp woods inc in san francisco as revenue falls countrywide probably will have to make "fairly significant" layoffs from a nationwide work force that totaled nearly as of june mr cannon said as recently as last week

close in a statement countrywide said its bank is well capitalized and noted that its deposits are insured by the federal deposit insurance corp lenders are finding it impossible or prohibitively expensive to borrow through issues of commercial paper a form of short term debt companies use to fund operations or to raise funds by selling mortgage backed securities countrywide has been trying for months to reassure investors about its financial prospects the latest crisis of confidence began early wednesday after a merrill lynch analyst spooked investors by raising the possibility that countrywide could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection yesterday countrywide said it had drawn &# billion of funds through a previously arranged "backup" line of credit from banks more than of the funds have a term of more than four years countrywide said adding that the move should "enable the company to meet its funding needs and continue growing its franchise " countrywide also outlined a strategy under which it plans to use is countrywide bank unit to fund nearly all its loans up from more than now as long as it can continue to attract deposits and cd accounts the bank provides a much more stable source of funding than commercial paper and other short term instruments that were the lifeblood of dozens of smaller lenders that have failed over the past six months the bank also

buy those loans and package them into securities that can be sold to investors world wide the problem is with "jumbo" mortgages above the &# limit and some other loans including those to people with poor credit records or who dont document their income so called nonconforming loans or ones that cant be sold to fannie or freddie countrywide and other lenders generally fund these by borrowing short term money until the loans can be packaged for sale to investors which can take several months with wall street firms and other lenders refusing to extend such credit lenders must either stop making loans that cant be sold to fannie and freddie or find alternative sources of funding amid this scramble for funds lenders are drastically scaling back their offerings of nonconforming loans and jacking up interest rates prime jumbo fixed rate loans that carried interest rates of less than a month ago can often cost more than but many loans being financed now are based on commitments to borrowers made months ago countrywide made about &# billion of loans in july of which an estimated &# billion to &# billion cant be sold to fannie or freddie according to paul j miller jr an analyst at friedman billings ramsey &amp co countrywide can retain some of these as investments and try to sell some to investors but eventually may be forced to dump many of them on the market at a large discount if investor demand remains low mr miller wrote in a research note published yesterday a fire sale of mortgage holdings would put "tremendous pressure" on countrywides book value and stock price mr miller wrote "the big question is can countrywide survive " he added "we do believe there is a scenario in which the current liquidity crises last for longer than three months and countrywide is forced into bankruptcy " creditsights inc a bond research firm said it believes countrywide has the financial strength to lend at a reduced volume for months in the hope that "capital markets begin to function more smoothly again " if credit markets remain in disarray a large bank may see a bid for countrywide as a way "to leap to the top of the mortgage league tables on the cheap " creditsights said down the street from the corporate headquarters in calabasas deposit holders besieged a countrywide retail branch yesterday morning the outlet had only one banking representative and one mortgage officer on hand and they compiled a waiting list to handle the heavy flow of clients anxious about the security of their certificates of deposit savings and checking accounts although the fdic

havent matured and she inquired about early withdrawal penalties the countrywide officer who attended to ms tedeski sought to reassure her about the companys financial health and the federal insurance that applied to her deposits still she said "i will have to think about the risks of keeping the cds " she says the majority of customers who camped out in the countrywide branch were senior citizens worried about their retirement nest eggs one man who declined to identify himself said he had just withdrawn all his deposits in countrywide checking and savings accounts countrywide has been tightening its guidelines and raising prices for some of its mortgage products on monday it sent brokers a lengthy set of changes in underwriting guidelines and pricing the changes related to loans that fell outside fannie and freddie guidelines said adam stein a mortgage broker in auburn wash who said he will continue to work with countrywide some brokers are looking for other sources of funding in case loans they planned to arrange through countrywide fall through or are sticking to loans that can be sold to fannie and freddie and thus will be easier to offload if the lender they are dealing with doesnt meet its obligations connor shortsleeve a mortgage banker with metrobostonmortgage in canton mass says he arranged yesterday for back up financing for a mortgage loan for a self employed borrower who is purchasing a &# home but hasnt sold his current home yet the buyer had already been preapproved by countrywide but "the seller said to the real estate broker they were uncomfortable with just a countrywide letter of approval and wanted a letter from another lender " mr shortsleeve says "you really have to have back up financing on purchases that are happening right now " countrywides woes sent prices of its bonds plunging to levels many investors consider "distressed " among the worst hit were the mortgage companys notes that come due within the next year a bond

down its bank lines moodys took the biggest action by cutting its rating three notches to baa its lowest investment grade rating that is one level above "junk" status standard &amp poors dropped its countrywide rating by a notch to a minus while fitch ratings lowered its two notches to bbb plus moodys said the difficult financial markets "create potential challenges to countrywides franchise and leadership in the mortgage banking business " the new york rating firm added that countrywide needs to stabilize and widen its sources of funding it also said countrywides rating could be lowered again "should its available liquidity come under further stress" or if the market value of its mortgage holdings keeps falling with countrywides access to the short term commercial paper markets now cut off many investors are unsure if the company can work through its funding problems in coming months "the uncertainty is concentrated in the near term the company is either going to get over this event in the next few months or it isnt " said jon duensing a portfolio manager at smith breeden associates kevin murphy a bond fund manager at putnam investments in boston said "countrywide is the gold standard of the mortgage market and has a pristine reputation but if they cant get the funding they need it would be very bad for their business and become a real credit issue " many analysts and investors expect countrywide to quickly take steps to shore up its finances by shrinking its balance sheet and selling assets "it looks like they are trying to sell what they can to raise cash " said thomas atteberry a portfolio manager at first pacific advisors in los angeles while countrywide is the largest mortgage company struggling against a changing credit environment it is hardly alone with liquidity drying up indymac bancorp which had focused on alt a loans a category between prime and subprime that often involves borrowers who dont fully document their income or assets or those buying investment properties says it has shifted its emphasis to loans that can be sold to fannie and freddie indymac chief executive michael perry says the company is finishing the quarter ending sept "with more than " of production eligible for sale to fannie and freddie based on the dollar amount of its loans mr perry expects loan volume to shrink to roughly &# billion in the fourth quarter from about

its bank "we have the liquidity and the capital not to sell those loans " mr perry says he adds that the company is "not a big commercial paper user" and has "record liquidity "
