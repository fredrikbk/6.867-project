has fed quietly eased stance amid hopes for rate cut some say that in effect it has already happened washington speculation intensified that the federal reserve is going to cut interest rates soon or even has already in effect done so without any clear signal from the fed to encourage it the feds primary weapon is its influence over the federal funds interest rate at which banks with excess reserves lend to banks that are short reserves when demand swamped supply last week and the market interest rate rose above the target the fed pumped in extra cash but at times of turmoil it can be difficult for the federal reserve bank of new york to fine tune its interventions in recent days the rate has traded well below the feds target at some points of the day even coming close to zero at times that has prompted some in the markets to deem this a stealth fed easing "the way we view the fed has changed " said james bianco president of bianco research llc a financial markets research firm in an email to clients "whether this is a temporary or permanent change remains to be seen but the fact is the fed eased last friday t hey are allowing the effective fed funds rate what the actual rate is to deviate from the target fed funds rate what they want it to be " but federal reserve chairman ben bernanke both in principle and in practice has a commitment to increased transparency and the current fed is extremely unlikely to change policy without announcement the effects of a rate cut would be muted if it was shrouded in secrecy mr bernankes predecessor alan greenspan often tried to steer financial markets when their views of the economy diverged from the feds mr bernanke does less of that and that approach has contributed to the divergence of views among fed watchers in the markets morgan stanley said this week "we believe that the decision to inject more reserves on wednesday actually reflects a temporary easing of policy on the part of the fed indeed they still do not appear to be particularly anxious to announce an inter meeting cut in the official funds rate target t he fed is essentially attempting to buy some time to see how things shake out remember there are no rules here we are in uncharted territory " trading in fed funds futures indicates markets anticipate that the fed will cut its rate target now at on or before sept by one quarter percentage point and by another one quarter percentage point by years end st louis federal reserve president william poole in an interview with bloomberg television wednesday made no secret of his opposition to any fed rate cut before its next scheduled meeting sept "theres no need for the federal reserve unless theres some sort of calamity taking place to make a decision before the next meeting " he said according to a bloomberg account of the interview "if the data confirm the markets view that the economy is sagging well have to decide whether to share that view "" mr poole added that he sees no sign that the subprime mortgage rout is harming the broader u s economy and an interest rate cut isnt yet needed "i dont see any impact as yet on the real economy or on the inflation rate " he said "obviously there could be an impact but we have to rely on some real evidence " asked about the remarks fed spokeswoman michelle smith said "president poole is speaking for himself and not for the committee " mr poole who is among the five regional fed bank presidents with a vote on the feds policy committee is not always the best weather vane on april he acknowledged speculation that the fed might cut rates before its may meeting but said "there are compelling times when quick action is necessary but this is not one of them " on april the fed cut rates by a startling half percentage point the federal reserve bank of new york said yesterday it expects to provide reserves through repurchase agreements or repo operations "on most days" for the next two weeks the statement was an attempt to alert the markets in advance so that they wouldnt misinterpret the daily intervention in the money markets as a sign of extraordinary concern caused by continuing market turmoil it added that it "stands ready to arrange further operations as needed to facilitate trading at rates around" the target for the federal funds rate in the u s banks are required to have a minimum level of reserves on average of a two week period known as a "maintenance period " if a bank has excess reserves it can lend them in the federal funds market if it has insufficient reserves it can borrow them the fed adds and drains credit for that market to keep the interest rate near its target anticipating seasonal ebbs and flows of demand for credit and the u s treasurys debt auctions and other factors the fed injected &# billion into the market early yesterday through day repurchase agreements that is reserves that will be available for the full two weeks of the maintenance period and another &# billion for just one day the european central bank didnt intervene in its money markets yesterday
