the afternoon report the discount windows day online edition ben bernanke and his fellow policy makers buoyed what looked to be an ugly market open today as they tinkered with one of the federal reserves oft overlooked credit tools before u s markets opened the fed announced a half percentage point cut of its discount rate to saying the changes will stay until the central bank "determines that market liquidity has improved materially " the discount rate the amount the fed charges banks for direct loans has long been overshadowed by the more prominent federal funds rate and the amount of cash coursing into the economy from the feds discount window isnt overwhelming but the surprise move heartened wall street for a few reasons among them was the fact that mr bernankes typical fixation on inflation was nowhere to be found in the statement accompanying the move instead the single paragraph focused solely upon economic and credit risks saying "market conditions have deteriorated and tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward " and while the fed adhered to the line that the economy will show "moderate" growth it added that the "downside risks to growth have increased appreciably " such statements sounded like a turnabout from the feds long standing focus on inflation as the primary sword dangling over the economy as such it seemed to improve the odds of a cut in the federal funds rate sooner rather than later lou crandall chief economist at wrightson associates told the wall street journal that todays fed moves were designed in several ways to give a jolt of juice to the mindset of moody financial markets for one thing it softened the feds stance on taking action in between meetings then there was the discount window rate cut itself and as well the accompanying statement on growth risks mr crandall said the fed wants "to provide as much psychological impact as possible without backing away from the principles theyve outlined they want to show as much support as possible " stephen stanley chief economist at rbs greenwich capital also saw the important psychological component of the move saying "for the fed right now this is a confidence game their job goal is to shore up confidence among market participants to encourage them to re engage in risk taking " if that was the goal mission accomplished at least for today following the feds premarket announcement stock market futures which had been pointing sharply lower whipsawed skyward and after the opening bell
