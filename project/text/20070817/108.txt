judged exactly the same as those with withering trees and skimpy shrubs "were using a broad brush here " mr barnhart says homeowners who need a professional opinion for insurance or tax purposes typically turn to an arborist or other landscape expert as do insurance companies investigating claims but even here not all specialists are uniformly trained and theres no unanimity of opinion or law

says a fellow arborist once told her that he calculated the worth of a diseased ash tree by figuring what he would charge to treat it for five years and then remove it when it died which he thought was likely a method that isnt mentioned in the councils guidelines homeowners need to ask arborists what sort of experience theyve had in appraising trees before hiring them ms nelson says perplexing
