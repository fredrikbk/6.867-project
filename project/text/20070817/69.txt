politics &amp economics padilla conviction feeds debate washington jose padillas conviction in miami on charges of helping islamic extremists and plotting overseas attacks marked a victory for the justice departments aggressive campaign to bust suspected terrorist cells it also is likely to feed an already fevered debate about the use of wiretapping by the federal government prosecutors built their case largely on wiretaps that began in the early s when federal agents obtained warrants from the foreign intelligence surveillance court that special court can authorize wiretaps on thinner grounds than those needed during a regular criminal investigation at the administrations behest congress recently expanded the governments power to obtain wiretaps outside court supervision the successful outcome of the padilla trial will bolster those who say a broad regime of warrantless electronic surveillance is a vital tool in the fight against terrorism it also could help the argument of those who say that supervision by a civilian court is no impediment to government counterterrorism investigations the case shows "that the system that the congress established requiring some limited judicial participation in the wiretaps was good enough to convict padilla " said jesse choper a professor of constitutional law at the university of california berkeley "but maybe it would not be good enough to convict some other character and thats what the president would have to argue " employing conventional criminal law introducing evidence from wiretaps conducted under court supervision and abiding by constitutional due process rules federal prosecutors were able to convict mr padilla and two co defendants serious as they are the murder conspiracy count carries a potential life term the charges are a far cry from the accusations first leveled at mr padilla upon his arrest in the native brooklynite had been sent by al qaeda to detonate a radiological "dirty bomb" in a u s city then attorney general john ashcroft said for that reason president bush designated him an "enemy combatant" to be held and interrogated by the military with none of the rights the constitution affords criminal defendants during those interrogations he couldnt invoke constitutional rights to remain silent or consult an attorney so any evidence they produced was almost certainly inadmissible in court two years after mr padillas arrest james comey then deputy attorney general told reporters military detention was the only way to keep mr padilla from wreaking mayhem because prosecuting him in civilian court would have required the government to reveal intelligence secrets vital to national security "he would likely have ended up a free man " mr comey said then officials slowly retreated from the claim that mr padilla a onetime chicago gang member who converted to islam in the s was capable of committing a sophisticated terrorist attack within the administration officials in the defense and justice departments grew uncomfortable with the prospect of holding a u s citizen indefinitely without charge in as the supreme court weighed whether to hear mr padillas challenge to his military detention the government abruptly changed course transferring him to civilian custody to face charges unrelated to the dirty bomb plot essentially conspiring with other muslim radicals in florida to recruit support and eventually join fighters in a "violent jihad" against americans central to the investigation were some fbi wiretap intercepts collected from to mainly involving mr padillas two co defendants and others most of the conversations were in arabic and purportedly used code words mr padilla and his co defendants adham amin hassoun and kifah wael jayyousi face sentencing dec attorneys for messrs hassoun and jayyousi said they plan to appeal there was no immediate comment from mr padillas lawyers evan perez and the associated press contributed to this article
