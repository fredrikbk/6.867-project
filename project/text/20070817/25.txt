fiscally fit credit only where credit is due terri looks at how the mortgage crunch is playing out in her neck of the woods online edition mortgage lending giant countrywide financial rattled wall street wednesday by announcing it was bowing out of the subprime mortgage business the move comes as dozens of lenders and mortgage companies have gone out of business or filed for bankruptcy amid the deepening credit crisis many investors like me wondered what if any long term damage this might inflict on their portfolios but to homeowners and homebuyers a more urgent question might be what affect is the credit crunch going to have on my ability to get a mortgage or home equity loan for now it appears homeowners with good credit still have access to relatively low cost financing the average rate for a year fixed rate mortgage stands at while the rate on a &# home equity line of credit averaged according to bankrate com if my experience is an indicator lenders are becoming even more aggressive in seeking out homeowners with good credit and substantial home equity lately my husband gerry and i have been bombarded with home equity loan and line of credit offers from our bank "get &# for as little as &# a month" and our credit card company "as low as guaranteed for life " our credit union sent a letter recently noting that we hadnt borrowed on the account recently and offering a lower rate of interest if we borrowed a minimum of &# and if my neighborhood is an indicator were not alone as i mentioned in a past column home construction in my neck of the woods is booming new homes are being built and mcmansions are rising where small bungalows once stood the renovations are so extensive its unlikely theyre being paid for with cash savings so clearly the credit spigot hasnt been turned off so whos in trouble if they need to get a mortgage borrowers with bad credit will find it extremely difficult to get a loan right now says fritz elmendorf spokesman for the consumer bankers association "unless youre looking for a conventional loan with good credit there arent too many out there willing to lend right now " he says and needless to say anyone walking in with no documentation expecting to get a loan will be out of luck he says another casualty of the credit crunch "piggyback" loans "this type of loan has almost completely disappeared " mr elmendorf says piggybacks combine a first mortgage that covers of the homes price and a second mortgage to cover the remaining the loans came into favor in the last decade as a way for borrowers to avoid paying for private mortgage insurance pmi which protects lenders in the event of a default going forward he says homebuyers will need to come up with at least some portion of the downpayment in cash and pay pmi my sister melissa and her husband joe got their piggyback just before lenders soured on the loans the couple purchased their first home this spring for &# eighty percent of the homes price was covered by their low rate first mortgage and the remaining on a higher rate year balloon loan melissa says theyre managing the monthly payments and since they have a cushion of savings shes not worried about making the mortgage whats keeping her up at night is home prices shes become addicted to monitoring the same real estate and foreclosure sites she used to find her home she estimates home prices in her area are down about from where they were just six months ago more troubling the number of foreclosures is up which means price are likely to sink even lower the couple had hoped that in a few years their home would appreciate enough to allow them to refinance the two loans into a single lower rate mortgage but that scenario now seems highly unlikely theyll need to stay in their home and continue paying the two loans for at least five years though likely more if they get into a financial crisis anytime soon its very possible they wont be able to refinance because theyll have negative equity meaning their mortgage will be greater than the value of their home anyone in the market for a home with no downpayment will need to rent a little longer to build up their savings homeowners looking to refinance and would be home buyers will need to work at boosting their credit scores before applying for a loan this article offers some good tips homeowners who are in my sisters situation underwater on their mortgages should cut back on spending as soon as possible and start funding a rainy day account to provide a cushion in the event of a financial emergency if youre already experiencing one your options are limited some lenders are helping borrowers modify their loans to prevent them from defaulting but financially distressed homeowners are often paralyzed by fears of losing their home and wait until the last minute to try and work something out with the lender at that point the loan is so delinquent that lenders are unwilling to negotiate so if youre in trouble contact your lender as soon as possible and try to work something out the pendulum has definitely swung hard to more conservative lending practices and ultimately thats a good thing for borrowers who wont be allowed to get themselves too deeply in debt how is the credit crisis playing out in your neck of the woods do you know anyone having trouble refinancing or getting a mortgage
