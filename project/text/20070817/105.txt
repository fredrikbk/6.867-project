weekend journal taste houses of worship vacationing with jesus there comes a time in every mothers life when she has to make a decision to save herself and her loved ones even if it means taking a leap of faith there comes a time for vacation bible school the large signs beckon from every suburban church free baby sitting they whisper all week it is a seductive pitch directed at frazzled parents desperate to entertain their bored offspring as the summer drags on vacation bible school or vbs differs by denomination but churches that offer it share a common goal to expose children to the gospel and maybe just maybe recruit their families into the church for southern baptists the largest protestant denomination in the u s vbs is the most effective tool of evangelism the impetus for of baptisms in nearly three million children and adults attended vbs at southern baptist churches last year resulting in "decisions to receive christ as savior" and "sunday school prospects discovered " according to southern baptist convention statisticians "vacation bible school is todays revival " said jerry wooley the vbs specialist for lifeway the sbcs publishing agency vacation bible school was the brainchild of a mrs d t miles wife of a methodist minister in hopedale ill mrs miles it is said was concerned that the children of her husbands congregation werent learning enough on sundays and needed a monthlong course of study over the summer the first session in had students like its modern day counterparts it included arts and crafts singing exercise drama and bible study today more than half of american churches offer vbs many provide a weeklong half day program during the summer primarily for grade schoolers increasingly however churches are switching to evening sessions and offering classes for adults as well said the rev mayra castaneda assistant director of education and leadership ministries for the national council of churches vbs is big business for the publishing houses of the major denominations which develop an annual theme ranging from ranching to hot air ballooning and sell workbooks teacher manuals decorations and computer games wrapped around it more than of the united methodist churches in the u s offer vacation bible school and they learned next years theme "beach party surfin through the scriptures " this july the material will be available by december allowing churches if they choose to conduct a summer themed vbs over christmas vacation chapel hill united methodist church in chapel hill tenn has members and for them vbs was a budget breaking expense at &# it "is one of our highest funded programs " said jenny youngman the wife of the pastor the investment paid off chapel hills program held july to drew children each evening and resulted in three new families attending church the next weekend vbs often begins or ends with a party as simple as a family worship service with refreshments afterward or as elaborate as a carnival with pony rides during the course of the week children may go on field trips and they often take home t shirts cds hats bracelets and videos usually all of this is free while a week at other camps can cost &# or more but the ymca camp doesnt follow up with phone calls and postcards urging you to come to sunday school the frozen ropes baseball camp doesnt ask your year old to dedicate his life to christ "people love to claim that our whole goal is to trap these kids into making a decision theyre not ready to make but were not forcing anything every church i know is very open about what theyre going to do that week " lifeways mr wooley said "were telling you right up front were going to be teaching gods word " churches are just one group competing for the hearts and minds of children he said "we know that once a child gets to about the age of if they have not been exposed to the gospel message of christ its going to be really hard to reach that person after " mr wooley added citing research by the barna group a ventura calif firm that studies cultural and religious trends glynis jaszewski a roman catholic who lives in the suburbs of richmond va sent her two children to vacation bible schools at protestant churches without qualms "when i was working they would always go to two or three of them in the summer it was day care " mrs jaszewski said she believes their generic christian message doesnt vary much even across denominational lines indeed the big publishing houses that provide vbs material the sbcs lifeway the united methodists cokesbury and the nondenominational standard publishing which produced the first printed vbs curriculum in peddle their wares to any church regardless of denomination and the simple themes based on bible verses with an accompanying vbs cheer "run the race keep the pace keep your eyes on jesus " rarely stray into wittenberg like territory mrs youngman the pastors wife said churches welcome any child to vbs whatever the parents intent "if we can connect with just one family its worth it " she said ms graham is a writer in the suburbs of boston
