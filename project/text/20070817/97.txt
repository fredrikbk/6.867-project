wal mart eyes smaller and higher end stores twelve years ago wal mart stores inc executives welcomed terry leahy to the companys bentonville ark headquarters mr leahy newly promoted at tesco plc and considering an overhaul of the british retailer spent an afternoon discussing operations with wal mart executives today wal mart is doing everything it can to stop mr leahy from crashing its last big growth business groceries it has a team of executives hunkered down far from bentonville in the san francisco bay area devising two new small footprint stores including a response to the november launch of tescos u s grocery stores according to people familiar with the group their brainchildren represent an unlikely step for staid wal mart one idea calls for urban convenience stores less than a tenth of the size of the companys supercenters and stocked with groceries geared to more affluent tastes another plan calls for stand alone stores offering a variety of health services and products the new outlets are being prepared for introduction early next year the people say david wild the wal mart senior vice president of new business development is leading the initiatives he declined to comment a wal mart spokesman wouldnt provide specifics but said "our business is constantly evolving and were always looking for new and innovative ways to serve our customers " the company may have waited too long to develop successors to its big box u s stores analysts now chopping their profit estimates for this and next year say wal mart has seemed tone deaf to consumer trends failed pushes in womens fashions and home decor continue to sap profits and high gasoline prices are eating into supercenter visits recently wal mart has tried running ads promoting its low prices as worth the extra travel nonetheless the smaller stores could help wal mart do more than fend off tesco the retailer has been largely shut out from upper income and urban markets including those in california and new york high land costs and local opposition have limited the discounter to just supercenters in california a tenth of the number in texas smaller stores are less likely to stir up opponents than the hulking square foot big box stores in health care wal mart sees itself providing an array of services and home health equipment along with the prescription eyeglasses and pharmaceuticals that it already sells according to a person familiar with the effort "in five years wal mart wants to be on its way to becoming the no health care company in america " that person said in april the retailer announced that over the next three years it would open up to in store clinics offering basic services including school physicals and treatments for sinus infections and allergies it also said it hoped to have clinics in operation in five to seven years wal mart has already teamed with some big employers hoping to improve employee health by providing standards for electronic health records if that effort succeeds it would give the wal mart clinics a boost the worlds largest retailer hopes to begin rolling out the new convenience and health care stores early next year and its looking at locations in california for the pilots a wal mart spokesman said the company "regularly tests new formats" but declined to describe the effort further california has been an embarrassing stumbling block for the arkansas retail giant "wal mart doesnt have a format that works in california " says burt p flickinger iii managing director of retail consultant strategic resource group he believes the convenience store effort is based in the san francisco area because it is home to the trader joes chain retailer of prepared foods and trency groceries and it has become the biggest market for whole foods inc "wal mart really needs to take a strategic stand" in the state he says tescos impending arrival in the u s southwest has accelerated wal marts plans the british retailer is expected to open fresh &amp easy neighborhood market stores by february and invest &# billion in the u s rollout over the next five years according to a spokesman for tescos u s operation which is based in el segundo calif after the first stores are launched the company has more stores in its pipeline for early "the impact on the competition depends on how fast tesco rolls out i think itll be fast " says david mccarthy a london based deputy head of equity research for citigroup he estimates tesco could have u s stores and u s revenue of &# billion by the proposed wal mart stores would fit with u s chief eduardo castro wrights goal of localizing the retailers business as part of its effort to appeal to a broader range of consumers wal mart has begun tailoring merchandise and food selections to regional and ethnic groups and tastes it recently asked fruit vendors to package apples now sold in plastic bags in paper sacks similar to those at roadside orchards and it is reaching out to major suppliers including johnson &amp johnson and procter &amp gamble co for advice wal mart could use an injection of new ideas its earnings are expected to rise just this year to &# billion compared with a increase just two years ago the company remains the worlds largest retailer with sales this year projected to hit &# billion but its rivals costco wholesale inc target corp and j c penney co have been turning in better comparable store sales for more than a year food sales are a double edged sword for wal mart they represent its fastest growing business with revenue rising last quarter and comparable store sales up about this year but slim profits mean the companys overall margins weaken as foods share of the business gains wal mart shares hit a new week low yesterday before bouncing back to close at &# up cents on the day in addition wal mart hasnt successfully incubated new store concepts since the first supercenter was created in its effort to build a conventional grocery business via neighborhood market stores has been a modest success at best the square foot outlets were designed to fill the gap between supercenters but the company has opened just of them since efforts to start new retail outlets overseas in countries like germany were stark failures in contrast wal mart has had some success entering into joint ventures with local retailers as it did with mexicos cifra sa in buying majority control after it understood the market wal mart isnt the only company readying new store formats major grocery chains are testing ideas that combine convenience and grocery stores the third largest u s supermarket chain safeway inc recently opened citrine new world bistro a restaurant that uses its private label brands familymart co the third largest convenience store operator in japan has opened famima convenience stores in the los angeles area and plans u s stores by "this is a big big target " says hidenari sato famimas vice president of u s operations analysts say wal mart hasnt been able to penetrate the markets where wealthier america resides "in the northeast corridor california and chicago you have of u s income and retail sales yet these areas account for of wal mart stores and less than of their supercenters " says greg melich a retail analyst at morgan stanley
