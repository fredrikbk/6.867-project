weekend journal review theater in jerome robbinss footsteps west side story seacoast repertory theatre bow st portsmouth n h &# &# closes aug the king and i ogunquit playhouse u s ogunquit maine &# &# closes aug portsmouth n h the fame of a stage director is usually as ephemeral as cotton candy in his lifetime jerome robbins was universally regarded as the greatest musical comedy director of his generation today though we must take his reputation on faith since only one of his shows "peter pan " was commercially filmed or telecast in its original form fortunately quite a bit of robbinss broadway choreography survives and it is regularly used in contemporary revivals of the many classic musicals he staged arthur laurentss recent city center revival of "gypsy " for instance used robbinss dances as do the regional productions of "west side story" and "the king and i" that i saw in new england last week of all the robbins shows "west side story " in which the plot of "romeo and juliet" is transplanted to a new york slum circa is hardest to revive without his choreography to be sure it can be done joel ferrell rechoreographed the show to fine effect for portland center stage last year but to do so is inevitably to invite comparison with the finger popping dances that made it into the film version and so became familiar to millions of moviegoers who would never see "west side story" on stage for most of us these vaulting vibrant sketches of teenage passion are as much a part of "west side story" as leonard bernsteins jazzy score and any director who omits them does so at his own risk brian swasey the man at the helm of the seacoast repertory theatres revival of "west side story " has opted for modesty over daring "who am i to think i can create something better than jerome robbins " he writes in his program note i admire his good sense and i also admire the way in which he has managed to cram robbinss dances into a downstairs theater whose stage isnt much larger than my manhattan living room my third row seat was no more than feet from the action to see "west side story" in so intimate a setting is viscerally thrilling in a way that no big house performance can possibly hope to rival it happens that i was also fortunate enough to see robbinss own staging of the "west side story" dances in "jerome robbins broadway " his greatest hits revue it stands to reason that seacoasts hard working young singer dancers cant compare with the hand picked ruthlessly trained ensemble of that brilliant show still the fresh faced members of the seacoast cast are good enough to be convincing while abby rose who cant be more than five feet tall is endearingly childlike as maria indeed the rough and ready quality of this "west side story" is part of what makes it so engaging ive seen better productions but none that touched me more ogunquit maine unlike the explosively kinetic tale of the sharks and the jets "the king and i" is not a dance driven show it does however contain one production number "the small house of uncle thomas " that requires first rate choreography to make its effect robbinss staging which was transferred intact from the broadway production to the film version is a timeless piece of theatrical magic that no one has equaled much less surpassed steven yuhasz directed the revival of "the king and i" now playing at maines ogunquit playhouse a year old purveyor of resort town musical comedy that bills itself as "broadway on the beach " he has wisely chosen to stick with the original choreography and susan kikuchis mostly faithful re creation of robbinss thai style dance and mime version of "uncle toms cabin" is one of the productions highlights the dancing isnt up to broadway standards but robbinss conception is so strong and vivid that it neednt be executed perfectly in order to be perfectly charming if youre longing for a radical rethinking of "the king and i " youre out of luck for mr yuhaszs approach to the show is traditional in every way he has even opted to use the costumes designed by stanley simmons for the broadway revival which in turn were based on the ones designed by irene sharaff in as for lorenzo lamas as the king of siam he wears his hair in a modified mohawk instead of taking it all off but otherwise his performance follows the yul brynner playbook closely and winningly rachel de benedet is no less winning as anna the stiff upper lip welsh schoolmarm who leads her royal employer along the road to western modernity though her faux cockney vowels make mincemeat out of the song whose title she insists on rendering as "getting to kneaouw you" all the secondary roles are well done two of them exceptionally so joanne javien sings tuptims numbers with operetta like flair and hechter ubarry is a properly glowering kralahome i saw "the king and i" early in its three week run a fact that doubtless accounted for a number of awkward onstage moments none of them interfered with my enjoyment of what may well be the very best show that richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein ii wrote only the undernourished scruffy sounding playing of the six piece pit band kept me from letting down my critical guard and having an unselfconsciously good time mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com
