the daily fix champs are marching back in baseballs weakest division online edition here come the champs left for dead the st louis cardinals are benefiting from playing in baseballs worst division by standing just two and a half games out of first place even as they remain two games under thats a fine recipe for tony la russas team which finished just five games over last year but won the world series in five games against the detroit tigers after completing a sweep of the first place milwaukee brewers the cards are off to chicago to face the second place chicago cubs in a weekend series "to the brewers routine pop ups are grenades " bernie miklasz writes in the st louis post dispatch "the pressure of losing continues to infiltrate and dominate their psyche their minds are cluttered with doubt their actions speak of a team that expects to lose the cardinals meanwhile are still crazy in a compelling way after all these years with la russa and thats a compliment who can explain this we saw an instantaneous reinvention last october when the cardinals pulled out of their late season malaise to pull off their postseason magic they turned busch stadium into an elysian field turned their dull regular season finish into world series gold now the cardinals are trying to go seabiscuit on us again " how are the cubs and brewers allowing it to happen even as the cards rank in the bottom half of the weak nl in both hitting and pitching the top of the brewers rotation has collapsed and the cubs have suffered without alfonso soriano phil rogers writes in the chicago tribune it also helps that the division has been so bad overall the fix generally celebrates words not images but dave studemans multicolored charts of the central division races on hardball times speak thousands of words ahead of the four game cubs cards series chicago sun times columnist rick telander headed to milwaukee to see the turnaround in person he reports back to his readers that "the once dismal cardinals suddenly look like a monster corn threshing machine churning toward the horizon " its an ugly photo former major leaguer jose offerman is pictured wielding his bat ready to strike bridgeport bluefish pitcher matt beech who has his hands up in a defensive crouch mr beech has just hit mr offerman with a pitch an inning after the long island duck homered off of mr beech the bluefish catcher john nathans is attempting to hold mr offerman back after the photo was snapped mr nathans suffered a concussion and mr offerman was arrested for assault with that photo topping his column the baltimore suns david steele cant exactly defend mr offerman but he does condemn baseballs unwritten rules that say its ok to hit a batter intentionally for having the temerity to homer but its not ok to charge the mound with a bat neither in mr steeles book should be condoned "give someone a concussion with a baseball as no less than roger clemens did to mike piazza in recent years because you failed to retire a batter as youre paid to do and thats what the greats in this game have always done " mr steele writes "but give someone a concussion with a bat as offermans wild backswing did to the opposing catcher john nathans who was trying to stop him because you feel there was no rational reason to get hit and thats a crime and the end of your career once again this isnt a defense of offerman bringing a bat to the mound thats inexcusable this is a plea to get someone in baseball to understand that using a pitched ball for any reason other than getting the batter out is just as inexcusable " shameless plug half the fix made a similar argument in a column back in his collegiate days an accidental hit by pitch years ago still haunts jack hamilton whose errant fastball knocked boston deity tony conigliaro out for one and a half seasons "every kid who grows up in boston learns the story of tony c and for many its their first taste of sadness and broken dreams " jeff passan writes on yahoo sports "at first it sounds like a fairy tale the local boy a product of st marys high in lynn starts his first game with the red sox as a year old and hits the first pitch he sees for a home run he leads the american league in home runs the next season smacks homers quicker than anyone in history slays girls with his brown eyes the size of drink coasters dates sexpot mamie van doren cruises the city in a corvette records a few songs and is well on his way to becoming one of the greatest baseball players anyone saw and then jack hamilton shows up " mr hamilton swears it was an accident and the late mr conigliaro who went on to excel in before exiting baseball at age believed him yet even today northeasterners arriving at mr hamiltons restaurant in branson mo hear his name and recognize it and ask "how did it happen " barry bonds and his lawyer john burris are looking for people to sue for defamation san francisco chronicle columnist gwen knapp is a touch hurt that he hasnt targeted her nor any of the former sluggers such as frank robinson and dale murphy who have expressed distrust about how bonds got the career home run record "the prospect of bonds vs legends of the game is still alive " ms knapp writes "but before anyone sets up outside the courthouse with baseballs and a felt pen bear in mind that any such cases wouldnt get to first base burris is an accomplished attorney he understands that opinions are legally protected and he says he intends to pursue only people who make false statements about what barry said " the tampa bay devil rays are dead last in baseball in earned run average nearly a run worse than the runner up cincinnati reds that helps explain why st petersburg times columnist john romano is exulting in the clubs signing of no draft pick david price a left handed pitcher for a guaranteed &# million over six years this exultation even overcomes deserved cynicism over the clubs record with young pitchers "there is no greater risk than overspending on pitching " mr romano writes "the rays signed six first round draft picks between tossing out &# million in salary and bonuses thus far the return is a record " yet mr romano adds "to sign a johan santana or a barry zito on the open market takes a &# million commitment price may never approach their level of success but he has a chance and at &# million it is certainly worth taking the risk " this years tour de france was riddled with dropouts and doping scandals but the eventual winner wasnt charged with using a banned drug not so with last years winner floyd landis who is fighting to clear his name more than a year later he stopped to watch this years race only during downtime from his own tour to promote his book and proclaim his innocence "landis who started his career racing mountain bikes was heralded as a gritty rider with a superhuman ability to endure " sara corbett writes in a profile in the new york timess play magazine "his tour victory was deemed to be the most exciting in years if not decades and then he fell or maybe hed already fallen with landis its virtually impossible to know whether he earned his way into hell or was thrown there without a lick of fairness " tip of the fix cap to reader john falck found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well
