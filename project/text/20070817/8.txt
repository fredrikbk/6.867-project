can high school last forever on ice in russian on stage disney aims for hit musical to be a long term cash cow los angeles at a recent shoot for a new ice skating version of walt disney co s "high school musical " the stylist suggested highlighting the hair of the skater playing the character troy to make him look more like zac efron the year old heartthrob who plays the role in the tv movies but a disney executive told the stylist to leave it dark "the franchise is expanding to the point that we need to embrace the fact these are different people and theyre not all going to look like zac " said the disney executive steve fickinger who is vice president of theatrical licensing at the company "high school musical" has made instant celebrities of mr efron and his ensemble of co stars a fact that is evident by the flurry of excitement around todays debut of "high school musical " on the disney channel disney is looking beyond its successful original formula in hopes of creating a franchise that can be sustained over the long term down the road disney hopes to keep the series alive with new actors and stories that appear under the now powerful "high school musical" brand the companys ability to do that will go a long way toward determining whether "high school musical" is a brief very profitable starburst for the company or a long running franchise such as "harry potter " the first movie splashed onto the disney channel months ago and since then disney has been aggressively spinning out new components the original "high school musical" cost &# million the sequel roughly &# million the franchise is expected to generate a total of &# million of profit in and disney chief executive bob iger said "high school musical" has risen to prominence much faster than any other disney franchise even pixars popular "toy story" series he believes it has a long life span ahead of it disney channel chief rich ross said "it has certainly gone way past a trend or a fad" and is still firmly in "growth mode " he added "the original movie continues to do blockbuster business " that movie has drawn million tv viewers world wide and spawned a dvd a chart topping cd a concert tour school productions a stage musical a book series and stationery disney plans to use the second movie to spin off a global ice tour new school productions ipod accessories a karaoke video game fragrances cosmetics and musical handbags in a departure from previous franchises disney already has plans to make local language versions of the movie with new casts in several countries including india russia and latin america a big test of the propertys staying power will come in when a third u s movie is expected to be released in theaters rather than on the disney channel while disney hopes the movie will feature the entire original cast it will also introduce new characters that could carry the franchise forward according to people familiar with the situation it will be a natural time to introduce a new generation of characters given that the film is built around graduation while the original cast has been pivotal to the success of "high school musical " mr iger said that "if the franchise lives as long as i believe it will it will require an infusion of new talent " jonah disend chief executive of new york based brand strategy firm redscout said "high school musical" benefits from themes that will "always be around " but he said "high school musical as a trademark with specific characters has a limited shelf life " mr disend added that "the sweetness" of the property is unlikely to be sustainable and disney will have to introduce some "more irony or more depth" to the characters and storyline if it is to keep audiences captivated the first movie followed a simple feel good story of troy a basketball jock who falls for math brainiac gabriella it explored such teen themes as first love acceptance and self expression the second movie takes that story into new emotional territories loyalty and maturity and new sports baseball and golf pastimes with global appeal especially in japan by setting the property up as an ensemble disney may avoid some of the pitfalls it has faced with other franchises its disney channel hit "lizzie mcguire" came to an abrupt end after disney got into a negotiating quagmire with its star hilary duff ms duff still makes makes records under her own name for disneys hollywood records unit as with ms duff mr efron has developed a huge following he bares his abs on the cover of rolling stone magazine this month he has also made the jump to the big screen he is one of the stars of the movie musical "hairspray " and has been in talks to star in a remake of the movie "footloose" for paramount nonetheless mr efrons absence from a live concert tour didnt prevent it from being a sellout the rollout of consumer products meanwhile has focused more on the overall brand than individual cast members mr fickinger said the stage play also doesnt feature the original cast and has been a commercial hit he said it always takes the audience a few moments to warm up to the new cast but when they do the songs and dancing are so strong they quickly forget that theyre watching new faces the ice show also has new faces disney is rolling out three versions of each cast around the world in the coming weeks while some consumers do expect to see the original cast members in both the stage and ice shows disney said there have been few complaints "some people think theyre going to see zac donning skates " mr fickinger said adding that of the nearly people who have seen the stage play so far only or so have sought refunds because it wasnt the original cast in extending the franchise mr ross said the key is to give audiences something new rather than just "a rehash " after the first movie "we were nothing short of maniacal in making sure the product extensions had the dna of the original movie yet creatively went beyond it " he said they avoided "a logo slap" at all costs still keeping fickle teen and tween audiences interested is tough disney is walking a fine line between capitalizing on the fan interest and overexploiting the property redscouts mr disend said the company is releasing too much too soon "it feels like theyre not holding anything back or making you wait for it " he said mr fickinger said when disney was working on a stage adaptation based on the first movie last year the company rushed it out in six months rather than the usual to months because it was worried people would forget about the property by the time it came out "nobody knows how quickly a super nova burns out " he said "we felt we had to seize the moment " while the initial blast took disney by surprise mr iger said the company is being thoughtful about how it rolls out the franchise a franchise committee that mr iger chairs meets regularly to consider ideas about various disney properties and "high school musical" has been very prominent in the discussions recently anne sweeney president of the disney abc television group said the company has a master calendar to make sure projects dont bump into each other mr iger said disney has started thinking about what it will do beyond the third movie "we dont expect this to end with high school musical but we do expect it to be another crescendo " said mr ross
