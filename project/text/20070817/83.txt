the lessons of to understand why money markets have been so shaken by the u s subprime mortgage turmoil and how they might be calmed it is instructive to recall the events around the stock market crash of back in that year the u s federal reserve succeeded in restoring confidence in financial markets so that credit extension resumed with savvy investors then picking up beaten up stocks markets quickly recovered and the economic expansion continued decisive central bank action world wide may well again lead to a relatively benign resolution of the present credit market downturn after several years of substantial gains international equity markets suddenly crashed on oct the precise causes of the crash have never been fully discovered but key suspects include a high valuation of equities interest rate increases a loss of confidence as a result of earlier insider trading scandals and dubious new equity issues and portfolio insurance on the basis of program trading which was intended to limit losses by having computers execute sell orders if the market fell below a specified level when they all tried to sell at once the system collapsed these features of the equity environment of look somewhat familiar to present observers of the credit markets over the last few years credit risk premiums have been so compressed that many analysts have diagnosed a "credit bubble " like equity portfolio insurance through program trading in credit derivatives have not been entirely understood by a large number of investors and the ratings of these financial instruments have not always been fully appropriate as central banks raised interest rates these problems eventually came to the fore in the u s subprime mortgage sector where the credit quality shortcomings were probably most pronounced when equity markets closed on oct prices had fallen so much the dow jones industrial average for instance plummeted points or that day that no one knew what damage had been done to private and institutional investors balance sheets with the creditworthiness of almost every market participant in doubt there was a serious danger that credit would dry up completely causing the default of a great number of debtors and hence possibly a collapse of the entire financial system as bob woodward recounts in his book "maestro greenspans fed and the american boom " fed chairman alan greenspan and new york fed president gerald corrigan took determined action to prevent this they assured markets that the fed would stand ready to "serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system" and had planned as a secret contingency even to directly guarantee payments between brokerage firms if lending money to the banks did not restore trust in the money markets the moral suasion and liquidity injections by the fed proved successful and with confidence gradually returning a number of prominent companies announced that they would buy back their own stock at the depressed prices after the crash in a paper for the fed mark carlson described the set of tools central bankers used to restore confidence to the system including "open market operations and lowering of the federal funds rate to support the liquidity of the banking system as well as liberalizing rules regarding lending securities from the system account finally the federal reserve encouraged various market participants in particular banks lending to brokers and dealers to work cooperatively and flexibly with their customers " these measures were vital in restoring stability to the system and avoiding a more severe economic fallout from the stock market downturn in the event u s real gdp grew by in after in despite the stock market losses in the fourth quarter of as in october financial markets last week suffered a loss of trust this time it came when a european institution revealed early on aug that some of its investment funds had suffered losses in this sector and that it was freezing investors deposits until liquidity returned to the asset backed securities markets with money markets seizing up as lenders feared the disclosure of more such unpleasant surprises central banks stepped in to provide liquidity and moral support just as the script from suggested now as then the purpose of central bank action has been to ensure a continuous flow of credit to borrowers in good standing by supplying commercial banks with the necessary amount of liquidity banks may feel reluctant to keep lending in present market circumstances but they know that it is essential for their future business relations to pass on this liquidity to good customers over the last few days tensions in the overnight money markets have eased on the back of central banks injection of liquidity while the term markets have remained strained and credit and stock markets have remained nervous however at &# billion to &# billion the estimated losses associated with the default of u s subprime borrowers are small compared with the assets of private investors and commercial banks whats more there are plenty of signs that the world economy has remained robust so it seems that a wide range of fundamentally sound assets have suffered out of proportion as markets have been gripped by fear the experience has shown that such circumstances provide good buying opportunities for savvy investors and there were signs in recent days of investors returning to the markets and picking up undervalued assets including asset backed securities if central banks make it clear that they stand ready to keep credit open to worthy borrowers there is still a chance that the dynamics of will reassert themselves helping to stabilize markets and to continue the world economic expansion the comparison of todays market events with those of does leave two questions open what may happen if markets fail to regain their footing and doesnt central bank support of the markets amount to a bailout of careless investors paving the way for more careless investing in the future as to the first question note that central banks can increase liquidity not only in money markets but in securities markets by easing the terms at which they buy securities in their open market operations thus they have the power to provide liquidity to financial markets in general if necessary regarding the second question the experience of suggests that central bank support of markets should stop short of re creating the conditions of careless lending that preceded the market turmoil when the present storm has blown over risk premiums in credit markets ought to be and probably will be wider than they were before mr mayer is chief european economist for deutsche bank
