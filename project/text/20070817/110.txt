weekend journal the wealth report the corn belt gets rich quietly farmers dont flaunt sudden crop windfalls buying the same pickup ogallala neb one day recently a farmer walked into cox chevrolet &amp buick in this western nebraska town and ordered a new truck of precisely the same model and color as his old one "he doesnt want anyone to know he has a new truck " says craig cox the dealerships owner in urban circles wealth tends to be enjoyed flaunted and admired but in much of rural america even amid a boom in the agricultural economy theres a deep suspicion of consumption particularly the conspicuous variety if the face of urban wealth is donald trump with his glitzy condo towers and television shows then the face of rural wealth belongs to some anonymous farmer whose battered pickup and tattered clothes belie a fortune in land equipment and investments at reicherts of ogallala a jewelry shop in this corn and cattle community of engagement ring sales average &# each half the national average and not just because of fiance frugality "even the women here say i dont want anything flashy i dont want anything big " says madeline palmer the stores sales manager this cultural distaste for showiness is notable at a time of rising farm income here in ogallala farmers are poised to reap the richest corn harvest in memory and last months record breaking wheat crop has already infused the local economy with cash meantime the nations growing appetite for ethanol the alternative fuel derived from corn is bolstering the price of that crop prompting farmers to plant more of it and the move away from wheat and other grains is boosting their prices by limiting supply you might say the future of american agriculture has never looked brighter yet no matter how much prosperity the ethanol and crop price booms bring to rural america dont expect big city style spending on fancy cars foreign travel or designer clothes in ogallala instead the rural embrace of ethanol plants two of which have opened within miles of here indicates a powerful desire for jobs high priced corn and industrial taxpayers hopes are soaring that the ethanol industry will help reverse population loss and attract new employers high hurdles for a town so isolated that catching a commercial flight typically involves a mile drive to denver or mile drive to omaha but any suggestion that prosperity could start ogallalans behaving like omahans causes alarm "i call omaha sin city " says doug havermann financial adviser at the edward jones investment office in downtown ogallala "individuals there are concerned about having a half million dollar house two &# vehicles in the drive designer clothes a hairdresser and somebody to do your nails " shaking his head he says "individuals there go out to eat twice a day seven days a week " amid the subprime mortgage fiasco that is shaking world financial markets a recent study of foreclosures in nebraska found a strong correlation between urban markets and troubled mortgages "its not as big an issue in rural areas " says kelly edmiston a senior economist at the federal reserve bank of kansas city who conducted the study that doesnt surprise paul foy an ogallala veterinarian whose clients ranchers mostly rarely use credit "people out here dont buy &# houses with no money down " says dr foy a former mayor of ogallala an agricultural force since the s when cowboys across the west drove their herds to the ogallala rail yards this town has rarely seen a more prosperous year than the regions three main commodities beef corn and wheat are fetching high prices simultaneously which may be unprecedented to add to the blessing an extraordinary level of rainfall has produced magnificent yields then there are the dividend payments that will start arriving soon from ethanol plants owned largely by local farmers "ethanol is going to help a lot " says ogallala farmer ralph holzfaster a lead investor in an ethanol plant in nearby madrid its the perfect recipe for prosperity yet few signs of it are sprouting no mansions are under construction building permits actually have fallen this year theres no retail renaissance in fact wal mart stores recently included ogallala on a list of planned openings that it is postponing county sales tax receipts have risen this year but town officials primarily attribute that increase to restaurant and hotel patronage by workers brought to ogallala to construct a natural gas pipeline one category undeniably booming along with ethanol is business equipment including pickup trucks the purchase of which can reduce a farmers taxable income summers zoellner ford here in ogallala is predicting it will sell more than twice as many trucks this year as in despite their modest lives residents here dont deprive themselves entirely most kids have cellphones and ipods according to a gang of fifth grade girls on bicycles who were interviewed downtown last week among grown ups one luxury category whose sales suddenly are skyrocketing is boats theres a big lake north of town "around here a fishing boat isnt a luxury its a necessity " jokes farmer jon holzfaster who is ralph holzfasters son agricultural economist michael swanson of wells fargo &amp co says farmers arent likely to buy a rolex watch but might overextend themselves with land and equipment "a lot of farmers have gone bankrupt because they wanted to impress the neighbors with two big combines when one would do " mr swanson says but at the ogallala headquarters of adams bank &amp trust chief executive todd adams says his customers are using their fatter commodities proceeds primarily to pay down loans a strategy he encourages even though it reduces his banks earnings unlike many big city lenders he says "i see my customers at church at school at the store i have to look out for their interests " as a principal shareholder of one of the regions largest agricultural lenders mr adams says he understands the plight of farmers who are land rich but cash poor the nature of his institutions ownership structure means that he too doesnt have a lot of spendable wealth "private bank stock isnt liquid " notes mr adams so he drives a year old chevrolet suburban and lives in the same modest home he bought in a hunter he frowns at the trend toward purchasing high end hunting suits from rural retailers such as cabelas "who knew that a deer wouldnt step out of the brush unless you were wearing designer apparel " he says talk of ethanol fueled agricultural prosperity bothers farmers such as ron kalkowski such talk could intensify growing public rancor about government subsidies to farmers he worries more to the point he says it isnt accurate as commodity prices have jumped so have costs ranging from fuel to fertilizer unable to retire at age mr kalkowski says rising commodity prices are abetting survival not prosperity still a banner wheat crop this summer helped him purchase two new vehicles a truck and car about the car he is sensitive its a cadillac explaining that it replaced a five year old model with high mileage he says he always drove buicks until that brand shrunk in size hurting his knees another sensitive subject for mr kalkowski is the size of his farm which at acres is large but he prefers to characterize it as "medium sized " mr kalkowskis condition for granting an interview to a journalist "i dont want to be blowed up or made to sound anything other than common and ordinary " in rural areas sensitivity about conspicuous wealth arises in large part from the inability of the rich to seclude themselves in exclusive clubs private schools or gated communities out here where the average house is valued at about &# and the average household income less than &# the haves attend the same schools and reside on the same blocks as the have nots out here fences exist only for livestock "our communities are gated with barbed wire " says mr adams the banker adding that he hopes his fellow ogallalans judge him for his character rather than his net worth in a town too small for any extravagance to go unnoticed grand gestures could be bad for business mr cox the chevrolet dealer says that if he and his wife were to build a new house "people here would think i must be making too large a profit " likewise mr havermann the investment adviser adds that while he could afford a new car annually he buys one only every five to six years "if you strut your feathers in a small town like this it will backfire " he says
