democrats and cannibals texas democrat henry cuellar is today fond of quoting a famous lyndon johnson line "you know the difference between cannibals and liberals cannibals only eat their enemies " mr cuellar would know having found himself the main course on liberals election menu just last year a centrist democrat who is pro business free trade and strong on law enforcement the congressman was designated an apostate by the left wing netroots crowd they decamped to his district and bankrolled a liberal primary challenger mr cuellar triumphed though daily kos founder markos moulitsas would later swagger on his blog "so we didnt kill off cuellar but we gave him a whooping where none was expected and made him sweat " which is the point if the liberal blogging phenomenon deserves to be known for anything it is the strategy to intimidate or silence anyone who disagrees with its own out of the mainstream views that muzzling has been on full display in recent weeks as mr moulitsas and fellow online speech police have launched a campaign against the centrist democratic leadership council dlc chairman harold ford jr was even thwacked last week for daring to speak to this editorial page my sincere apologies mr ford the clear goal to discourage him from making such a free speech mistake again yet a lively midweek chat with mr cuellar suggests that this campaign of threats isnt necessarily having the intended effect if anything it might be backfiring "they win when they intimidate people " says mr cuellar "ive taken everything theyve thrown plus their kitchen sink and i still stand proud as a moderate conservative democrat " he says his triumph over blogger fire has only strengthened his conviction that his party will only win elections if it continues to be a "big tent" open to all views "to make that tent smaller to force people not to persuade but to force because these are threats to quiet down thats destructive in the long term and the short term " mr cuellars victory may be the truest proof of those words while many of the democrats toughest races were fought in conservative leaning districts mr cuellar hails from the th a democratic area near san antonio home to many border towns and a significant hispanic population liberal bloggers may have thought theyd have an easy time turning the texan into an example of what happens to "traitors" to their cause they mounted a spendy campaign behind the more liberal ciro rodriguez whod only lost by votes to mr cuellar in instead democrats independents and even republicans rallied around the incumbent who had impressed them with his support for the central america free trade agreement his push to reform the public school system and his pro business stance this time mr cuellar beat mr rodriguez in the primary to and then went on to get of the general election vote "they poured out negative ads and hundreds of thousands of dollars but in the end i knew my district a lot better than they did " despite all the blogger bravado that they now run the show mr cuellars experience has been more the norm than the exception the press may adore them but the netroots simply havent notched many concrete victories "every time i see sen joe lieberman in the hall we like to say were still here arent we " says mr cuellar a spunky tone in his voice californias jane harman reviled as a "warmonger " last year whipped antiwar activist marcy winograd in a primary ellen tauscher who heads the new democrat coalition in congress was savaged by left wing blogs for her votes authorizing iraq and free trade and in particular for her warning to her party not to "go off the left cliff " she walked away from her re election with of the vote mr cuellar goes so far as to argue that instead of cowing democratic moderates the left wing attacks have united them more middle of the roaders now believe that if the bloggers were to win a high profile primary it would only energize them to go after others "this has brought us together to say this is us and weve got to stick together " he says but perhaps the netroots biggest failure suggests mr cuellar is that it hasnt bludgeoned his partys leadership into abandoning the middle it was moderate democrats who won their party the majority last year the new democrats now boast members new additions and mr cuellar claims few people understand that better than speaker nancy pelosi "ive seen her behind the scenes and ive always thought she was liberal but shes done a good job of trying to bring us more to the middle " for proof mr cuellar suggests a look at "all the passes" the leadership has given red state dems on tough votes like iraq missile defense and immigration this is an obvious recognition by the top ranks of the party that getting moderates re elected is the only way to stay in power they know that "if we go the way these internet groups want us to go well be the shortest lived majority in congressional history " he says dont take this to mean that the liberal juggernaut hasnt shifted the debate some moderate democrats while reticent to admit it are tacking left in hopes of dodging further assaults ms tauscher long known for her national security credentials has toned down her hawkish impulses voting against the recent surge and taking a harder line on missile defense even mr fords dlc these days seems a little more comfortable talking about "trade enforcement" than it does "free trade " mr cuellar admits that while some centrists are willing to say "who the blank blank do these internet groups think they are " others dont want "to be the center of the attraction " in a match up on "meet the press" this past weekend the daily koss mr moulitsas extolled those who use his site to trash thoughtful folks such as mr cuellar as a shining example of "democracy " in the same breath he then commanded the dlcs mr ford to "control" his moderate members and force them to stop disagreeing with liberal democrats if you get that logic you might just be a daily kos reader mr cuellar for his part doesnt show much of an inclination to be controlled by anything other than his own principles and hes trumped the hungry liberals so far write to kim wsj com
