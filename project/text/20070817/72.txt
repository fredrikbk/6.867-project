shoot to kill estimates vary but up to people were killed by east german border guards for trying to flee to the west during the cold war yet saturdays revelation of an official order that stasi secret police agents "stop or liquidate" anyone trying to escape the socialist paradise has stunned germany the story preoccupies the media and politicians alike granted the order is unique in its explicit inhumanity "do not hesitate to use your firearm not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children which the traitors have often used to their advantage " the document reads like other totalitarian regimes east germanys apparatchiks usually referred to state sanctioned murder in more ambiguous terms the document published days before the th anniversary of the construction of the berlin wall on august may help silence former east german officials and their apologists who deny that an order to shoot ever existed technically they are right a public law authorizing it never passed but a plethora of documents the testimonies of former soldiers and not least the killings along the former german german border all prove that such a policy was in effect so why did the current document which actually appeared years ago in an obscure publication without gaining much attention so shock the country this week in part it reflects a romanticized view of the past it is still popular in germany and some other western countries to see communism as basically a good idea just an imperfectly executed one in a survey two years ago a clear majority of germans polled agreed with this view this benign interpretation of communism has paved the way for ostalgie a german term referring to nostalgia for life in the former east germany its manifested in a revival of symbols products and brands of the now defunct "worker and farmer state " it has also helped the successor of the east german communist party make a comeback in german politics rebranded as the left party it sits in the national parliament and shares governing power with social democrats in the city of berlin its leaders are regular and respected guests on tv talk shows the shoot to kill document is however far better evidence of the true nature of communism
