weekend journal review books why the west was won seizing destiny by richard kluger knopf pages &# if america as some assert is the new rome then our caesar surely was james k polk the th president who in his single term pushed the countrys western border from the middle of the continent all the way to the pacific ocean yet posterity relegates polk to the back bench of the presidential pantheon with obscure mediocrities like franklin pierce and millard fillmore why is polk denied a caesar size portion of fame because the rubicon he crossed was the rio grande when he sent his armies to invade mexico in americans naturally prefer to credit the the winning of the west to the bold pioneers who settled the land rather than to the president who acquired the title by right of conquest this impulse to look on the bright side of history irritates revisionists like richard kluger in "seizing destiny " mr kluger focuses on the less ennobling aspects of americas transcontinental surge which reached its apogee under polk "for the united states " he writes "the decisive savaging of mexico was the most brazen chapter in an ongoing saga celebrating what some of the nations most forthright statesmen had dignified as its providential mission " mr kluger is a former journalist who has written such nonfiction books as "the paper " a history of the new york herald tribune and "ashes to ashes " a pulitzer prize winning history of the tobacco industry in "seizing destiny " he takes aim at the mindset epitomized by the journalist john osullivan a polk supporter who famously urged "the fulfillment of our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allowed by providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions " for mr kluger lust for land was the engine that drove american history the war of independence motivated in part by frustration over britains refusal to let colonists cross the appalachians to settle the mississippi valley the louisiana purchase napoleon knew he had to sell or the americans would seize new orleans by force the war of a failed american plot to conquer canada the acquisition of florida from spain a land grab by gen andrew jackson abetted by the extortionist diplomacy of john quincy adams the annexation of texas a southern bid to expand slaverys reach the mexican war an imperialist thrust by polk who had just bluffed the british out of oregon and now sought to secure california give mr kluger this much the push west did owe less to lofty principles than to the self interest of the settlers for whom land was the basis of wealth they sought better lives for themselves and in the process they built a mighty nation as mr kluger concedes what annoys him are the self justifying myths that the settlers spun to clothe their history in virtue "they were simply all too human in confusing opportunity with entitlement and mistaking the abundance of liberty doled to them by history and geography for a license to have their way " mr kluger writes "those americans given to blind chauvinism would do well to consider the darker side of the tale as well " mr kluger concludes his narrative in the early s shortly after the frontier era ended when americans "chose to sublimate their compulsively acquisitive drive by redirecting it from the massive accumulation of land to other forms of expansionism " you can see where he is going with this americas rapid growth created an overconfident and self righteous nation which eventually would overreach and come to grief in such places as "korea vietnam lebanon somalia and iraq " here mr kluger himself overreaches americans are hardly unique in their tendency to conflate self interest and selflessness besides the nations transcontinental expansion was mostly accomplished by when polk left office mr klugers labored attempt to connect the dots from that distant "manifest destiny" era to our own time is not persuasive he further undercuts his case with occasional sloppiness as when he identifies the "waspish and eloquent" statesman john randolph as a federalist from south carolina randolph was a virginian and the opposite of a federalist elsewhere mr kluger asserts that apart from cuba slavery had been outlawed "in the rest of latin america" by at that point slavery remained legal in brazil ecuador peru and venezuela among other places still "seizing destiny" raises some questions that are worth pondering even by readers who will reject mr klugers conclusions how should we view the complicated legacy of nation builders like polk and jackson whose rude methods we would not countenance today even in their own time they were condemned by abraham lincoln who bitterly opposed the mexican war mr kluger rebuts john osullivan with horace greeley who in bewailed the tendency of nations like america "to covet and seize what is their neighbors " yet greeley today is better remembered for his association with another line "go west young man " the west to which he referred of course was in large part the same west that polk had wrested from mexico osullivan was right it was indeed americas manifest destiny to overspread the continent james k polk was an instrument of that destiny we would not undo his accomplishments nor would we celebrate his mugging of our southern neighbor so we tactfully ignore him and focus historys spotlight on more appealing figures such as lincoln yet it was polk and his expansionist predecessors who built the nation that lincoln saved and that we still proudly inhabit from sea to shining sea mr lewis is writing a book about americas colonial experience in the philippines
