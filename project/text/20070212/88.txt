the evening wrap defending libby online edition its the ultimate washington telephone game just who first whispered the name valerie plame in a reporters ear the defense for former vice presidential aide i lewis "scooter" libby began to lay out its answer today on the same day the iraq war which is the cases backdrop marked a grim anniversary the defense for mr libby who has been charged by special prosecutor patrick fitzgerald with perjury and obstruction of justice opened by summoning to the stand several high profile washington reporters in an attempt to show that any number of administration officials were leaking but that mr libby was himself watertight the first scribe to testify was veteran washington post national security reporter walter pincus he said that former white house press secretary ari fleischer leaked the identity of ms plame a cia employee and wife of administration critic and former ambassador joseph wilson to him during a july phone call he said he was talking to mr fleischer for an article about weapons of mass destruction when mr fleischer "suddenly swerved off" topic and asked "dont you know mr wilsons wife works for the cia as an analyst " mr fleischer had testified that mr libby told him about ms plame and that he then leaked the information to two reporters during a trip to africa next to the stand was mr pincuss washington post colleague bob woodward mr woodward who along with reporting partner carl bernstein famously kept the identity of watergate source "deep throat" a secret for decades testified he first heard ms plames name and identity from senior state department official richard armitage in june and produced a tape recording of mr armitage discussing ms plame and her duties at the spy agency mr armitage also was a source for syndicated columnist robert novak who authored a july column that mentioned ms plame by name mr novak testified today that he never discussed ms plame with mr libby the defense has argued mr libby was pushed in front of the prosecutorial bus to protect presidential adviser karl rove who was a source for mr novak "i would call him a very good source " mr novak said today of mr rove "i talked to him two or three times a week at that point " but if the trial has played out like "meet the press" mr fitzgerald quipped to the new york times reporter david sanger that he was "the third pulitzer prize winner to testify this morning" its been rather short of revelations on the politics of the iraq war which has raged bloodily onward as the courtroom drama grinds on in iraq today car
