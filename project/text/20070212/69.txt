politics &amp economics indonesia is pressed to get windfall to its most needy jakarta indonesia indonesias financial situation is the brightest it has been since the asian financial crisis battered the country with at least &# billion in budget funds now available to help combat poverty the world bank said in a report expected to be published today the report cautioned that indonesia risks missing its best chance in a generation to use the windfall to improve the lives of its tens of millions of poor citizens as a combination of corruption bureaucratic inefficiency and the lack of provincial administrative capacity means much of this money isnt getting to those who need it most the world bank said indonesias financial situation today is similar to that in the late s when an unexpected revenue bonanza from oil prices gave the government of then president suharto a war chest to upgrade basic health and education services since the asian financial crisis however public investment as a proportion of gross domestic product has declined to one of the lowest levels among middle income developing countries as jakarta has battled to reduce its large foreign debt the result indonesia a country of million people and southeast asias largest economy has fallen further behind neighbors on a number of social indicators such as infant mortality and secondary education enrollment levels now several years of conservative fiscal management urged on the country by the international monetary fund after the crisis have paid off in reduced debt levels and smaller outlays on fuel subsidies giving indonesia a chance to boost spending the world bank said in the report its annual survey of government expenditures government spending is crucial for powering indonesias economy and creating jobs at a time when private investment remains in the doldrums president susilo bambang yudhoyono indonesias first directly elected leader came to power in on a platform of improving the investment climate but he has failed to push through major investment legal and labor changes sought by the foreign and domestic business communities government efforts to crank up state spending have made little progress public investment returned to its precrisis level of of gdp in but that is still well below other asian nations the world bank said one major obstacle to quickening the pace of disbursement the bank said is corruption which is perceived to pervade all levels of indonesias government "while this report argues that indonesia should increase its public investment the degree of corruption will determine if these investments will produce lasting results for the people of indonesia " the report said disbursement is also being held up because of an ambitious effort begun in to hand more control of revenue to provincial authorities spread across indonesias more than islands about of revenue is now controlled by local authorities which after years of mr suhartos centralized rule often lack the know how to disburse money effectively mr yudhoyonos decision to slash expensive fuel subsidies which was applauded by the world bank and imf but was unpopular with many indonesians helped free up &# billion in funds last year the bank report said an additional &# billion became available due to a reduction in public debt service outlays and higher revenue from taxes and other sources "similar amounts will be available in and beyond " the bank said the government has had some success in targeting this money in education for instance spending was of gdp last year although indonesias education system remains weak this level of expenditure is in line with many developing counties other areas need more attention the world bank said indonesias sprawling bureaucracy a legacy of the suharto era consumes a huge portion of the budget government administration and remaining subsidies on utilities such as electricity and fuel accounted for of total spending last year at the same time spending on health care was less than of gdp the report said infrastructure spending was equivalent to of gdp lower than the level before the asian crisis and much lower than many asian countries without a big improvement in ports roads and other weak infrastructure a significant jump in foreign investment is unlikely economists contend meanwhile only about of indonesians have access to piped water and one third or about million people have no electricity the world bank said
