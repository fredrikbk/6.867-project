now she tells us after hiding her intentions during last years campaign connecticut governor m jodi rell wants to thank constituents for electing her with of the vote by socking them with a hike in the personal income tax rate fellow republicans in the state legislature are understandably scratching their heads but the proposal has no doubt also left many taxpayers wondering why they even bother to pull the lever for republicans ms rell dropped this bombshell last week when she presented her biennial budget in addition to the income tax increase which would push the top marginal rate to from the current over two years the governor also proposes increasing cigarette taxes hiking bus fares and phasing out a &# property tax credit democrats who control both houses of the legislature welcome the plan so does much of the states liberal media who are hailing ms rell as "brave" and "courageous " but as susan kniep of the federation of connecticut taxpayer organizations put it to the associated press "gee why didnt we kind of hear about this before we went into the polls " governor rell says a tax increase is necessary to fund more education spending but connecticut already spends more money per student on public schools than all but three states according to the latest census data which is from the school year connecticuts per pupil spending is &# or more than above the national average of &# in such urban districts as new haven and hartford the state is spending well over &# per student and the states teachers are among the highest paid in the nation all of which suggests that connecticuts problem isnt too little education spending so much as how current expenditures are being used for instance public charter schools in the state such as new havens amistad academy and bridgeports bridge academy spend thousands of dollars less per pupil than surrounding traditional public schools yet student test scores in math and reading far surpass those of neighboring schools and often match the scores of students in wealthier towns such as greenwich perhaps money isnt what really matters in education achievement the larger danger of a tax increase is its impact on the states overall economy connecticut adopted its income tax in and it has since ranked last nationally in employment growth while losing tens of thousands of people to other states increasing the income tax rate seems an odd way to reverse these trends "when looking at states that have growing economies and are thriving " said republican state senator david cappiello in an interview "theyre the states that either have no income tax or are looking to phase down their income tax connecticut is moving in the opposite direction " an income tax hike could also affect whether a small business such as a limited liability or subchapter s corporation decides to expand or move to a more business friendly environment by the way its not as if connecticut taxpayers havent been doing their part the state will end the current fiscal year with a &# million revenue surplus the problem is that the politicians want to spend the money faster than it comes in governor rells budget would grow government by nearly over two years and bust constitutional spending caps approved by of voters back in no wonder she kept her plans secret until after the election
