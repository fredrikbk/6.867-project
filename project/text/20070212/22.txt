energy a special report continental quest the refining industry in western europe appears ripe for a restructuring oil magnate thomas d omalleys vision for redrawing the landscape of european refining evokes a sense of deja vu he speaks of lucrative refining assets for sale growing demand for fuel and plentiful capital to back an independent refiner its all reminiscent of the u s in the late s when mr omalley was at the center of a market in which refineries were relatively inexpensive and changing hands often frequently into his now hes making similar moves in western europe since becoming chief executive of petroplus holdings ag nine months ago he has more than doubled the swiss based companys refining capacity with one acquisition completed and two more under way "i make it a practice to talk to people on a fairly constant basis and to always be available with my catchers mitt on " says the year old mr omalley who was tapped to lead petroplus by the companys former private equity owners riverstone holdings llc new york and the global private equity fund the carlyle group riverstone and carlyle acquired petroplus then a dutch outfit in and took it public last year with a share offering in switzerland "i think the reality is its been an overlooked sector " mr omalley says of western europe "its quite clear that the furniture is being rearranged " on the move mr omalley knows about rearranging he entered the u s refining sector after the stock market crash of then led two different companies on campaigns to acquire refineries that major oil companies were tossing away or being forced to shed as integrated companies began to consolidate he eventually built a network of eight refineries at tosco corp nearly of the u s refining capacity at the time and later four at premcor inc subsequently few were as well positioned as mr omalley when refining margins began to strengthen in he was a major shareholder at tosco which was acquired by phillips petroleum corp in and also at premcor which sold for &# billion to valero energy corp of san antonio texas today he is one of the largest individual shareholders in valero and owns significant stakes in conocophillips chevron corp and exxonmobil corp as well there were plenty of doubters when mr omalley embarked on his original acquisition campaigns "everything was against it the values were down the margins were horrible " says bryan caviness a senior analyst in chicago for the international fitch ratings agency while the large integrated oil companies ran refineries as an outlet for crude they did not see their potential as moneymakers he says "i think it turned out to be a pretty staggering success after all " mr caviness reflects with his new focus on europe mr omalley doesnt mean to imply he thinks there are no more deals to be made in the u s he just thinks there is more opportunity elsewhere as an independent he was drawn to the continent he says in part because the majors have largely dominated the scene in asia "i think you also have to play to your individual strengths " he says premcor and tosco dealt extensively in europe while mr omalley was at the helm tosco for example bought a refinery in ireland and mr omalley himself got his start in the oil business four decades ago at the philipp brothers commodities trading house in switzerland where he spoke primarily in german but also picked up some yiddish which still occasionally peppers his speech he got his first job at philipp brothers in the mailroom because he was "mishpokhe " he says family as in connected now theres a core group of executives that stays connected with him following him from one refining company to the next seeing reflections mr omalley is quick to map out the similarities between europe and the u s there is similar crude processing capacity and neither is likely to see a new refinery built soon supplies are tight of gasoline in the u s and diesel in western europe and he sees the shortage growing in europe as fuel it once imported from the former soviet union is now largely consumed there both markets also will likely feel the impact of growing demand from china and india like the u s back in the s mr omalley and some analysts argue there also may be more room now in europe for a strong consolidator to emerge in the u s these days significant new refining capacity is seen coming online which could outstrip demand for refined products says mark routt a refining analyst with energy security analysis inc in wakefield mass european refiners on the other hand are going to see new capacity come online more gradually potentially stimulating margins there mr routt says moreover while companies like royal dutch shell plc exxonmobil and bp plc maintained a relatively strong presence in european refining throughout the s there are signs that the big oil companies in europe now want to reduce their exposure according to mr omalley and the analysts indeed in recent months exxonmobil and bp have each agreed to sell refineries to petroplus in germany and in england respectively conocophillips shell and chevron corp meanwhile similarly have announced plans to put west european refining assets on the block major oil companies have looked for opportunities to scale back their refining and marketing presence owing to historically low margins says damian kennaby of purvin &amp gertz "on the whole investment has gone into upstream drilling and production because they know what sort of return theyre going to get on their capital " he says unlike the exploration and production realms where companies can set the price of oil refining is a price taker dependent upon the price set by the market mr kennaby says and because capital returns from refining can be limited the appeal to major companies has diminished he says but for a niche player like petroplus the same assets may appeal despite the large capital investment required mr kennaby says niche refinery buyers are able to see opportunities in these plants either for export or for niche supply in a local market he says pipelines to planes petroplus is already one of the largest independent refiners and wholesalers of petroleum products in europe it currently owns and operates refineries in switzerland britain and belgium the plant it has agreed to purchase from bp the coryton refinery in the thames estuary would become the largest in the petroplus system with capacity of barrels a day and the ability to process an additional barrels a day of other feedstocks according to petroplus coryton is the major supplier of fuel in southeast england the refinery includes pipelines that supply heathrow and gatwick airports directly with jet fuel petroplus has agreed to pay bp about &# billion in the deal the bp and exxonmobil deals are both expected to close in the first half of mr omalley would not speculate on what additional refineries would attract bids from petroplus "petroplus would be interested in considering any reasonable refining asset in western europe " he says the company would consider adding refinery assets that would process any kind of crude but would shy away from very small refinery companies those whose total refining capacity was less than one million barrels a day he says petroplus will also likely stay out of former eastern bloc countries where so called national champion oil companies still exist he says there is obviously competition in other places as well private equity firms and other interests are investigating opportunities in european refining but petroplus may have an advantage in having a business plan that is seen as unique some analysts say "tom omalley with petroplus is really the only company out there with the basic business plan to be a consolidator in europe right now " says mike wilcox an analyst with london based wood mackenzie for instance while refiners that came after tosco like valero focused on growth through corporate acquisitions that brought in whole systems of refineries mr omalleys ventures have often targeted individual plants building systems from piecemeal acquisitions this might be more appropriate to the european market where international infrastructure is not so strong as the infrastructure in most of the u s analysts say even with this optimistic outlook mr wilcox says independent refiners may never become as dominant in europe as they are in the u s market offering a broad estimate refining analyst john parry of john s herold an energy research firm in greenwich conn speculates that independents might be able to obtain a european market share of a to but for mr omalley or another strong consolidator this might provide more than enough opportunity staying in touch after four decades in the oil business mr omalley now spends of his time living in switzerland and still keeps in touch with college classmates and one of his first bosses former salomon inc president john gutfreund after salomon merged with philipp brothers mr omalley served as a vice chairman of the parent company and chief executive of phibro energy also a unit of salomon mr omalley stood out in u s refining circles not only for his successful deals but also for his eccentricities delivering a keynote speech in vail colo he skied down the mountain from his villa stepped up to the podium and gave a ski condition report before addressing his audience on more serious issues he occasionally has taken controversial stands once advocating the removal of sulfur compounds from jet fuel in opposition to the industrys general position but while mr omalley has proved unpredictable at times he says he doesnt intend to retire with oil prices as strong as they are right now he says hes not leaving the industry ms resnick ault is a staff reporter for dow jones newswires in houston she can be reached at jessica resnick ault dowjones com
