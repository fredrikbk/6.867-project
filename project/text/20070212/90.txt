the morning brief new evidence against iran online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here while it was remarks from vladimir putin over the weekend that revived talk of the cold war it is the u s iranian relationship that more resembles the hostile jousting for global or in this case maybe regional sway that always stopped short of outright combat the unveiling of military intelligence yesterday in baghdad accusing tehran of providing deadly explosives to allies in iraq is viewed by some as another precursor to a u s war against iran and it certainly was inflammatory the presentation by anonymous officials included pictures and accounts of so called explosively formed penetrators what the new york times describes as "squat canisters designed to explode and spit out molten balls of copper that cut through armor " and which the officials blamed for the deaths of more than americans since the officials showed off serial numbers and other evidence linking the arms to iran and asserted though without direct evidence that the smuggling of such materiel into iraq was authorized by irans leaders the washington post pointing out that this was the first time during the bush administration that officials sought to make a public intelligence case against iran says the briefing was "also notable for what was not said or shown " and the military briefers it adds werent joined by cia or other intelligence officials or by american diplomats on top of irans standoff with the u s and allied europeans over its nuclear program the role tehran plays in iraq has become an increasingly heated point of contention in washington and the times reports the officials were defensive about the timing of disclosing evidence that has been available since they said efp attacks in nearly doubled from the previous months while military and civilian officials tell the post the army is working to fill a shortfall of advanced humvee armor kits aimed at countering whats considered a rising threat still the briefers also backed away from previous u s claims that shiite iran was supporting sunnis who make up most of anti u s insurgents in iraqs multifarious fields of battle the los angeles times reports instead they accused militias loyal to politically influential shiite cleric moqtada al sadr of being involved in smuggling iranian arms the paper adds that few independent analysts consider iran or other countries decisive players in iraqs sectarian and insurgent warfare the iranian government today rejected the u s accusations yesterday one of its top national security officials ali larijani asserted at a conference in munich that the only secure parts of iraq were along the iranian border where u s troops arent stationed the guardian reports he also broke with aggressive comments against israel voiced by president mahmoud ahmadinejad saying iran "posed no threat to israel " the post adds the escalating remarks over arms in iraq happened to come the same day mr ahmadinejad vowed iran would continue to ignore the united nations by never halting its nuclear program but he failed to produce promised "good news" about that programs progress raising speculation that "domestic political pressure and technological glitches" have gotten in the way as the n y times reports may be part of a long cold conflict the more aggressive rhetoric and even military action against iranian officials in iraq have given tehran reason to "feel paranoid " as newsweek notes especially amid remarks from some bush administration officials that resemble pre comments on iraq hillary mann a former bush administration national security council director for iranian affairs tells the magazine that some presidential advisers "intend to be as provocative as possible and make the iranians do something america would be forced to retaliate for " there is an unmistakable message in the deployment of a second u s navy carrier group to the persian gulf and newsweek says a third will likely follow even as iranian missile tests in those same waters raise the ante iran and the u s have passionately been at odds since the islamic revolution and hostage taking of americans nearly three decades ago but newsweek says "the chances of a small incidents spiraling into a crisis are higher than theyve been in years " and yet they were able to find common cause early in the afghanistan conflict and at other times too the magazine adds but that was a different time when a stronger superpower had an all but universally recognized right to fight back after a terrorist attack of historic proportion before the "axis of evil" speech and before the war in iraq weakened the u s hand militarily and diplomatically now neither government is in a dominant position of global influence one that could make war seem an easier prospect making it harder to distinguish true aggressive intent in the mutually hostile statements of tehran and washington from rhetoric aimed at boosting support among domestic constituencies and as newsweek says "every time america or iran has gained an advantage over the other in the last five years theyve overplayed their hand " google and a tangled online piracy web time warner news corp viacom sony
