inc opened a garage size office in this dusty town of about coming up soon here a policy that insures a cow for a &# annual premium seeking potential sources of future growth aig and its international rivals are racing to sell insurance in the developing world from sprawling markets like india to smaller ones like romania and nicaragua in remote areas insurers must teach the concept of insurance to populations who have never bought any sometimes as in parts of northern uganda the local language doesnt even have a word for it to penetrate these markets insurers are devising unusual policies charging as little as cents to insure everything from television sets to burial costs theyre forgoing traditional documentation requirements sometimes selling life insurance to people who dont know when they were born instead of relying entirely on agents aig and many others are partnering in some markets with nonprofit microloan programs operations that lend small amounts of money to the poor many microlenders provide a form of life insurance that will pay off the loan and sometimes also compensate survivors if the debtor dies aig currently has roughly million life insurance policies on microloan recipients mostly in uganda mexico india and brazil microlenders say that providing insurance can benefit borrowers by teaching them greater financial sophistication its a "natural extension of our role " says scott graham senior manager of strategic alliances for washington d c based finca international a nonprofit that operates microlending programs in countries microlending won bangladeshi banker muhammad yunus the nobel peace prize last year and just as major banks are being drawn to that business big insurers are increasingly lured by what they call "microinsurance " its a way for insurers to wedge themselves into new markets markets they see as crucial to the future of the industry that in collected &# trillion in premiums that year insurance premiums world wide edged up just from the year before according to swiss reinsurance co the worlds largest reinsurer thats because half the total market is driven by the u s and japan where insurance is ubiquitous and growth opportunities can be limited but in that same year insurance premiums in emerging markets grew by nearly after inflation more than three times the growth rates of developed markets according to swiss re increasing car and home ownership in those countries is boosting demand as is rapid economic growth "the premiums are not very high but selling these policies allows you to build up relationships with these customers as their markets develop and thats going to be important " says james schiro chief executive officer of zurich financial services ag which sells microinsurance in four latin american countries today and is launching a pilot program in south africa sometime this year ugandan fred adriko years old didnt know his mother had insurance until she was killed in a car accident in she had taken out a microloan from finca to develop a business selling produce and purchased a policy at the same time because of the policy mr adriko received a payment of about &# which he can use to take care of his family he said in an interview through a finca provided translator aig knows the benefits of getting in early former aig chief executive maurice r "hank" greenberg hewing to the style and approach of his mentor cornelius vander starr started building relationships with government and business leaders in china more than a quarter century ago before the government allowed foreign insurers to sell policies there today aig is the only foreign insurer allowed to have a wholly owned unit sell life insurance in china a right it won in other foreign insurers are piling into the china market but they typically need to work with a locally based partner emerging markets can present logistical and cultural hurdles as well as daunting local bureaucracies whats more since the premiums collected are small by western standards the revenues generated by the microinsurance sector also are tiny while developing markets are profitable for a few companies insurance executives say they remain unprofitable for many others aig which does business in about countries says its microinsurance business is in the black but total premiums from life insurance sold to microloan recipients in developing markets add up to only about &# million a year thats just of the &# billion in life insurance premiums aig took in world wide in some insurers are sitting out the global rush northwestern mutual a milwaukee based firm thats among the nations largest life insurers doesnt sell insurance abroad the company relies on agents who aim to establish long term relationships with customers explains ceo ed zore and "i dont think we could" build such a sales force in another country mr zore says the company may expand to other countries in the future the insurance race is particularly heated in india which opened its market to foreign insurers in not only does the country boast a young population and a british influenced legal system it is relatively virgin territory the countrys billion people spend &# billion on premiums a little more than what million illinois residents paid for property casualty coverage in according to the insurance information institute a new york based trade group a number of the worlds biggest insurers including aig and aviva plc britains largest insurer expanded into india in the past seven years allianz se a german insurance giant says it has full and part time agents in india and is hiring more every month britains prudential plc indias leading foreign life insurer in arrived even before the market opened to establish local ties yet india also presents some obstacles as in china local players are dominant the life insurance corp of india boasts more than one million agents and collected well over of the countrys life insurance premiums in according to the insurance information institute under indias laws all foreign companies must join with locally based companies to sell insurance india also requires that companies generate some of their business from the countryside preventing insurers from focusing solely on the affluent urban customers theyre often most interested in india stipulates that of foreign insurers premiums for property casualty coverage must be generated by rural customers rural customers must represent of all life insurance policies in the insurers first year a number that rises to in its fifth year in rural india in addition to using their own agents both aig and aviva typically sell basic life insurance policies through local womens groups and microlending agencies this lowers distribution costs because the person processing the loan also sells and processes the insurance policy on the loan finca which works with aig in many places but not india says its local offices keep as much as to of the premiums left over after claims and expenses in some areas in others fincas local offices get nothing some companies working in india say married women are often their best representatives because they tend to stay in their community and know it well that knowledge is helpful given how much insurers have relaxed traditional standards accepting thumb prints on policy applications and eliminating death certificate requirements since few rural clients die in hospitals in india aig says it accepts the signatures of a village elder or groundskeeper at cremation facilities without local expertise "we would be too scared to go into this market " says sriram gopal head of the rural non life insurance business for tata aig which is aigs local joint venture with tata group an indian conglomerate to market its brand in rural areas aviva representatives tour villages and stage festivals in a promotional van festooned with a big loudspeaker in nandurdi village a few brick and mud homes amid sugar cane and grape fields five hours drive from mumbai some villagers gathered recently to spin a giant wheel in hopes of winning key chains and pens as they handed out the prizes aviva agents talked to the crowd about the value of life insurance the representatives told the crowd that aviva is the worlds fifth largest insurer and assured them that insurance isnt just for the rich they asked villagers who would take care of their family if they died "who here has insurance " asked aviva representative sushil gaykawad and only about six hands went up "who plans to get insurance now " he followed up all hands went up to reach its core urban audience aviva plasters its logo on the clocks that count down to green lights at traffic stops in delhi it advertises during cricket tv broadcasts and in aviva paid for more than airings of tv advertisements for the bollywood family drama "viruddh " the movie ads ended with the india megastar amitabh bachchan saying the aviva slogan "kal par control " or "control your future " after four years in india aviva covers more than one million lives and operates branches says vivek khanna head of avivas indian operations rival aig has already written policies covering the lives of about cattle while local insurers pioneered cow coverage years earlier those policies became problematic because of fraudulent claims to avoid bovine fraud aig employs retired veterinarians who armed with digital cameras visit farms to verify a cows death the policy typically pays more than &# when the animal dies as part of its marketing efforts aig invites local leaders and the press for a grand ceremony when it pays out insurance claims of any kind the cost of many of these policies is trivial by the standards of the global insurance market but they are very significant for many developing world customers in a rural part of the indian state of rajasthan kalyan prasad a tailor who says he is in his s but doesnt know his exact age purchased a &# term life policy on his wife who had heard aigs pitch at a local self help group one hot night in june mr prasad was woken by his wifes screaming he says she had been bitten by a cobra and died hours later upon her death aig paid mr prasad &# more than he usually makes in a year "id never seen that much money altogether before " says mr prasad who says he used the money to pay off debts and saved the rest like other companies aig is looking for other things that indias population would consider valuable enough to insure it has begun investigating crop insurance but is having trouble finding a way to sell coverage profitably because the parcels of land are so small and weather varies so much from region to region says mr gopal it is looking at selling health insurance but is still weighing the risks which include "danger zones" like settlements near truck stops prostitutes often gather in such areas leading to higher hiv infection rates and people living in industrial areas could report more respiratory problems mr gopal says in rural areas aviva has to price its life coverage without knowing much about the health of the people its insuring "there could be no medical tests " says mr khanna "medical facilities do not exist in many of these areas "
