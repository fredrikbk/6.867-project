nbc turns fresh eyes to its ad sales newcomer to tv seeks revamp of methods in place for decades a few weeks after nbc universals new ad sales chief michael pilot started work he was given a framed picture of " rock" actor alec baldwin who plays a top executive assigned to the network from general electrics fictional oven division mr baldwin had signed the photo "mike mike make me proud " it was a joke mr pilot could appreciate like mr baldwins character he arrived at general electrics nbc with no prior experience in television coming instead from a post running ge commercial finances equipment finance group but mr pilot faces a real life challenge a ratings slump at nbc and lack of growth in spending on broadcast tv advertising generally have hurt nbcs ad revenue in the past couple of years in naming mr pilot to oversee ad sales nbc gets someone with an outsider perspective and a history of using sophisticated analytical methods to generate sales growth mr pilot profiled last september by the harvard business review for what it called his scientific approach to sales productivity confirms that he has in the past focused on using statistical analysis of potential customers to figure out which are the best prospects mr pilot years old says he plans to apply the same kind of analytical thinking at nbc "fresh eyes " he says can help unleash some of the selling resources within the network he wants to revamp nbcs ad sales department introducing more systematic procedures for dealing with customers and making the company more flexible to advertisers requests his proposed changes come as tv networks like other traditional media such as newspapers face intensifying competition for ad dollars from the internet and other digital media broadcast networks which in the past might not have had to make a huge effort to sell ad time expecting advertisers would come to them are being forced to become more aggressive even so some of mr pilots ideas represent radical change for an industry that uses decades old sales methods more than many other businesses tv ad sales are heavily reliant on telephone negotiations paper purchase orders and personal relationships the industry is so old fashioned that orders for commercials are often processed manually by a tv network mr pilot notes that nbcs advertising "traffic" department which tracks when commercials will air gets faxes a day from clients with instructions about their ads he wants to computerize this part of the ad sales process to free up salespeople so they can concentrate on spending more time with clients media buyers who purchase ad time and negotiate prices for commercials on behalf of advertisers are likely to applaud such a change they describe the process of buying and logging commercial time as onerous "its antediluvian its the way the dinosaurs did it " says gene dewitt chief executive of dewitt media strategies a new york media buying consultant "the industry could use a ge process person to make this all work more rationally " he adds computerizing the "traffic" function is just part of a broader strategy by mr pilot to overhaul how nbc sells advertising after spending the first few weeks in the job meeting with media buyers and advertisers he believes advertisers want to have a "deeper insight earlier" into development of new programs so marketing techniques like product placement can be arranged more systematically he says with that in mind he wants to make it easier for his salespeople to develop broader relationships with their clients this partly reflects a shift by some advertisers to put less emphasis on traditional tv ads given the growth of digital video recorders that make it easy for viewers to skip commercial breaks mr pilot says one client asked him "tell me what you can do for me if i dont have the ability to buy a second spot " while the traditional commercial remains "the most effective way to reach a mass audience " mr pilot says "different clients will need and demand a different level of service " he also wants to make it easier for advertisers to make deals across nbc universals properties which aside from nbc include cable networks such as bravo usa and sci fi and web outlets such as ivillage and nbc com mr pilot notes that nbc already offers advertisers these types of deals "from time to time " but he says the company needs to do it in a more systematic way in the future early reaction from madison avenue is positive despite mr pilots lack of experience in television "maybe i was skeptical initially that they were bringing someone that wasnt from the sector but after sitting with him and going back and forth im actually quite interested to hear and learn what he thinks " says charlie rutman chief executive of havas sas mpg north america who recently had breakfast with him "maybe having a fresh pair of eyes is something we should all be doing "
