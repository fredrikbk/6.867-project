politics &amp economics cheney backers grow restive vice president retains clout but war in iraq libby trial rile allies washington dick cheneys diminished popularity outside the white house hasnt affected his power within the bush administration where he continues to hold considerable clout from the surge of troops in iraq to the tough line on iran to opposition to tax increases the vice president has helped to shape an array of recent administration policies but as his standing erodes among the administrations most conservative supporters mr cheney finds himself being criticized by former allies and emerging as a focal point for republican anger about the war in iraq that is making it easier for republicans to split with the administration on a number of issues notably iraq "cheneys popularity with the republican base is reflective of the iraq wars popularity with the republican base and that support is waning " said vin weber a republican strategist and lobbyist "thats taking a toll on the vice president who is more closely identified with iraq than on any other issue " it is a shift for mr cheney who remained popular with conservatives as his support among the general public declined in a september wall street journal nbc news poll of those calling themselves conservative republicans said they felt "very positive" about mr cheney compared with of all adults surveyed that rating fell over the next few months as republicans lost control of congress support for the iraq war eroded and the perjury trial of former cheney chief of staff i lewis "scooter" libby put the vice president and his office in the spotlight by mid january the same poll found that of conservative republicans said they felt "very positive" about mr cheney compared with for all respondents mr cheney could be called to take the stand in the libby trial as soon as this week making him the first sitting vice president to testify in a criminal court mr cheneys declining support among conservatives leaves him open to criticism from fellow republicans when mr cheney traveled to capitol hill recently for a lunch meeting with republican senators the lawmakers opened the floor to discuss the administrations "surge" proposal it was mr cheneys birthday and participants said the senators began by singing "happy birthday " the warm feelings evaporated as soon as the conversation turned to iraq however several senators said they remained committed to the war on terror but questioned the administrations overall management of the war participants said sen gordon smith of oregon told mr cheney he couldnt find words strong enough to express how bad he thought the administration had overseen the war in iraq according to participants other lawmakers told the vice president they feared the additional troops would be unable to stabilize the country and expressed skepticism about the capabilities and intentions of iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki according to participants mr cheney listened closely but didnt say anything in response to the criticism participants said to date there are few signs that talk outside the white house has changed mr cheney one reason administration officials say is because mr cheney doesnt aim to become president he can stay loyal to the bush agenda without having to distance himself from the president mr cheneys top foreign policy aide john hannah shaped the administrations "surge" proposal for iraq david wurmser mr cheneys top middle east aide helped to craft the administrations tougher stance toward iran on the domestic front senators from both parties said last week that mr cheneys antitax positions had contributed to derailing talks between congressional democrats and the administration on a budget plan that might include changes to the social security and medicare entitlement programs "hes been a longtime and steady supporter of conservative causes and conservatives have known that he is consistent in his views and that hes making those conservative views known to the president " said cesar conda a lobbyist and former policy aide to mr cheney "but they also know that cheney doesnt win the debates all the time " a number of conservative figures outside the administration offered three reasons for their displeasure with mr cheney they point first to iraq expressing concerns mr cheney was in denial about how bad the situation was in the country and about the wars political cost for republicans second they say mr cheney was finally caught up in conservative anger at mr bush for not limiting government spending or balancing the budget lastly some conservatives say they are uncomfortable with mr cheneys support for his daughter marys decision to have a child and raise it with her partner another woman white house officials defended mr cheney saying the vice presidents statements about iraq were meant to emphasize that political progress had been made in iraq despite the difficulties there "the vice presidents insistence on pointing out what has gone well in iraq three elections and substantial progress in many iraqi provinces should not be taken for granted or ignored " said dan bartlett counselor to the president
