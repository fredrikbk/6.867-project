energy a special report investors the green machine hal harvey spends his environmental war chest with one guiding principle winning in any business money means influence in professional environmentalism hal harvey wields both mr harvey a year old engineer heads the environment program at the william and flora hewlett foundation a deep pocketed philanthropy based in silicon valley his job gives him control over an annual budget of tens of millions of dollars one of the biggest war chests in the green movements campaign for government policies to curb the fossil fuel emissions linked to global warming mr harvey disburses that money to an international network of scientists lawyers pollsters and campaigners the group which he calls "the machine " has been instrumental in most major global warming policies under way around the world today new caps on emissions in california new automotive fuel economy standards in china and new rules pushing for alternative fuels such as ethanol in california and europe in washington where several proposed federal caps on u s global warming emissions are being debated in the wake of last falls democratic takeover of congress mr harveys machine is behind the one increasingly viewed as having the best political chance a middle of the road plan hatched by a hewlett foundation funded think tank that would slap a mandatory ceiling on emissions but over time would lower that ceiling less severely than would some other proposals on capitol hill some environmental groups assail the plan as a sellout to big business many in industry and in the bush administration praise it as economically reasonable the strange bedfellows dont bother mr harvey after recently watching al gores global warming film in which the former vice president lectures about the dangers of fossil fuel emissions mr harvey told the producer he wished the movie had spent more time exploring solutions rather than just laying out the threat "awareness of the problem is the first step to fixing the problem " he says "but its not the same as fixing the problem " mr harvey is an odd bird among green activists the consummate insider who argues his own movement needs to get savvier for years environmentalists have shaped their agenda largely in moral opposition to industry mr harvey contends that strategy is outdated in the face of a problem as pervasive as global warming global warming is tougher than localized environmental threats such as smog theres no known filter to block it carbon dioxide the chief greenhouse gas is produced wherever fossil fuel is burned which means that curbing co emissions will require altering how the world uses energy that mr harvey argues will require environmentalists to focus less on fiery rhetoric and more on hashing out economically efficient policies that have political legs so in doling out the dollars at his disposal mr harvey uses much the same strategy as the other venture capitalists in silicon valley he invests where he thinks hell get maximum return in his parlance he looks for the political "pinch points" likely to promote technologies that will deliver the most "tons of carbon avoided per philanthropic dollar invested " he and his colleagues actually try to compute that using spreadsheets "two things matter coal and cars two countries matter china and the u s " he says talking over dinner in his house in mill valley north of san francisco "in that little matrix theres only a handful of policies that are going to make any damn difference " mr harvey is trying to cobble together alliances with constituencies that long have been leery of organized environmentalism but that pack political punch among them farmers who stand to profit from increased production of ethanol military leaders concerned about the national security dangers of foreign oil dependence and union members who might support hitting detroits auto makers with tougher fuel economy requirements if the rules included subsidies for the companies to retool factories to crank out the more efficient cars and trucks mr harvey grew up on a ranch in aspen colo got bachelors and masters degrees from stanford university and spent much of the s working on nuclear arms control for nonprofit groups in foundations he had gotten to know the john d and catherine t macarthur foundation the rockefeller foundation and the pew charitable trusts decided to work together on energy and hired him to help them plan a push the foundations gave mr harvey and two colleagues a travel budget and six months to come up with a philanthropic strategy to curb fossil fuel use when that search was over the foundations together pledged &# million a year for a decade to create a philanthropic wholesaler of sorts to funnel money to front line environmental groups named the energy foundation it set up shop in san francisco with mr harvey then as president the energy foundation bankrolled groups that successfully pushed for government policies requiring appliance manufacturers and home builders to make their products more energy efficient using less energy is typically cheaper than finding new energy sources the foundation also helped land state policies requiring utilities to generate a certain percentage of their electricity from non fossil fuel sources such as wind today states and washington d c have such rules the energy foundation says it has been involved in of them trying to make cars more fuel efficient has proved tougher the energy foundation spent much of the s working with california regulators to defend a state rule essentially mandating that auto makers sell large numbers of battery powered electric cars california ultimately watered down the rule deciding to push hybrid cars instead which pair a smaller electric system with a traditional gasoline engine mr harvey drove an electric car during much of the s one he basically built himself yet he sold it and bought a toyota prius when that hybrid went on sale electric cars were "just not practical " he says because they couldnt go far enough before having to be plugged in to recharge mr harvey and his family still own a prius as well as a minivan but on those days when he commutes to hewletts headquarters he makes the mile round trip drive in his audi a car with a six cylinder engine but an efficient transmission that he had to order specially he has bought a certificate offsetting the co emissions that he calculates his driving produces mr harvey left the energy foundation in for the hewlett foundation which was expanding its environmental program hewlett spends about &# million annually on the environment about twice the energy foundations budget about half that budget goes to issues related to the american west about half goes to energy and global warming the hewlett and energy foundations work closely together the energy foundation gets about &# million a year from hewlett in california the foundations have been active behind three high profile policies a measure requiring cars sold in the state to emit less co a broader law passed last year that amounts to the first economy wide global warming emission cap in the u s and an executive order announced last month by california gov arnold schwarzenegger that mandates a cut by in the carbon intensity of passenger vehicle fuels in california the energy and hewlett foundations work mostly behind the scenes last year when the california legislature was debating what would become the statewide emission cap hewlett helped fund a poll by the non partisan public policy institute of california that showed broad support for the measure a few weeks later as the bill was nearing a vote the university of california at berkeley released a study concluding the law would help the states economy by promoting investment in clean energy technologies the study was funded by the hewlett and energy foundations the day the study was issued enough legislators signed on as co authors to ensure the bills passage now both the hewlett and energy foundations plan to ramp up spending on studies to help state officials implement the global warming laws they also have been spending about &# yearly on the legal front mostly to fund lawyers at the natural resources defense council and the sierra club two big environmental groups mr harvey and his energy foundation colleagues also worked closely with the schwarzenegger administration to hatch the low carbon fuel proposal announced last month a low carbon fuels proposal similar to californias was announced two weeks ago by the european union a hewlett funded group called the international council on clean transportation worked with european officials to draft it in addition the hewlett and energy foundations are focusing on china whose global warming emissions are expected to surpass those of the u s within a decade whatever the u s and europe do to curb emissions is likely to make little atmospheric difference unless china and other developing countries slow the growth in their co output as well the energy foundation has set up an office in beijing whose staffers worked closely with government officials in writing a automotive fuel economy law now hewlett is planning a push for policies in chinese cities promoting more compact real estate development fast growing china is at a "pattern setting moment" where such policies could produce huge energy savings mr harvey says in washington hewlett is spending about &# million a year to try to craft a viable solution to the polarized u s energy debate in hewlett created the national commission on energy policy whose bipartisan board includes everyone from an environmental lawyer to a union leader to a former auto executive the groups recommendations issued just after the elections marked a controversial compromise yet one that has been taken up in washington as something of policy template among its proposals is a "cap and trade" system for co emissions in which the government would limit nationwide emissions distribute so called permits to companies that allow them to emit up to that ceiling and then let the companies buy and sell the permits among themselves such an emissions market intended to minimize compliance costs is under way in europe but because much of u s industry worries a cap would cost too much the commission called for an assurance that if the price of the u s permits got too high the government would print more bringing the price back down environmental defense a green group that receives funding from the hewlett and energy foundations nevertheless ran a newspaper ad in criticizing two senate global warming proposals including one based largely on the commissions plan as environmental "impostors " environmental defense argues that a policy limiting how expensive co emission allowances can get wont cut emissions enough any policy that "falls short of an unconditional cap on emissions will fail to get the job done " says john decicco a senior fellow at environmental defense mr harvey himself says he wishes the national commission on energy policys proposals were tougher the commission now is considering such changes including allowing the price of emission permits to rise higher before the government printed more of them within industry some companies call the commissions plan too costly others say its the sort of centrist policy they endorse the bush administration for its part says it opposes a mandatory emissions cap because it would slow the economy yet james connaughton who as chairman of the white house council on environmental quality is president bushs top environmental policy adviser calls the commissions proposal "a really solid effort " it represents he says "this convergence going on about what can be reasonably expected based on a rational analysis " mr ball is a staff reporter in the wall street journals dallas bureau he can be
