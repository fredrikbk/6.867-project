energy a special report editors note after we ran an article about solar energy last year a reader responded with an email "i know this sounds naive " she wrote "but i dont get it when you talk about how expensive green energy is why is solar so much more expensive than oil or gas isnt the sun free " i dont know if the question was naive but it was one i wanted to know the answer to as well we all hear about the high cost of alternative energy we hear about how solar wind geothermal and other energy sources need subsidies to be competitive with oil gas or coal and we just dont get it our cover story this issue should clear things up it looks at the economics of different types of alternative energy it explains why most of these costs are higher than energy derived from fossil fuels and it provides a window into how that math is beginning to change in some cases dramatically as always we welcome your thoughts on this and any of the other articles in the report feel free to comment or ask a question no matter how naive you think it is
