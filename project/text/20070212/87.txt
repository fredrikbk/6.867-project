the daily fix mlb officials tour of ghana brings hope painful history online edition major league baseball officials toured ghana early this month a trip intended to help their sport gain a foothold in west africa find new talent and explore the countrys legacy of slavery the unusual tour headlined by new york mets general manager omar minaya hall of famer and san diego padres vice president dave winfield and dusty baker former manager of the san francisco giants and chicago cubs was the brainchild of a new yorker who is neither a politician nor a baseball official but works in guest relations at the marriott marquis in times square "it was a dream come true for george ntim a ghanaian immigrant to the united states who fell in love with baseball and now is working to bring americas national game to his soccer mad homeland " karen palmer writes in the washington times a tour through the news archives shows mr ntim has more powerful friends than mr minaya who helped organize the tour after the bombing of the world trade center he helped evacuate guests from the vista international hotel where he then worked earning public gratitude from rudy giuliani who was mayor of new york at the time mr ntim later helped organize police lodging in the aftermath of sept earning him a position of honorary commissioner from former police commissioner bernard b kerik mr ntim facilitated a meeting between new jersey governor james mcgreevey and ghanaian vice president alhaji aliu mahama and once attended a dinner for a visiting ghanaian dignitary along with president bush hes thrown out the first pitch at a minor league baseball game in oklahoma city and worked with spalding to get equipment to ghana last year more equipment arrived with this years delegation but much work remains to refashion ghana as a baseball hotbed t j quinn of the new york daily news writes that many of the young players who gathered to meet the visiting luminaries were puzzled about their identities brightening only when they heard that mr minaya is the one who writes contracts the visitors meanwhile enjoyed watching a miscue filled game spotting promise and the joy of kids playing without too much coaching "the emotion from ntim the ghanaian ballplayers and their visitors is genuine " mr quinn writes "but their mission is not pie eyed this is baseball as business " when daniel "iron" atiemo or atieno depending on the news account a year old shortstop slugs a home run mr minaya says the youngster will play in the u s some day "atiemo floated around the bases wearing one of the biggest smiles of his life " phil rogers writes in the chicago tribune "he said later he was not often a home run hitter making it even more remarkable that he had seized the moment and made it his own in the most important at bat of his life " the cheerful demonstration games were followed by a grim tour of slave castles way stations for africans enslaved and shipped west centuries ago "eighteen of the members on this baseball pilgrimage to ghana were african american or latin american " mr rogers writes "many had traced their family heritage back generations but all felt an instinctive immediate connection to these fortifications where only the strongest men and women survived to be shipped to ports in the caribbean england and eventually north america " mr quinn posts video of the slave castle tour on his blog with a game left in the nba seasons first half the defending champion miami heat are one game under have been outscored by a cumulative points and are in good position to return to the finals after yesterdays victory over the san antonio spurs miami has won six of their past seven games stands seven games back of the woeful eastern conferences top spot and has a healthy shaquille oneal and the heat is one of just four east teams with a winning record against the west superstar dwyane wade has been the heats focal point all season but south florida sun sentinel columnist ethan j skolnick says wades teammates have been the difference lately allowing their leading scorer time to emerge from a first half slump "with so many heat players taking star turns heres what coach ron rothstein found when he turned to wade a star who had paced himself taking just two shots until a desperation one at the end of the first half lying back in the weeds on defense letting others do their part " mr skolnick writes "a star rested and ready to do what he does win " what a difference a conference makes the los angeles clippers have the exact same record as the heats and are also in current position for the eighth and last playoff berth yet a matchup with the dallas mavericks is far more daunting than anything the east can offer los angeles times columnist j a adande thinks the clippers would be better off if they were much worse and therefore in better position to nab greg oden or kevin durant two college freshmen expected to enter the draft a similar strategy outlined in a fix item last week about the boston celtics now losers of in a row this is a recurring theme for the clippers "as bad as theyve been historically theyve never been consistently horrendous at the right times to get the right players " mr adande writes the afc and nfc squared off in hawaii yesterday for the pro bowl and yawn nate kaeding yawn zzzzzzzz huh where was the fix oh italy has shut out fans from most of its top level soccer games in reaction to crowd violence earlier this month that cost a police officer his life reporters werent banned and si coms grant wahl reported from an inter milan chievo verona match on the sound of silence "inside you could hear all sorts of things that you dont normally pick up at a game the slap of players shaking hands before kickoff the clank of inter goalkeeper julio cesar knocking his studs against the goal frame before a chievo free kick the thump of adrianos left boot striking a ball on goal and the unmistakable doink of his shot hitting the right post before ricocheting into the net it was like being granted a private audience with some of the worlds top soccer players patrick vieira luis figo hernan crespo adriano esteban cambiasso marco materazzi and yet the soul of the game was missing " for the latest proof that college championships are never won on signing day consider floridas five game winning streak against its college hoops rival kentucky "at midnight madness kentucky unveiled a recruiting class ranked no in america randolph morris joe crawford ramel bradley and rajon rondo " pat forde writes " at florida meanwhile nobody was slobbering over billy donovans recruiting class for once the guy who was making quite a career out of stockpiling hamburger all americans went light on hype with taurean green al horford corey brewer and joakim noah as it has famously turned out that class has been long on chemistry basketball iq and winning attitude somewhere along the way kentuckys ballyhooed class slipped behind floridas undervalued class and it cannot catch up " but top ranked florida the defending champs looked shaky in their victory over the wildcats their th straight overall and for in the sec lexington herald leader columnist john clay says the wildcats will foil floridas bid for a perfect conference record in their rematch on march after years on earth of them spent writing about sports jerry izenberg is taking a break sort of the newark star ledger columnist is now a columnist emeritus meaning hell still write a few dozen pieces a year in a letter to readers mr izenberg lists what hell miss most "the geometrical beauty of the overhead blue white quartz lights at yankee stadium and shea on a soft summer night that always makes me feel as though i have just entered abner doubledays own temple the electricity that always filled the joint when ali came down the aisle to defend his title the wall of noise so real you could almost see it each time the horses turned for home and came pounding down the stretch in the derby the way youd swear an arena can almost freeze itself in time as the clock races toward all zeroes and the ball forms a rainbow arc on the final make or break pointer and of course the guys covered in fourth quarter december mud or battling through a steady barrage of wind and snow and still going belly to belly in the yard trenches that was my milieu and i am sure the farther away i move from it the more i will miss it but not as much as i will miss you " tip of the fix cap to reader john falck found a good column
