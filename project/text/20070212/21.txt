energy a special report a new playing field as oil futures trading moves out of the pits the impact may be felt far from the exchange floor oil futures trading changed dramatically last year as the bulk of it moved from the raucous new york pits of the new york mercantile exchange to the convenience and anonymity of computer screens the shift to electronic trading has many predicting an imminent end to the famous trading floor of nymex where traders in colored jackets shout buy and sell orders and prices have been set for years but the effect will be greater than just the potential loss of a trading icon and the jobs of those who work there many traders are expecting higher volumes and more volatility with faster bigger intraday price fluctuations as electronic trading speeds up the flow of institutional money from mutual funds pension funds and hedge funds that has been piling into the energy futures market since nymex the worlds biggest energy exchange extended hours of electronic trading last september to include the floor trading session electronic crude trading volume jumped from less than a sixth of floor trading volume to more than double it in december and january the new playing field is expected to attract more money as investors look to increase returns in the volatile market and while the risks to investment grow with volatility so do the chances for quicker profits "its evolving into a new ball game " says john kilduff senior vice president of energy at brokerage firm fimat usa in new york "and folks that have traditionally shied away from crude are coming in there are larger volumes and the spikes are now quicker " mr kilduff adds that "you could say theres more risk but theres also more chance for making money " the eagerness of traders to take up electronic trading which is quicker than dealing through a floor broker and reveals more bids and offers has stunned many inside and outside the nymex trading floor "in the fourth quarter of nymex reached electronic trading volume levels we thought they would get to in the fourth quarter of " says richard herr an analyst who covers exchanges for keefe bruyette &amp woods a new york based investment firm the chicago mercantile exchanges "movement from floor to electronic trading was measured in years at nymex were measuring this migration in months " the catalyst for nymexs move was the success of the electronic energy bourse intercontinentalexchange or ice in the ice bought the international petroleum exchange the home of europes brent north sea crude oil futures and in closed the london trading pits then in february atlanta based ice launched a cash settled copy of nymexs benchmark u s light sweet crude oil futures that move gave funds and other traders direct electronic trading access to a market previously restricted to nymex members during the all important floor session ices then superior electronic trading system and its more open access to trading quickly led the exchange to capture more than half the worlds crude oil futures trading taking market share away from nymex in response nymex in april started using the chicago mercantile exchanges globex electronic trading system considered to be better than the one nymex had been using since electronic trading began in and in september it allowed nonmembers to start trading crude oil around the clock electronically nymex has seats or rights to trade on the exchanges floor a member is someone who buys one of those seats some members own more than one floor trading is still closed to nonmembers unless they lease a seat the impact of traders moves into the oil futures market has been evident amid consecutive then record volumes on both jan and jan crude oils net daily price move was less than but the difference between the highs and lows was more than as heavy trading helped prices make big intraday swings and the moves didnt appear to be based on any new supply or demand changes while nymexs overall crude oil trading volumes have surged since august floor trading has shown a marked decline fewer orders are going through floor brokers and independent seat holders are heading to the computer screen with people often trading with hand held computers right from the pit average total crude oil daily trading volume for january was double last years average daily volume before floor trading was opened up but floor trading volume which used to make up more than of total daily trading volume now comprises only investing in energy is expected to rise even further this year as pension funds retail investors and other funds increase oil holdings for instance california public employees retirement system announced in november plans to launch a &# million pilot program to invest in commodities with a view to creating a permanent place for the asset class in its &# billion fund so with the rise of electronic energy trading is an end to the nymex trading floor in sight stock analysts are divided some say the floor is likely to be seen as too costly when competing with ice and could be shut down by the exchanges members the vote of nymexs members who own more than of nymex shares is needed to close the floor before in the decision to open up electronic trading members agreed to retain the right to keep floor trading going for at least another five years others point out that while most of the near month crude futures trading has gone electronic traders are still using the floor for options and contracts that settle further out "the american approach has been to keep a vestige of floor trading not only because it gives you some form of backup but theres also certain trades that still trade better on the floor than electronically " says kb&amp ws mr herr "i think nymex will have a floor for at least the next five years these floors pay for themselves " mr chambers is a staff reporter for dow jones newswires in jersey city n j he can be reached at
