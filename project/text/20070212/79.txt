saudi oil minister suggests more stable oil market is ahead naimi confirms reduction of million barrels a day in kingdoms production riyadh saudi arabia the world oil market is in "much much better health and balance" now and if trends hold there will be no need for further production cuts or increases in supply when members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries meet next month saudi arabian oil minister ali naimi said yesterday in an interview mr naimi said the kingdoms production is now million to million barrels a day confirming its reduction by one million barrels a day from its output about six months ago the reduction is part of a push by opec to shrink stockpiles of oil that climbed sharply last year as demand growth stumbled the u s benchmark crude price fell through the turn of the year to a month low in mid january of &# a barrel it has since rebounded to settle friday at &# a barrel mostly mild winter weather heavy selling by financial funds and falling oil use among developed nations have contributed to prices dropping from the record &# a barrel settlement price last summer opec whose members supply about of the worlds oil is to meet march in vienna to assess its production policy "if you are asking me are we going to take additional cuts or increase supply i do not know " said mr naimi the oil cartels de facto leader "but most probably if the trend is like what it is like today with the market getting in much much better health and balance there may not be any reason to change " he added that the situation can still change "i would not be surprised to see different figures and a different situation on the th of march that is the benefit of getting together with other oil ministers to review the data " saudi arabias one million barrel a day reduction reported in the wall street journal last month is nearly double what it agreed to under two opec output cuts hammered out by the cartel at meetings in doha qatar in october and in abuja nigeria in december asked about his plans and rumors he may want to retire mr naimi hinted that he would like to stay on in his role when king abdullah undertakes his first major cabinet shuffle soon the king is said to be planning the shuffle to inject new blood into his member cabinet "ministers normally do not retire " the year old mr naimi said "ministers are appointed by the king and relieved by the king unless there is serious medical reason and as you can see i am fairly fit and in good shape "there are still many challenges ahead of us " he added he serves at the disposal of the king and "anything else has no basis " mr naimi said that beginning in may the kingdom "went almost all out" to produce million barrels a day to satisfy rising demand "we kept that level until august september last year " he said when the kingdom saw demand slacken in the summer of it voluntarily cut production by to barrels a day and then by another to barrels a day in concert with opec "so you can say one million barrels was taken off the market " he said "but gradually " the drop in oil prices from last summers highs and a surge in interest in rival forms of energy havent forced the kingdom the worlds largest crude exporter to rethink its investment plans "from what we see the world will need what saudi arabia produces " mr naimi said therefore the kingdom will proceed with its plan to increase capacity by the end of to million barrels a day from million barrels "there is no question demand will be there in " he said "there is no reason to think otherwise " president bush declared in january a more than fivefold increase in target levels for renewable fuel production to billion gallons annually by "alternatives will be needed over the next years " mr naimi acknowledged the world he added will need every unit of energy "it can generate whether from alternatives conservation or greater efficiency " still he said "it is a global market so what one country does isnt really relevant " among the reasons world leaders cite to diversify their energy sources is mounting concern over the future reliability of the worlds oil and natural gas suppliers those in the middle east russia and venezuela to name but three mr naimi responded that the major threat to oil stability is "all these outside influences strikes tension geopolitical events " but one has to keep it all in perspective "we have had a lot of tension many wars and the flow of oil has not been interrupted there is a determination to keep the flow of oil uninterrupted " he said he conceded that terrorist threats pose a serious challenge "security in the kingdom against terrorism is very very high " he said "but you can never have enough security enough protection because you are dealing with a threat that is very very well organized and erratic it can happen anytime " mr naimi who has served as minister of petroleum and minerals in the worlds most important oil exporting nation for nearly a dozen years met yesterday with russian oil company heads in advance of the visit by russian president vladimir putin who was to arrive later in the day "when the two biggest producers and exporters of oil meet energy will be a subject but not the subject " mr naimi said mr putins visit is the first by a russian leader to the kingdom since its founding even though the soviet union was the first nation to recognize parts of what eventually became the kingdom its leaders were never welcome here during the communist rule because the leadership of saudi arabia a religious nation didnt approve of moscows policies or principles as a country that was antireligion the distaste for the soviet union was particularly high after the soviets invaded afghanistan in l prompting many deeply religious young saudis to join the afghan resistance and creating some of the radical saudi jihadists that threaten the kingdom today
