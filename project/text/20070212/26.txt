energy a special report the new math of alternative energy does going green finally make economic sense the numbers are starting to look promising for years the big criticism of alternative energy was cost it was too expensive compared with energy based on traditional fuels like coal and natural gas even though the fuel was often free such as wind or the suns rays alternative energy producers had to plow lots of money into finding the best way to capture that energy and convert it into electricity fossil fuel producers on the other hand could draw on billions of dollars in infrastructure investments and decades of know how now the equation is showing significant signs of change costs are falling for some alternative energy sources driven by new technology and renewed development interest alternative energy still cant compete with fossil fuels on price but the margins are narrowing particularly since oil and gas prices have been rising the math looks even more favorable if you consider the environmental cost of fossil fuels which most purely economic calculations dont alternative energy still faces obstacles to mainstream success many projects need government or utility subsidies and incentives to be viable generating costs have risen recently for some types of renewable resources pushed by higher materials prices labor costs and demand supply chains are prone to hiccups and wind and solar energy resources need backup sources of power to compensate on windless or cloudy days for all its promise relatively little electricity currently comes from renewable sources other than hydropower according to the energy information administration renewable resources produced of the u s electricity supply in bio mass was responsible for wind for geothermal for and solar power for a scant in contrast coal fired generation produced of u s electricity supplies in followed by nuclear power at natural gas at hydropower at and oil fired generation at but alternative energy stands to gain a larger share in years to come driven by concerns about global warming and energy security as well as the rising cost of electricity generated by fossil fuels regulators are forcing electric utilities to broaden their resource mix to include more "green" power at the same time the federal government is requiring oil companies to blend more plant based biofuels like ethanol with gasoline equipment makers are expanding their production lines which should ease recent shortages of some materials like the polysilicon used in solar panels and take pressure off prices heres a look at the economics of the various alternative energy sources how much they cost now and what developments could make them more competitive wind wind power stands out as one of the splashiest success stories in renewable energy over the past years as wind farms sprouted around the world the cost of generating electricity from wind has fallen dramatically in wind power electricity cost cents per kilowatt hour by it cost cents according to the international energy agency today production costs at the best on shore sites have dropped as low as cents to cents per kilowatt hour but are more typically cents to cents not counting subsidies getting closer to the cost of generating electricity from burning coal in fact costs are approaching the point where wind power may be able to prosper without subsidies currently cents a kilowatt hour in the u s particularly if natural gas prices stay high the department of energys energy information administration has concluded that there isnt much difference between the cost of new power plants using wind and other traditional fuels such as nuclear coal and natural gas if you take into account a broad array of expenses a plant entering service in the administration said in a report could make electricity from wind for cents a kilowatt hour versus cents for natural gas cents for coal and cents for nuclear the report didnt quantify the differing environmental impacts a host of factors have brought down the cost of wind power the materials used in wind turbines have improved and the turbines are now much larger and more efficient meters in rotor diameter compared with meters in the s the cost of financing wind farms also has dropped as financial markets become more comfortable with the risks involved governments have also given wind power a boost in germany the largest wind power producer the government has been giving grants to builders of wind farms since the late s and requires utilities to buy electricity generated from renewable sources at premium rates the extra cost is passed on to consumers in the u s the extension of the federal production tax credit which gives tax credits to alternative energy companies has spurred record development over the past two years as have state renewable procurement targets the nations wind power generating capacity increased by in to megawatts according to the american wind energy association only gas fired generators added more megawatts of capacity in the u s the association expects wind power capacity to increase by an additional this year by the end of there were about megawatts of total installed capacity of wind power world wide enough for the needs of roughly million homes two thirds of that capacity is in europe germany spain the u s india and denmark are the top five producers of wind power wind power faces hurdles factors like location wind speeds and capital costs have a big impact on the cost of generating wind power the price of cents to cents per kilowatt hour only holds at sites with the best wind conditions in some places with less wind costs can still be as high as cents per kilowatt hour meanwhile a shortage of turbines the past couple of years has pushed up construction costs in the u s as has a weak dollar the turbine shortage at least could be easing soon abb ltd a big equipment vendor based in zurich says it has boosted production of transformers used by the wind industry at its plants in virginia and missouri and in january american superconductor of westborough mass completed its purchase of windtec a wind turbine designer that recently inked deals with south korean and chinese manufacturers to build the machinery "as more companies manufacture wind turbines we think prices will come down " says jason fredette spokesman for american superconductor a maker of advanced electrical devices solar for decades solar power has endured cycles of booms and busts as investors made big bets only to watch the technology fail to achieve its promise solar power still accounts for less than of the worlds power generation with megawatts of capacity on line enough for the daytime needs of million to million homes solar power doesnt generate electricity at night meaning backup energy sources are needed one reason theres relatively little solar electricity is that traditional solar panels arent very efficient at converting sunlight to electricity so most solar electricity is made and consumed at a single site and in many cases isnt even enough to meet the needs of a single house a recent study by the new jersey board of public utilities found that it cost about &# to install a kilowatt capacity system on a house without subsidies it would take years to pay for itself with subsidies it dropped to years in all the cost of generating electricity with solar panels is cents to cents per kilowatt hour according to the international energy agency in the u s costs are typically less cents to cents because theres better sun says the u s solar energy industry association now however a new generation of solar plants is on the cusp of being able to produce electricity on an industrial scale at competitive rates the new plants use a technology called concentrating solar power or csp which is much more powerful than the classic photovoltaic panels which use semiconductor chips to convert sunlight into electricity csp plants use huge arrays of mirrors or solar dishes to track the sun and collect its heat to make electricity the plants can generate hundreds of megawatts of power closer to what fossil fueled plants make the major hurdle remains bringing generating costs in line with those of conventional power plants it costs cents to cents to generate one kilowatt hour of electricity by csp not counting any subsidies compared with about cents to cents to generate the same amount of electricity by burning coal tom mancini csp program manager at the energy departments sandia national laboratories says three factors make csp plants more expensive than a traditional coal plant even though the raw material the suns rays is free because the technology is so new the equipment is pricey in itself and costs more to operate and maintain and financing such projects is costly because of the perceived risk csp is a young technology only of solar energy is generated by csp technology with the lions share still coming from traditional solar panels that typically are heavily subsidized by homeowners for now csp still needs government support to be viable either in the form of tax breaks to builders of plants or subsidies to buyers of electricity the industry scored a major coup in with the creation of a u s tax credit that equals of a solar projects cost a growing system of state sponsored renewable energy credits also gives developers a valuable revenue stream the credits are bought and sold by businesses and utilities trying to meet greenhouse gas reduction goals but the new technology has inspired a burst of development major power companies in europe such as abengoa sa of spain and enel spa of italy are spending billions on new plants that will be coming on line in the next few years in california utility companies edison international and sempra energy have inked contracts to buy large sums of solar power from proposed projects in nevada solargenix energy llc plans to bring a megawatt solar plant into service this year energy experts argue that as more csp plants go into operation the technology will improve and costs will come down but with current costs high few companies are willing to take the risk of building without significant government incentives "its a chicken and egg situation " says mr mancini biomass although it doesnt get much public attention biomass is the biggest source of renewable electricity in the u s today producing more electricity than wind solar and geothermal sources combined biomass refers to the conversion of plant matter into a transportation fuel biofuel or electricity biopower usually by incinerating waste material or creating combustible gas through chemical processes a significant amount of electricity also is made by gathering and burning landfill gas its a growing area of interest because methane created by decaying organic material is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide so people are anxious to put it to use and keep it out of the atmosphere many cities also burn solid waste to cut down the volume destined for landfill sites and theyre eager to convert the garbage to something useful the biggest biomass power generators in the u s arent utilities theyre forest products companies with big sawmill and pulp operations like international paper co weyerhaeuser co and koch industries georgia pacific corp weyerhaeuser for example makes electricity by reusing waste heat and by burning hog fuel or wood waste and black liquor a pulp mill byproduct it sells the power it produces equivalent to the annual energy needs of homes to local utilities because biomass plants typically are small usually less than megwatts in capacity or one tenth the size of a conventional fossil fuel power plant equipment costs are high relative to the amount of power produced that in turn makes generating costs somewhat high currently about cents to cents a kilowatt hour without subsidies power costs are also related to the cost of fuel and the amount of heat embedded in it as many homeowners know theres more energy locked in an oak log than a pine log the same holds true for biomass power generation some fuels make more heat and thus electricity better numbers can also be achieved by mixing plant matter with fossil fuels like coal and burning them together at large plants to capture the greater efficiencies costs are expected to come down as technology improves and as more waste material gets redirected to electricity production providing a cheap fuel stream many experts believe biomass will expand dramatically in coming years as more industries look for ways to make electricity out of their waste diverting more material away from landfill sites a recent study by the california biomass collaborative a government and industry group concluded there are million tons of plant material produced in california each year that could be diverted to biomass use about million tons are practically available the study said those million tons could be converted into megawatts of electricity equivalent to five large gas fired plants and billion gallons of transportation fuel at competitive prices biomass has gotten a jolt from renewable portfolio standards embraced by nearly half the states which require utilities to get electricity from renewable resources in california for instance the states energy agencies have set a rough goal of having biomass sources generate of the states power by geothermal geothermal energy tapping heat deep in the earth to generate power may have more potential at less impact to society than any of the other alternative resources a new study on geothermal energy produced by an interdisciplinary team at the massachusetts institute of technology found that geothermal energy could produce of the nations electricity by at prices that would be competitive with fossil fuels geothermal heat is turned into electricity through a number of methods in general producers drill into the ground to release steam and water that have been naturally heated and until then trapped these are used to power a turbine and generator making electricity liquids are reinjected into the ground to keep the process running currently geothermal energy costs about cents to cents a kilowatt hour without subsidies the main expense is actually drilling the holes and building power plants on top of them and expertise is needed to properly manage a site to make sure the right amount of liquid is cycled through the geothermal source to extract the heat the amount of electricity produced depends on many things including the size of the geothermal field water pressure and temperature and how quickly the field can heat and release water geothermal energy is especially valuable because it makes electricity around the clock unlike solar or wind power that require backup sources of generation also unlike wind and solar installations geothermal plants have a small footprint smaller even than many fossil fuel power plants advancements in equipment are making it possible to generate electricity with lower temperature geothermal resources and new drilling techniques let producers plumb greater depths today theres about megawatts of installed geothermal capacity globally with megawatts in the u s the top producer mostly it has been developed where heat is easily accessed and is accompanied by water and porous rock the biggest developed field in the u s lies miles north of san francisco at the geysers nineteen of the plants at the site are owned by calpine corp which makes megawatts of electricity there equivalent to one and a half large conventional power plants the mit study found that far more geothermal electricity could be generated if companies especially oil companies leveraged their knowledge of drilling techniques geology and hydrology to tackle the problem an investment of &# million to &# billion in research and development would be required equivalent to the expense of a single coal fired plant the initial units would make electricity for cents or so a kilowatt hour but later plants would see costs fall to cents a kilowatt hour probably within a decade as processes became more refined that would make geothermal operations competitive with modern gas fired plants but backers say that for geothermal energy to thrive supportive policies are needed including loan guarantees depletion allowances tax credits and accelerated depreciation things oil gas and minerals extraction companies get still geothermal energy does come with a caveat heat sources can be depleted if not carefully managed at the geysers for instance operators have had to retire at least half a dozen generating units even though the field was developed largely only in the s and s biofuels interest in alternative transportation fuels mostly ethanol soared following president bushs declaration a year ago that the u s is "addicted to oil " many potential fuels are being discussed from biodiesel to hydrogen most of the buzz is around whats already by far the biggest alternative transportation fuel in the u s ethanol made from corn theres lots of talk about the possibility of using ethanol as a standalone fuel to power cars but virtually all the ethanol consumed in the u s today is used in a less sexy way its blended into normal gasoline thats done mostly in parts of the country with bad air pollution problems because adding ethanol to gasoline reduces smog causing emissions from the cars that burn the fuel ethanol also is used as a gasoline "extender " the cost of producing ethanol depends largely on the cost of corn ethanols main feedstock it also depends on the cost of the energy typically natural gas used to power the process that turns the corn into ethanol keith collins chief economist at the u s department of agriculture estimates that today it costs about &# to produce a gallon of ethanol ethanol producers sell their brew on a wholesale market sometimes to gasoline refiners and sometimes to middlemen who sell to those refiners the price of ethanol typically rises and falls with that of gasoline which itself is a function of the global oil price ethanol typically has sold for up to cents per gallon more than gasoline because the federal government gives ethanol blenders a cent per gallon tax break to encourage production of the supplemental fuel over the past year the industry that produces ethanol has had a wild ride last summer ethanol prices soared due to increases in both gasoline prices and ethanol demand gasoline blenders who had been using another emission reducing additive methyl tertiary butyl ether or mtbe were switching over to ethanol because of concerns that mtbe was contaminating ground water ethanols per gallon price premium over gasoline widened to more than &# margins for ethanol producers ballooned yet by late last year the ethanol boom was cooling the sudden profitability of the ethanol business combined with increasing federal requirements for the production of alternative fuels sparked a rush of investment in new ethanol plants meanwhile gasoline prices and thus ethanol prices were falling from their mid highs the production costs for ethanol were also rising largely because the rush to produce more ethanol had driven up the price of the fuels main feedstock corn on friday the price of ethanol for march delivery closed at &# a gallon on the chicago board of trade and the price of gasoline for march delivery closed at &# a gallon on the new york mercantile exchange where ethanol prices will go from here is a matter of debate president bush in his state of the union speech last month laid out an ambitious target for the u s to consume about billion gallons of ethanol and other alternative transportation fuels by the u s currently consumes about billion gallons of ethanol per year reaching the numbers outlined by president bush wont be easy it probably would require significantly increasing the concentration of ethanol thats blended into gasoline that paradoxically is a move that scientists say raises potential air pollution problems of its own studies show that while ethanol added to gasoline in low concentrations helps reduce certain emissions such as carbon monoxide it tends to increase some other emissions another option to meet the government mandate would be to increase the use of ethanol as a standalone fuel that would require the installation of ethanol pumps at gas stations a move that could cost the oil industry billions of dollars staff reporters leila abboud in paris and jeffrey ball in dallas contributed to this article ms smith is a staff reporter in
