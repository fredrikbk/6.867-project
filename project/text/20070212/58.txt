nasdaq chief weigh choices after lse snub owning a large stake adds complications sit and wait or sell with the nasdaq stock market inc effort to buy the storied london stock exchange failing this weekend the year old u s exchange and its chief executive bob greifeld are left with daunting questions about its future and strategy nasdaq had built a stake in the lse and bid to buy the rest of it for gbp &# a share or about &# billion on saturday only about of the lses other shareholders voted in favor of nasdaqs offer a stark slap at the new york based companys second bid in less than a year the rebuke was a setback for the exchange and especially for mr greifeld as rivals merge around him his exchange is left sitting on a pile of debt built up during the battle for the trans atlantic deal while many of nasdaqs competitors have negotiated politically difficult deals mr greifeld blazed an especially aggressive path gambling he could force a proud institution whose roots stretch back to london coffee houses years ago to capitulate in a hostile takeover battle lse shareholders would have none of it but they now face questions of their own stripped of nasdaqs bid the lse could see its share price fall this week according to many analysts confronted with his first major setback at nasdaq mr greifeld says he will continue to pursue other opportunities "we have a highly disciplined approach to acquisitions and will only consummate transactions to the extent that they deliver clear and visible benefits for nasdaq shareholders " he said in a statement he said he was "disappointed" by the lse vote but added nasdaq showed discipline by sticking to its lse valuation some big nasdaq shareholders yesterday came out in support of mr greifelds strategy mr greifeld was stymied in part by nasdaqs size with roughly the same market value as lse nasdaq took on roughly &# billion in new debt to fund the effort its credit rating fell from investment grade to speculative or "junk" status hampering its ability to pay more for the lse or do other deals in the quickly changing exchange landscape "to a certain extent nasdaq has shot itself in the foot" says octavio marenzi ceo of financial research and consulting firm celent llc which sells research to nasdaq but doesnt do consulting business for either exchange nasdaq says it paid down &# million in debt in november will pay down more in march and is committed to paying off its debt rapidly nasdaqs predicament is a reminder of the bumpy path global exchanges are traveling as they consolidate with fiercely independent firms fighting to stay in control of their own destinies the pressure on these firms grows as others merge to expand their reach and move into more profitable innovative products like derivatives nyse group inc is close to completing a merger with european exchange operator euronext nv that will create the first trans atlantic stock exchange chicagos two big futures exchanges have agreed to join forces in hopes of dominating trading in futures and options under u k takeover rules unless somebody else bids for the lse the operator of europes largest stock market measured by the value of companies listed mr greifeld will have to wait a year to make another approach or he will have to look elsewhere for a partner a veteran of the financial services industry mr greifeld is known as a demanding negotiator with a record of smaller acquisitions that helped put nasdaq back on track after the tech bubble burst in long before he worked on wall street the queens n y native put himself through business school at night one of his major papers was on the future of nasdaq some nasdaq investors and analysts say mr greifeld misjudged the resolve of lse shareholders to push for a higher bid critics argue he should have sweetened his offer more and toned down his public criticisms of the lse which alienated the exchanges executives and some investors in public comments nasdaq characterized the lse as being blind to competitive threats and misleading in the way it valued itself mr greifelds supporters including some powerful board members say he was right to avoid bidding too aggressively for the london exchange "we support nasdaqs price discipline and knowing when to say when " said patrick healy a nasdaq director and managing director at private equity firm hellman &amp friedman which is a big shareholder of nasdaq nasdaqs shares have fallen about since its first lse bid in march while other exchange stocks have soared or more nasdaq reports full year earnings tomorrow giving mr greifeld a chance to address analysts "our tactics reflected the lses refusal to engage at any stage " a nasdaq spokeswoman said she added that the lse stake has "proved to be a good investment" and that nasdaq still has options mr greifelds original bid in march appeared to give nasdaq a head start over the nyse and other rivals his opening bid was gbp a share when the lse rejected the offer mr greifeld who took over nasdaq in didnt give up he convinced big lse shareholders to sell their shares to nasdaq and in november bid gbp for the rest of the company valuing lse at about &# billion lse management refused to meet with nasdaq officials criticizing the bid as too low hedge funds bought up lse shares and urged nasdaq to make a higher bid but mr greifeld refused to sweeten the offer instead nasdaq campaigned to highlight the lses weaknesses and said the lse had overly optimistic growth projections nasdaq also criticized the lse for being complacent about new european commission rules to take effect by november that would increase competition for europes exchanges in the process some lse shareholders said nasdaq sent mixed signals for instance nasdaq said if the bid failed it could work with lses competitors but that would undermine the value of its own minority stake in the lse investors say mr greifeld was too convinced nasdaq could scare hedge funds into taking the money on the table rather than risk seeing the bid fail and have nasdaq sell its stake now mr greifeld has to decide what do to with nasdaqs large stake in lse he could begin the bidding process again in a year though the emergence of a rival bidder or an unexpected change of heart by lse management could allow nasdaq to come back sooner mr greifeld could sell the stake to another exchange or to a group of private equity investors that would probably be welcomed by nasdaq investors says analyst richard herr at brokerage firm keefe bruyette &amp woods if the lse stumbles nasdaq could win with a lower bid and if the share price rises nasdaq will have a gain on its investment "we would have rather had lse engage with us but nasdaq is in a fine position " says glenn hutchins another nasdaq director and an executive at silver lake partners an investment firm that has a stake in nasdaq though he has reservations about mr greifelds tactics celents mr marenzi gives him a "b plus" for strategy because the lse deal would have allowed considerable cost cutting and global diversification but he adds there are "massive" opportunities that could be missed if nasdaq waits a year to bid again on lse though lses shares might now fall themselves mr greifelds lse rival clara furse has been lauded in the u k for the way she handled the bid it was the fifth approach she has batted off in two years "you have to hold up your hand to them they stood by their beliefs " said stephen lansdown chairman of hargreaves lansdown a retail broker based in bristol england that has held lse shares since the exchange started selling them publicly in still the lse faces its own uncertainties like increased competition also though its share price has tripled in two years and business has boomed ms furse has been criticized for missing her chance to act as a buyer herself with nasdaq off its back for now lse is pursuing other investments and alliances including accelerating talks with the tokyo stock exchange about a cooperation agreement corrections &amp amplifications the nasdaq stock market inc turned years old this month a money &amp investing article monday about the electronic exchange operators future following its failure to purchase the london stock exchange said it was years old wsj feb
