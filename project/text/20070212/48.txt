intel prototype chip raises industry bar an processor tester shows how demand for power drives firms intel corp has developed a prototype chip with the equivalent of electronic brains the latest sign of a major design shift sweeping the semiconductor industry the santa clara calif companys new chip is a research project not a product intels engineers managed to pack number crunching capability into a device the size of a fingernail that once required a roomful of computers other companies are exploiting the same concept combining handfuls to hundreds of the microprocessors that serve as calculating engines in computers such creations now carry out specialized business and scientific chores and eventually may spread to consumer devices that wont happen quickly in part because of the difficulty of programming such complex machines moreover not all kinds of computing tasks can easily be broken up to be gang tackled by multiple processors but some jobs like identifying and processing images are ideal for multibrained machines video security systems might quickly scan and pick out a face in a crowd for example or a pc might automatically create video highlights of a single player in a football game said justin rattner intels chief technology officer mr rattner said cameras on future videogame systems could track users motions eliminating the need for the kind of hand held controller offered with nintendo co s wii console realistic three dimensional models of users could be transferred into videogames or programs like a digital dance lesson "then you could put the model for your partner in there " mr rattner says "if you step on their toes its not a big deal " such chips are often called "multicore " because they pack together core circuitry of a multiple microprocessors the design has gained in popularity as an earlier tactic of boosting the operating frequency of each chip began consuming too much electrical power intel and rival advanced micro devices inc already offer dual processor chips for pcs and laptops more complex chips will be a focus of the international solid state circuits conference this week in san francisco for example amd sunnyvale calif is providing new details about a four processor version of its opteron chip line expected by midyear that includes technology for switching portions of the chip off to save power sun microsystems inc also of santa clara is discussing improvements to a chip called ultrasparc t which has eight processors and uses a concept called "threading" to perform as many as tasks at once a version arriving next summer will perform as many as tasks said marc tremblay a sun senior vice president intel which is also describing its chip at the conference created and hooked together processors that were tailored for "floating point" operations a kind of calculation used by scientists in tests mr rattner said the chip exceeded a "teraflop" a trillion floating point operations per second and it draws just watts of power by comparison an intel teraflop supercomputer in took up square feet and drew watts he said some companies differ about how the technology will evolve intels mr rattner in three to five years hopes to offer products that use simplified versions of the general purpose x processors used in its pc chips but amd and some other companies are proposing "heterogeneous" chips which combine general purpose microprocessors with specialized circuitry for tasks like image processing "that is definitely a split in the industry " said stephen kleynhans an analyst at gartner inc azul systems inc for example sells systems with a processor chip that is specially designed to run software based on suns java technology stephen dewitt chief executive of the silicon valley start up is skeptical that general purpose circuitry will ever match its performance for such tasks "for special workloads you need a special piece of silicon " said marty seyer an amd senior vice president mr rattner thinks special purpose circuitries will only play a small role because they will be even harder to program than those with many general purpose processors his company and others are working on programming tools as well as circuitry to help the electronic brains communicate with others and retrieve data from memory chips
