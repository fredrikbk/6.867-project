politics &amp economics frances royal introduces platform ahead of election paris french presidential hopeful segolene royal sought to recover from her recent decline in election polls by unveiling a long awaited platform focused on social programs including higher minimum wage pensions and unemployment payouts but a lack of specifics on key economic policies such as how to finance new social spending and concrete proposals on how to tackle the countrys high unemployment rate are likely to leave frances business community cold "she avoided talking in depth about sticky issues " says marc touati chairman of acde an association promoting the study of frances economy over the past months ms royals simple proposition of listening to the people has transformed her from a minor politician in frances socialist party to one of the two front runners in the race to succeed current president jacques chirac over the past few weeks however her popularity has waned vis a vis her main rival conservative candidate nicolas sarkozy in part because of a series of foreign policy gaffes but also because she waited until weeks before the election to unveil her official platform mr sarkozy unveiled his in mid january ms royal has justified her schedule by saying she needed enough time to gather the ideas of french people around the country by holding town hall meetings and sifting through suggestions of million visitors to her web site in her two hour speech before supporters in an auditorium near paris yesterday ms royal stuck to her trademark crowd pleasing tactics including distancing herself from the official socialist party platform and promising to give people a greater role in government for example in presenting her point "presidential pact " she stuck to her idea of introducing so called citizen juries or ordinary people chosen randomly to oversee elected officials a proposal that has rankled many in her own party "you have suggested many things that are simple and true " she said referring to the town hall meetings that she says formed the basis of her platform during the speech she pledged that if elected workers who lose their jobs would receive of their salaries during their first year without a job and promised to increase pensions by she also promised to build units of state subsidized housing and offer young people a euro &# loan to finance business projects and get started in life "the speech is likely to stop her decline in the polls and is in line with her approach so far " says zaki laidi a professor at the institute detudes politiques in paris what remains unclear however is how she plans to finance the measures "the most astounding thing is that she didnt say anything about tax policy " adds mr laidi business leaders have been concerned with ms royals economic rhetoric so far including promises to give more power to unions a pledge she confirmed yesterday adding that unions should receive state aid to "promote a mass unionization " yesterday ms royal said she wanted to "reconcile people and their companies " promising to give tax breaks to companies that invest in research and development and raising the overall state budget in research initiatives but in her speech she also pledged that if elected she would raise the minimum wage to euros per month from euros per month something unlikely to please the business community which was instead hoping to have more details on ms royals view regarding frances hour workweek and overall job creation measures ms royal also said she wanted to placate public "wrath" over frances unemployment rate among young people but she gave few details on how to overhaul the job market to make it easier for employers to hire young people early in the speech ms royal said she wanted to tackle frances public debt which has soared to of gross domestic product compared with about years ago because of high public spending and a chronic budget deficit "its a good thing that she started her speech with the issue of debt it shows shes aware of the problem " says mr touati adding "but its a pity she didnt say more "
