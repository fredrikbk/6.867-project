entrepreneurial culture the nations of continental western europe in the reforms they make to try to raise their economic performance may prove to be a testing ground for the view that culture matters for a societys economic results as is increasingly admitted the economic performance in nearly every continental country is generally poor compared to the u s and a few other countries that share the u s s characteristics productivity in the continental big three germany france and italy stopped gaining ground on the u s in the early s then lost ground as a result of recent slowdowns and the u s speed up unemployment rates are generally far higher than those in the u s u k canada and ireland and labor force participation rates have been lower for decades relatedly the employee engagement and job satisfaction reported in surveys are mostly lower too it is reasonable to infer that the economic systems on the continent are not well structured for high performance in my view the continental economies began to be underperformers in the interwar period and have remained so with corrective steps here and further missteps there from the postwar decades onward there was no sense of a structural deficiency during the "glorious years" from the mid s through the s when the low hanging fruit of unexploited technologies overseas and europeans drive to regain the wealth they had lost in the war powered rapid growth and high employment today there is the sense that a problem exists what could be the origins of such underperformance it may be that the relatively poor job satisfaction and employee engagement on the continent are a proximate cause though not the underlying cause of the poorer participation and unemployment rates and high unemployment could lead to a mismatch of worker to job causing job dissatisfaction and employee disengagement the task is to find the underlying cause or causes of the entire syndrome of poorer employment productivity employee engagement and job satisfaction many economists attribute the continents higher unemployment and lower participation if not also its lower productivity to the continents social model in particular the plethora of social insurance entitlements and the taxes to pay for them the standard argument is fallacious though the consequent reduction of after tax wage rates is unlikely to be an enduring disincentive to work for reduced earnings will bring reduced saving and once private wealth has fallen to its former ratio to after tax wages people will be as motivated to work as before an indictment of entitlements has to focus on the huge "social wealth" that the welfare state creates at the stroke of the pen yet statistical tests of the effects of welfare spending on employment yield erratic results in any case it is hard to see that scaling down entitlements would be transformative for economic performance indeed some economists see increased wealth social plus private as raising the populations willingness to weather market shocks and helping entrepreneurs to finance innovation i am skeptical in my thesis the continental economies root problem is a dearth of economic dynamism loosely the rate of commercially successful innovation a countrys dynamism being slow to change is not measured by the growth rate over any short or medium length span the level of dynamism is a matter of how fertile the country is in coming up with innovative ideas having prospects of profitability how adept it is at identifying and nourishing the ideas with the best prospects and how prepared it is in evaluating and trying out the new products and methods that are launched onto the market there is evidence of such a dearth germany italy and france appear to possess less dynamism than do the u s and the others far fewer firms break into the top ranks in the former and fewer employees are reported to have jobs with extensive freedom in decision making which is essential at companies engaged in novel and thus creative activity further i argue that the cause of that dearth of dynamism lies in the sort of "economic model" found in most if not all of the continental countries a countrys economic model determines its economic dynamism the dynamism that the economic model possesses is in turn a crucial determinant of the countrys economic performance where there is more entrepreneurial activity and thus more innovation as well as all the financial and managerial activity it leads to there are more jobs to fill and those added jobs are relatively engaging and fulfilling participation rises accordingly and productivity climbs to a higher path thus i see the sort of economic model operating in the continental countries to be a major cause perhaps the largest cause of their lackluster performance characteristics there are two dimensions to a countrys economic model one part consists of its economic institutions these institutions on the continent do not look to be good for dynamism they typically exhibit a balkanized segmented financial sector favoring insiders myriad impediments and penalties placed before outsider entrepreneurs a consumer sector not venturesome about new products or short of the needed education union voting not just advice in management decisions and state interventionism some studies of mine on what attributes determine which of the advanced economies are the least vibrant or the least responsive to the stimulus of a technological revolution pointed to the strength in the less vibrant economies of inhibiting institutions such as employment protection legislation and red tape and to the weakness of enabling institutions such as a well functioning stock market and ample liberal arts education the other part of the economic model consists of various elements of the countrys economic culture some cultural attributes in a country may have direct effects on performance on top of their indirect effects through the institutions they foster values and attitudes are analogous to institutions some impede others enable they are as much a part of the "economy " and possibly as important for how well it functions as the institutions are clearly any study of the sources of poor performance on the continent that omits that part of the system can yield results only of unknown reliability of course people may at bottom all want the same things yet not all people may have the instinct to demand and seek the things that best serve their ultimate goals there is evidence from university of michigan "values surveys" that working age people in the continents big three differ somewhat from those in the u s and the other comparator countries in the number of them expressing various "values" in the workplace the values that might impact dynamism are of special interest here relatively few in the big three report that they want jobs offering opportunities for achievement in france and in italy versus an average of in canada and the u s chances for initiative in the job in france and in italy as against an average of in canada and the u s and even interesting work in france and italy versus an average of in canada and the u k relatively few are keen on taking responsibility or freedom in germany and in france as against in the u s and in canada and relatively few are happy about taking orders italy of a possible and germany as against in canada and in the u s perhaps many would be willing to take it for granted that the spirit of stimulation problem solving mastery and discovery has impacts on a countrys dynamism and thus on its economic performance in countries where that spirit is weak an entrepreneurial type contemplating a start up might be scared off by the prospect of having employees with little zest for any of those experiences and there might be few entrepreneurial types to begin with as luck would have it a study of advanced countries i conducted last summer found that inter country differences in each of the performance indicators are significantly explained by the intercountry differences in the above cultural values nearly all those values have significant influence on most of the indicators the weakness of these values on the continent is not the only impediment to a revival of dynamism there there is the solidarist aim of protecting the "social partners" communities and regions business owners organized labor and the professions from disruptive market forces there is also the consensualist aim of blocking business initiatives that lack the consent of the "stakeholders" those such as employees customers and rival companies thought to have a stake besides the owners there is an intellectual current elevating community and society over individual engagement and personal growth which springs from antimaterialist and egalitarian strains in western culture there is also the "scientism" that holds that state directed research is the key to higher productivity equally there is the tradition of hierarchical organization in continental countries lastly there a strain of anti commercialism "a german would rather say he had inherited his fortune than say he made it himself " the economist hans werner sinn once remarked to me in my earlier work i had organized my thinking around some intellectual currents solidarism consensualism anti commercialism and conformism that emerged as a reaction on the continent to the enlightenment and to capitalism in the th century it would be understandable if such a climate had a dispiriting effect on potential entrepreneurs but to be candid i had not imagined that continental man might be less entrepreneurial it did not occur to me that he had less need for mental challenge problem solving initiative and responsibility it may be that the continentals finding over the th and early th century that there was little opportunity or reward to exercise freedom and responsibility learned not to care much about those values similarly it may be that americans having assimilated large doses of freedom and initiative for generations take those things for granted that appears to be what tocqueville thought "the greater involvement of americans in governing themselves their relatively broad education and their wider equality of opportunity all encourage the emergence of the man of action with the skill to grasp the chance of the moment " the most basic point to carry away is that the empirical results related here lend support to the enlightenment theme that a nations culture ultimately makes a difference for the nations economic performance in all its aspects productivity prosperity and personal growth it was a mistake of the continental europeans to think that they expressed the right values right for them these values led them to evolve economic models bringing in train a level of economic performance with which most working age people are now discontented perhaps the way out to go from unsatisfactory performance to high performance will require not only reform of institutions but also a cultural shift that returns europe to the philosophical roots that put it on the map to begin with mr phelps a professor at columbia university is the nobel laureate in economics
