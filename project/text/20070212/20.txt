energy a special report regulations alternative approaches governments struggle to find policies that will spur renewable energy industries without coddling them since the oil shocks of the s governments around the world have paid plenty of lip service to renewable energies such as wind and solar power but only a few governments have been able to engineer policies that have begun to bring alternative energies into wider use renewable fuels provided of the worlds total electricity supply in according to figures from the international energy agency a paris based intergovernmental organization almost all of that though came from hydropower a source with limited growth potential because of geographic constraints the use of wind and solar power is growing but they still generated only of global electricity production in the latest year for which figures are available in asia the u s and europe governments have spent billions on research and development of renewable energies over the years but finding effective policies to encourage their use has proved just as challenging as developing new technologies most governments have tried approaches like tax credits subsidies and mandated targets for renewable energy production although approaches differ the overarching goal is the same to spur companies to build large scale renewable energy plants such as wind farms or solar installations so that the costs of clean power come down enough to compete with fossil fuels like oil and coal a debate still rages over what kind of government intervention and level of subsidy is appropriate "regulators have to try to strike a delicate balance " says todd allmendinger of emerging energy research a research and consulting firm with offices in cambridge mass and barcelona spain "they have to provide enough incentive for renewables to grow but not so much that they coddle the industry and prevent it from becoming more efficient " countries in europe that have led in renewable adoption including denmark germany and spain have pursued unabashedly interventionist programs that require utility companies to buy electricity generated by clean energies at a premium price set by the government this policy known as "feed in tariffs " pushes the extra cost onto consumers in the form of higher energy prices in contrast about two dozen u s states japan and the united kingdom have preferred a more market oriented approach based on tax credits and "renewable portfolio standards " or rps under this approach the government sets a target for the percentage of electricity that must come from renewable energy and lets utility companies decide how to meet it sometimes financial penalties are imposed if utilities dont meet the targets in the u k utilities that fall short of the targets can fulfill their obligations by buying certificates representing the amount of power they failed to produce from renewable sources those funds are then redistributed to companies that met the targets one notable success with the more interventionist approach has been denmark fifteen years ago the country mounted a push to expand the use of renewable fuels which accounted for of its electricity generation in up from in its a considerable achievement for a country with no hydropower the cheapest and most common way of making clean electricity "denmark has what is probably the most ambitious support scheme for renewable energy technologies ever seen " says jonathan coony who wrote a report on denmarks energy policies for the international energy agency and now works at the world bank the danes established a feed in tariff that set an above market rate for electricity made from wind and solar power and from biofuels like wood and straw the system spurred a wave of investment mainly in wind because it gave companies the certainty to proceed with massive investments and construction the danish government also established capital grants for companies that built wind turbines kicking in to of project costs and spent aggressively on research in wind power and it required utilities to build plants that burn wood pellets and straw to generate electricity with some of those plants also providing heat for nearby homes and offices all this has come at a cost consumers and businesses in denmark pay a "public service obligation" or tax on every kilowatt hour of electricity according to an analysis by the iea the surcharge adds about to the electricity bills of every household and to the cost for businesses however higher electricity costs often are more politically palatable in europe than in the u s "people dont really notice the costs of feed in tariffs in europe because the cost of electricity already is so high " says robert dixon head of the energy technology policy division of the iea in the danish government worried that its subsidies for renewable energies were too generous says steffen nielsen an energy supply expert at the danish energy authority if the government set the price too high for electricity from renewable sources the producers would have little incentive to refine or improve their technologies to be more cost effective "if you had a wind turbine in a good location you were probably getting overcompensated " says mr nielsen a decision was made to shift from a fixed feed in tariff to a formula in which renewable energy producers would be paid a certain percentage above the market rate a change that effectively scaled back support "the policies have become more market oriented over time " says mr nielsen japan has found some success with a slightly different mix of policies it spent heavily on research and development in solar panels and gave grants and subsidies to promote their installation as a result japan has the second largest installed capacity of solar panels in the world after germany which supports solar energy with feed in tariffs for producers and with subsidies for the installation of panels also in japan passed a law that requires of the electricity that utilities supply to the nations grid to be generated from renewable sources those that dont comply can buy credits from utilities that are meeting the targets in the u s the federal government instituted feed in tariffs for wind solar and other renewable energy sources after the oil shocks of the s but implementation was left to the states which in many cases wrote rules that severely watered down the effect of the federal legislation since federal support for renewable energy has come mostly from the production tax credit which provides a tax benefit to companies for every kilowatt hour of electricity a renewable energy plant produces in its first years of operation the policy has led to construction of numerous wind farms but it has a major weakness the tax credits periodically expire if not reauthorized an element of unpredictability that hurts investment congress has let the credit expire several times since and each time construction of wind turbines has dropped as a result in for instance newly installed wind power capacity in the u s dropped to megawatts from mw in according to the american wind power association it then bounced back up to mw in "its simple no production tax credit no wind " says mr allmendinger of emerging energy research at the state level in the u s renewable portfolio standards targets for the percentage of electricity that must come from renewable energies are the favored way to spur investment in renewables "the states have really been the crucible for experimentation" with policies to encourage renewable energy in the u s says the ieas mr dixon texas triggered a burst of investment in wind power with a law passed in that requires a certain percentage of the electricity sold by utilities in the state to be generated from renewable sources those that dont hit the target face financial penalties but one downside of the texas experience is that companies have invested almost exclusively in wind power because its the cheapest alternative stunting the development of other promising energy sources like solar power as governments continue to experiment with policy alternatives the key is that whatever policies they employ must be predictable and reliable not subject to constant buffeting by political winds says brandon owens associate director of global power for cambridge energy research associates a research and consulting firm based in cambridge mass "thats the only way to provide market participants with the certainty required to take financial risks " says mr owens "investors need to be confident the rug isnt going to get pulled out from under them in the future "
